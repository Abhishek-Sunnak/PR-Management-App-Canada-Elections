Pages to request publications from Elections Canada, as well as the websites of Liberal, Conservative and NDP MPs use an outdated, unprotected chain to carry information you send to them through the network.

Liberal Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould, Conservative Finance Critic Pierre Poilievre and the NDP's Ruth Ellen Brosseau had this deficiency on the ""contact me"" form that asks for personal information — like your email, name and address — before sending feedback to your MP. Gould and other Liberal MPs updated their sites after queries from CBC News.

Conservative Party spokesperson Cory Hann said the party's websites all adhere to proper encryption standards, but the sites of individual MPs are not run by the party.

NDP spokesperson Jonathan Gauvin said the party has ""been in the process of updating all sites to ensure they're secure for users"" and they're ""committed to ensuring this is the default for all of our sites.""

There are two different protocols for sending data between your browser and the website you're connected with, the unsecure ""HTTP,"" and ""HTTPS"" — the secure version, with proper encryption — where the ""s"" stands for ""secure.""

Banks and credit card-based sites like Amazon started using HTTPS about 20 years ago, and social media sites have had it in place for more than a decade.

""This is what you can really consider the minimum 'security 101' for your website,"" said Aleksander Essex, a cyber security expert at Western University who specializes in democratic institutions.

He said if major political players — like Elections Canada and MPs — haven't fixed their websites yet, it's time to consider ""what kind of message is that sending.""

Elections Canada said they're aware of the security gaps and are working to fix them.

""We share the view that this is an important security measure. We are working on the final stages of implementing HTTPS on our site,"" they said in an email.

Fears of voter suppression

Basic HTTPS encryption isn't just about protecting information flowing through the internet, Essex said. It's about the user knowing their information will be kept confidential and giving people confidence they're interacting with legitimate organizations.

Without proper security, hackers are able to alter information on a website, including redirecting users to decoy pages. In the case of Elections Canada, Essex said these tactics could be used for voter suppression if information like where to vote is manipulated because the site isn't protected.

Essex said he first reached out to the agency eight months ago to flag the issue.

""I don't see any technical reason that it would take as long as it has,"" he said, adding a single web page can be converted into a HTTPS-safe site in a few minutes.

""Ultimately it comes down to the organization's priorities.""

Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale joins Power & Politics to discuss the government’s new cyber security strategy and what it means for Canadians. 6:30

A spokesperson for the Liberal Party said the ""highest levels of security are implemented for all data, communications, and records.""

When asked if Canadians should be concerned about sharing personal information over Liberal-affiliated websites, Braeden Caley said the party takes data security seriously.

""We are also providing 2019 candidates, campaign teams, and campaign officials with comprehensive resources and guides on best practices for information security online, on social media, and more broadly.""

Not every MP's web page is a security risk. Many MPs are already using HTTPS and all of the parties' primary websites are properly protected.

Similarly, most of Elections Canada's site uses a secure connection when it asks for your information.

'Not sending the right message'

Despite steps to fix the problems, Essex said it should worry Canadians that many MPs and the country's election agency are still operating at 1990s-level internet security.

""They say 'we would like to hear from you please sign up give us your email' and they send it insecurely over the unencrypted connection. It is not sending the right message,"" he said.

It's not a critical vulnerability, but that doesn't mean it should be tolerated.

""Turning this on is like the minimum thing that they could do.""

'We can never rest,' says Scott Jones, head of the Canadian Centre for Cybersecurity. 7:51

Political parties have created perplexing cyber security issues, as they are not beholden to privacy laws in Canada.

It's gotten so bad that Canada's Chief Electoral Officer Stéphane Perrault has called them out for being the weak link in the chain.

Perrault said inexperienced staff could fall prey to simple phishing scams and accidentally give hackers access to databases holding the personal information of thousands of Canadians.

1,Canada,2019-03-24T11:30:00.0000000Z,"""I felt it was my obligation to alert Elections Canada,"" said Lynd, when contacted by CBC News. Lynd confirmed he filed the incident report within three weeks of the election ending — at the end of November 2015, at the latest. He added Elections Canada ...","He allegedly vouched for four people's addresses during the 2015 federal election in Windsor, Ont. — and that's landed him in hot water.

Ali Shadzik was a poll supervisor at Parkwood Gospel Church in the Windsor West riding. In legal terms, the Crown contends he ""attested to the residence of more than one elector.""

Poll supervisors can attest, or vouch for someone's address. Almost any voter can, provided a number of conditions are met, including living in the same polling division, proving their own identity and swearing an oath in writing on a specific form.

What you're not allowed to do? Vouch for more than one person.

When returning officer Thomas Lynd, former clerk for the City of Windsor, was packaging the attestation forms after the election, he realized he'd seen Shadzik's name more than once.

""I felt it was my obligation to alert Elections Canada,"" said Lynd, when contacted by CBC News.

Lynd confirmed he filed the incident report within three weeks of the election ending — at the end of November 2015, at the latest.

He added Elections Canada has directed him to not speak with the media.

Shadzik's first court appearance was Feb, 22, 2019.

Why has it been such a long process?

Lynd reported the incident to Elections Canada headquarters in Gatineau, Que. The operations and field governance branch of Elections Canada then reported the incident to the Electoral Integrity Office of Elections Canada, which in turn forwarded the complaint to the Office of the Commissioner of Canada Elections.

The operations and field governance branch received a request for documentation from the Electoral Integrity Office in August 2016.

In an interview with CBC News, Shadzik said police officers showed up to his home on January 17, 2019 with a summons. He was not aware of any trouble with his election work more than three years prior before he received that summons.

""It's bizarre,"" he said. ""I don't even understand why it all of a sudden came out in January. I'm still trying to figure out the entire thing.""

According to the Commissioner of Canada Elections website, prosecution for offences must be no later than six years after the offence occurred. However, if intent to commit the offence must be proven, there is no limitation.

""Generally, the length of time that it may take to review and investigate a particular complaint can vary greatly,"" said Michelle Laliberte, manager of communications, policy and engagement with the Commissioner's office.

Windsor West MP Brian Masse, who won the 2015 election for the riding, was not aware of the case and would not comment.

Duff Conacher doesn't understand why this case has gone to court. (Marc Robichaud/CBC)

Democracy Watch co-founder Duff Conacher said there's a history of the Commissioner of Canada Elections not moving forward on situations very quickly.

""I don't know exactly why. If it's lack of resources, the government should be giving them resources because obviously timely enforcement of elections law is important. After voting day, the results are in and it's really difficult to have any judge change those results.""

Should he have known better?

Shadzik told CBC News after his first court appearance that he didn't realize he wasn't supposed to vouch for more than one person.

Elections Canada provided CBC with training documents, showing the information would have been provided to the poll supervisor in multiple formats: a guidebook, the oath document itself and a training video.

The restriction also appears on the list of acceptable identifications. Every voter has access to this list.

Brief training period to learn a lot of rules

Conacher said the training a poll supervisor goes through just isn't enough.

""I'm not surprised to hear that a polling clerk saying 'I didn't know,'"" said Conacher. ""The training is very brief, very cursory and there's a ton of rules to know. It points to a flaw in our system.""

According to Conacher, a lot of poll personnel are hired at the last minute and not given the opportunity to fully know the rules.

""It's hard to learn them all in a brief period of time.""

Shadzik said the training took less than three hours and it felt more like a processing centre, with groups of 30 being trained at one time. They covered information like accessibility and the requirements to have signs up at polling stations.

""It went over what IDs are required but they did not mention at all, you're only allowed to do one or 10 or five or what have you,"" he said.

Conacher called the alleged incident ""quasi-criminal,"" but noted that the Elections Act does say punishment for this can include jail time.

""He'll likely be able to document that he was poorly trained and just didn't know,"" said Conacher.

Is vouching for four people really that bad?

Conacher said the system that was put in was designed to stop someone from vouching for 100 people. The Elections Act allows someone to vouch for just one other person.

""It was to stop people from voting more than once or to stop people from voting in a riding they didn't live in,"" said Conacher, adding that there's been no evidence of voter fraud at a high level.

""Some say these provisions were put in to repress voter turnout,"" said Conacher. ""But it's to safeguard the system.""

Conacher said situations like families, groups of friends or young people who want to vote but don't know how to register would be where vouching for more than one person would be okay.

Some of the people Shadzik is accused of vouching for were students he had attended university classes with.

""You have to sign a statement. It's on the record. People would be able to see very easily if there was some pattern at a polling station which could then be investigated.""

The Commissioner of Canada Elections has public compliance agreements on their website, which shows instances where people who violated the Elections Act, such as donating double the annual allowed amount. In many of those compliance agreements, violators just had to give the money back and agree to not do it again.

Shadzik says he can't find a lawyer who will take the case

Shadzik has had difficulty retaining a lawyer. He said the closest law firm dedicated to election law is in Toronto. At his last appearance the court told him to contact the law society.

""It's such a rare and ambiguous act that not a lot of lawyers aren't well versed in it,"" he said.

He returns to court on April 15.

""It doesn't sound like attempted fraud,"" said Conacher. ""I'm not sure why this guy is in court.""","Former poll supervisor in Windsor, Ont. charged with fraud during 2015 federal election",CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/poll-supervisor-fraud-windsor-1.5067370?cmp=rss

The country’s third-largest economy in terms ...,"For weeks, Canada’s political circles have been transfixed by the LavScam scandal engulfing the federal Liberals.

Such is the amplitude of the storm in Ottawa, those Canadians outside of Alberta could be forgiven for not noticing the potential winds of change rolling off the foothills.

The now week-old campaign ahead of the provincial election on April 16 has renewed the focus on Alberta’s — and Canada’s — economic fortunes.

The country’s third-largest economy in terms of GDP can punch well above its weight.

When the heart of Canada’s energy sector blossoms, the economic benefits spread across Canada by providing work to thousands of Canadians and by filling the federal government’s coffers and paying for programs and services.

But in the last few years, things have been less rosy. What was at first a cyclical downturn caused by a global crude slump has turned into a prolonged regional funk.

While the rest of the world’s energy sector has seen recovery Canada’s has not, due to low prices brought on by a lack of pipeline capacity.

The result has been thousands of lost jobs and persistently high unemployment in Alberta.

This damage has been inflicted by a federal government’s unhelpful energy policies; the Alberta NDP’s carbon tax and other business-unfriendly measures; a hostile, obstructionist neighbour (we’re looking at you, British Columbia); and foreign-funded special interest groups hell-bent on disrupting the oilsands.

This election is the first opportunity for Albertans to take action on some of those problems and, with hope, help put the province and country on a track of prosperity.

But it’s not only about creating jobs for Canadians.

Economic woes have led to political malaise in the West which, left unaddressed, could tug at the threads holding the country together.

Already, the front-running United Conservative Party is looking into using equalization as a tool to force Ottawa to jumpstart pipeline construction.

Smaller political parties are vying for votes by vowing to assert more provincial control in various sectors, with some going as far as proposing Alberta independence.

The frustration in Alberta is potent — and how Albertans choose to address it will have economic and political implications across Canada.",EDITORIAL: The Alberta election matters nationally,Toronto Sun,https://torontosun.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-the-alberta-election-matters-nationally
3,Politics,2019-03-24T19:15:00.0000000Z,"Kniaziev and his Canadian counterparts exchanged information and best practices on how to cope with the inevitable threat of foreign interference in elections. Canada has struck a special committee, a ""critical election protocol,"" composed of five senior ...","OTTAWA — Two weeks after Serhii Kniaziev's military career ended, the Iron Curtain fell, the Soviet Union crumbled and the young ex-soldier returned to Ukraine and quickly found his calling — the thin blue line of policing.

In the latter days of his military service, he was posted to the volatile Caucasus region, where ethnic conflict and strife rose amid the Soviet Union's disintegration.

""I came back to an independent Ukraine,"" Kniaziev said through a translator on a recent visit to Ottawa. ""That was also the reason I decided to become a policeman because I was exposed during my military service to blood and to fighting that took place in that time, at that area.""

A generation later, Kniaziev is the chief of the National Police of Ukraine at a pivotal moment in his country's history. He is now responsible for protecting the integrity of Ukraine's March 31 presidential election.

The election faces daily threats from a familiar source: a determined Russia bent on using cyberspace to sow disinformation to undermine the democratic ambitions of a country it still considers part of its orbit.

""I feel a great sense of responsibility, ensuring the proper elections,"" said Kniaziev, whose furrowed brow and strapping, thick frame suggests the presence of invisible anvils on each of his broad shoulders.

""Unfortunately we are in a position that Russia is our enemy now, and Russia has never been weak. We have to be very honest and very realistic in assessing the capabilities of Russia.""

Kniaziev spent time with RCMP counterparts, Toronto police and other leading federal government officials in Canada's diplomatic and security apparatus in Ottawa earlier this winter. Canada has been helping Ukraine build its national police force following the tumultuous events of early 2014 that saw the ouster of the country's Kremlin-backed president after pro-democracy Maidan protests in Kyiv, and Moscow's subsequent invasion and annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula.

The Police Training Assistance Project, run by Global Affairs Canada, is part of the government's broader assistance to Ukraine, which includes a Canadian Armed Forces mission of 200 trainers that was extended last week, the deployment of hundreds of election observers for the upcoming ballot and the imposition of sanctions on more than 100 Russians.

Kniaziev and his Canadian counterparts exchanged information and best practices on how to cope with the inevitable threat of foreign interference in elections.

Canada has struck a special committee, a ""critical election protocol,"" composed of five senior public servants who will decide whether a malign act of interference in this October's federal election warrants going public in the middle of the campaign.

Kniaziev and his Ukrainian colleagues describe their country as a petri dish for Russian cyberattacks — known in 21st Century military doctrine as ""hybrid war"" — and say the countries that partner with it, such as a Canada, have a lot to learn from them as well.

Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland echoed that sentiment recently, calling Ukraine a ""laboratory"" for Russian disinformation campaigns in cyberspace that Canada has learned from.

Russia has also undertaken traditional military manoeuvres against Ukraine by seizing Crimea and supporting separatist rebels in its eastern Donbass region, but cyberspace has become the main battlefield.

""In 2014, these were military activities — war fighting. But in 2015, '16, '17, '18 they've changed their ways and we are in the midst of hybrid war,"" said Kniaziev.

That has come to encompass a wide spectrum of malign activity, from trying to directly hack the online infrastructure of elections, to influencing public opinion through misinformation and generally sowing unrest.

""Whenever Russia doesn't feel like it wants to be involved in direct, naked aggression they are involved in all of these subversive hybrid activities,"" said Kniaziev.

Ukraine's ambassador to Canada, Andriy Shevchenko, said as the election nears, Russia has launched daily cyberattacks on Ukraine's digital election infrastructure, its critical infrastructure and media.

Ukrainian police and the Mounties are also working together on a daily basis. ""It's a very practical co-operation,"" he said. ""We can witness true camaraderie between Canadians and Ukrainians.""

The constant state of vigilance has also created a heightened state of national stress, something Kniaziev only realized after spending time on the beat with rank and file Toronto police officers during his recent trip.

As he headed back to Ukraine, he came to recognize the need to incorporate mental health professionals into the daily patrols of his country's police officers as part of their regular interactions with Ukrainian citizens.

""We have quite a number of people who have so-called Vietnam syndrome, meaning some mental issues,"" he said.

""The society in general does not understand who these people are, where they are coming from. The approach we saw in Toronto really impressed us.""

Kniaziev blames the ongoing strife with Russia for affecting his country's national psyche.

""It's been six years of ongoing war with our neighbour, so Ukrainian society lives in a totally different reality, if we were to compare with the Canadian society.""

The race for Alberta is on between Jason Kenney’s United Conservative Party and Premier Rachel Notley’s NDP. “That anything can happen in a campaign is a cliché for a reason: because it is true. And it is especially true in Alberta,” writes Jaime Watt. ( Star Edmonton and CP )

For those of us observers in the rest of Canada, much of the challenge in predicting the horse race results of Alberta elections lies in the outdated perception we have of both Alberta and Albertans. In 2019, the province is much more Nenshi and much less Klein; a shift that’s been driven in part by net-migration — from within Canada and abroad. At various times in Alberta’s recent history, the pundits and pollsters have ended up tying their shoelaces together; politicians have staged improbable comebacks; while voters have flirted with the notion of change, only to return to the status quo at the last moment. And so, I watch with interest as Albertans prepare to go to the polls April 16.

That anything can happen in a campaign is a cliché for a reason: because it is true. And it is especially true in Alberta. Back in 2008, pundits obsessed over lingering bad blood from Ed Stelmach’s leadership race against party stalwart Jim Dinning. His government was destined to collapse from majority to minority status, or so went the conventional narrative. But Steady Eddy proved the talking heads wrong. He ran a consistent, focused campaign that doggedly reminded Albertans that he “had a plan” and relentlessly hammered away at the shortcomings of Alberta Liberal Leader Kevin Taft. In the end, he proved the smart people wrong: the PCs picked up a dozen more seats. Fast forward to 2012, when Alison Redford went into campaign season lagging by 22 points. As the Wildrose opposition took the lead, and media exposed details of a government committee that hadn’t met in years yet paid its members handsomely, the PCs faced an almost certain rout. Considering the party had been in power for 39 years at that point, many voters thought a rout was exactly what the PCs deserved. But as the public turned its attention to the Wildrose bench, they discovered a team that wasn’t yet ready for prime time.

One candidate described how gays will burn in a “lake of fire.” Another Calgary-area candidate claimed that he had an advantage in the ethnically diverse riding “as a Caucasian.” The party’s leader questioned the science of climate change – hardly a deal breaker in oil-dependant Alberta – but it was the straw that broke the camel’s back. In the end, the PCs were returned to majority status and managed to stem their losses to five seats.

And then there was Jim Prentice’s 2015 roll of the dice when he tried to seek a mandate from voters to support his unpopular budget. This after he had engineered a mass floor-crossing of Wildrose MLAs to eliminate the province’s only effective opposition. To say these antics left a bad taste in voters’ mouths would be an understatement and polls began to indicate that voters were looking elsewhere – namely, at Rachel Notley’s NDP. Yet, pundits remained skeptical. Today, Premier Notley finds herself heading into her first re-election campaign facing a united and re-energized opposition. The PCs and the Wildrose have merged to create a Jason Kenny-led United Conservative Party that’s a formidable challenger. The UCP, which has been leading in the polls for a year and a half, has started the election as the victim of its own self-inflicted wounds: candidates with sketchy pasts, an exposé in Maclean’s recounted a tale of skulduggery surrounding a “kamikaze” candidate who worked with Kenney to sabotage an opponent’s leadership campaign. All of a sudden, there are shades of the internecine warfare that was supposedly meant to doom Stelmach along with mutters of history from either 2008 or 2012 repeating itself. But the UCP still maintains a commanding lead, and it is laser-focused on the issues — pipelines, jobs, and the economy — which will define the race. While it is too soon to say whether its focus will pay off, this election may prove that campaigns do matter, after all.

Well, that’s not how they did it in Convocation of the Law Society of Upper Canada. But it’s hard to imagine that a 1960s-Berkeley-type free for all would be a better ...","This has been a tough winter in Canada — one of the hardest in recent years, climate change notwithstanding. Thanks to extended periods of frigid temperatures in southern Canada, we’ve all had unhappy tutorials in the science of things such as polar vortexes and weather bombs. So it was that it was often warmer in Whitehorse than in Toronto. At least in the circles I run, that meant that February was a grumpier month than it usually is. It also meant that, more than once, I found myself mumbling the Duke of Gloucester’s famous line from Shakespeare’s Richard III, “Now is the winter of our discontent.”

That line came to mind again the other day when I was scanning my twitter feed and following the Ontario bencher election. I remain a member of the Law Society of Ontario and I happen to know (and admire) many of the candidates who are running. Several of them are people I consider personal friends. So, I’ve been paying closer attention than most lawyers in Alberta are wont to do. And what I’ve noticed is that this is, without question, the angriest legal profession election I’ve ever seen.

I’ve been voting in law society elections — Nova Scotia first and then Ontario — since the 1980s. Over the years, I’ve seen some hotly contested votes. And I’ve met some candidates who were real doozies. But I’ve never seen the passion — or the rancour — that I’ve seen so far in this Ontario election.

Typically, a law society election will have one or two key issues around which voter choice eventually coalesces. At one point in Ontario, for instance, a big issue was reducing the size of Convocation. In Alberta, the last election involved an underlying issue of entity-based regulation. And so on. But this year in Ontario is quite different. Rather than one or two principal issues, there seems to be a host of them demanding our attention – and each involves the drawing of deeply seated emotional battle lines.

So far, I’ve seen angry screeds about tuition levels in law school (scandalously high), diversity (pitifully low), alleged vote trading among law firms (a bad thing), the degree to which the law society should be driving the technology bus among lawyers (split opinion), grey hair among the benchers (way too much of it), who should be sitting in judgment of lawyers behaving badly (perhaps a stand-alone tribunal?), transparency within the law society (there is not enough), membership fees (see “tuition levels,” above) and operating deficits. (What? How could an organization that charges that much be running one? Seriously? It must be the catering charges). And then there is the so-called “Stop SOP” slate of candidates pledging to try to repeal the obligation the law society imposed on us to declare that we will abide by a statement of principles that acknowledges obligation to promote equality, diversity and inclusion. It’s too early to say whether Stop SOP is what we in Alberta are learning to describe as a “Kamikaze campaign,” but whatever it is, I don’t think I’ve ever seen as sure-fire a way to raise blood pressure among lawyers as to casually lob a reference to the statement of principles into a conversation.

It will be interesting to see how all this messiness plays out on voting day, April 30. One wonders whether the various passions on display among the candidates will arrest the decline in voting numbers in recent years. It’s a paradox. For interest in being a bencher has never been higher. A record 135 lawyers are running for the job this year. That’s a 40-per-cent increase over the number in the last election. But it seems that our keenness to choose them has never been lower. Law Times reported that between 1987 and the last election, in 2015, voting turnout declined from almost 60 per cent of the bar to just a little more than a third. That’s not a healthy trend-line at all, and one hopes it will start to tilt upwards again.

At the same time, one wonders how the law society will actually manage its agenda in any kind of orderly way. As someone who had occasion to attend meetings of Convocation for more than a decade, I can report that they could seldom have been accused of being pot boilers. And that thing that we teach in law school about the importance of succinctness in speech? Well, that’s not how they did it in Convocation of the Law Society of Upper Canada. But it’s hard to imagine that a 1960s-Berkeley-type free for all would be a better — or more productive — alternative.

But most importantly, one wonders how the society will find the bandwidth to deal with some of the other existential issues facing our profession. Alternative business structures is hardly a sexy topic. But if our concern is making legal services more accessible to citizens (in other words, if we really believe that access to justice is an important goal), it’s at least worth a discussion. For the same reason, we need to think seriously about broadening the scope of permitted practice for paralegals. What about professional self-governance? If we don’t begin to build a case for its continuation, it’s hard to imagine it surviving — particularly if a provincial government decides that some political hay can be made out of the issue. And who knows, maybe it shouldn’t. But I’d at least like us to be involved in a serious way in the debate. And, yes, there is the cost of legal education. That’s a very important issue. But it is only part of a much bigger discussion we need to have regarding the whole continuum of professional development. Will we, though, have the time and energy to do that? Put another way, will our new Convocation be a place of heat or of light?

In popular usage, we tend to employ the Duke of Gloucester’s line for negative connotation — as I did earlier. But perhaps we should remember that in Shakespeare’s play, it was actually part of a speech about hope. “Now is the winter of our discontent,” said the Duke.

Made glorious summer by this sun of York;

And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house

In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.

Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;

Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;

Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,

Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.

Let’s only hope that come May Day, with our new Convocation, our ending is as happy as Shakespeare’s.",Now is the benchers’ election of our discontent,Canadian Lawyer Magazine,https://canadianlawyermag.com/author/ian-holloway/now-is-the-benchers-election-of-our-discontent-17023/

On Saturday morning, the NDP called on the United Conservative Party to remove Calgary-Mountain View candidate Jeremy Wong alleging he “praised and promoted” a conversion therapy program.

Wong was nominated in the riding after candidate Caylan Ford was removed after a report surfaced about remarks she made suggesting white supremacist terrorists are treated unfairly.

In September, Edmonton-Castle Downs backbench NDP MLA Nicole Goehring said she was developing legislation to ban conversion therapy, which is based on the unfounded idea that psychological or spiritual intervention can change someone’s sexual orientation or gender identity.

Manitoba and Ontario have passed legislation to prohibit the damaging practice.

Jason Kenney in Red Deer

UCP Leader Jason Kenney will be in Red Deer Saturday for a pair of public events.

Kenney unveiled an multi-point plan dubbed the ‘Fair Deal Plan’ at a speaking event at the Red Deer Museum & Art Gallery Saturday.

Kenney said a UCP government would use a referendum to push the pipeline fight, and for a fair new formula, convert social and health transfers from cash to tax point transfers, take aim at payroll tax hikes, fight for Employment Insurance fairness, challenge the federal government on its “unfair, one-size-fits-all policy” stress test for mortgages, press for a charter of economic rights that would essentially open borders to more and better trade, and establish an Alberta parole board, just like Ontario and Quebec has, and end agreements with the parole board of Canada.

Afterwards, Kenney will be holding a rally in Red Deer at 4 p.m. at Red Deer-North candidate Adriana LaGrange’s campaign office, Unit 5, 6782-50 Ave.

The UCP issued a statement Saturday morning condemning the NDP for not taking action against foreign-funded anti-oil sands campaigns while they were in government.

“Rachel Notley must explain what the options presented to her were, and why the NDP chose to ignore them,” said Jason Nixon, UCP candidate for Rimbey-Rocky Mountain House-Sundre in a news release. “The NDP needs explain why they opted for inaction against these foreign-funded attacks on our oil and gas workers and Alberta’s prosperity.”

Rachel Notley was reportedly presented with a legal opinion on how to fight back against the foreign-funded attacks against our oil & gas workers. But the NDP refused to act! Rachel Notley must explain. https://t.co/WVe3w2q6XD #ableg #abpoli #abvote pic.twitter.com/yQSIfXfvsF — United Conservative Party (@Alberta_UCP) March 23, 2019

On Friday, Kenney said an elected UCP government would spend $30 million on a taxpayer-funded “war room” to fight attacks on Alberta’s energy industry.

""The Green party is about citizenship, democracy and true accounting,” she told the Times. “We are a party based on looking after people, community and the planet. We understand that the economy of the future needs to embrace innovation, evidence-based practice and good stewardship of resources, planet and wealth. And the people of Canada understand that if we want a better system of government, we need a party committed to evidence-based electoral reform.”

Meanwhile, the battle to win the federal Conservative party’s nod in the Cambridge riding has yet to play out, with three candidates vying for the nod, including Waterloo Region District School Board trustee Cindy Watson, former TV reporter and meteorologist Tyler Calver and small business owner Sunny Attwal. Former Cambridge mayor Doug Craig originally threw his hat in the ring in the nomination race, but bowed out, throwing his support behind Calver.

The nomination vote is set for April 8 at the Armenian Community Centre of Cambridge.

The Conservative Party of Canada has, however, named its candidate in the Kitchener South-Hespeler riding. Alan Keeso, who earned master degrees in biodiversity and business at Oxford University, decided to venture into politics upon his return from the United Kingdom and worked on Kitchener South-Hespeler Conservative MPP Amy Fee’s campaign.

Keeso plans to focus on fiscal responsibility and economic strength.

“Primarily there is a big concern on fiscal responsibility, tax dollars going toward servicing the debt, versus services people need, so there is a real call for return to fiscal responsibility (for) future generations, as well and what that debt is going to do them,"" he said in a recent interview.

Kitchener South-Hespeler Liberal MP Marwan Tabbara, who congratulated Kesso on his nomination, is seeking re-election.

Two nominees have been confirmed in the race to select a Green Party of Canada candidate in the Kitchener South-Hespeler riding, including former candidate David Weber, and Ian Graham, who was in the nomination run for Kitchener-Centre last month. A third name could be added to the nomination race. Nominee selection is expected to take place on April 4.

The New Democratic Party has not yet selected its candidate for the Kitchener South-Hespeler riding, as its nominee vetting processing is still underway.

The next election promises to be one of the most contentious in living memory. As usual, the economy will be a huge focus. Can investors expect shifts in policy that will provide a boost for the market in the next decade?

In the spring of 2018, Royal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY)(NYSE:RY) CEO Dave McKay warned that there was “significant” investment outflow from Canada to the United States. The US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 slashed corporate taxes in the US by 14%. U.S. stocks experienced huge gains in 2017 in anticipation of the legislation. Companies reported record profits in 2018, especially financial institutions, but many of these gains were already priced in.

McKay and other business leaders in Canada are pushing for a modernization of Canada’s tax laws. Canada has remained competitive when it comes to corporate tax, but there is renewed focus on personal income taxes. According to the Fraser Institute, Canadian workers across the income spectrum pay significantly higher personal income tax than their U.S. counterparts.

Some economists argue that high marginal tax rates discourage productive economic activity. There is much debate on just how much impact these rates have, but you can bet it is enough to be politicized. Success breeds imitation, and the Ontario Progressive Conservatives marched their way to a stunning majority on a campaign of “opening Ontario up for business, while mixing in some populist rhetoric.

Canadian banks are unlikely to enjoy the kind of windfall their U.S. counterparts experienced after the 2017 U.S. tax reform package. However, some type of tax reform is almost guaranteed to be on the platform for all opposition parties this year.

Magna International (TSX:MG)(NYSE:MGA) CEO Don Walker was also vocal on the topic of Canadian tax rates in the spring of 2018. In May, Walker said that it had become costlier to do business in Ontario, especially in the wake of U.S. tax reform. Doug Ford’s PCs ran on a campaign of reducing Ontario’s corporate tax, although only by 1% as the rate already stands at 11.5%. This change has yet to come down the pipe, however.

Magna will lobby for a boost, but it has been an absolute powerhouse in the face of economic headwinds going by its recent earnings. In 2018, Magna reported record sales of $40.8 billion which was up 12% from 2017. It posted record cash from operations of $3.7 billion and record diluted earnings per share of $6.61, a 13% year-over-year increase.

Shares of Magna have climbed 5.1% in 2019 as of late afternoon trading on March 21. The stock is still down 10.7% from the prior year. Magna and other auto giants are still waiting on the USMCA to be ratified by Congress, but the agreement alleviated some anxiety. Now the company will eagerly await a push to lower the cost of doing business in its home country.

Notley in Edmonton

Alberta NDP Leader Rachel Notley was in Edmonton Sunday afternoon giving a speech to hundreds of screaming supporters at the Polish Hall, 10960 104 St NW, Edmonton. It is the only event on her scheduled Sunday.

Notley said the NDP inherited an economy that is “deeply damaged” and said an elected NDP will balance the books by 2023 without making “reckless cuts.”

Mandel in Edmonton

Alberta Party Leader Stephen Mandel is door-knocking Sunday morning in the Edmonton-McClung riding. It is the only event he is scheduled for Sunday.

However, the Alberta Party released plans Sunday to do away with paper and plastic government ID cards in favour of digital identification. According to a Sunday news release, the plan would see plastic and paper identification for health care, drivers’ licenses, provincial ID and the Alberta WIN cards all converted digitally to a “government identification app with a portal to allow Albertans more flexibility when presenting ID.”

“My paper AHS card is a daily reminder Alberta is still using solutions from the 1970s,” Mandel said in the news release. “It’s time to start living in the present by consolidating identification for government licensing and access to services. Digital identity is commonplace. If we don’t develop or modernize, we’ll simply be left behind.”

Khan in Calgary

Alberta Liberal Leader Dave Khan is in Calgary Sunday making calls from his campaign office from 9-10:30 a.m., attending a campaign office grand opening for Calgary North East candidate Gul Khan from 1-3 p.m., and finally door knocking in the Calgary-Mountain View riding from 4:30-7 p.m.

On Sunday, the Alberta Liberals unveiled their platform policy for new Canadians, pledging to improve access to foreign credential upgrades, boosting settlement funding and investing in adult education and English-as-a-second-language programs.

“We will make it easier for immigrants to access Alberta Government services,” Khan said in a news release. “We will provide those services in more languages. We will establish a telephone service that allows new Canadians to speak to government agents with the help of a translator.

“New Canadians are vital to Alberta. Immigrants help us unlock our economic potential and the diversity they create enriches the multicultural fabric of our nation.”

UCP in Slave Lake

UCP candidate for Athabasca-Barrhead-Westlock, Glenn Van Dijken, is in Slave Lake Sunday to detail the party’s plan to “stand up for Alberta’s forestry workers.”

Van Dijken will make the announcement at 1 p.m. at the Vanderwell Contractors Ltd (Mill), 695 West Mitsue Industry Road, in Slave Lake.

(A previous version of this story said Jason Kenney will be in Slave Lake Sunday but he will not be participating in the announcement.)

In a Sunday news release, van Dijken called out the NDP government for “restricting timber access” and “over-regulation”, and said a UCP government would set up a Caribou Range Task Force to review the NDP’s Alberta Caribou Draft Plan.

“It is essential that forest companies have long-term access to a sustainable secure fibre supply,” van Dijken said. “We need to get behind our foresters. For Albertans, this is a vital industry.”

On Saturday night, the party confirmed Sanjay Patel as the UCP candidate in the Edmonton-Ellerslie riding.

“Like many Albertans, Sanjay Patel came to Canada seeking opportunity. Sanjay received a Bachelor of Science degree in India, and since coming to Alberta, he has worked in the construction industry,” Kenney said in a Saturday news release. “Sanjay will be a huge asset to the United Conservative team as we work to present Albertans with a common-sense alternative to the NDP. I am pleased to welcome Sanjay as the United Conservative candidate in Edmonton-Ellerslie.”

That’s the big question behind the bitter election campaign now underway in Alberta.

From left, former Wildrose Leader Brian Jean, former United Conservative candidate Jeff Callaway, and United Conservative Leader Jason Kenney. The RCMP and Alberta’s election commissioner are currently probing allegations that Kenney’s team orchestrated Jeff Callaway’s UCP leadership bid in 2017 in order to attack former Wildrose Party leader Brian Jean, Kenney’s biggest rival. ( TorontoStar File/ Canadian Press )

After all, Donald Trump was elected U.S. president even though voters knew, among other things, that he had sexually abused women, called Mexicans “rapists,” and duped people out of money at his bogus university. Doug Ford was elected premier of Ontario even though he had been an eager sidekick to his brother Rob Ford when he was mayor of Toronto and embroiled in one public scandal after another. Jason Kenney, a former federal cabinet minister and leader of Alberta’s United Conservative Party is facing the same kind of scrutiny about his moral fibre in his bid to oust NDP Premier Rachel Notley.

Article Continued Below

Unfortunately for Kenney, the scandal he is caught up in raises serious questions about how he was elected leader of the UCP, which of course put him on the road to possibly becoming Alberta’s next premier. And since election day is only three weeks away, it’s possible that if Kenney becomes premier he will begin his tenure under the shadow of an RCMP investigation into that leadership campaign. The scandal begins in October 2017 when the UCP held a leadership contest after the Progressive Conservatives and the Wildrose Party agreed to merge. There were four candidates for the leadership of the new party: Kenney, former leader of the Progressive Conservatives; Brian Jean, former leader of the Wildrose Party; Jeff Callaway, former Wildrose president; and Doug Schweitzer a Calgary Lawyer. Given on the record interviews and documents from people directly involved, it now appears the Callaway campaign was a fake campaign, or as it has been dubbed a “kamikaze” campaign, designed to rip Brian Jean apart, leaving Kenney to travel the high road. The Kenney campaign worked closely with the Callaway campaign, instructing Callaway how and when to attack Brian Jean, and even scheduling when he would drop out of the race and throw his support to Kenney.

Emails also suggest that Callaway’s videos and attack ads aimed at Brian Jean were produced by Kenney’s staff and then sent to the Callaway camp. At one point $60,000 was donated to the Callaway campaign in one fell swoop and then distributed to various campaign volunteers so it would look like the money was donated by them. The Alberta Election Commissioner has already fined three people and reprimanded one for donating funds given or furnished by another person.

Article Continued Below

Callaway’s co-campaign chair was fined $15,000 for obstructing the election commissioner’s investigation. The investigation concerning the $60,000 donation has been turned over to the RCMP. Kenney has said there is “nothing unusual” about two competing political campaigns communicating with each other. And he has denied any direct involvement. But it seems there was a lot more than simple communication going on. Collusion is the word that comes to mind. And it’s not as though Kenney is an inexperienced political campaigner. He has been immersed in political campaigns since he left high school. While at university in San Francisco he vociferously campaigned again pro-choice advocates, and he was active in a campaign to deny spousal rights to people dying of AIDs. At the tender age of 22 he was president of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation. He was a Calgary MP for 19 years and an influential federal cabinet minister for eight years. That he is even associated with such unethical campaign tactics leaves one to wonder just what he would do behind closed doors as premier Kenney’s been at the backroom game for a long time. Maybe that’s why he doesn’t seem the least bit flustered by the accusations that he ran a dirty leadership campaign. He just motors along talking about the economy, jobs, and pipelines. But perhaps he’s also hoping that voters have become inured to scandals; that they accept them as par for the course just as many did with Donald Trump and Doug Ford. Maybe he’s counting on voters’ anger at the Liberals in Ottawa and the NDP in Edmonton to carry him through no matter the stink rising from his leadership campaign. Or maybe he’s hoping that character doesn’t count, winning is all that matters. Gillian Steward is a Calgary-based writer and freelance columnist for the Star. Follow her on Twitter: @GillianSteward

To get you caught up on Alberta politics and to give you a taste of what to expect from the newsletter, here are some of our recent Maclean’s features and articles:

This is Notley and her NDP on pre-election footing, polling well behind Jason Kenney’s United Conservatives and their more aggressive posture toward pipelines and anyone who dares not to advocate for them. She’s largely denied critics the opportunity to label her anti-pipeline, and perhaps it’s her best shot at regaining acceptance—Notley has taken the NDP’s old reputation for Prairie pragmatism and dunked it in oil.

In question period, the governing side often attacks more than it defends, as if it’s auditioning to be the official opposition. With this massive advantage, Kenney plans to test how much of a rightward correction Albertans are willing to make. More than just angling to erase the NDP’s four-year imprint on Alberta, he wishes to roll back the political moderation of the Progressive Conservatives before that, too.

Jen Gerson: We may yet see another oil boom, or two. There will probably be applications for oil and plastics over the next century, and Alberta should be doing everything within its power to supply that demand. But it’s a pretty safe bet that global demand for oil is going to abate within my lifetime, as climate change policies, decarbonization efforts and new technologies come to the fore. These shifts are already starting to happen. My child—a toddler today—will probably drive an electric car. He may never learn to drive at all. So what, exactly, is the plan?

For nine years, Kenney sat in a Harper cabinet beset by competing impulses: on one hand, avid conservatism, on the other, incrementalism—the idea that Canadians had to be brought along gradually to accept the Conservative agenda on taxes and programs. A deﬁning question in the run-up to Alberta’s next election is how much cautious incrementalism Kenney will employ, or how free he’ll feel to untether his conservative id.

As a midterm examination of sorts, Maclean’s interviewed dozens of voters in some parts of Alberta where NDP support surged in 2015.

Trudeau pitched the upcoming election as an opportunity for all Canadians to step up and start talking about the kind of country they want to leave for their children ...","VANCOUVER — Justin Trudeau delivered a feisty, campaign-style speech in Vancouver-Kingsway Sunday night as he introduced former TV news anchor Tamara Taggart as the riding’s Liberal candidate in the fall federal election.

The prime minister fired off a flurry of verbal jabs at Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer, and also former prime minister Stephen Harper, giving a glimpse of what could be a heated campaign for the October election.

“Investing in people and communities is the way to grow the economy. Stephen Harper and the Conservatives still don’t get it. Andrew Sheer doesn’t get it either,” he said to a gym full of enthusiastic supporters.

“Under Stephen Harper, Canada had the worst growth rate we’d had since the depths of the Great Depression under R. B. Bennett.”

Trudeau then accused Sheer’s Conservatives of hoping to continue Harper’s policies by giving tax breaks to the wealthy while cutting programs for the middle and lower classes.

“They still think the way to create economic growth for everyone is to cut programs and give advantages and benefits to the wealthiest,” he said. “Well, that doesn’t trickle down to anyone and it didn’t work for 10 years.”

Trudeau pitched the upcoming election as an opportunity for all Canadians to step up and start talking about the kind of country they want to leave for their children and grandchildren.

“Do we want to invest in the middle class — shine on the world stage,” he asked, before warning that Canada “is seeing the rise of populism, aggressive, fear-based politics, just like the rest of the world.”

The crowd roared its approval when the prime minister suggested the best way to counter divisive populism is by recruiting “strong, compassionate people who’ve focused their lives on bringing people together and on empowering people.”

He lauded Taggart as one of those people from all walks of Canadian life who have invested in their communities in various ways to grow the economy, respond to the challenges of climate change and put Canada on the world stage.

Taggart admitted feeling a bit overwhelmed and emotional at being on stage, especially seeing her children holding up signs that read, “Team Tamara.”

The Order of British Columbia recipient said she wants to be the people’s voice in Ottawa, adding that her media career made her a good listener.

While Taggart steered clear of talking about the specifics of her campaign platform at the event, she has previously said that she wants to focus on affordable housing, protecting the environment while boosting the economy, and women’s health and safety.

She’s likely to face a tough challenge in Vancouver-Kingsway, which has been held by New Democrat MP Don Davies since 2008.

Trudeau said Wilson-Raybould and Philpott have indicated they plan to run as Liberals in October, and he is happy with them doing so.

“I look forward to continuing to engage with both Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott as they make their way forward.”

Trudeau said the former ministers’ strong voices add value to his caucus.

Philpott resigned soon after Wilson Raybould from cabinet amid the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Trudeau had said previously he needed time to think about whether he wanted Wilson-Raybould to remain in his party.

But if we want the lives of women and girls to be a priority in this election, then we have to take those numbers and get loud. And to do that we have to work together.","A woman was murdered every 2.5 days last year in Canada.

This is just one of the many startling statistics contained in the first report issued by the Canadian Femicide Observatory for Justice and Accountability, an organization that was established in 2017 as a response to a call from the United Nations to monitor femicide rates around the world. The goal of this yearly report is to draw attention to the unique circumstances surrounding femicide in the hopes of preventing further violence.

But while the report received some attention when it was released in late January, it doesn’t appear to have riled up a single politician—which is alarming when you consider that all the major federal parties are gearing up for the fall election. Candidates of all stripes are hosting town halls, shaking hands, kissing babies and duking it out over SNC-Lavalin, international relations and border security. But no one seems particularly concerned that 148 women and girls were killed last year or that half of the women were murdered in their home by someone who claimed to love them or that the youngest victim was three weeks old. Not a single candidate has made femicide a talking point on the campaign trail.

As a longtime advocate for women and girls, and as a survivor of intimate partner violence and stalking, I’m outraged. What will it take for politicians to care about the lives of women and girls? During the 10 years that Stephen Harper was prime minister, funding for research on women’s lives ground to a halt. Cuts to Status of Women Canada’s budget along with his cancellation of the long-form census meant it became impossible to measure women’s experiences in the home, workplace and at school. It also meant we had no real sense of how many women were experiencing violence. Trudeau’s election and his commitment to feminism was a moment of exhilaration for advocates—it felt as though change was coming.



And in many ways, they have. Gender-Based Analysis was applied to the federal budget, Status of Women got a profile boost and a strong message was sent across the land that “Feminism is cool.” But the violence continued. At the height of the #MeToo moment, three years into Trudeau’s term, an act of misogynist terrorism unfolded on a sunny afternoon in Canada’s largest city when a man drove a van through the streets of Toronto, mowing down eight women and two men. There were hot takes and head shakes, but no concrete policy changes. Neither Canada’s feminist-ally prime minister nor Ontario’s feminist premier Kathleen Wynne called out the blatant misogyny of the act.

When the CFOAJ report launched last month, I was hopeful that hard data would make a difference. For years, we had been relying on patchwork statistical evidence and the qualitative stories of advocates to paint a picture of femicide in Canada. We finally have a better sense of what is happening across this country.

But if we want the lives of women and girls to be a priority in this election, then we have to take those numbers and get loud. And to do that we have to work together. When a candidate comes knocking at your door or when you find yourself at an election debate, here are some hard-ball questions you can throw their way:

How are you going to address violence against Indigenous women and girls?

Indigenous women make up only 5 percent of the Canadian population, but they were 36 percent of the women and girls killed last year. Does your candidate have a position on the Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women? Do they know that provinces, such as Ontario, are clawing back Indigenous education in schools and denying our youth the truth about colonization? Ask them how they plan to make Canada safer for Indigenous women and girls.

What’s your strategy for addressing the high rates of violence against rural women and girls?

Only 16 percent of Canadians live in a rural area, but 34 percent of the women killed last year lived rurally. Women in the north are particularly at risk, with the highest femicide rate in Nunavut and the Yukon. A triple femicide in Wilno, Ontario in the fall of 2015 highlighted the isolation and lack of support for rural women trying to flee violence.

My colleagues and I are re-thinking how funding should be allocated. Currently, funding for services like shelters and sexual assault centres happens per capita. Yes, there are technically fewer clients in a rural community but the lack of public transportation, patchy cellphone reception and the overall isolation means the cost per client is actually higher than urban areas. Ask your candidate if they’re thinking about the rural reality and if rural survivors are on their radar.

How are you going to make Canada safer for young women and girls?

Across all races and regions, young women are especially vulnerable to violence, with a quarter of femicide victims last year being women aged 25 to 34. We also know that women under 25 have the highest rates of sexual assault in Canada. Ask your candidates where they stand on mandatory consent education in schools, the creation of a national youth mental health strategy and funding for trauma-informed youth services.

The vulnerability of young women was recently made tragically clear with the Amber Alert across Ontario searching for Riya Rajkumar. She was a smart, vibrant girl who was killed on her 11th birthday.

This $5 billion represents 100,000 new jobs annually, each paying $50,000 – or half a million new jobs ...","Politicians talk about what they want to talk about and not what’s necessarily important and relevant to Canadians. There are taboo subjects that no political party will address. Tax laws that legally allow affluent Canadians to use tax havens to avoid paying tax are highly relevant to all Canadians. They’re also at the top of the list of taboo topics political parties refuse to talk about. Canada’s tax regulations have created a two-tier tax system, one for the rich and one for everyone else. Some have called this economic discrimination.

It’s estimated by some experts that the annual lost government revenue due to the legal use of tax havens by individuals is $5 billion, or $25 billion over five years. These billions could fund numerous elections promises without adding to Canada’s deficit. This $5 billion represents 100,000 new jobs annually, each paying $50,000 – or half a million new jobs over five years. It represents the funding of a national Pharmacare plan and investments in growth industries, and environmental and social programs. This lost revenue would enhance the lives of all Canadians, instead of benefiting only Canada’s affluent.

These affluent Canadians are not tax-cheats or tax evaders, nor are they abusing our tax system. They are adhering fully to Canada’s tax laws. These laws need to change.

These lost billions represent the funding of a national Pharmacare plan and investments in growth industries, and environmental and social programs.

The October 2019 election represents the only opportunity for Canadian voters to prohibit affluent Canadians from using tax havens to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. We need to demand political parties engage in discussions about this “taboo” issue before the October election. For instance, in next week’s federal budget.

Politicians don’t talk about the Panama and Paradise Paper disclosures, in which thousands of affluent Canadians were identified as having used tax havens to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. This represents only a fraction of the number of affluent Canadians who benefit from offshore tax havens.

The difference between tax evaders and tax avoiders is that tax avoidance is legal. Tax evasion is illegal. Tax evaders are hunted down by the Canada revenue Agency and face the possibility of going to jail.

By contrast, affluent Canadians who use tax havens are law-abiding citizens, free to continue doing the same year after year. This will only change if Canadians demand our government close tax loopholes. But we are reluctant to take to the streets and challenge political parties to address this issue.

Tax reform that prohibits the use of tax havens by affluent Canadians is not radical. U.S. citizens are forbidden to use tax havens to avoid paying taxes. It is a criminal offence. They respect the sacred principle of tax fairness, under which all citizens must pay their fair share of taxes. In Canada, we have a two-tier tax system, which is unfair and unjust.

The losers in all of this are “average” Canadians. Tax avoidance is a dominant factor for Canadians having inadequate health care and social programs. Investments are not being made to growth industries that would allow them to compete domestically and globally. “Average” Canadians are paying more taxes while our government debt is growing at a staggering rate. This should not be allowed to continue.

A 2017 Environics poll found that nine out of 10 Canadians say the use of tax havens is morally wrong, and 87 per cent said they would like to see tax-haven use criminalized. This poll is an indication as to how voters in October’s federal election might respond to a political party advocating for tax reform.

Both individual and corporate tax avoidance laws are crippling Canada. Solutions to tax avoidance by individuals can be addressed by voting for political parties committed to closing tax loopholes. The nature of corporate tax avoidance is complex and requires long-term solutions.

The goal of The Grassroots Coalition for Tax Reform, is to pressure political parties to address the use of tax havens by affluent Canadians, in their election platforms. Let’s all tell them how we feel. This policy issue should no longer be taboo.

A day after announcing that Nanaimo—Ladysmith voters will head to the polls in early May to fill the Commons seat left vacant by the departure of New Democrat Sheila Malcolmson earlier this year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is set to kick off the week with a morning appearance in Maple Ridge, where, as per the advisory, he’ll “highlight” his government’s latest plan to support “housing affordability,” as laid out in last week’s budget.

[READ MORE: What We’re Watching: House hiatus happenings]

At press time, that was the only event on his official itinerary, but according to the Nanaimo News Bulletin, he’s expected to hit the hustings alongside Liberal standard-bearer Michelle Corfield before jetting off to Winnipeg. There, alongside International Trade Minister Jim Carr, he’ll rally the crowd at an evening reception for member of the Laurier Club, which requires a minimum annual contribution of at least $1,500, which can be paid at once or in monthly instalments of $125.

Earlier in the day, Carr will sit down for a post-budget chat with the Association of Manitoba Municipalities, during which, as per the notice, he intends to focus on “national pharmacare and investments in municipal infrastructure.”

Meanwhile, New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh heads to Montreal for what, according to the official record, would seem to be his first extended bilateral session with Quebec Premier François Legault since the Coalition Avenir Quebec’s election win last fall.

Although Singh — who will be accompanied by his newly appointed deputy leader Alexandre Boulerice — is undoubtedly hoping to find common cause with the Quebec premier on issues like housing affordability, national pharmacare and other policy initiatives expected to be front and centre in the New Democrat campaign platform, he may well find himself on the defensive over the party’s position on the SNC-Lavalin controversy — and specifically, their opposition to negotiating any sort of deal that would allow embattled Montreal-based engineering firm to escape criminal prosecution on fraud and bribery charges.

Speaking with reporters last week, Legault confirmed that he has spoken with Trudeau “on the need to find a way to save SNC-Lavalin,” as well as the thousands of jobs that may be at risk, and hinted that Quebec could buy shares in the company in order to protect it from foreign takeover.

Expect the SNC-Lavalin question to come up when Singh and Boulerice take questions from the media after their closed-door meeting with Legault.

Also out and about today: Finance Minister Bill Morneau takes his cross-country budget-boosting tour to Calgary, where, as per the notice from his office, he’ll outline his plan to “invest in the middle class” at a lunch event hosted by the Economic Club of Canada.

Finally, Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland treks south of the border to Washington, D.C., for a one-on-one with United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, as well as closed-door meetings with various unnamed congresspersons, during which she’ll likely make the case for the revamped North American free trade deal.

The threat of political fragmentation is increasing in Canada – and instead of exacerbating divisions, federal politicians can bridge regional divides and offset tensions.

As a survey released last week by the Environics Institute showed, perceived regional divisions across the country are increasing. At the same time, this national poll suggests that many Canadians think that the federal government is less relevant to their lives.

Story continues below advertisement

This divide is evident in the recent SNC-Lavalin controversy involving former attorney-general and justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould. Before her explosive testimony, while people in Quebec focused primarily on how to save SNC-Lavalin jobs and keep its headquarters in Montreal, many observers in other provinces saw this story as an example of how Prime Minister Justin Trudeau favours Quebec at the expense of other parts of the country.

The language divide in our country cannot be ignored, and the fact that French-language media in Quebec covered the story quite differently from media outlets located in other parts of the country mattered. Language and economic interests converged to create regional perception gaps over the most central political controversy of the Justin Trudeau era.

Other key issues are perceived very differently across the country – in ways that aggravate regional conflict. For instance, a fall 2018 Abacus poll suggested that while 43 per cent of Ontarians and 47 per cent of Quebeckers perceived climate change as a “very big” problem, only 22 per cent of Albertans felt the same way. Once again, differences in perceived economic interests played a direct role, as climate change is associated with oil production, which is much more important to the economy of Alberta than to the economies of Ontario and Quebec.

Perceptions grounded in regional economic interests can be hard to reconcile, which creates a major challenge for federal politicians struggling to design policy proposals that will garner enough support across the entire country. This struggle is especially tricky because everyday interactions among individuals reinforce these perceptions. Such interactions make people believe their views are widely shared, a situation that social media reinforces by creating online communities of like-minded people who seldom engage with individuals who hold opposing views. These social and virtual realities are likely to increase the risk of political fragmentation in Canada and around the world, as evidenced by the rise of far-right populism in Europe and the advent of the Trump presidency in the United States.

In Canada, we must find better ways to counter the regional fragmentation of politics and to seek shared solutions to the economic, social and environmental challenges we face as a country. Blaming people from other regions of the country for our woes is counterproductive, so we must get a better sense of why people think the way they do as it relates to their regional identities, perceived interests and everyday experiences.

Instead of exacerbating existing divisions, federal politicians in this country can bridge regional divides. As opposed to federal countries such as Belgium who only have regional parties left, Canada has strong federal parties that seek to bring people together from all regions of the country. Federal politicians representing countrywide parties have an obligation to offset the re-emergence of strong regional resentment in this country. This is especially the case now, with the rise of regionalist and populist sentiments across Canada.

The danger with the constant struggles over issues such as carbon pricing and pipeline building is that regional alienation and finger pointing can grow out of control. This is not what our country needs and both federal politicians and ordinary citizens can foster new political conversations to bring people together from coast to coast to coast. This endeavour can only take the form of inter-regional dialogues in which voters and politicians can address differences and find common ground through compromise.

""The events of the last few weeks have raised important questions about the relationship between the federal government and the minister of justice and Attorney General of Canada,"" a statement from Trudeau's office read.

""Ms. McLellan will assess the structure that has been in place since Confederation of a single minister holding the positions of minister of justice and Attorney General of Canada … She will also analyze the operating policies and practices across the cabinet, and the role of public servants and political staff in their interactions with the (minister).""

Opposition MPs also took issue with Wernick's alarming statements on foreign interference in the upcoming election, as well as the tone and tenor of political discourse in Canada.

Wernick said he is concerned somebody will be assassinated in the upcoming campaign. He also tabled seven angry messages sent to him after his first committee appearance, saying they constituted ""intimidation of a witness.""

As clerk, Wernick was the most senior member of a five-person committee tasked with assessing possible foreign intervention in the upcoming election — and whether or not the Canadian public should be warned.

Last week, the opposition parties expressed no confidence in his ability to do that.

The task now falls to Ian Shugart, who Trudeau named as Wernick's replacement on Monday. Shugart is a lifelong bureaucrat and the current deputy minister of foreign affairs.

Global Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters that Shugart is ""someone I trust completely, someone who is 100 per cent devoted to the Canadian national interest, and someone with excellent judgment.""

""I can't think of a better person to fill the role,"" Freeland said.

""I want to thank Michael Wernick for his extraordinary service to Canada over many, many decades,"" Trudeau told reporters outside the House of Commons.

""We've accomplished a lot as a government over these past three and a half years, and it was definitely in large part because of extraordinary public service and Michael Wernick's leadership.""

As Canada’s military mission races to leave Mali and the United Nations pleads for it to stay, the European Union is making a fresh appeal to the Canadian Forces to partner with it in the West African country.

Gen. Esa Pulkkinen, director general of the EU’s military staff, told The Canadian Press that he has asked the Canadian government to bring its military training expertise to Mali as part of a broader effort to stamp out Islamic extremism in Africa’s Sahel region.

Pulkkinen said he’s aware of the context of his request – it comes as Canada faces pressure from the UN to extend its Mali peacekeeping mission in order to bridge a gap until Romanian replacements can arrive.

Story continues below advertisement

But he says Canada would make a great bilateral partner with the EU’s military training efforts in West Africa, which he says are crucial to stamping out security threats to Europe.

Those threats include the mass northward migration to Europe, an increase in the smuggling of arms, drugs and human trafficking, as well as terrorism.

Pulkkinen was in Ottawa this past week, and said he was planning to make a formal request to Canadian officials after raising the matter informally.

“I need brains. I don’t need the quantities,” he said.

“Your officer training is top level in the world. More importantly, you have French language skills as well, which we need when we provide advice for our Malian friends.”

Pulkkinen already commands 1,000 troops in Somalia, the Central African Republic and Mali, and is partnering with the United States on various missions on the continent. He said the EU wants to ramp up its presence in Mauritania, Burkina Faso, Niger and Chad as well.

Joining forces with Canada would be a natural fit, he noted, because the EU mission is predicated on the same shared values.

Story continues below advertisement

“We try to find other partners that share the same universal Western values as we have. They are very important when you provide education for our African troops,” Pulkkinen said.

“The same understanding of the respect of human rights and other issues – you name it.”

But the mission will be a tough sell for the EU.

Canada is in the final throes of withdrawing its eight helicopters and 250 military personnel from Mali, where they have been providing emergency medical evacuations and transporting troops and equipment across the vast country.

The drawdown has moved the UN to formally ask Canada to extend its mission in what appears to be a final effort to prevent a gap in military medical evacuations for wounded peacekeepers and UN staff.

The UN sent a formal request, in writing, to the federal government late last month after months of behind-the-scenes prodding got them nowhere with Ottawa.

Story continues below advertisement

The letter marks an unusual step: the UN usually only makes such requests if it believes it stands a good chance of a positive response, which in this case is far from certain.

The government, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, has repeatedly played down the gap it would be creating by leaving Mali on schedule.

Pulkkinen’s request on behalf of the EU will only increase the pressure on the Trudeau government, which has faced criticism for what has been seen as a relatively weak return to the business of UN peacekeeping due to the Mali mission’s modest scope. The Liberals made peacekeeping a signature foreign policy promise during the 2015 federal election.

Canada will face pressure this coming week when the UN hosts a major peacekeeping summit in New York, the first one since Vancouver hosted a similar gathering in November 2017.

The party states in a news release that a recent poll found ""a shocking 50 per cent of Albertans surveyed said they support secession from Canada.""

Kenney says in the release that most Albertans are proud Canadians, but they will no longer tolerate the rest the country benefiting from the province's resources while trying to hold back its economy.

Watch: Kenney says his campaign is focused on jobs

His comments come in the wake of the British Columbia government's effort to pass legislation that would impact the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline, which runs from Edmonton to Metro Vancouver.

They also reflect his view of the federal government's Bill C-69, which would change how projects such as oil and gas pipelines are reviewed.

Kenney says that in the midst of economic crisis, Alberta is ""under assault from other governments in Canada.""

""We are by far the biggest contributor to the federation. We have always played by the rules, paid our taxes, and produced wealth for other Canadians,"" Kenney said in a statement on Saturday.

""And it's why we need to stand up and fight for a fair deal, a new deal, for Alberta in the Canadian federation.""

Kenney repeated during a campaign stop in Red Deer on Saturday an earlier pledge to hold a referendum on federal equalization payments if his party wins the provincial election on April 16.

Dave Chidley/CP Alberta Premier Rachel Notley makes an announcement in Calgary on March 19, 2019.

Kenney last week said a UCP government would hold a referendum on equalization on Oct. 18, 2021 — the same date as the next municipal elections in Alberta — if what he dubs the ""no more pipelines'' law hasn't been mothballed, and if there is still no progress on pipelines.

Kenney further says if he becomes premier, he would also call for Ottawa to cut federal income tax for Albertans equal to the amount of the Canada Health Transfer and Canada Social Transfer.

He says that would allow Alberta to raise its tax rates to give Albertans more control over their own money.

NDP Leader Rachel Notley, who spoke at a campaign rally in Edmonton on Sunday, noted she compelled the federal government to buy the stalled Trans Mountain project to keep it alive.

""Pipeline, pipeline, pipeline. That is two more times saying the word pipeline than Mr. Kenney did in the House of Commons in the 10 years that he was representing Alberta in Ottawa,"" Notley told the rally, referring to the UCP leader's time as a federal cabinet minister under former prime minister Stephen Harper.

""We led the largest pipeline campaign across Canada and we have made the need to build pipelines a majority opinion across this country, including in British Columbia.""

Pipeline, pipeline, pipeline. That is two more times saying the word pipeline than Mr. Kenney did in the House of Commons in the 10 years that he was representing Alberta in Ottawa. Rachel Notley

On Sunday, Kenney further pledged a UCP government would seek to form federal and provincial agreement on resource corridors to create pre-approved, guaranteed land corridors for Canadian products.

He also said the UCP would demand an exemption for Albertans to the stress tests recently imposed by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, and would create an Alberta parole board.

Notley, meanwhile, repeated accusations Sunday that Kenney's proposed rollback of corporate tax increases was a giveaway to profitable corporations. She also summarized the UCP's first week of the campaign, where a candidate resigned over online comments she reportedly made about white nationalists, and her replacement was accused of calling for wives to obey their husbands.

""In all fairness, in responding to this, Mr. Kenney did say, listen, he wasn't aiming for perfection with his candidates. Well, Mr. Kenney, mission accomplished,"" Notley said to cheers from the crowd.

She promised an announcement Monday on child care.

Also Sunday, Alberta Party leader Stephen Mandel promised to introduce a single provincial identification card that would replace the current drivers' licences, health cards, provincial ID and the card necessary for buying hunting and fishing licences.

Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners Want Justice? Then Let the Youth Lead When The Tyee’s Katie Hyslop won a major honour, here’s how she used the platform it provided.

But as one of this country’s digital journalism pioneers (I founded a popular online investigative news site called Public Eye before such ventures became fashionable), I believe those woes may have as much to do with whether Canadians actually want news about their own country, and whether newsrooms have not just the resources, but also the willingness, to produce such stories.

And unless we treat those afflictions, no amount of money will turn our news industry around.

In fairness to the politicians and bureaucrats who decided to dole out $595 million over five years to support Canadian journalism, many of their potential beneficiaries are also convinced that the bottom line in solving the country’s news media crisis can be found in their own bottom lines.

For example, two years ago, Public Policy Forum president Edward Greenspon, the former editor-in-chief of the Globe and Mail, released a government-contracted study called The Shattered Mirror.

It stated that “journalism’s economic model has collapsed, profoundly and structurally.” As a result, it recommended government measures to “strengthen the economic sustainability” of the news media and “promote civic-function journalism and digital innovations.”

That’s fine, as far as it goes.

But there often seems to be an assumption that Canadians actually want public interest news about our country, in other words news about economic, environmental, health, political and social issues taking place within its borders. This is the product journalists have a societal mandate to produce. It’s the most important thing we do. And it’s easy for journalists and politicians to assume there is a demand for it because we associate with people who want it — from sources and existing audiences (such as you, dear reader) to supporters and lobbyists. But what about other Canadians?

I’ve found it difficult to answer that question with any certainty. Most of the data I’ve come across concerns how often Canadians consume the news rather than the kind of news they actually consume.

But what we do know is that, when the Canadian Election Study surveyed over 7,500 people in 2015, more respondents correctly remembered the last name of Russia’s prime minister (62.8 per cent) than they did Canada’s Governor General (20.2 per cent), its finance minister (17.2 per cent) and even the premier of their own province (60.1 per cent). This suggests many of us are not routinely reading, listening to and watching news about Canada’s affairs of state.

Moreover, why should we? Because of party discipline, which forces most provincial and federal elected representatives to vote the way their leaders tell them to rather than the way we might want them to, Canadians have little power over what happens in government between elections. That means there’s little reason to pay attention to public interest during those years. Indeed, paying attention could easily lead to feelings of impotence. And that’s not much of a foundation for a news industry.

Even if Canadians wanted public interest news about their own country, journalists often don’t have the information to produce such stories. Most of what happens in government happens in private, with its officials and the information they have about our country under lock and key.

What happens in public is just for show: an expensive political theatre meant to convince Canadians that we live in a democracy. And it’s exceedingly difficult for journalists to peak behind the theatre’s curtain. The sources we’re forced to deal with are political hacks or flacks who are trained to spin rather than tell the truth. Leaks are few and far between. And our freedom of information laws sometimes do more to fortify the government’s secrecy than challenge it — to say nothing of the information immunity enjoyed by Canadian corporations.

The upshot is a lot of newspapers, news sites and news broadcasts run too many shallow, uninteresting stories that only tell us what our leaders want us to know. That’s not public service. That’s propaganda.

Finally, even if newsrooms did have the information to produce public interest stories, are they willing to do that work?

The Shattered Mirror never addressed this question. But The Uncertain Mirror, the 1970 Senate committee report that was initiated by Red Chamber member Keith Davey and inspired the newer report’s name, did. It stated “a great many, if not most” Canadian newspapers printed news releases “intact,” seldom extend their coverage “beyond the local trout festival,” and haven’t “annoyed anyone important” in years.

“Their city rooms are refuges for the frustrated and disillusioned, and their editorial pages are a daily testimony to the notion that chamber-of-commerce boosterism is an adequate substitute for community service,” the report concluded.

My impression is that not nearly enough has changed in the ensuing 49 years. There are certainly some journalists and news outlets that could be described, in the words of the Davey report, as a “constant embarrassment to the powerful.” The late senator and his committee found them too. So if you’re one of those thin-skinned Canadian journalists who is reading this and thinking, “Actually, I do great work” or “I would do great work if only my editor/news director would let me,” you can assume I am referring to you. So if we see one another at a reception or conference I would probably never be invited to anyway, there’s no need for any awkwardness. You’re doing a bang-up job.

That said, too many journalists wouldn’t ever be described that way, nor would some want to be. I would even hazard there are those who would duck and cover if such words were even hurled in their general direction.

Instead, they and their similarly minded newsrooms continue to squander precious time and money covering stories based on news releases, news events and social media postings. And what passes for objective and unbiased reporting in those newsrooms too often amounts to little more than ensuring canned quotes from both sides of an issue are included in their coverage. The work and courage required to find the truth is abandoned as a result of overwork in some cases, laziness in others, and perhaps even outright fear.

If the government actually wanted to cure what ails news industry, here’s what it would do beyond providing fair financial support to established news outlets and startups alike — invest in teaching young people Canadian history, civic literacy and news literacy; loosen party discipline; reform our electoral system; and make it easier to access information held by governments and corporations.

In other words, create a demand for public interest news about our country and give journalists the information they need to produce it.

However most of these things, which would also be a boon to the civic health of our nation, are hard to do. They discomfort the comfortable. And they depower the powerful.

Instead, it’s easier for the government to pretend to be doing something meaningful, while journalists and politicians squabble over the details of the pretence.

Moe has no such problem. This week, the right ...","A budget 19 months in advance of the next provincial election campaign should be starting to give us a clue as to what that campaign will be about.

But it’s what we heard in Monday’s question period, rife with snarling over past arrests and political ties to radicalism, that really gave us a clue as to what the October 2020 provincial election campaign may be like.

Scott Moe and Ryan Meili may not personally dislike each other. But it’s pretty clear the Saskatchewan Party and NDP don’t share much love.

And when the premier and Opposition get into issues like the yellow vest rallies, it’s only likely to fuel that political animosity until the writ is dropped.

Interestingly, the one whose image is likely to suffer the most from this is Moe, which makes one wonder why he wouldn’t see the wisdom of abiding by Meili’s reasonable request that the Saskatchewan government cut all ties to potentially image-harming elements like the yellow vest movement.

Why Moe wouldn’t do this anyway is confounding.

After all, the Sask. Party is an alliance of old PCs and Liberals, and keeping that alliance intact requires occasionally leaning at bit left, as they may have done in Wednesday’s budget.

While it’s a shoddy excuse for failing to always immediately denounce right-wing racism or other extremism, it can be argued that federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer may have to worry about bleeding far-right support to Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada. Moe has no such problem.

This week, the right thing for Moe would have been to at least start messaging that extreme views like the ones we are seeing on the yellow vest Facebook page are both unwanted and actually detrimental to the Sask. Party government’s central message that should be focused on the need for pipelines.

Instead, Moe opted to bicker with reporters whether Facebook messages on the yellow vest page — messages he said he hasn’t seen — were all that reflective.

In politics, when you are apologizing for extremist views that aren’t even really your own, you are losing.

Moe then made matters worse by tapping his designated political enforcer — in this case, Energy Minister Bronwyn Eyre — on the shoulder and sending her over the boards to do battle with Meili over his two-decade-old arrest at the 2001 Summit of the Americas in Quebec City.

One gets why there may be a burning desire in the Sask. Party ranks to paint Meili in the far left corner of Saskatchewan politics — a task eased by Meili’s own desire to hang around that corner, anyway.

So was it really all that necessary or advisable for Eyre to prattle on about Meili hanging around radically dangerous elements — the Sierra Club — at a legitimate public protest where people weren’t threatening harm? Should it have been all that tough for Jeremy Harrison — responsible for immigrant investment — to say this week the yellow vesters’ obsession with with the UN migration compact is a little deranged?

And how smart was it for Eyre to bring up Meili’s “criminal record” when Moe and few other backbench MLAs have a more lasting criminal record involving driving under the influence?

Sure, Eyre and company have had success at getting under Meili’s rather thin skin, evident in his complaints about the Sask. Party’s political ads. And, yes, it was maybe a little greasy of Meili to draw the longbow between Highways Minister Lori Carr and Rural and Remote Health Minister Greg Ottenbreit attending yellow vest rallies and those who would “celebrate” last week’s Christchurch attacks where a white suprematist gunned down 50 innocent people in New Zealand.

But in end, it was Eyre, Moe and the Sask. Party who came out looking the worst. If the Sask. Party is playing the long game, how did this help their own brand?

There again, maybe this is just what Saskatchewan politics is destined to be like for the next 19 months. Buckle up, folks.

Conservative Party of Canada seats in the ...","David Anderson figures he’s put around three-quarters of a million kilometres on a succession of vehicles, and flown a couple million more, over his 19-year career in federal politics.

Now, Saskatchewan’s longest-serving Conservative Member of Parliament — and one of just a few left from the Canadian Alliance days — says he won’t stand for re-election when Canadians go to the polls in the fall.

“We’ve put in six terms and at some point there’s a reason to go back to a normal life, particularly around family life,” Anderson said, adding that he spends about two-thirds of his time away from his wife, Sheila.

“It’s time that we started living our life together, not apart, and really enjoying our time together.”

Anderson was first elected to represent Cypress Hills — Grassland in 2000, and was re-elected with wide margins in five subsequent elections. In 2015, he won more than 25,000 votes, good for 69 per cent of the total.

In an interview on Monday, the veteran MP — among current members, only Liberal Ralph Goodale has held a Saskatchewan seat for longer — said he is most proud of the role he played in dissolving the Canadian Wheat Board.

At the time of the still-controversial decision, Anderson was Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture and the Canadian Wheat Board, a supporting role for former agriculture minister and Saskatchewan MP Gerry Ritz.

It is not immediately clear who will seek the nomination in the riding, one of the safest Conservative Party of Canada seats in the country. A party spokesman said the date for a nomination meeting has not been set.

“David — thank you for your dedication and your service to SW Sask and to the country. It has been an honour to work with you over the years,” Anderson’s friend, former Premier Brad Wall, said in a tweet on Monday.

Anderson, meanwhile, said he looks forward to spending less time on the road, but leaving public life behind won’t be easy.

“I don’t think anybody leaves easily. There’s a lot of really good things about this job; it’s an incredible privilege to be able to serve. So yeah, I expect there will be some days where it’ll be difficult, but it is the right thing … for us.”

Bottom line: Either ...,"Stephen Skyvington is on a mission to have an adult conversation about the dire state of health care in Canada and the need for revolutionary change.

Hired as manager of government relations by the Ontario Medical Association in 1995, Skyvington opened his own PR company PoliTrain Inc. in 2001 — he’s a lobbyist, consultant, pundit, veteran of the health care wars.

“Unfortunately, my detractors would have you believe I have a hidden agenda, that my goal is to foist on Canada a U.S.-style, two-tier health care system,” he quipped.

“The irony, however, is that if we continue to keep our heads buried in the sand like we have for the past 50 years, trying to prop up a system that simply isn’t sustainable, then we’ll indeed end up with exactly what our neighbours to the south have: a health care system that’s a bloody mess.”

In his new book, This May Hurt A Bit: Reinventing Canada’s Health Care System, Skyvington concludes it is time to properly fund Medicare or “free it,” citing the long-running Cambie constitutional trial as a potential watershed moment that might prompt the long-needed transformation.

Or not.

With the face of the challenge, Dr. Brian Day, founder of the private Cambie Surgery Centre and a former president of the Canadian Medical Association, supplying a cheerleading foreword, Skyvington offers a 200-odd-page indictment of the current health care system.

He has nothing but scorn for the present crop of politicians — too mealy-mouthed to tell the truth and too spineless to act.

“Remember those kids who used to sit at the back of the classroom?” Skyvington asked. “The troublemakers? The slow learners? The social misfits? Well, guess what? They’re the ones in charge now.”

In his view, the most vulnerable are put at risk and governments dodge responsibility.

“The solutions are seen in best practices of the many countries that deliver universal care far more effectively and efficiently than we do in Canada. Governments have, with the support of special interest groups, abrogated their duty to care for patients,” Skyvington said.

He pointed to Walid Khalfallah, from Kelowna, a paraplegic thanks to his encounter with the health care system.

“All because those running the show felt it was a reasonable risk for a young boy of thirteen to wait 27 months — that’s right, I said 27 months — for surgery on his spine. By the time Walid had the surgery in 2012, at Shriners Hospital in Spokane, Wash., it was too late.”

Young people better pay particular attention, he warned.

“Baby boomers like me will get $4,000 more health care services than we pay for in our lifetime through taxes, Millennials will pay $18,000 more in taxes than in services received for health care, and the iGens will pay $27,000 more in taxes than in services received because we are always paying for our parents, the generation ahead of us,” Skyvington said.

“The problem is there are too many of us (baby boomers), not enough of the iGens and Millennials, plus they have all this school debt, they’re working two jobs, they’re living in their parents’ basement instead of having a house and building equity.”

How many ministries of health do we currently have in Canada?

“Believe it or not,” he fumed, “the answer is 14! Ten provincial, three territorial, and one federal. Each province and territory has a health minister and a health ministry chock full of civil servants, most of whom never see a patient. That’s a hell of a lot of dollars being spent on things other than frontline patient care.

“How much sense does it make to have all these different ministries negotiating separate deals with Big Pharma? Is it any wonder the cost of prescription medicines is eating up so much of our health care budgets?”

With all the surety of a scientist lamenting climate change, Skyvington is convinced Medicare’s doomsday is around the corner.

“We’re going to have a U.S.-style, two-tier system by 2030 because that’s what happens if we don’t make the changes I’m talking about now.”

He identified three treatment “tsunamis” — diabetes, obesity and dementia — that will swamp the system.

Introduced in 1968, Medicare is showing its age and there is not enough money to keep it from collapsing under its own weight, Skyvington explained.

Canada’s population has more than doubled — from 18.2 million in 1961 to 36.6 million in 2017 — while per-capita spending on health care increased more than 60 fold: From less than $100 per person in the early 1960s to a whopping $6,604 in 2017.

Even with all that money, there are historically long queues for care: Nearly a million patients waiting for treatment in 2016 lost $1.7 billion in wages alone.

Skyvington has a program of 10 solutions, but his book’s strength is not so much his prescription but his etiology and diagnosis.

And he hopes his analysis will spur a realistic discussion: “We have a bad insurance scheme masquerading as a working health care system, a system that is broken and unsustainable because it wasn’t built right in the first place.

“The reality is it puts the vulnerable and disadvantaged in our society in a much worse place than if we actually had a hybrid system. The government should either properly fund health care or — if they can’t or won’t — free it.”

In 2017, he said the Fraser Institute released a report estimating that some 63,000 Canadians traveled abroad for medical care, a 40-per-cent hike from 2016.

“The rich don’t need a second tier,” Skyvington noted. “They already have one. It’s called America.”

Australia, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, and Switzerland all provide universal health care, he said. Unlike Canada, none prohibits user fees or ties the funding of health care to “some kind of sick, perverse ideal of patriotism.”

Instead, each expects patients to share in the costs of health care and imposes either deductibles, co-payments or both on everyone except the poor and most vulnerable.

“If Canada’s health care system is so good, so worth fighting for and preserving, then why hasn’t anyone else copied what we’re doing?” he asked.

“The answer, my friend, is simple: Our system sucks. While we’ve been standing around for the past 50-plus years, admiring our collective navels, everyone else has been embracing not the status quo but change. Real change. Real innovation. Real solutions for an ever-evolving world.”

He hopes to make the crisis a key campaign issue this fall. “We haven’t talked about health care during an election for years. It’s high time we did. This is catastrophic. Bottom line: Either we accept this new reality and change or we’re doomed.”

This is likely the Liberals' way of stating that the deal is damaging for many agricultural sectors ...","Most people expected an electoral budget, and that is exactly what Canadians got. For the agrifood sector, the budget was underwhelming at best, and provided little hope for the near future.

Let's start with supply management. It was interesting to see that the Liberals opted to do exactly what the Harper government did in the middle of an election campaign, back in 2015. At the time, the Conservatives hastily announced an out-of-nowhere $4-billion compensation package for supply-managed sectors, amid signing the defunct Transpacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, now known as Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). As in 2015, the Liberals provided no hint as to how they intend to make our supply-managed sectors more competitive in the future. Monies will be allocated based on speculation and presumptions, just to buy peace, since no timeline for the compensation was provided.

This time, the sum of $3.9 billion in funding is budgeted, which includes $2.15 billion in direct compensation. The sum also includes another $1.5 billion for a Quota Value Guarantee Program that would be applied on an on-demand basis when the quota has been sold. In other words, Canadians will be acquiring quotas back from farmers, initially given out years ago, and at no charge. The motivation to procure votes in Quebec for the upcoming election was extremely obvious. To do this right, the budget should have also looked beyond supply management, to support other sectors that are also negatively affected by trade.

So, this is the path chosen by the Liberals. We get to keep an outdated system while subsidizing farmers who have prided themselves for years on not accepting public subsidies. Compensating farmers without a plan for the future of supply management is the worst possible scenario for everyone, starting with the farmers themselves. They will only see their sector shrink further, especially in dairy, and many more farms will disappear with no strategy for less populous regions in the country, like the Prairies and the Atlantic. This will be a slow and painful way to go.

Nothing is planned for other commodities, including canola, pulses and others, affected by quasi-embargoes and trade disputes. There is a small budget, at least, set aside for African Swine Fever, a disaster-in-waiting for our hog sector. It is just a matter of time before the disease hits North America. Once it does, we'll need to brace ourselves for another mad cow type of scenario.

What was interesting is that the compensation program does not extend to concessions made under NAFTA 2.0, also known as the United States, Mexico and Canada Agreement. This is likely the Liberals' way of stating that the deal is damaging for many agricultural sectors and therefore stands little or no chance of being ratified. This is as good an admission as we will get from the Liberals, and we should not expect more. It is also probably the only thing which made sense for the agrifood sector in this budget.

Some provisions were made for a food strategy. If Canada wants to make good on the aspirations of our newly-minted Food Guide, our agricultural landscape will need to change, and follow a new, much needed strategy. We need more fruits and vegetables in this country. However, a budget of $134 million over five years toward this end is hardly anything. Quebec, a province with a population of under nine million and which has just adopted its own food strategy, is spending more than double that sum, in this year alone.

Our food processing folks, who represent the largest manufacturing sector in the country, were given peanuts. The budget plans to award $100 million to support innovation and plant upkeep projects. Given that the cradle of food innovation has always been food processing, that sum is almost insulting to the 250,000 people working in this sector.

A total of $24 million is dedicated to food fraud, in support of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)'s effort to crack down on the cheaters. It is estimated that food fraud is costing our agrifood sector anywhere between $10 to $30 billion a year. This problem is massive, so the CFIA needs all the help it can get.

For agrifood, this budget regrettably doesn't accomplish much, other than admitting that the USMCA trade agreement was a bad deal. But everyone knew that already. For the rest, the budget feels like the Liberals, an urban-focused government, are simply checking boxes to please a sector that it barely understands. But Canadians are smarter than that.",Federal budget leaves Canada’s agrifood sector with worst possible scenario,The Hamilton Spectator,https://www.thespec.com/opinion-story/9235612-federal-budget-leaves-canada-s-agrifood-sector-with-worst-possible-scenario/

By Keith Currie, President, Ontario Federation of Agriculture

There’s something in this year’s federal budget for everyone, at least that’s the government’s intent ahead of a federal election this year. The good news for Canadian agriculture is the emphasis on food, developing a food policy and new school food programs. Dedicated funding support for farmers in supply managed sectors in response to recent trade agreements and the promise of rural broadband also highlight the 2019 budget announcement for farmers.

Listen here:

The Ontario Federation of Agriculture (OFA), along with the Canadian Federation of Agriculture (CFA) submitted budget recommendations outlining what we believe the agri-food sector needs to be competitive and sustainable. A number of these requests were included in the March 19 budget announcement.

Food security is a must for Canadians and the budget allocation to create a National Food Policy is a welcome promise. OFA is especially encouraged by the 3-year agricultural immigration pilot that will help address year-round agricultural labour shortages, the development of a national school food program and a $25 million commitment to a buy Canadian promotional campaign that are all included in the proposed strategy. A National Food Strategy is a landmark announcement for Canadian agriculture and together, OFA and CFA will be working directly with the federal government to understand how this program will be implemented in support of the whole agri-food sector.

OFA maintains rural access to reliable, high-speed broadband is a must. The federal budget announcement unveiled a plan to implement targets of 95% of Canadians to have high speed internet by 2025 and 100% by 2030. As likely the last 5% to get the service, many farmers and rural communities are looking at another 11 years before being able to actively participate in the digital age. This is not acceptable and defies the real economic potential of rural Ontario.

The $3.9 billion allocated to assist supply managed sectors responds to the market access concessions made through recent trade agreements signals the federal government understands the significant impact our farmers make to the Canadian economy. This monetary support is meant to sustain the incomes of eligible dairy, poultry and egg farmers. While this revenue recovery announcement is good news, relief for those farmers affected by the US-China trade war is missing from the federal budget. It’s hard not to look south of the border where US grain farmers are receiving billions in compensation from their government and not ask Canada’s leaders why they aren’t supporting Canadian farmers.

The housing initiatives aimed at housing affordability and incentives for first-time home buyers will appeal to many Canadians. However, OFA is concerned the real impact of these incentives will see a rise in housing prices in areas where very limited housing supply is already an issue. The housing crisis in Ontario’s Golden Horseshoe will only get worse. OFA maintains the best solution to help Ontarians realize home ownership and alleviate the housing crisis is to enable opportunities across Ontario. Investment in rural areas including realistic broadband targets will create jobs, attract new residents and see our communities outside of the Greater Toronto Hamilton Area flourish.

OFA believes some of the 2019 budget investments in Canadian agriculture will see economic returns for all Canadians. Many budget details have yet to be determined but together, OFA and CFA will work closely with government to ensure effective policies and programs are implemented that will benefit our agri-food sector, one of Canada’s largest economic industries.",OFA: Federal election budget fuels investments in agri-food,Blackburn News,https://blackburnnews.com/agrimedia/commentaries/2019/03/25/ofa-federal-election-budget-fuels-investments-agri-food/

After the court case is ... top two candidates in last October’s mayoral election. In its own presentation to city council ...","A case that has implications for the cost and distribution of electricity in eight Northwest Territories communities, including the capital Yellowknife, is now in the hands of a judge.

The N.W.T. Supreme Court case is part of an ongoing battle by the town of Hay River to transfer Northland Utilities’ power distribution franchise for the town to the Northwest Territories Power Corporation.

The town made the decision to switch three years ago but, so far, breaking up with Northland has been complicated and costly.

And promises of rate reductions — the whole point of the switch — have softened since the town decided to go with NTPC.

In a joint press release issued that day, March 3, 2016, the corporation and town council stated unequivocally the switch would result in an overall reduction of 20 per cent on electricity bills.

A few months later, Louis Sebert, the minister responsible for the corporation, told CBC the price of power with NTPC as distributor was “somewhat of a moving target, but we’re optimistic that once this process is concluded, rate payers in Hay River will see significantly lower power rates.”

In an email last week, an NTPC official said the corporation “continues to believe it can provide lower overall rates in the town of Hay River than the current distributor.”

The power corporation refused CBC’s requests for an interview for this story, saying the town was in the best position to comment on the corporation’s involvement and its ability to deliver on the 20 per cent reduction.

The town did not respond to CBC’s requests for an interview.

Deal-breaker

The central issue Justice Andrew Mahar must decide in the case is how to set a price Hay River must pay to get out of its franchise agreement. Under the agreement, the town must buy all of the infrastructure (power poles, transformers, buildings, vehicles, etc.) that are part of Northland’s distribution system.

Northland is challenging an arbitrator’s decision to allow Hay River to pay market value, plus a 30 per cent premium to recognize the business revenue Northland would lose through the transfer.

“The decisions of the arbitrator are entirely inconsistent with what the case law says,” said the company’s lawyer in court last week. Loyola Keough said one example of that inconsistency was taking into account the cost impact on the town and its ratepayers, “which the courts have said is not relevant.”

Northland argues the price the town should pay is how much it would cost to build a brand new system — including everything from constructing new buildings, transporting and installing generators, and the cost of setting power poles and stringing lines — less depreciation. That method yields a figure of about $40 million, almost three times what the arbitrator suggested.

The lawyer for Hay River said there is nothing in the court decisions Northland referred to that suggests the method it’s proposing is the one that should be used.

Thomas Marriott said using Northland’s formula would render the clause allowing the town to buy out of the agreement meaningless.

“Is it appropriate to say: ‘you have the right to purchase those assets but, if you do, you have to use this methodology that requires you to pay three times book value?'” Said Marriott.

“Why would anybody exercise that right? That has no practical application.”

The town has said if the court decides Northland’s methodology must be used, it will not terminate the franchise agreement.

Whatever the judge decides, Northland will continue distributing power in Hay River for the foreseeable future. Each side has the right to appeal any decision to the N.W.T. Court of Appeal and, after that, the Supreme Court of Canada.

After the court case is decided, the public utilities board will have to approve the cost, the transfer of the franchise agreement and the setting of new rates, if any, for the town.

Other cities to come?

In a presentation to Yellowknife city council earlier this year, NTPC said part of its three-year strategy is to complete the merger of its generation and distribution functions in Hay River and pursue more distribution franchise opportunities.

The only other power distributor in the N.W.T. is Northland, which delivers power to homes and businesses in Yellowknife, Ndilo, Enterprise, Fort Providence, Samba Ke, Wekweti and Kakisa, as well as Hay River.

Yellowknife is the biggest distribution franchise in the territory and one Northland has held for decades. It generates about $45 million in revenues annually.

The city’s franchise agreement with Northland expires on Dec. 31, 2020. Reducing the cost of power (the N.W.T. has the highest in the country) was a campaign commitment of the top two candidates in last October’s mayoral election.

In its own presentation to city council, Northland pointed out that the money it pays to NTPC to purchase the power it distributes in the city accounts for 77 per cent of the price Yellowknifers pay.

Another cost is the $1 million franchise fee Northland pays the Corporation of the City of Yellowknife annually, a cost that is passed on to residents and businesses in their monthly power bills.

Northland says the best system for Northerners is one in which it and the power corporation combine forces. It says that will reduce duplication and, ultimately, lower costs to customers.

Others, including previous ministers responsible for the power corporation, have suggested another way would be to eliminate Northland — and the need to return a profit to its shareholders.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau has promised the budget will contain help for workers in need of skills training, young people looking to buy their first homes, seniors worried about their own finances, and patients with high drug costs.

“It’s an election budget … There’s been a tendency to use these as important communications vehicles – almost platform-launching vehicles,” Kevin Page, Canada’s former parliamentary budget officer, said in reference to recent budgets from federal and multiple provincial governments.

The likelihood that the Liberals will use the budget to sell their own record raises a question: who deserves credit for Canada’s strong economic run?

Job-creation numbers have been solid and the unemployment rate has fallen close to a 40-year low. A recent Statistics Canada report said in 2017 fewer Canadians were living under the official poverty line than at any time in the last decade. The agency credited the drop to a mix of a stronger economy and the Liberals’ enhancement of child benefits.

Canada rode a long stretch of impressive economic growth until the final three months of 2018 before it abruptly decelerated – and nearly stalled – along with a drop in oil prices. Experts predict the economy will regain its momentum over the coming months.

But even with a surprisingly weak end to 2018, Ottawa’s financial situation is better than last November’s fall fiscal update projected.

Experts say the federal treasury pulled in more tax revenues than anticipated. Many fully expect the Liberals to dedicate the bulk of the extra money to new promises, as they’ve done with windfalls in past budgets and economic statements.

Over the last few years, the Liberals have spent billions more than they promised in their 2015 election platform.

[RANT] Trudeau’s deficits: Short-term gain, long-term pain

They vowed to post annual deficits of no more than $10 billion and to return to balance by 2019. Instead, they’ve posted shortfalls of more than $18 billion in each of the last two years and have offered no timeline to balance the budget. In their November update, the Liberals projected annual deficits of between $18.1 billion and $19 billion over the next three years.

Morneau has regularly argued that the Liberal plan is working.

“Our government has made smart and responsible investments in the middle class, and Canadians are seeing concrete results,” Morneau told the House of Commons last month as he announced the budget date.

Morneau has argued the bigger-ticket commitments, in areas such as child benefits and infrastructure, have been necessary to juice the economy for years to come. He’s also insisted the deficits remain small enough that they’re fiscally prudent.

Page expects the Liberals to take credit for the economic improvements and he thinks they deserve some recognition _ particularly for enhancing child benefits and an ambitious, expensive infrastructure plan, despite its slow start.

But he added Canada’s prospects have also been lifted by strong economic performances in the United States and the world as a whole.

Page said it’s difficult to know whether the Liberal deficits will actually raise Canada’s long-term growth or if they’ve mostly created a big, temporary bump in consumer spending, as the government has borrowed money and put it into Canadians pockets.

“You don’t have to be at balance. There’s nothing perfect about a zero (deficit) number in this environment,” said Page, who now heads the Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy think-tank at the University of Ottawa. “Having said that, we are adding to the stock of debt and that creates potential instability down the road and we’ll have less room to manoeuvre – and future generations, definitely, are going to pay higher interest costs on the public debt.”

The Opposition Conservatives, some economists and leaders in corporate Canada have criticized the Liberal deficits, especially because they’ve come during good economic times that are traditionally thought to be when governments should pay debt off.

“My concern is, and I’ve said this to him … privately and publicly, it’s not that you’re spending, it’s where you’re spending,” Goldy Hyder, CEO of the Business Council of Canada, said of his exchanges with Morneau. “You’re spending a lot on things that no one can really point to and can say (there’s a) direct line back to helping the economy.”

Hyder said he supported Morneau’s move last fall to use some fiscal space for new accelerated investment write-offs for businesses. He also applauds the Liberals’ commitment to invest in worker training and their earlier efforts on trade, immigration and child benefits.

But he insists there’s an urgent need for Canada to be more competitive on regulations and taxes if it hopes to avoid falling behind the rest of the world.","Liberal budget to applaud Canada’s economy, but who deserves credit?",plant.ca,https://www.plant.ca/economy/liberal-budget-to-applaud-canadas-economy-but-who-deserves-credit-182168/

As the imbroglio concerning Jody Wilson-Raybould, Jane Philpott and the Liberal government emerged, an immediate wave of sentiment broke across social media. The panicky message can be summed up: “In light of this scandal, Canadians will inevitably end up with an Andrew Scheer government.”

This type of thinking reflects a reductive historical and political fallacy that assumes Canadians have only two choices.

It also seems that many cannot distinguish the Conservative Party’s identity from that shaped under the tenure of Stephen Harper. The assumption that any conservative government is a right wing threat to Canadian civility seems baked into the perception of many who consider themselves progressive.

Actually it is too early at present to discern whether Scheer will discover electoral good sense and distance himself from the harder social conservative elements of his Conservative party as October’s federal election nears. From a historical perspective, however, the belief that a Liberal regime is automatically more righteous than a Conservative one is based on thin historical evidence.

There’s no doubt that over the past few weeks Justin Trudeau and his government have faced its worst crisis since the scandal caused by last year’s trip to India. This time, the government that self-brands as a champion of Indigenous reconciliation alienated its most prominent Indigenous cabinet minister. The fact that Jody Wilson-Raybould is a woman further tarnishes the brand of the self-described feminist Trudeau. However, my aim here is not to re-litigate the various depositions made by Ms. Wilson-Raybould, Messrs Butts, Trudeau or Wernick nor to debate the merits of Deferred Prosecution Agreements, but to provide some context about what this moment says about Canadian political culture.

Here are some basic, if inconvenient, historical facts:

Conservative governments under Macdonald introduced a national transportation system (the CPR) and under Bennett an incipient national broadcasting network (the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission). In 1960, the government of conservative John Diefenbaker passed a Bill of Rights that allowed Indigenous people on reserves to vote in federal elections – this 93 years after Confederation. In 2008 with the encouragement of Indigenous leaders, the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, and the late Jack Layton, Stephen Harper apologized in parliament for Canada’s national shame – the system of residential schools that had been maintained for decades by Conservative and Liberal governments in concert with Christian churches.

In 2015 Justin Trudeau famously proclaimed his “sunny ways” which he attributed to the example of Liberal prime minister Wilfred Laurier. Laurier’s ways were not entirely sunny. His government championed the settlement of the Canadian west with an Indigenous policy of aggressive civilization featuring passes controlling movement and residential schools as central planks of a programme of assimilation and removal of First Nations peoples. Laurier’s powerful western minister Clifford Sifton oversaw an expansion programme based on marginalizing Indigenous peoples. Canadian manifest destiny was in firm Liberal hands. Laurier was often pragmatic and the economic interests of some Canadians were at the top of his mind.

It is also perhaps timely to remind readers that the consolidation and hardening of colonial Indian policy under The Indian Act was achieved by Liberal prime minister Alexander Mackenzie in 1876. Distinguished historians such as Olive Dickason, Jim Miller, John S. Milloy, Ian McKay and Brian Titley have documented that with The Indian Act, the fledgling Canadian state launched a vigorous assault on First Nation rights executed by various governments for decades. Rights articulated by the Royal Proclamation of 1763 and practiced in pre-confederation military and trading alliances were swept aside as the new liberal state expanded westward.

At his press conference of March 7, the Prime Minister evoked his father’s devotion to justice. Given the circumstances, that may have struck some as tone deaf. Many Indigenous people associate his father with the introduction of a 1969 White Paper on Indian Policy that would have completed Canada’s assimilationist project; it was also the Trudeau Sr. government that with questionable evidence extradited Leonard Peltier, where he remains in a Florida prison. Yet Justin Trudeau chose to compare himself to his father over matters of justice during a crisis involving two MPs most closely associated with justice and First Peoples.

Nor was Pierre Elliott Trudeau a model feminist. His Liberal government legislated severe restrictions to access to abortion and participated in the prosecution of Dr. Henry Morgentaler as he championed better access.

The current Liberal government can claim some success on progressive policies including the abatement of child poverty and the legalization of marijuana. On other files held dear by progressives, the Trudeau government has failed or simply changed course. Trudeau vigorously campaigned in 2015 on a promise of electoral reform, stating famously that that campaign would be the final “first past the post” election in Canadian history. After that plank – pilfered from the NDP – helped secure a majority, Team Trudeau abandoned the project early in its mandate.

The assumption that Liberals are more progressive also wobbles occasionally in the domain of foreign policy. Pierre Elliot Trudeau’s response to apartheid in South Africa was tepid compared to that of conservative Brian Mulroney. And didn’t Justin Trudeau himself recently apologize for the horrendous 1939 decision of Liberal prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King to bar the MS St Louis, a ship carrying Jewish refugees in flight from Nazism?

I am not building a case for conservative government rule. Nor am I suggesting every Liberal government including the present one is inherently benighted. I am questioning the assumption that Liberal government means progressive policies, or a different style of politics as the current prime minister expects Canadians to believe.

Many in the Canadian chattering classes seem to have decided that there is no alternative to Conservative or Liberal rule. This at a time when the people of Alberta, British Columbia and Québec have indeed found alternatives. The population of those provinces represents close to 50 percent of the entire Canadian populace. The NDP-Green alliance in BC, the NDP government in Alberta and the Coalition Avenir Québec government of François Legault belie the notion that Canadians have only two choices.

The assumption that only Liberals or Conservatives can rule federally seems to be most deeply held by some members of the media who routinely exclude commentary and proposals from the smaller parties, even when their caucus is sizeable, as is the case currently with the New Democratic Party.

The historical and journalistic amnesia regarding the NDP overlooks the decisive breakthrough that Jack Layton and Thomas Mulcair achieved in Québec which vaulted the party into official opposition status less than a decade ago. It remains to be seen whether current leader Jagmeet Singh can get his footing and make Québec an important battleground come October. If he does, that alone could make the difference between minority and majority rule. Needless to say, no meaningful historical or political analysis of modern Canada can underplay the contribution of the NDP’s predecessor the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in achieving Canadian social progress, especially accessible health care.

Justin Trudeau may have stemmed the negative tide of recent news surrounding his government. He will certainly campaign vigorously for re-election. Trudeau’s recent appearances have made that clear at least. Come October Canadians will likely judge him and his government in part on the residue of the SNC–Lavalin matter and the resignations of Wilson-Raybould and Philpott. Hopefully they will also recognize that a mature democracy such as Canada’s affords nuanced and diverse alternatives to Liberal hegemony.

What we will have to decide about in this election, is the fiction of slashing revenue to generate revenue, versus the reality of needing to build revenue to generate strength. We’ll also be witness ...","Premier Rachel Notley’s NDP clearly hopes to make Opposition Leader Jason Kenney’s character the ballot box issue for voters in the April 16 provincial election, but will the United Conservative Party’s scandals have as much traction now that the election writ has been dropped?

The risk for the NDP strategy, even if daily reminders of the UCP leader’s flawed character and his party’s problem with extremists continue, is that they will get lost amid the daily policy announcements both parties and their smaller rivals are bound to make during an election campaign.

For a government generally perceived to be campaigning from behind its principal challenger in popular support, the campaign didn’t get off to a bad start from the NDP’s perspective, with near simultaneous revelations that more fines had been levied in the UCP’s “Kamikaze Campaign” scandal and that a high-profile UCP candidate had been forced to quit the race after her apparent white supremacist views became known.

On Tuesday, the day Premier Notley called the election, the Office of the Election Commissioner announced that it had levied two additional fines related to Jeff Callaway’s UCP leadership campaign in 2017, which has come to be known as the “Kamikaze Mission,” so called in a leaked recording of UCP strategists talking because its intent was allegedly not to win, but to knock off Mr. Kenney’s main rival, former Wildrose Party leader Brian Jean.

The two $4,000 administrative penalties were levied against one Darcy McAllister. One was for contributing funds to the Callaway campaign that were furnished by another person, the other for “furnishing $4,000 to Maja McAllister, for purpose of making contribution to Jeff Callaway.”

The same day, it was learned that Caylan Ford, a star candidate personally recruited by Mr. Kenney to run in the Calgary-Mountain View riding had abruptly pulled out of the race after a progressive news site revealed she had complained that white supremacist terrorists are treated unfairly by the media compared with Islamic terrorists.

According to the report in Press Progress, Ms. Ford also expressed anxiety about “the replacement of white peoples in their homelands” and mused about the violent collapse of Western civilization as a result.

Since then, her uncomplimentary views on LGBTQ Pride Parades have also come to light. They are “a celebration of vice and transgression,” she opined, asking: “What are the redeeming values?”

Well, so much for the Caylan Ford campaign, for the moment anyway.

This in turn prompted an understandable debate on social media about Mr. Kenney’s own views, particularly on race and LGBTQ rights, and, whatever they are, what it is about the UCP that seems to attract such characters from the dark fringes of the right.

And the evening and the morning were the second day.

No time like an election to talk politics? Not at the U of A!

One would think there’d be no time like an election to talk about politics, especially at a university

But as it turns out, not everyone agrees. Leastways, certain folk appear to be uncomfortable with the idea of a brisk discussion that might lead to a critical consideration of the consequences of implementing some of the policies being proposed by the Opposition in the upcoming Alberta election.

A memorandum yesterday from the director of the Chester Ronning Centre for the Study of Religion and Public Life at the University of Alberta’s Augustana Campus in Camrose, for example, announced that a coffee and conversation event about Alberta politics planned for today would be cancelled because … wait for it … an election has been called!

“As you probably know, yesterday an election was called in Alberta,” wrote an apologetic-sounding Ian D. Wilson to the centre’s friends and supporters. “Now that campaigning has officially started, the U of A President’s Office has asked all units at the University to ensure that our activities do not influence the election in any way.” (Emphasis added.)

Say what?

“The goal of this Ronning Centre event was to facilitate an informed discussion about the interrelationship of religion and politics in the Alberta context, not to influence anyone’s political position during the election season,” Dr. Wilson said. “But in this case, given the timing of the election call, we think it is best to follow the President’s advice with due diligence and to cancel the event.”

Hmmmmm. For those of you who think an election might be an ideal time to talk about politics and policy, perhaps the explanation is that U of A President David Turpin took enough of a beating from the UCP over that honorary degree for environmentalist David Suzuki last year.

Well, there’s no point beating him up again this time, as the former University of Victoria president has already announced he’ll be outta here after June 2020. So, whatever the reason for his typically Albertan excess of election caution, he’s only going to have to put up with one more typical Alberta winter.

Chester Ronning, after whom the centre is named, would certainly not have had a problem with a briskly critical discussion of policy during an election, especially the kind of policies put forward by the UCP.

Born in 1894 in Xiangfan, China, to Christian missionaries, Mr. Ronning graduated from the University of Alberta in 1916 and returned to China in 1922 to continue his parents’ mission. He came back to Alberta in 1927 to serve as principal of the Camrose Lutheran College, which occupied the site that is now the U of A’s the Augustana Campus. Like Dr. Suzuki, he was awarded many honorary degrees.

Mr. Ronning served Canada as a diplomat in China, Norway and India, and led an attempt to bring a negotiated end to the Vietnam War in 1966.

In politics, he was elected as a United Farmers of Alberta MLA in 1932 and served as leader of the Alberta branch of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, the predecessor to the NDP, from 1940 to 1942.

Provinces had asked the Liberals to find a way for the Canada Infrastructure Bank to finance work, and pressed for better co-ordination in spending to connect remote or rural communities.","OTTAWA — A one-time $2.2-billion windfall in the federal budget to help Canadian cities improve roads, bridges, highways and water systems won't become an annual tradition, Finance Minister Bill Morneau warned Wednesday, even in the face of what he acknowledged were problems getting the original projects off the ground.

Tuesday's multibillion-dollar top-up will double the money cities receive through the federal gas-tax fund, which sends money directly to municipalities each year.

The spending blueprint says the Liberals have approved more than 33,000 projects worth about $19.9 billion in federal financing under new and existing infrastructure programs, but also acknowledges spending has been slower than anticipated, including ""some jurisdictions being slower to prioritize projects.""

Morneau called out four provinces on Tuesday in explaining the Liberals' decision to use the gas-tax fund to kickstart more projects, naming Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, New Brunswick — provinces with conservative-minded governments that don't always co-operate readily with the federal Liberals.

Topping up the fund was the appropriate response, Morneau said Wednesday at a post-budget event in Toronto.

""We haven't been able to do exactly what we expected and that was the reason for the municipal infrastructure top-up,"" he said.

""What you shouldn't do is take this as a conclusion on how we will go forward, but what it is, is an important way for us to move forward now in getting some projects that are stalled going.""

Federal infrastructure funding is regularly subject to delays because funds only flow once receipts are filed, which causes a lag between when work occurs and money is paid out.

An internal analysis of the Liberal program pointed to several issues to explain the pace of spending: too many low-value projects requiring the same detailed review as those much larger in size and delays in getting provincial and territorial project recommendations.

Elections in Ontario and New Brunswick last year paused provincial project approvals during the campaign. There are also delays in approvals when a new government is elected — as was the case in Ontario and New Brunswick — as new office holders learn their files and review government operations.

Even more spending will flow through funds managed by the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. The federation's president, Mayor Vicki-May Hamm of Magog, Que., said the measures are a direct response to pleas from cities to modernize their relationship with Ottawa so they don't have to rely solely on the provinces.

Under the federal Liberal government's infrastructure program, federal spending will top $186 billion over the next decade.

How successful the plan has been to date is an area of contention between the Liberals and the parliamentary budget watchdog, who most recently questioned anew whether increases in federal spending have created the jobs promised by the government.

Other investments have, according to provinces, fallen short of what was required, particularly on rural broadband internet service. Provinces had asked the Liberals to find a way for the Canada Infrastructure Bank to finance work, and pressed for better co-ordination in spending to connect remote or rural communities.

The Liberals created the bank in 2017 to take $35 billion in federal financing and use it to leverage three to four times that from the private sector to help pay for major highways, bridges, and water and electrical systems. To get private money involved, projects needed to produce revenue streams — tolls, for instance. Fees for internet service are already typical, but serving remote, sparsely populated areas with high-speed lines is a financial challenge.

On Tuesday, the Liberals added a new component to the Crown agency, earmarking $1 billion over 10 years for rural broadband, but mandating the bank find at least $2 billion more in private capital for the initiative. It was part of a plan to deliver up to $6 billion over a decade to connect everyone in the country to high-speed internet by 2030.

Transcript:

James West: Charting Man Dan McDermott joins me now via Skype from Asheville, North Carolina, right, Dan?

Dan McDermott: That’s right, glad to be back!

James West: Yeah, it’s great to have you back. Dan, so today our theme is, you know, the outlook for cannabis stocks and the economy generally in the context of the 2020 elections, and you had some interesting hypotheses – theses, we’ll call them. Why don’t we start with that?

Dan McDermott: Sure. So it’s bigger-picture, you know, we’re looking 20 months out, and I’m told that in the US it’s a much bigger deal. We look a lot further ahead in the election than you do in Canada, and that’s probably because there’s billions of dollars doing their best to purchase the outcomes. But what we’re going to be looking for is, we clearly see that the stock market is a fan of Trump and Republicans. It’s been going up since he was elected, in a very big way.

So we can assume that if Trump is re-elected, the market is going to be, you know, continue to do well, continue to hold on. And that would be important for the MJ sector because, you know, I’m always talking about correlations to the S&P 500 and how big of an impact that does have on the sector as a whole.

But we can also look at the other side of things and say that if a Democrat were to win, that would be negative for the overall market in my opinion, and we can anticipate things are going to go down due to a number of reasons. You know, we have Democrats talking about reining in the biotech sector, reining in the big banks, reining in Citizens United, which allows Big Money to have influence on politics. So if that were to happen, we would anticipate the markets would go down.

But we can make the assumption that if a Democrat were to be elected, they are very likely to have a very pro-marijuana legalization platform as well. So we can assume that while the markets will be going down in a reaction to a win, we would see the MJ market start to thrive again, anticipating that we would get accelerated steps toward legalization. So it’s almost like the marijuana sector could be a hedge play to go bullish in, as the market pulls back if there were a Democrat elected.

Now, way too soon to look at polls or anything like that, but this is just broader picture, something to start wrapping our heads around as we get ready for 2020.

James West: Sure. So are you suggesting, then, that a Republican victory, while it will be good for a broader economy, would be less beneficial to the progress of cannabis de-prohibition in the US than would a Democrat win?

Dan McDermott: I would say so. I think it’s inevitable regardless; we’re just talking timelines, and I think a Democrat would probably be a faster timeline towards legalization, towards, you know, rescheduling, getting the banking sector involved, all of the key points that we need to see for the US MJ market to start to thrive. So it would be an accelerated version of what’s going to play out, if the Democrats were to pull out a victory.

James West: Sure. Do you think the scope and scale of the cannabis market in 2020 would be sufficient to offset the broader economic downturn that would be engendered by a Democratic victory, as they seek to bring debt and spending under control?

Dan McDermott: Not big picture, not as far as a whole market is concerned; but if we’re talking individuals, you know, my parents are of the age of entering retirement, and so I’m constantly wondering, you know, what are people that have retirement accounts going to be doing? And if we were to see a Democrat victory, it would be bad timing in the sense that, you know, their investments would probably be taking a hit while they’re already retired, while they’re relying on that money.

But if they make that hedge play and go into the MJ space, in my opinion, it will make the blow to their account a little bit less severe.

James West: Interesting. Okay, so one of the events in the cannabis space that I wanted to touch on is, we saw HEXO bought Newstrike. So that’s, HEXO was the larger company there, and Newstrike was the lesser company, but against normal traditions when that kind of thing happens, we saw that the acquiring company’s stock went up, as did the acquiree, which is contrary to the normal pattern of the acquiring company’s stock taking a hit in the short term until it actually ingests the smaller company.

Why do you think that the stock of HEXO rose on news of the takeover bid?

Dan McDermott: Well, I won’t take credit for John back there, but deal was done with no premium, and that’s significant, and usually you see a premium paid to the company, and that’s why, you know, people invest in these smaller companies hoping to get bought out. And this is a change from that norm, and it’s also a potential, maybe an omen for future companies, saying, wow, you know, we don’t have as much hype in the space; maybe those premiums are going to start shrinking a little bit, so maybe all these smaller companies, these smaller LPs that are looking for the potential of a buyout deal from a CGC or a bigger company, maybe they’re not going to get as good a deal.

So I think it has a bit of a ripple effect in terms of perhaps lowering expectations in terms of the premiums that smaller companies are going to receive in the near term future.

James West: Okay. All right, Dan, so what are we looking at, here?

Dan McDermott: So we’ve got CGC, this is a five to six week long pattern, and it’s just a tightening range, and if we were going to visualize this, it would be something along the lines of a pendulum, where the swings are getting smaller and smaller each time, and we’re going to reach what I call, this is an equilibrium pattern, and we reach a flex point where we literally can’t get any tighter. And when that pattern reaches that flex point and we get a clear break, we see a volume spike – so next week, we’re anticipating this pattern is going to break. And people that draw trendlines – I’m not much of a trendline-drawer myself, but if we were to do it here, you could just see visually it’s a tightening range that’s going to be forming.

So like I said, we’re anticipating a break next week. Here we are, coming down towards the support here, and the key levels to be watching: 43.71 on CGC as a support level, and our new resistance level that’s key is 48.01. So we’re going to see this range continue to tighten into next week; we’re going to see a volume spike somewhere along the lines of, oh, let’s say, 12 million-plus shares traded. Right now our 20-day average is about 7 million shares traded.

So the volume spike tells us the break is occurring, and we’re going to be looking for this break to dictate pretty much where we’re headed for April in terms of momentum. So I do believe, obviously, because this is the sector leader, in my opinion, that it’s going to have a significant impact on all the names in the sector. There will be some names that can, you know, go against the grain and do their own thing, but at a broader sense, this break of this CGC pattern is going to be really important for, again, end of March into April.

James West: Interesting. So the break that you’re speaking about, is this a sign that investors are getting sort of fatigued with the diminished performance potential as a result of this consolidation pattern, and that that’s going to cause some abandonment of the play?

Dan McDermott: One thing that we don’t do is, we don’t, you know, try and predict direction. So with these equilibrium patterns, they’re very common after a high volatility; so when we had this huge move back in January and February and we entered a new range, this is just price discovery; this is trying to find out, you know, where we stand, and so we’re not saying it’s going to be a bull break or a bear break, but we know a break is imminent. So if we get a bull break, we’re going to see shorts covered, and we’re going to see bulls pile on as we look to test the recent high of 51.81.

If we see a bear break, we’re going to see stop losses trigger, we’re going to see bears jump in, and there’s a lack of support down under 41.68, so we would potentially be looking to the upper $30 area as a target from there. So it really, it’s going to paint a completely different picture depending on which direction this break does occur.

James West: Wow. So I guess absent a fundamental catalyst, is it more likely, in your opinion, that we’re going to see a break to the downside, whereas if we do see something that would be considered fundamentally significant, that the break might happen to the upside?

Dan McDermott: I would say that the break right now is favoured to the upside for a number of reasons. Number one, the trend, just in the sense of where we are coming from: we’re coming off of a bull move, and this is a tightening pattern from that bull move. And Number two, the S&P 500 has really impressed me in terms of the resiliency of these bulls over the past three months since the December crash. They’ve held up extremely well, and we’ve got oil holding up extremely well. So until I see weakness in the S&P 500 or in oil, I’m not going to anticipate significant weakness in the MJ sector.

James West: Okay, do you have an S&P chart good to go, there?

Dan McDermott: Sure, we can pull it up. This is SPY, which is the ETF which tracks the S&P 500. Let’s clear up these lines. So just looking at the weekly time frame: again, the dump from December, we saw just a straight-up V-shaped recovery with no consolidation. We finally got the consolidation we were looking for, and it lasted all of pretty much one week, and just like that, the bulls are right back to the high of the bounce. So, holding on very strong, and at this point for me, we’re going to have to break the low of last week to see any kind of bearish momentum in this sector, or I should say in the markets as a whole.

So, 272.42 on SPY is a key level for me, and if we were to pull back into next week on SPY, back to the low 270s, that’s a scenario where I could foresee CGC breaking bearish. CRON is also at a pretty critical point in terms of coming up on a couple key supports: 19.50 and then down to 18.72, these are US numbers. But again, once these levels break, if they do break, there’s a lack of support immediately below those levels, just like there is on CGC. So bears could get a little bit of follow-through if it is indeed how it plays out.

James West: Uh-huh. Looking at the large cap cannabis companies, it seems like they’re all sort of falling into this pattern, this equilibrium pattern after the big spike in the first quarter of 2019. And is that more or less indicative of the potential for another summer downward drift absent sector-wide catalysts?

Dan McDermott: Yeah, we’re definitely looking for that. Seasonality has been a big part of the MJ sector for quite some time; we’ve talked about it on your show here in the past. So it is, I mean, and it’s almost a self-fulfilling prophecy to a certain degree, where this is the narrative that we’re seeing in chat rooms and in social media groups that are concerned with the sector. Just, you know, people are expecting that perhaps ‘sell in May, go away’ is going to be occurring in the space. and for a lot of names, I mean, it wouldn’t be a significant red flag if we were to see consolidation.

Just looking at CRON, the run that we saw back at the end of the year, I mean, we could pull back into the upper teens and still be just fine on a longer term picture with how significantly we have run. I mean, just looking back, we ran to 15.30; we gave back 50 percent of that move, and then saw a continuation. So if you are truly long term and you’re looking out, you know, three, five years plus, then weekly consolidation and a bear break of these daily patterns wouldn’t really be a major concern at this point.

James West: Wow, Dan, fascinating as per usual. I always learn so much when I’m talking to you. We’re going to leave it there for now; I’ll come back to you next week. Thanks so much for your input as usual.

Dan McDermott: Thanks, James. See you next time.",Charting Man Dan on the 2020 Election and Market Movers in the Cannabis Space,midasletter.com,https://midasletter.com/2019/03/charting-man-dan-2020-election-market-movers-cannabis-space/

THUNDER BAY – With an eye on this year’s federal election, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau found a friendly reception in Thunder Bay.

Trudeau capped his first visit to the city in nearly three years with a two-hour town hall style meeting at the CJ Sanders Fieldhouse on Lakehead University campus on Friday night, being joined by hundreds of mostly supportive city residents.

The prime minister fielded 17 questions from audience members, ranging from the environment, education, infrastructure and the economy.

Trudeau forecasted the environment and climate change as a potentially key election issue as his Liberals seek a second term while a coalition of provinces prepare to challenge a federally imposed carbon tax.

“There’s a few things we have to all agree on. I can’t believe I have to say this, but climate change is real and it’s a massive threat to our lives, our ecosystems, our well-being and our futures,” Trudeau said.

“Unfortunately, there are four provinces so far, coincidentally or not all led by conservative politicians including right here in Ontario, that refuse to move forward and put a price on pollution. They want to make pollution free again.”

Two of the environment-related questions also levelled criticism at Trudeau for last year’s decision to acquire the stalled Trans Mountain pipeline for $4.5 billion, with one person telling him that “climate leaders don’t buy pipelines.”

Trudeau responded that as long as the economy remains reliant upon fossil fuels, the government needs to ensure that Canadian oil can be sold at a fair price.

“Since we do have oil resources, the choices are putting them on tanker trucks, putting it on trains or putting it in a modern pipeline,” Trudeau said. “Pipelines remain the safest way to export our oil resources.”

While most of the questions hit on priority points for the Trudeau government, the prime minister could not dodge the SNC-Lavalin scandal that has resulted in the resignation of two cabinet ministers, a key staffer and the clerk of the Privy Council.

“You were saying how you were protecting the jobs. That’s been the common narrative, that you’re protecting the 9,000 jobs that SNC employs across Canada and in Quebec,” Michael Coccimiglio said. “Well, the SNC-Lavalin CEO said this week he never raised the issue of jobs with you and your team, yet that’s what everyone seems to be saying that’s the reason for all of this.”

That question drew a smattering of applause throughout the audience and launched Trudeau into a nine-minute answer, where he deflected the defections and took aim at the Conservatives for this weeks’ marathon vote in the House of Commons.

“Jody Wilson-Raybould, Celina Caesar-Chavannes and Dr. Jane Philpott have made decisions about their own positioning and their own perspective on this that I absolutely respect, but to a certain extent I disagree with,” Trudeau said.

“We have a situation where the Conservatives don’t even want to talk about (the budget) right now. They don’t want anyone else talking about it, so they’re trying to amplify this particular discussion.”

The crowd, which began filling the venue two hours prior to the start of the event, was largely appreciative of having the opportunity to share a room with the prime minister.

Meagan Harris, a Trudeau supporter in 2015, said she supports his government’s work with Indigenous people.

“I feel like he’s done a lot to focus on strengthening Indigenous relationships in Canada, which I think in our demographic is super important,” Harris said.

“I think it’s gotten better. For me personally, only under Trudeau’s government was my community (Missanabie Cree First Nation) granted their land back in June after 112 years.

Despite not being able to vote for another seven years, 11-year-old Parmida Akbari said she wanted to hear about the Trudeau’s plans for the upcoming election.

“I think that we should have a chance to understand what’s happening in our world,” she said. “I’m hoping to hear about his plan for the economy and about immigration.”",Upcoming election apparent during PM's town hall,Tbnewswatch,https://www.tbnewswatch.com/local-news/upcoming-election-apparent-during-pms-town-hall-1336746

(Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press) The federal government has promised to spend $700 million over the next 10 years for Canada’s North, with money coming for post ...","The federal government has promised to spend $700 million over the next 10 years for Canada’s North, with money coming for post-secondary education in the North, new infrastructure and Arctic research.

The budget, released Tuesday by Finance Minister Bill Morneau, is the fourth and last the Liberal government will table before the next federal election, set for October.

Overall, the budget delivers few big-ticket, signature programs but offers several programs targeting key electoral constituencies heading into the election campaign.

Across the North, the budget recommits to develop a new Arctic and Northern Policy Framework in consultations with Indigenous people and the Northern territories. But it doesn’t include a timeline for when that will be complete.

Here’s a breakdown with some of the other highlights for the territories.

Northwest Territories

One of the biggest individual spending promises for the Northwest Territories is $18 million over the next three years to start paying to expand the Taltson hydroelectric system.

That project is a key plank in the territory’s climate change plan, but the territory has long said it cannot pay for it without Ottawa’s help. Though there is not an up-to-date cost estimate, a 2014 business case priced the expansion at $1.2 billion.

Another $13 million has been promised for the Dechinta Centre for Research and Learning starting this year and continuing over five years to deliver a “culturally appropriate and community-developed curriculum.”

In addition, the government also recommitted to amending the Canada National Parks Act to legally establish the Thaidene Nene National Park Reserve.

In February, members of the Lutsel K’e Dene First Nation voted 89 per cent in favour of establishing the national park reserve.

Further reading: Small deficit projected in Northwest Territories budget

Nunavut

An addictions treatment facility has been promised for Nunavut, which has not had one in the territory for more than 20 years, according to budget documents.

Though the budget did not include a specific figure, that facility would be paid for through spending from the Nunavut government and other Inuit organizations.

The federal government also pledges to continue funding programs with Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, such as $50 million over 10 years for the Inuit Suicide Prevention Strategy, which was first announced in 2016. That is the exact figure Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami asked for in its pre-budget submissions.

The biggest news, I think, is the commitment for the addictions treatment facility in Nunavut. However, there isn't any money associated with it, and it seems contingent on funding from the Government of Nunavut, and ""Inuit partners."" pic.twitter.com/NHFpl7zqkk — Nick Murray (@NickMurray91) March 19, 2019

Overall, the budget lays out $286.2 million over five years in spending for Inuit-specific programs. That includes:

$125.5 million over 10 years for an Inuit-led post-secondary education strategy.

$50 million over 10 years to continue the National Inuit Suicide Prevention Strategy.

$220 million over five years for health and social services for Inuit children.

Environment and Climate Change Canada has also been promised $21.8 million over five years for the Eureka Weather Station on Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, for much-needed repairs at the Arctic research facility.

The federal government is also exploring creating a marine conservation area in the High Arctic Basin or Tuvaijuttuq, which is the last portion of the Arctic expected to retain summer sea ice until at least 2050.

In October, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association and the federal government signed an agreement in principle for a marine protected area for Tallurutiup Imanga, also referred to as Lancaster Sound.

Yukon

Yukon College has been promised $26 million over the next five years for a new science building on campus. This money is supposed to support the college’s transformation as “Canada’s first university in the North.”

The budget also recommits to return all direct proceeds from the federal carbon tax back to the Yukon and Nunavut governments. The Northwest Territories has already released its carbon pricing plan.

Northern Quebec: Makivik Corporation reacts to federal budget “In relation to Makivik’s mandate, today’s Federal budget announcement will help address issues related to the Inuit and the Arctic,” said Charlie Watt, president of Makivik Corporation, the land claims organization representing the Inuit of Northern Quebec, in a press release. Watt welcomes the budget’s funding for post secondary education, suicide prevention, health and social services for Inuit children and Indigenous languages, as well as a measure to forgive or reimburse land claim loans.

Having finally managed to deliver his last pre-election budget speech — which, as predicted right here in iPolitics AM, was delayed by more than hour, courtesy of a Conservative-led procedural protest maneuver that nevertheless failed to stop the clock on the release of the document itself, which was tabled by the minister shortly before 4 p.m., thus allowing the Liberals to spend the next 30 minutes touting the contents ahead of its official presentation to the House — Finance Minister Bill Morneau is off to Toronto for his now-traditional first post-budget breakfast appearance.

This year, he’ll outline his plan to “invest in the middle class” at an early morning event co-hosted by the Canadian Club Toronto, Empire Club of Canada and Toronto Region Board of Trade, which he’ll follow up with a Q&A with area reporters before returning to Ottawa for a “post-budget armchair discussion” with the Economic Club of Canada.

Back in the capital, meanwhile, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will “highlight” his government’s newly announced “First-Time Home Buyer Incentive” during an afternoon visit to Orleans.

First, though, he’ll join Liberal MPs for their weekly confab on the Hill — the first, it’s worth noting, since the resignation of former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott, who quit her post over concerns at how Trudeau and his team had handled the SNC-Lavalin controversy, but who, like former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, remains, at least for the moment, in caucus.

In the weeks since the departure of the two one-time senior front benchers, Trudeau has repeatedly stressed that it will be up to the caucus to collectively decide on their future within the Liberal ranks, which may or may not put it on the agenda for today’s discussions — which, of course, will take place far from the prying eyes and ears of the press.

Fear not, though: As is always the case on caucus day — and even more so when there’s the possibility of high drama behind closed doors — a full contingent of reporters will be stationed outside the West Block meeting room, ready and waiting with boom mics, cameras and a flurry of pointed questions for any MP who wanders within range.

Meanwhile, the Conservatives are hoping to shift the spotlight back to the former justice minister’s incendiary allegations of attempted political pressure to intervene in the criminal prosecution of the embattled Quebec engineering firm when they take temporary control of the Chamber this afternoon.

Last week, the party served notice that they intended to use their final opposition day of the winter supply cycle to call on Trudeau to drop any remaining constraints on Wilson-Rabould’s capacity to discuss the events that led to her resignation, a demand that the prime minister has thus far rebuffed.

That opposition motion was initially slated for Monday, but due to a last-minute change in programming, is now set to take place this afternoon, which, given the standard abbreviated Wednesday schedule, means that the Conservatives will have only a few hours to make the case for expanding the waiver to — as the now familiar chant goes — “let her speak.”

The Conservatives are also set to decide whether to launch the House into a voting marathon that could keep MPs in the Chamber until the wee small hours of the night — and possibly well into the next day — by triggering nearly 200 recorded divisions on the estimates, which, under parliamentary rules, must be passed by the end of the current sitting day.

Although the original plan was to use the estimates vote to delay the budget, the Liberals had sufficient warning to rejig the schedule to hold it today, but the threat of an overnight session is still very much in play — and entirely under the control of the Conservatives, who have vowed to use every available parliamentary tool to express their disapproval of the decision to shut down the House justice committee probe of the controversy.

Chelsea Carey's Calgary-based rink was officially eliminated in the penultimate round-robin draw on Friday when Japan beat China and Germany lost to Finland.

article continues below

Those results put an end to Canada's faint hope of earning the sixth and final playoff spot in the 13-team event before Carey's final round-robin game against Denmark on Friday afternoon.

Canada finished the event with a 5-3 win over Denmark's Madeleine Dupont later Friday. Canada, the U.S. and Japan all had 6-6 records, but the Japanese went through on tiebreakers.

""Obviously, we're gutted with the results and not making the playoffs here,"" said Carey, who also skipped Canada in 2016 with a different crew. ""But we did a lot of good things and it just didn't go our way. I'm proud of the girls, it was all their first time at this event, and they were incredibly composed.

""Everybody was calm, we supported each other, we did a lot of good things — it just didn't work out for us. So we wanted to come out strong tonight and finish on a positive note.""

Canada had won the last two world championships, with Ottawa's Rachel Homan in 2017 and Winnipeg's Jennifer Jones in 2018 running the table en route to a gold medal.

Carey's chances to advance were all but done after a 5-3 loss to reigning Olympic champion Anna Hasselborg of Sweden in the morning draw.

Two misses loomed large for Carey, third Sarah Wilkes, second Dana Ferguson and lead Rachel Brown.

In the seventh, Ferguson's takeout just rubbed on a guard, leading to a go-ahead deuce for Sweden.

In the eighth, Carey's hit-and-roll went inches too far and was second shot, forcing her to draw for one instead of scoring a possible deuce.

""We learned a lot of things, for sure,"" Wilkes said. ""It's a very long week — a similar number of games to the Scotties, but it's so different. Wearing the Maple Leaf is such an honour but it's heavy, too. So we know how that feels and it’s a learning opportunity for the future. Everyone tells you about it, but until you feel it, you don’t really know.""

The last time Canada missed the playoffs was 1999 when Colleen Jones (4-5) finished in a three-way tie for fifth place in Saint John, N.B.

The playoffs in Silkeborg will kick off Saturday at with Russia's Alena Kovaleva (9-3) playing Japan, and Switzerland's Silvana Tirinzoni (8-4) playing China's Jie Mei (7-5) in the first round.

Later Saturday, Sweden's Anna Hasselborg (11-1), who topped the round-robin standings, will play the lowest-ranked winner of the first-round games in one semifinal, while second-place Minji Kim of South Korea (9-3) will play the higher-ranked winner in the other semi.

44,,2019-03-22T04:33:00.0000000Z,Former Competition Bureau commissioner John Pecman notes a federal election is looming ... laws governing corporate competition reflect Canada’s outdated view of itself as primarily a ...,"Canadians like to believe they live in one of the most sophisticated free-market economies in the world. Don’t tell that to John Pecman. Until May of last year, Pecman was commissioner of the Competition Bureau, the agency responsible for enforcing laws against anti-competitive practices in the Canadian marketplace.

Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners Want Justice? Then Let the Youth Lead When The Tyee’s Katie Hyslop won a major honour, here’s how she used the platform it provided.

After he stepped down in September 2018, he published an article in the Canadian Competition Law Review that called for reforms to give the bureau more power to check corporate concentration, including added independence by separating it from the Ministry of Innovation, Science and Economic Development.

In a phone interview with The Tyee last week, Pecman elaborated, saying that federal laws governing corporate competition reflect Canada’s outdated view of itself as primarily a resource exporter and otherwise unable to compete with the big U.S. economy next door.

This led to laws favouring corporate consolidation in the name of “efficiency” over promoting competition or the interests of consumers.

The Competition Bureau he ran lacks the independence that would make it truly effective, he said — a vulnerability to political meddling that brings to mind other headline grabbing moments in Ottawa of late.

“Scarce enforcement resources” further erode the bureau’s ability to take initiative, he noted. The Trudeau government trimmed the bureau’s already strained budget to help cover a $950-million industry initiative called “superclusters,” says Pecman.

When it comes to not just studying market concentration but moving to break it up, says Pecman, Canada is “so far behind other western economies on this front. The fact that the country does not treat competition policy seriously is just a great disappointment to someone who has spent his entire life working in this area.”

Here is more of what Pecman, who spent 34 years at the bureau and now is senior business advisor at the nation-wide law firm Fasken, had to say...

On why it’s time to get the Competition Bureau out of the Ministry of Innovation, Science and Economic Development:

“If you look at any international body’s recommendations on institutional framework and design for competition authorities, the number one no-no is to be housed in the industry department that’s there supporting business, particularly [corporate] ‘national champions.’ Of course the industry department is probably the most lobbied department, so there’s the perception of political interference.”

On years of competition law foot-dragging in Canada:

“Competition law has been sort of shunned to the side, other than there were some serious amendments in 2010. I think particularly when you’re reading the papers today and [headlines reflecting] the angst about monopolies and IT giants, and corporate concentration and income inequality, we haven’t heard much from the government on any plans to study these issues.

“There have been calls outside of my requests from time to time to look at the law. For example, Carolyn Wilkins, the senior deputy governor at the Bank of Canada. During her speech this past year at the G7, she raised a concern about the growth of the IT giants and its impact on labour.”

On ‘scarce resources’ and ignored cases:

“Notably, on the abuse of [corporate market] dominance or consumer protection and deceptive marketing practices, particularly on the latter part, we receive more complaints than we have resources. We have to be careful, the bureau does, where to invest our scarce enforcement resources.”

On the big 2008 recommendation never enacted:

“If you are familiar at all with the competition review policy report done by L.R. (Red) Wilson [for the Canadian Council of Chief Executives] back in 2008... the largest recommendation that they made was to create an independent Canadian competitiveness council that would report to parliament that would do the advocacy and the policy work for competition. And that was not adopted by the previous government or this government.”

On how Canada lags behind other nations, hurting innovation:

“There is a huge gap. Most countries around the world have their competition authorities spending significant budgets to work in terms of promoting competition. In Canada, that’s just not the case. It depends on the discretion of the commissioner. There is no expressed authority to do it.

“To me, there needs to be some clarification of the importance of competition policy and advocacy in Canada with expressed authority to do that kind of work — whether it’s referred back to an independent competitiveness council to do the work or give the authority to the competition bureau. Someone has to do it.

“It’s hurting the competitiveness of the country not focusing on that, including the innovation agenda. The number one driver of innovation is competition.”

On why the Competition Bureau is ‘spinning its wheels’ because it can’t make regulations:

“We are so far behind other western economies on this front. It’s just disappointing. The fact that the country does not treat competition policy seriously is just a great disappointment to someone who has spent his entire life working in this area, knowing how powerful it is.

“Let’s take a good example — FinTech (Financial Technology). We engaged in a serious market study on the whole question of financial services technology. We put together a significant consultation and put out a report with 30 recommendations, including moving to an open banking system whereby consumers can move their banking data easily to competitors, whether it’s FinTechs or other banks, to facilitate competition, lower prices, better services.

“The government, in its last speech in the throne, identified this as important and in finances started to look at the issue.

“But in England, their competition authority did a robust market study because [unlike Canada] they can compel information from companies. Then it issued regulations. So England is about a year ahead of us. They’ve actually implemented open banking. And the FinTech companies and services and banking service fees have gone down significantly in the U.K. And FinTech is twice the size in Europe as it is in Canada.

“So there’s an example of the importance of competition advocacy in changes by government to facilitate competition and the benefits to the marketplace, where consumers have greater choice, lower prices, better services, better quality.

“And so, we’re spinning our wheels on open banking. The finance department is going to study this for years and who knows where it is going to end up?

“It just speaks to the lower priority competition policy has in Canada, in my view, compared to Europe, Australia, the U.S.”

On why Canada tolerates such high corporate concentration:

“I think it has to do with the fact is that we’re a small open economy next to the U.S. Economic thinking back in the ‘60s was that we needed to have large economies of scale in order to be competitive internationally. And of course, Canada has significant barriers to foreign competition in many sectors, whether it’s the financial services, transport, agriculture, just go down the list.

“The government has created economic policies that create corporate concentration, with the view of becoming more competitive internationally. I think that’s the thinking behind it. Whether it’s been successful or not, you can be the judge of that.”

On why ‘efficiencies’ enriching corporate shareholders supersede consumer interests:

“The ‘efficiencies defence’ was part of that thinking [that], in Canada, having larger companies to compete internationally was important. So this defence, which is an outright defence [supporting] an anti-competitive merger, was implemented. And we’re unique in that. I think we’re the only major economy in the world that has this defence, whereby an anti-competitive merger could proceed because of cost savings. Sometimes just static cost savings going to shareholders are more significant than potential higher prices to consumers or other businesses.

“It’s something that I don’t believe we should be an outlier on.”

On how consumer resentment may fuel populism:

“I just think [the efficiencies defence] needs a rethink, particularly when you’re looking at the whole issue of populism, corporate concentration and income inequality. In Canada, we can clear mergers to create increases in concentrations — further increases in concentration — because of cost savings that go to shareholders from a merger transaction. Increases that could be one-time, that do not benefit the economy at all writ large.”

On Canada’s own monopoly game, and why it’s rigged:

“I’m concerned about the rules that have created the concentration in Canada. Concentration per se, is not a problem. That is the end game for any company in a business — they want to become a monopoly. And if you earned organically and not through anti-competitive processes, more power to you! You’ve got a better mouse trap, you can reap the monopoly benefits of that.

“That’s not what competition laws are designed to prevent. They’re preventing abuses in a monopoly situation, or once you’ve emerged to become a monopoly. That’s what competition laws are in place to do.

“So really, the concentration piece doesn’t bother me, it’s how these companies are able to obtain concentration in Canada. It’s not through open, competitive markets. It’s through protection from government, protecting companies against competition.

“That’s the concern I have in Canada, with regard to our foreign investment rules, our supply management rules, our efficiency defences — those are my concerns with our process in Canada.”

On whether corporate concentration and competition could be an election issue this fall:

“I think it’s starting to make its way back to the front pages, and people may be following. But generally speaking, it’s an obtuse area that most don’t pay attention to. And so it rarely makes it as a priority in politicians’ platforms because it’s not a big vote-getter at the end of the day.

“But there’s a federal election coming up and, you know, what better way of targeting the middle class or consumers than saying there’s going to be a review of the Competition Act, given the growing concern about corporate concentration. To me it’s an easy, low-hanging fruit. But I haven’t seen any talk about that yet in Canada.”",Monopoly-Friendly Canada ‘Does Not Treat Competition Policy Seriously’,The Tyee,https://thetyee.ca/News/2019/03/19/Monopoly-Friendly-Canada-Competition-Policy/

The reality for Justin Trudeau is that he needs these goodies in a way he didn't think he would.

Now he has found a way to help them buy their first homes and stay in his tent.

He was focused in his first mandate on helping lift people into the middle class, even though there are so many other ways to pick their pockets.

Now he has found late-stage promises like mid-life learning support to induce their support at the polls in the fall.

He forgot entirely about seniors.

Now in his budget, he is signalling his understanding of the necessary commitment to them - they, after all, vote in disproportionate numbers, and there are more and more of them and more to come.

Enter the prospect of pharmacare, if still faint in nature.

He appeared at first benign about business, then ham-handed in handling small business concerns about taxation and big business concerns about competitiveness and productivity.

On the former, he has generally patched things up over time, with some hard feelings remaining; on the latter, his budget Tuesday suggests he either doesn't think it matters for his political health or doesn't actually care. The yellowing and reform-needing tax code might outlive the lifespan of paper.

You can almost hear someone saying: ""Businesses don't vote. People do.""

Some governments would look at the recent operating surplus and say it was time to prune taxes as the country is stricken with economic stagnation and heads toward the first round of uncertainty in a decade.

That would leave some manoeuvrability if the storm hits shore. But the Liberals have determined in the time-honoured tradition of election cycles that it is again the moment to spend - as they have in their first term, for that matter, at a 6.5 per cent annual rate of growth - to improve their lately shakier odds of re-election.

For a government that has been at the helm during prosperous times, the Liberals have not demonstrated much interest in scrubbing the balance sheet.

Its projections suggest the deficit for the year ending March 31 will drop to $14.9 billion from $19 billion - thanks to revenue, not prudence - then rocket again to nearly $20 billion in the following two years.

Their optimism is that it is halved by 2023-24, after the second-next election.

They haven't extensively targeted spending programs that have outlived usefulness, nor particularly enabled through some support programs the next wave of wealth generation.

The extra $1.4 billion commitment to skills training will not hurt - workers 25 to 64 will accumulate credits of $250 annually to a maximum $5,000 - but will not necessarily align the needs of the labour market because they are not particularly targeted.

You will need to read the budget documents and fall listlessly into a hallucination to find anything to propel investment or corporate tax competitiveness.

In riding the revenue wave and pointing to lifetime lows in unemployment, the Liberals have taken a what-me-worry? pose.

They are content to sustain a debt-to-GDP ratio, maybe lower it a bit - all the while rolling out nearly $23 billion in new programs in the half-dozen years ahead.

This spendthrifty character could be a regret in a matter in a year or so, but that is a matter for a year or so.

Meantime there is an election machinery that needs to fire on all cylinders, have talking points for each riding it hounds, and nothing approaching sour medicine to spoon out.

To that end, Finance Minister Bill Morneau is straight out of Central Casting in the role of using our money - and, I suppose, our childrens' - to supply the illusion of improvement in our lives.

SILKEBORG, Denmark – Chelsea Carey’s Canadian rink bounced back with a much-needed 8-7 win over China’s Jie Mei on Wednesday at the world women’s curling championship.

The win improved the Calgary-based team’s record to 4-4 as it aims to avoid becoming the first Canadian rink to miss the playoffs at the women’s worlds since 1999.

Canada was in a three-way tie for sixth with Scotland and the United States after the second of three draws on Wednesday. The top six teams in the 13-rink event make the playoffs.

Carey scored three on a draw in the ninth to wipe out a two-point deficit and then held on for the win against a Chinese team (6-2) that entered the draw in a tie for first.

China settled for one in the 10th, giving Canada the win.

Stolen singles in the fifth and seventh ends gave Canada a 5-4 lead before China responded with a deuce in the eighth to go up 6-5.

Canada lost both its games on Tuesday to fall below .500.

The game against China was Canada’s lone contest on Wednesday.

Canada faces Switzerland (4-3) and Russia (6-2) on Thursday.

The election year budget was offered under a ...,"The Liberal government’s preference for continued deficits and increasing program spending “could increase the vulnerability of public finances to a faster economic slowdown or sudden shock,” according to Fitch Ratings.

Canada has the second largest gross government debt of ‘AAA’ rated countries after the United States, which is ‘incompatible’ with its gold-plated rating, according to the ratings agency.

While the credit agency concedes that increased spending and projected deficits in Canada’s latest budget remain consistent with a falling federal debt burden, the forecast assumes the economy will avoid a recession.

“Modest fiscal loosening and sustained deficits will increase the economy’s exposure to a downturn,” the ratings agency said in its post-budget analysis.

While the expanded federal deficits remain relatively modest at less than one per cent of GDP and are sufficiently low to keep debt-to-GDP ratio drifting lower over the medium term, the country’s gross general government debt, combining federal and provincial fiscal accounts, is higher than other similarly rated sovereigns, and the ratings agency notes that debt levels are “incompatible with (Canada’s) ‘AAA’ status.”

Fitch had issued a similar warning in 2017.

A raft of new spending items in the federal budget aims to stimulate an economy that’s lost momentum, with some analysts suggesting a recession may be around the corner. Canada’s GDP fell by 0.1 per cent in November and December, but the economy managed a marginal 0.4 per cent growth in the fourth quarter.

Earlier this month, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said it is now forecasting 1.5 per cent growth this year for Canada, compared to its previous call for GDP growth of 2.2 per cent.

On Wednesday, Finance Minister Bill Morneau disputed the notion that recession might rear its head.

“We’re expecting … that we will have a return to growth at expected levels in the second quarter (of 2019) and our long-term forecasts are positive,” Morneau said.

However, investors are becoming more cautious and more convinced that the next interest-rate move from the country’s previously hawkish central bank will be more dovish.

Local yields have fallen in recent weeks amid weakening economic data, a more downbeat assessment from the Bank of Canada and a global rally in bonds. Wednesday’s dovish shift by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the market’s more gloomy view on prospects for the U.S. buoyed sovereign bonds and supported the view that policy makers in Ottawa will need to cut rates.

Modest fiscal loosening and sustained deficits will increase the economy's exposure to a downturn Fitch Ratings

With “the bulk of the curve being below the overnight rate, it really says that the BoC will be reluctantly led to cutting rates,” Ryan Goulding, a fixed-income manager at Vancouver-based Leith Wheeler Investment Counsel Ltd., which manages around $19 billion, told Bloomberg. But it may not happen until “after a long, disappointing wait” for capital spending to pick up, he said.

The annual deficit projections in Tuesday’s budget, which is set to reach as high as $19.8 billion, will be racked up as the government makes several large, one-time investments for 2018-19, including $2.2-billion worth of new infrastructure funding and $1 billion towards improving energy efficiency.

The budget also pledges up to $3.9 billion for supply managed dairy, egg and poultry farmers affected by recent trade deals with the Asia-Pacific and Europe. Other big-ticket items include a $300 million zero-emissions car incentive, and a $1.25 billion houses-for-votes program that provides interest-free loans to first-time home buyers through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.

The election year budget was offered under a backdrop of disappointing growth over the last several months, according to CIBC Capital Market analysts Avery Shenfeld and Andrew Grantham.

“This was less a rain of largesse and more of a sprinkling of measures, aimed at winning-over targeted groups.”

There was an enhancement of the fiscal track since the fall statement, CIBC analysts wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.

“With revenues running further ahead of plan, and spending undershooting,” they said.

Instead of aiming at a lower track for deficits than had been laid out last year, CIBC said the government used the extra room generated by the enhancements to announce a dissemination of new spending and tax benefits, “thereby giving the economy a modest dose of stimulus while leaving the deficit track little changed from the fall statement.”

This scene has been repeated around the world; in Nigeria, Ecuador, Indonesia and elsewhere. In what economists call the “resource curse,” countries with minerals or oil are exploited by foreign powers and end up with damaged land, poisoned waters and sullied air.

In a new twist to an old tale, however, the foreign power in this case is Canada, and the indebted nation is the United States. Specifically, Boulder County, Colorado.

It began in October 2015, when the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), the $368 billion behemoth that invests payroll withholding taxes from Canada’s workers on behalf of 20 million contributors, announced a $609 million USD deal to purchase all of the oil and gas assets in the Denver-Julesburg Basin owned by Canadian oil and gas giant Encana.

Many of Encana’s holdings were located in rapidly growing suburban areas near homes and schools north of Denver astride the Interstate 25 corridor between Colorado’s capital and its fourth-largest city, Fort Collins. Others were in communities that had banned hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, such as Broomfield and Boulder counties. The oil and gas industry challenged those bans, and the legal fight reached the Colorado Supreme Court as the Encana deal was being negotiated. The fracking bans were overturned, and when the dust settled, CPPIB had picked up a chunk of sub-surface Colorado real estate and wells producing approximately 30 per cent less than had been announced just months earlier.

It was moving full-steam ahead into a Colorado firestorm of opposition. With all the investments in the world available to them, why would widows in Winnipeg, retirees in Richibucto and teachers in Toronto choose to invest in Colorado’s escalating fracking wars?

× Expand Ted Wood/The Story Group Crestone's 15-well Wooley Sosa development.

TOXIC ASSETS

It may simply be that the CPPIB was willing to go where other companies wouldn’t – the pension board thought they scored a deal from a distressed seller that would yield strong long-term results for their beneficiaries.

The fact that the CPPIB created a new oil and gas company in Colorado, the CPPIB-registered Crestone Peak Resources LLC, rather than simply investing in an existing Canadian-owned one added another quizzical twist to the deal.

John Bennett, a senior policy advisor at the environmental group Friends of the Earth Canada, suggests it may be because fracking is highly controversial in Canada, where three of 10 provinces have banned the practice.

“I don’t think they would ever have invested in a fracking company in Canada,” says Bennett. “Most Canadians would be surprised to know they own a fracking oil company in Colorado.”

Denise Melanson, 70, is one such Canadian. A retired medical social worker who lives in Richibucto, New Brunswick, Melanson had been involved in passing the moratorium in the province. Melanson also receives two pensions from the CPPIB: one that she paid into during her years of employment, and the other she calls an “old-age” benefit that she started receiving when she was 65.

When she learned that some of her benefits might be coming from fracking operations in Colorado, she said in a phone interview, “I was horrified. I’d much rather not be receiving money that was earned by making other people miserable.”

Most Coloradans would also be surprised to know that Canadian pensioners are invested in drilling operations in suburban backyards.

“I have to wonder if the beneficiaries of the pension fund’s investments understand what they’re investing in,” says Boulder County Commissioner Elise Jones. As far as she knows, virtually every elected official in the county – including those from its municipalities – as well as the overwhelming majority of people who live here, oppose the kind of residential drilling plans Crestone is proposing.

Concerns range from the planned drilling around homes and schools, to negative health effects from the industrial facilities’ emissions, to the oil and gas industry’s impact on the Denver metropolitan area’s persistently poor air quality.

FOLLOWING THE MONEY

Along with its purchase of these controversial assets, Crestone was also invested in Colorado’s 2018 election.

Oil and gas issues figured prominently up and down the ballot, from the governor’s race to several ballot initiatives. And Crestone contributed $607,500 to support groups that directly or indirectly opposed Proposition 112, the failed initiative that would have required new oil and gas development to be placed at least 2,500 feet from homes and schools.

Crestone, for example, donated to the pro-industry group Protect Colorado, which campaigned to defeat 112, and other political groups backing Republican state legislature candidates that unswervingly support the oil and gas industry.

Austin Graham, legal counsel for the Campaign Legal Center in Washington, DC, reviewed Crestone’s contributions for their legality.

Federal law requires that foreign-owned companies’ contributions to state campaigns meet a two-part test: the contributions must be drawn from money made from U.S. operations; and the person making the decision to donate must be a U.S. citizen.

But since Crestone is a privately held, Canadian-owned company, it is not obvious where the money came from or who made the decision to contribute to the election.

Crestone states in an email that it follows all state and federal laws, and as a company operating in Colorado, “Crestone allocates a certain amount of funds each year to dedicate to organizations and initiatives that are important to our team. Crestone leadership ultimately makes the decision on which organizations these funds are donated to.”

Those organizations include “independent expenditure committees,” which are also allowed to receive contributions from foreign-owned corporations.

“Regardless of whether any laws were broken,” says Graham, the CPPIB “spent a substantial amount of money trying to influence Colorado voters.”

RESIDENTIAL IMPACTS OF OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT

Crestone has applied for a Comprehensive Drilling Plan (CDP) to move into Boulder County, but the applications for drilling permits are still awaiting approval from the Colorado Oil & Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC), which is slated to meet about Crestone’s CDP in late April in Boulder.

If approved, the plans will have to survive an ongoing lawsuit filed by Boulder County that a judge recently ruled must wait for the COGCC’s final approval to move forward. The company will be subject to Boulder County’s new oil and gas regulations that went into place in March 2017. A bill that would impose greater regulation upon the industry, in part by beefing up local control of drilling, may bolster Boulder County’s position. However, industry representatives have vowed to develop their mineral rights in accordance with whatever Colorado law permits.

Although Boulder County has not seen any new drilling since its ban was lifted in 2016, the impacts of residential oil and gas development are plain to see.

In Weld County, there are 21,694 active wells, according to COGCC. At the same time, new homes have been built within 120 feet of existing oil and gas facilities.

Pressure has been mounting for years around the state to put some brakes on the industry. There have been repeated fires at oil and gas sites, as well as a deadly explosion in 2017 from an abandoned pipeline located less than 200 feet from a home in Firestone, which killed two people. Recent scientific reports state that Weld County’s hydrocarbon production is sullying Boulder County’s air and contributing significantly to pollution in the Denver metro region, which has placed Colorado in the crosshairs of the Environmental Protection Agency for its worsening “non-attainment” of federal clean air standards.

WELCOME TO ""EERIE""

Perhaps no place illuminates these conflicts better than Crestone’s operations in Erie, a former farming community in Boulder and Weld counties with a population of about 2,000 that has grown to a bedroom community of about 25,000 residents today. The first citizen complaint against Crestone’s operations with the COGCC was filed just three months after the CPPIB/Encana deal was finalized.

Noise from a drilling operation smack in the middle of Erie was so loud it was “like a huge semi truck parked in our driveway,” according to one complaint. Others reported rumbling and shaking of Erie homes, pictures falling from walls and disturbing vibrations night and day for weeks on end. Dank smells emanated from the drilling sites, which were just a few hundred feet away from rows of homes, parks, schools, a skate park and even the city offices. Residents joked that their town should be renamed “Eerie.”

Monica Korber who works from her Erie home as a consultant, recalls trying to sleep while her bed was shaking through the night. Soon dozens of people were sharing stories on social media and asking what Crestone was doing to rattle their lives so viscerally. “We never got a straight answer,” Korber said.

After the rumblings stopped the project, Crestone pressed on. Soon, Erie residents were complaining at COGCC meetings and on the agency’s website about noxious smells, leaks, nosebleeds, headaches, industrial noises and lights burning all night outside their bedroom windows.

Erie’s experience with Crestone isn’t isolated. More than 1,000 complaints against Crestone’s operations were filed with the COGCC between November 2016 and February 2019 – almost twice as many as the next five oil and gas companies conducting business in Colorado combined.

Crestone spokesperson Jason Oates has repeatedly stated that residents have abused the complaint process in Erie by organizing complaining campaigns.

In its email response to my questions, Crestone’s public relations department says that, “while none of the complaints resulted in a violation of state standards by the COGCC or the CDPHE [Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment], we knew we needed to make some changes in our operations. We took an above-and-beyond approach to further lessen the temporary impacts that we may have on neighbouring communities.”

One flurry of complaints came after Crestone’s operations caused a release of toxic gases at a site in Erie just 25 yards from the Aspen Ridge Preparatory School playground in September 2017. Crestone was plugging and abandoning a set of wells, and had been venting large quantities of volatile organic compounds before a resident smelled noxious fumes and complained to the COGCC. Those toxic emissions wafted directly onto the school playground of the Kiddie Academy Childcare Center and the elementary school, according to the COGCC’s report on the incident.

The COGCC ordered Crestone to cease operations until the problem was fixed, but parents say they didn’t hear about the leak for months. Mark Kadlececk, who has three children who attended Aspen Ridge, found the “Notice of Alleged Violation” posted on the COGCC website more than six weeks after the violation.

The COGCC fined Crestone $10,000, according to Mike Leonard, the agency’s community relations manager.

Christiaan van Woudenberg, one of Erie’s newly elected trustees, says that when companies like Crestone come into small communities such as Erie, dangling potential tax revenue and arguing (as Crestone spokesman Oates told a community meeting) that there are “no health impacts” from fracking, it is almost impossible not to be steamrolled. He says local elected officials are also hamstrung by state laws that limit their ability to say no to new oil and gas development.

“Erie is fracked,” van Woudenberg says. “We lost. We’re the cautionary tale.”

INVESTMENT QUESTIONS

Besides the fact that Crestone is seeking to operate in communities that oppose it, there’s a larger question for the CPPIB: is residential drilling in Colorado a smart investment?

Crestone continues to face legal challenges that are increasing the cost of doing business in Colorado. The company has been involved in lawsuits, protests, leaks and alleged violations of state regulations in multiple communities. Crestone, in turn, has sued the state and at least one other oil and gas company, alleging interference in its operations.

While Crestone is private, there are several clues that the CPPIB’s Colorado investment may be problematic. As of last month, the CPPIB’s website stated that the value of the investment had dropped to $543 million from the purchase price of $609 million.

Analysts are also divided about the future of shale development, with some predicting slow growth in 2019 and others convinced that many parts of the industry are burdened with debt and uncertainty regarding future regulatory regimes, international price fluctuations and the increasingly competitive cost of renewable energy technology. Other investors remain bullish on oil stocks but are moving away from riskier investments in politically volatile countries such as Venezuela, Russia, and Saudi Arabia, and are looking to U.S. fracking operations as a safer alternative. Both Noble Energy and Anadarko reported record Colorado oil production in 2018.

Then there’s climate change. Canada, a signatory to the Paris climate agreement, faces some cognitive dissonance with the CPPIB’s fossil fuel portfolio. Financial and legal analysts as well as climate activists point out that Canada cannot export its fossil fuel investments and still claim it is moving to reduce its carbon footprint.

In a report released in January entitled Time To Act, Canadian law professors Janis Sarra (University of British Columbia) and Cynthia Williams (Osgoode Hall Law School at York University) conclude that, “The CPPIB has enormous potential to help shift governance practice to meet the issues discussed in this report.”

That potential has yet to be unleashed, says Williams in an interview. Canada is heavily invested in the oil and gas sector, and all recent indicators are that those investments “already have a lot of risk,” she says, partly exemplified by the drop in value of the Canadian dollar and declining returns from oil and gas investments in comparison to other sectors. “Why would the CPP double down on oil and gas developments?”

Various organizations in Canada have tried to push the CPPIB towards a more sustainable, lower-carbon portfolio, without much success, says Bennett. The CPPIB has expressly avoided committing itself to environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments, stating that, “Consistent with the CPP Investment Board’s belief that constraints decrease returns and/or increase risk over time, we do not screen stocks or eliminate investments based on ESG factors. The CPP Investment Board considers the securities of any issuer all of whose businesses are lawful, and would be lawful if carried on in Canada, as eligible for investment.”

As many of the affected residents have noted, what is lawful in Colorado isn’t necessarily admirable. Many state laws were written in an earlier era of oil and gas exploration. They never anticipated new horizontal drilling and fracking techniques that allow companies like Crestone to build pads of 10, 20 and 30 wells and drill underneath hundreds of people’s homes for miles in every direction. These well pads are accompanied by rows of storage tanks, condensers, combustors and separators, as well as thousands of truck trips a day in and out of these mini-industrial complexes.

BURNING UP THE PLANET

Groups looking to aggressively address climate change are targeting pension funds around the world. As concerns resonate across the globe, investments in fossil fuel companies are increasingly seen as bad bets. Viable alternatives are emerging – with better financial rewards.

In the U.S., the divestment movement has made great strides in the past few years ever since Stanford University made headlines by selling off its coal stocks in 2014. Clara Vondrich, global director of DivestInvest – a philanthropic movement that encourages large institutional investors to move away from fossil fuels in favor of more sustainable investments – says that since 2014, more than 1,000 institutional investors have committed to fossil-free investments, with growth of capital investments rising from $52 billion to more than $8 trillion today.

Various backdated investment comparisons such as those done by the U.S. divestment advocacy group As You Sow confirm that portfolios without fossil fuel investments would have performed better than those with them. Says Vondrich: “These are underperforming assets that are also burning up the planet.” Now, she says, the CPPIB and other large investors “increasingly have a fiduciary duty to explain why they don’t divest, rather than the other way around.”

CALLING EDMONTON

At a January 2019 conference hosted by the Rocky Mountain Mineral Law Foundation, Crestone’s Oates told the audience that the company had met all of the requirements laid out by the COGCC for its drilling plans, and Crestone would forge ahead into Boulder County despite resident and local governments’ objections. “It is how, not if, we are going to drill,” Oates told the audience.

Sara Loflin, executive director of the League of Oil and Gas Impacted Coloradans, attended the conference and was taken aback by the “arrogance” of Oates’ remarks. In response to multiple communities’ concerns ever since it started doing business in Colorado, Loflin said, Crestone has only proposed moving “closer to homes, in higher risk areas, in larger scale developments.”

In its email to this reporter, Crestone disputes this and says it aims “to operate safely, responsibly, efficiently and with minimal impact on local communities, while acting as good stewards for the land, air and water. This is a priority for us because as Coloradans, we value these natural assets, and we live here, too.”

Back in Erie, grandmother Monica Korber says that she and her neighbors suffer not just the proximity of the industrial operations, but also from the discord that they have unleashed on her community. She has joined a lawsuit against her elected officials for not doing more to protect Erie citizens.

Korber’s message to the CPPIB? “Why don’t you drill next to the homes of the people where you’re sending those retirement checks?”

Being an inveterate ‘skip to the end’ kind of a reader, I took a boo at the Conclusion,

A chief science advisor plays an important role in building consensus and supporting positive change to our national institutions. Having laid the foundation for the function of the Chief Science Advisor in year one, I look forward to furthering the work that has been started and responding to new requests from the Prime Minister, the Minister of Science and members of Cabinet in my second year. I intend to continue working closely with agency heads, deputy ministers and the science community to better position Canada for global leadership in science and innovation.

I think the conclusion could have done with a little more imagination and/or personality, even by government report standards. While there is some interesting material in other parts of the report, on the whole, it is written in a pleasant, accessible style that raises questions.

Let’s start here with one of the sections that raises questions,

The Budget 2018 commitment of $2.8 billion to build multi-purpose, collaborative federal science and technology facilities presents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to establish a strong foundation for Canada’s future federal science enterprise. Similarly momentous opportunities exist to create a Digital Research Infrastructure Strategy [emphasis mine] for extramural science and a strategic national approach to Major Research Facilities. This is an important step forward for the Government of Canada in bringing principles and standards for federal science in line with practices in the broader scientific community; as such, the Model Policy will not only serve for the benefit of federal science, but will also help facilitate collaboration with the broader scientific community. Over the past year, my office has participated in the discussion around these potentially transformative initiatives. We offered perspectives on the evidence needed to guide decisions regarding the kind of science infrastructure that can support the increasingly collaborative and multidisciplinary nature of science. Among other things, I took an active part in the deliberations of the Deputy Ministers Science Committee (DMSC) and in the production of recommendations to Cabinet with respect to federal science infrastructure renewal. I have also analyzed the evolving nature and needs for national science facilities that support the Canadian science community. Success in building the science infrastructure of the next 50 years and propelling Canadian science and research to new heights will require that the multiple decisions around these foundational initiatives dovetail based on a deep and integrated understanding of Canada’s science system and commitment to maintaining a long-term vision. Ultimately, these infrastructure investments will need to support a collective vision and strategy for science in Canada, including which functions federal science should perform, and which should be shared with or carried out separately by academic and private sector researchers, in Canada and abroad. These are some of the essential considerations that must guide questions of infrastructure and resource allocation.

Canadian government digital infrastructure is a pretty thorny issue and while the article I’m referencing is old, I strongly suspect they still have many of the same problems. I’m going to excerpt sections that are focused on IT, specifically, the data centres and data storage. Prepare yourself for a bit of a shock as you discover the government did not know how many data centres it had. From a December 28, 2016 article by James Bagnall for the Ottawa Citizen,

… Information technology [IT} offered an even richer vein of potential savings. For half a century, computer networks and software applications had multiplied willy-nilly as individual departments and agencies looked after their own needs. [emphases mine] The result was a patchwork of incompatible, higher-cost systems. Standardizing common, basic technologies such as email, data storage and telecommunications seemed logical. [emphasis mine] It had been tried before. But attempts to centralize the buying of high-tech gear and services had failed, largely because federal departments were allowed to opt out. Most did so. They did want to give up control of their IT networks to a central agency. The PCO determined this time would be different. The prime minister had the authority to create a new federal department through a simple cabinet approval known as an order-in-council. Most departments, including a reluctant Canada Revenue Agency and Department of National Defence, would be forced to carve out a significant portion of their IT groups and budgets — about 40 per cent on average — and hand them over to Shared Services. Crucially, the move would not be subject to scrutiny by Parliament. And so Shared Services [Shared Services Canada] was born on Aug. 3, 2011. … Speed was demanded of the agency from the start. Minutes of meetings involving senior Shared Services staff are studded with references to “tight schedules” and the “urgency” of getting projects done. Part of that had to do with the sheer age of the government’s infrastructure. The hardware was in danger of breaking down and the underlying software for many applications was so old that suppliers such as Microsoft, PeopleSoft and Adobe had stopped supporting it. [emphases mine] The faster Shared Services could install new networks, the less money it would be forced to throw at solving the problems caused by older technology. … … Because the formation of Shared Services had been shrouded in such secrecy, the hiring of experienced outsiders happened last minute. Grant Westcott would join Shared Services as COO in mid-September. Sixty-three years old at the time, Wescott had served as assistant deputy minister of Public Services in the late 1990s, when he managed the federal government’s telecommunications networks. In that role, he oversaw the successful effort to prepare systems for the year 2000. More relevant to his new position at Shared Services, Westcott had also worked for nearly a decade at CIBC. As executive vice-president, he had been instrumental in overhauling the bank’s IT infrastructure. Twenty-two of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce’s [CIBC] data centres were shrunk into just two, saving the bank more than $40 million annually in operating costs. Among other things, Westcott and his team consolidated 15 global communications networks into a single voice and data system. More savings resulted. It wasn’t without glitches. CIBC was forced on several occasions to apologize to customers for a breakdown in certain banking services. Nevertheless, Westcott’s experience suggested this was not rocket science, at least not in the private sector. [emphasis mine] Streamlining and modernizing IT networks could be done under the right conditions. … …

While Shared Services is paying Bell only for the mailboxes it has already moved [there was an email project, which has since been resolved], the agency is still responsible for keeping the lights on at the government’s legacy data centres [emphasis mine]— where most of the electronic mailboxes, and much of the government’s software applications, for that matter, are currently stored. These jumbles of computers, servers, wires and cooling systems are weighed down by far too much history — and it took Shared Services a long time to get its arms around it. “We were not created with a transformation plan already in place because to do that, we needed to know what we had,” Forand [Liseanne Forand, then president of Shared Services Canada] explained to members of Parliament. “So we spent a year counting things.” [emphasis mine] … Shared Services didn’t have to start from scratch. Prior to the agency’s 2011 launch, the PCO’s administrative review tried to estimate the number of data centres in government by interviewing the IT czars for each of the departments. Symptomatic of the far-flung nature of the government’s IT networks — and how loosely these were managed — the PCO [Privy Council Office] didn’t even come close. “When I was at Privy Council, we thought there might be about 200 data centres,” Benoit Long, senior assistant deputy minister of Shared Services told the House of Commons committee last May [2016], “After a year, we had counted 495 and I am still discovering others today.” [emphasis mine] Most of these data centres were small — less than 1,000 square feet — often set up by government scientists who didn’t bother telling their superiors. Just 22 were larger than 5,000 square feet — and most of these were in the National Capital Region. These were where the bulk of the government’s data and software applications were stored. In 2012, Grant Westcott organized a six-week tour of these data centres to see for himself what Shared Services was dealing with. According to an agency employee familiar with the tour’s findings, Westcott came away profoundly shocked. Nearly all the large data centres were decrepit [emphasis mine], undercapitalized and inefficient users of energy. Yet just one was in the process of being replaced. This was a Heron Road facility with a leaking roof, considered key because it housed Canada Revenue Agency [CRA] data. Bell Canada had been awarded a contract to build and operate a new data centre in Buckingham. The CRA data would be transferred there in the fall of 2013. A separate part of that facility is also meant to host the government’s email system. The remaining data centres offered Westcott a depressing snapshot. [emphasis mine] … Most of the gear was housed in office towers, rather than facilities tailormade for heavy-duty electronics. With each new generation of computer or servers came requirements for more power and more robust cooling systems. The entire system was approaching a nervous breakdown.[emphasis mine] Not only were the data centres inherited by Shared Services running out of space, the arrangements for emergency power bordered on makeshift. One Defence Department data centre, for instance, relied [on] a backup generator powered by a relatively ancient jet engine. [emphases mine] While unconventional, there was nothing unique about pressing military hardware into this type of service. The risk had to do with with training — the older the jet engine, the fewer employees there were who knew how to fix it. [emphasis mine] The system for backing up data wasn’t much better. At Statistics Canada — where Westcott’s group was actually required to swear an oath to keep the data confidential before entering the storage rooms — the backup procedure called for storing copies of the data in a separate but nearby facility.While that’s OK for most disasters, the relative proximity still meant Statcan’s repository of historical data was vulnerable to a bombing or major earthquake. …

Two and a quarter years later, I imagine they’ve finished counting their data centres but how much progress they might have made on replacing and upgrading the hardware and the facilities is not known to me but it’s hard to believe that all of the fixes have been made, especially after reading the Chief Science Advisor’s 2018 annual report (the relevant bits are coming up shortly.

If a more comprehensive view of the current government digital infrastructure interests you, I highly recommend Bagnall’s article. It’s heavy going for someone who’s not part of the Ottawa scene but it’s worth the effort as it gives you some insight into the federal government’s workings, which seem remarkably similar regardless as to which party is in power. Plus, it’s really well written.

Getting back to the report, I realize it’s not within the Chief Science Advisor’s scope to discuss the entirety of the government’s digital infrastructure but ***Corrected March 22, 2019 : Ooops! As originally written this section was incorrect. Here’s the corrected version; you can find the original version at the end of this post: “… 40 percent of facilities are more than 50 years old …” doesn’t really convey the depth and breadth of the problem. Presumably, these facilities also include digital infrastructure. At any rate, 40 percent of what? Just how many of these facilities are over 50 year old?*** By the way, the situation as the Chief Science Advisor’s Office describes it, gets a little worse, keep reading,

Over the past two years, the Treasury Board Secretariat has worked with the federal science community to develop an inventory of federal science infrastructure. The project was successful in creating a comprehensive list of federal science facilities and documenting their state of repair. It reveals that some 40 percent of facilities are more than 50 years old and another 40 percent are more than 25 years old. The problem is most acute in the National Capital Region. A similar inventory of research equipment is now underway. This will allow for effective coordination of research activities across organizations and with external collaborators. The Canada Foundation for Innovation, which provides federal funding toward the costs of academic research infrastructure, has created a platform upon which this work will build.

***Also corrected on March 20, 2019: Bravo to the Treasury Board for creating an inventory of the aging federal science infrastructure, which hopefully includes the digital.*** Following on Bagnall’s outline of the problems, it had to be discouraging work, necessary but discouraging. ***Also corrected on March 20, 2019: Did they take advantage of the Shared Services Canada data centrre counting exercise? Or did they redo the work?*** In any event, both the Treasury Board and the Chief Science Advisor have even more ahead of them.

Couldn’t there have been a link to the inventory? Is it secret information? It would have been nice if Canada’s Chief Science Advisor’s website had offered additional information or a link to supplement the 2018 annual report.

Admittedly there probably aren’t that many people who’d like more information about infrastructure and federal science offices but surely they could somehow give us a little more detail. For example, I understand there’s an AI (artificial intelligence) initiative within the government and given some of the issues, such as the Phoenix payroll system debacle and the digital infrastructure consisting of ‘chewing gum and baling wire’, my confidence is shaken. Have they learned any lessons? The report doesn’t offer any assurance they are taking these ‘lessons’ into account as they forge onwards.

Lies, damned lies, and statistics

I’ve always liked that line about lies and I’ll get to its applicability with regard to the Chief Science Advisor’s 2018 report but first, from the Lies, Damned Lies, and Statistics Wikipedia entry (Note: Links have been removed),



“Lies, damned lies, and statistics” is a phrase describing the persuasive power of numbers, particularly the use of statistics to bolster weak arguments. It is also sometimes colloquially used to doubt statistics used to prove an opponent’s point. The phrase was popularized in the United States by Mark Twain (among others), who attributed it to the British prime minister Benjamin Disraeli: “There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.” However, the phrase is not found in any of Disraeli’s works and the earliest known appearances were years after his death. Several other people have been listed as originators of the quote, and it is often erroneously attributed to Twain himself.[1]

Here’s a portion of the 2018 report, which is “using the persuasive power of numbers”, in this case, to offer a suggestion about why people mistrust science,

A recent national public survey found that eight in ten respondents wanted to know more about science and how it affects our world, and roughly the same percentage of people are comfortable knowing that scientific answers may not be definitive. 1 [emphases mine] While this would seem to be a positive result, it may also suggest why some people mistrust science, [emphasis mine] believing that results are fluid and can support several different positions. Again, this reveals the importance of effectively communicating science, not only to counter misinformation, but to inspire critical thinking and an appreciation for curiosity and discovery.

I was happy to see the footnote but surprised that the writer(s) simply trotted out a statistic without any hedging about the reliability of the data. Just because someone says that eight out of ten respondents feel a certain way doesn’t give me confidence in the statistic and I explain why in the next section.

They even added that ‘people are aware that scientific answers are not necessarily definitive’. So why not be transparent about the fallibility of statistics in your own report? If that’s not possible in the body of the report, then maybe put the more detailed, nuanced analysis in an appendix.Finally, how did they derive the notion from the data suggesting that people are aware that science is a process of refining knowledge and adjusting it as needed might lead to distrust of science? It’s possible of course but how do you make that leap based on the data you’re referencing? As for that footnote, where was the link to the report? Curious, I took a look at the report.

Ontario Science Centre and its statistics

For the curious, you can find the Ontario Science Centre. Canadian Science Attitudes Research (July 6, 2018) here where you’ll see the methodology is a little light on detail. (The company doing this work, Leger, is a marketing research and analysitcs company.) Here’s the methodology, such as it is,



QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH INSTRUMENT An online survey of 1501 Canadians was completed between June 18 and 26, 2018, using Leger’s online panel.The margin of error for this study was +/-2.5%, 19 times out of 20. COMPARISON DATA Where applicable, this year’s results have been compared back to a similar study done in 2017 (OSC Canadian Science Attitudes Research, August 2017). The use of arrows ( ) indicate significant changes between the two datasets. ABOUT LEGER’S ONLINE PANEL Leger’s online panel has approximately 450,000 members nationally and has a retention rate of 90%. QUALITY CONTROL Stringent quality assurance measures allow Leger to achieve the high-quality standards set by the company. As a result, its methods of data collection and storage outperform the norms set by WAPOR (The World Association for Public Opinion Research). These measures are applied at every stage of the project: from data collection to processing, through to analysis.We aim to answer our clients’ needs with honesty, total confidentiality, and integrity.

I didn’t find any more substantive description of the research methodology but there is a demographic breakdown at the end of the report and because they’ve given you the number of the number of people paneled (1501) at the beginning of the report, you can figure out just how many people fit into the various categories.

Now, the questions: What is a Leger online panel? How can they confirm that the people who took the survey are Canadian? How did they put together this Leger panel, e.g., do people self-seletct? Why did they establish a category for people aged 65+? (Actually, in one section of the report, they make reference to 55+.) Read on for why that last one might be a good question.

I haven’t seen any surveys or polls originating in Canada that seem to recognize that a 65 year old is not an 80 year old. After all, they don’t lump in 20 year olds with 40 year olds because these people are at different stages in their lifespans, often with substantive differences in their outlook.. Maybe there are no differences between 65 year olds and 80 year olds but we’ll never know because no one ever asks. When you add in Canada’s aging population, the tendency to lump all ‘old’ people together seems even more thoughtless.

These are just a few questions that spring to mind and most likely, the pollsters have a more substantive methodology. There may have been a perfectly good reason for not including more detail in the version of the report I’ve linked to. For example, a lot of people will stop reading a report that’s ‘bogged down’ in too much detail. Fair enough but why not give a link to a more substantive methodology or put it in an appendix?

One more thing, I couldn’t find any data in the Ontario Science Centre report that would support the Chief Science Advisor Office’s speculation about why people might not trust science. They did hedge, as they should, “… seem to be a positive result, it may also suggest why some people mistrust science …” but the hedging follows directly after the ” … eight in ten respondents …”. which structurally suggests that there is data supporting the speculation. If there is, it’s not in the pollster’s report.

Empire building?

I just wish the office of the Chief Science Advisor had created the foundation to support this,

Establishing a National Science Advisory System Science and scientific information permeate the work of the federal government, creating a continuous need for decision-makers to negotiate uncertainty in interpreting often variable and generally incomplete scientific evidence for policy making. With science and technology increasingly a part of daily life, the need for science advice will only intensify. As such, my office has been asked to assess and recommend ways to improve the existing science advisory function [emphasis mine] within the federal government. To that end, we examined the science advisory systems in other countries, such as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as the European Union. [emphasis mine] A key feature of all the systems was a network of department-level science advisors. These are subject matter experts who work closely with senior departmental officials and support the mandate of the chief science advisor. They stand apart from day-to-day operations and provide a neutral sounding board for senior officials and decision-makers evaluating various streams of information. They also facilitate the incorporation of evidence in decision-making processes and act as a link between the department and external stakeholders. … I am pleased to report that our efforts to foster a Canadian science advisory network are already bearing fruit. Four organizations [emphasis mine] have so far moved to create a departmental science advisor position, and the first incumbents at the Canadian Space Agency and the National Research Council [emphasis mine] are now in place. I have every confidence that the network of departmental science advisors will play an important role in enhancing science advice and science activities planning, especially on cross-cutting issues.

Who asked the office to assess and recommend ways to improve the existing science advisory function? By the way, the European Union axed the position of Chief Science Adviser, after Anne Glover, the first such adviser in their history, completed the term of her appointment in 2014 (see James Wilsdon’s November 13, 2014 article for the Guardian). Perhaps they meant countries in the European Union?

Which four organizations have created departmental science advisor positions? Presumably the Canadian Space Agency and the National Research Council were two of the organizations?

If you’re looking at another country’s science advisory systems do you have some publicly available information, perhaps a report and analysis? Is there a set of best practices? And, how do these practices fit into the Canadian context?

More generally, how much is this going to cost? Are these departmental advisors expected to report to the Canadian federal government’s Chief Science Advisor, as well as, their own ministry deputy minister or higher? Will the Office of the Chief Science Advisor need more staff?



I could be persuaded that increasing the number of advisors and increasing costs to support these efforts are good ideas but it would be nice to see the Office of Chief Science Advisor put some effort into persuasion rather than assuming that someone outside the tight nexus of federal government institutions based in Ottawa is willing to accept statements. that aren’t detailed and/or supported by data.

Final thoughts

I’m torn. I’m supportive of the position of the Chief Science Advisor of Canada and happy to see a report. It looks like there’s some exciting work being done.

I also hold the Chief Advisor and the Office to a high standard. It’s understandable that they may have decided to jettison detail in favour of making the 2018 annual report more readable but what I don’t understand is the failure to provide a more substantive report or information that supports and details the work. There’s a lack of transparency and, also, clarity. What do they mean by the word ‘science’. At a guess, they’re not including the social sciences.

On the whole, the report looks a little sloppy and that’s the last thing I expect from the Chief Science Advisor.

*** This is the original and not accurate version: “… 40 percent of facilities are more than 50 years old …” doesn’t really convey the depth and breadth of the problem.

So the top guy at SNC says they never mentioned any numbers for job losses to anybody … so that means someone made up the 9,000 jobs lost if SNC moves, and would that not mean someone lied at the justice committee on the record?

I will not, nor have I ever voted for the NDP. As for the Liberals, as long as we have a bleeding heart, apologetic for everything, throw tax money away prime minister, the Liberals will never get my vote. As for the UPC and Jason Kenney, I have not voted for him when he was running in my riding, and the candidate that is now running in my riding will probably not get my vote. It’s too bad that the politics in this country both provincially and federally have fallen to the low credibility it has. It’s not about running the province or country, it’s about finger-pointing, the childish bickering, the accusations, the opinions the other guys are wrong and we are right, the my-way-or-no-way attitude, and it’s all BS, political BS that costs us taxpayers. If the UCP wants my vote, then they need someone that can be trusted, honest, accountable, responsible, and has integrity. Unfortunately the last person I feel that fit this bill was Danielle Smith of the former Wildrose Party. Too bad she didn’t stick it out as she would have probably been premier and we probably wouldn’t be in the mess we are now. If the UCP are going to win this election, they need to get someone in position that the voters can support and respect, now!

It’s too bad that Caylan Ford resigned from the Calgary Mountain View election race. It is quite apparent that if one offers a legitimate contrary perspective to any liberal leftist view you are branded a racist, a bigot or an Islamophobe. The irony is that the Liberals claim to be tolerant and inclusive of all ideas when in fact the opposite is true. The leftists in this country are so intolerant, such that when you have dissenting opinion they are unable to debate and can only resort to a fallacious argumentative strategy avoiding discussion of the topic and instead attacking the character or motives of the person making the argument. The leftists are only interested in being right and disinterested in healthy democratic debate. By suppressing genuine free speech democracy dies and all of us will suffer in the end.

UNACCOUNTABLE

There is something terribly and fundamentally wrong with Canada’s justice system when the Liberal government under Justin Trudeau can shut down the SNC-Lavalin inquiry when they know they have been caught with their fingers in the cookie jar. Now the whole truth will never be made public. It’s like asking a caught-in-the-act bank robber how many years he wants to spend in prison and he replies, “none!” That’s exactly what the Liberal Party did when they shut down the inquiry. There should be some world court to hold a country’s government accountable for their actions and allow the truth to be heard. This fall’s federal election is when Canadians can have their say like the song goes, “Nah, nah, nah, nah, hey, hey, hey, goodbye.”

GREEDY UNION

Wow, D’Arcy Lanovaz, president CUPE local 38. You can’t make this stuff up. The union is frustrated to the point of being angry. Wow, wow, wow. Apparently this group haven’t been paying attention since the crash of oil prices and the tragic election of CUPE’s Matron Saint, Ms. Notley. How many tens and tens of thousands of families have lost their livelihoods and homes, not to mention their families, while our natural resource sector struggles under the fumbling of Justin and Rachel. Where do these union types think the money comes from? How tough can these double- and triple-dipping pension types have it. Taxpayers deserve much better. The smartest thing the City of Calgary could do is start trimming the fat to get back to the real world. But that won’t happen so up, up, up go the taxes while the downward spiral of living standards continue. Keep up the good work, D’arcy.

HATE BREEDS HATE

I’m very saddened by the events that occurred in New Zealand, I honestly feel for those innocents and their families. Things like that should never happen. However, I believe it is a double edged sword. Hate breeds hate, this man had an agenda (even if it was misguided) because of Islamic actions in other parts of the world. I don’t condone it at all, but I also notice how the entire world is up in arms about this killing, but when an Islamic radical goes on a killing spree it’s just another news day, nobody is up in arms, nobody is protesting, especially within the Islamic community. It’s very sad, but it’s the truth. (I know you will never print this because it’s the truth.)

SHARE SOME LOVE

In light of the horrific Christchurch shootings, here’s my take on the hatred and violence we face in the world today. I was just contemplating about the shootings in two mosques in New Zealand as well as all the other recent shootings in places of worship. If you visit these places of worship, you’ll notice that there’s no hatred being preached in any of them. However, if you look at the world today, you’ll notice there’s less unity among people. I believe the culprit for all this hate is divisive politics, polarizing media, and lack of understanding between people. Many have lost the ability to listen to those who’re different from them. This is where all hate begins. When one person feels they don’t need to hear the other side. Let us all show each other love and unity. If you know someone of a different race or culture or faith, reach out to them, show some love and make sure you stand up for them.

BUT WHAT IF …

So Jody Wilson-Raybould is seeking re-election as a Liberal so that she can change the culture of conflict, partisanship etc. in government, which was one of her goals the first time. This is providing PM Justin Trudeau accepts her nomination and allows her to run under the Liberal banner, and we have heard that many times before from all kinds of political hopefuls. She claims that she never expected the national focus even though she is an accomplished lawyer. If she would have agreed to an independent, high-level retired judge advising her on the SNC-Lavalin affair, the end choice would still be hers but any controversy may not have been. She might still have her old job but now even if re-elected it could take a while to get off the backbench.

WAGE DISPUTE

Ricky Leong: Teenage workers deserve same minimum wage as adult. This article was written by someone with zero business experience. Came out of college indoctrinated with the lefty, socialist ideologies pushed throughout our school system. Everyone should be paid the same, why keep score during a game, someone’s feelings might get hurt, give him a good grade for doing bad in school. It really makes me sick. Not one thought of common sense in this article. All he keeps saying is it’s not fair. Well, whaaaa! Go cry in your beer. He mentions nothing of experience. Only age, race and gender. Typical liberal talking points. As an employer, I put huge stock in experience. I don’t want to retrain a new employee if I don’t have to. I will pay good employees more money to stay but you have to show me you’re worth the added investment. The article says “teenagers deserve the same wage” based on what? Why do they deserve the same wage? What have they done to show they deserve the same wage? What responsibilities do they have that requires the same wage? The writer suggest that kids need to earn more money to support their families? Really! That’s your MO. Do you know how silly that sounds. This thought process is a socialist ideology. People should be paid what they are worth to an employer and for a youth with zero experience and zero responsibilities, it’s worth very little.

DAVE SMITH

(Plenty of people would agree with you. And Ricky.)

A ROUGH GAME

So the NDP wants to make a mountain out of a molehill regarding the PC leadership campaign that saw Jason Kenney win. I have a news flash for them, that’s how the game is played. Remember Ed Stelmach? Third place on the ballot behind Jim Dinning and Ted Morton. Morton threw his support behind Stelmach and boom, Dinning is out. Too bad, really, Jim Dinning would have made a hell of a good premier. Look at B.C. The NDP were losing and the Green Party throws in behind them and it’s bye bye Liberals. As I said, it’s just the way the game’s played and all the parties do it. I’m not saying it’s right, but that’s just how it is. Don’t let Notley’s misfits get in your head over it. They’re sucking in the polls and will try anything to gain some traction.

JOHN HANCOCK

(When your track record is dismal, you need to find a shiny object.)

DON’T BLAME RACHEL

Hilarious to see Roy Peterson say “on election day, vote as you please, but for the sake of our kids, not NDP.” So somehow the Notley NDP government has been detrimental to the youth of Alberta? The government that finally got shovels into the ground on many badly needed schools? The government that raised the minimum wage to help bring the youth and working poor out of poverty? Somehow Jason Kenney’s racist and bigoted policies will better serve the youth of Alberta? Kenney really needs to pick up a book on how trickle down economics has never worked. Perhaps reading a book on being a decent human being might be a boost for Jason, too.

OUT TO LUNCH

This whole mess with the added fee for every bag of garbage outside of your bin is insane. The fact that the citizens of Calgary are becoming jaded sheep is beyond insane. The reason why I say this is because in the March 18 issue, people actually said that they agree with people paying more who generate more trash, 62% in fact. Are these 62% of the people forgetting that our lovely council downtown slashed the service in half while keeping the price the same?! Take my extra $3 out of the money that you are keeping for doing half the job, better yet, go back to collections every week and we won’t have to worry about extra bags. Not to mention the green cart (which I don’t use) also had its service cut in half over the winter but the rates also stayed the same. It’s always so easy for council to just charge more money instead of thinking of ways to make the system more efficient and doing their jobs properly. I wonder if they have put very much thought into how much it will cost to clean up all the illegal dump sites in ditches and such that will pop up because of this. It already exists as there is scum out there too cheap to take their garbage and dispose of it properly so this will only increase the problem further and they will be kidding themselves if they don’t think this.

On Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government presented its 2019-20 budget, which lavished new spending on middle-class voters ahead of a federal election in October.","(Reuters) - The Canadian province of Saskatchewan forecast on Wednesday its first balanced budget since 2014-15, with resource revenues set to rise after the government proposed a change to how it calculates its return from potash sales.

Saskatchewan, home to major potash and uranium reserves, projected a C$34.4 million ($25.9 million) surplus for 2019-20, with increasing surpluses for future years, the province's budget document showed.

For the fiscal year ending on March 31, the deficit was projected to rise to C$379.9 million ($285.6 million) from C$365.3 million forecast in November's mid-year fiscal update.

""This budget contains no new taxes or tax increases, so it’s the right balance to keep our economy strong,"" Finance Minister Donna Harpauer said.

The western Canadian province, which has a population of about 1.2 million, had balanced its books for two decades before its economy was weakened by the 2014 collapse in the price of oil.

The right-leaning Saskatchewan Party government, led by Scott Moe, has since moved to reduce the province's reliance on oil revenue. In 2017, it bumped up the sales tax up by 1 percent and applied it to more items.

Tax revenue is forecast to rise 5.8 percent in 2019-20 from the current fiscal year to nearly C$7.6 billion, while there is a 7.1 percent projected increase in resource revenue that is mostly due to potash.

The budget includes changes to the Potash Production Tax, which eliminates some deductions.

Resource revenue has rebounded by 40 percent since 2016-17 but remains 30 percent below 2014-15 levels, the province said.

The price for potash is forecast by Saskatchewan to average $219.66 per tonne in 2019, up from $207.66 last year.

The province expects the average price of West Texas Intermediate oil to fall to $58 a barrel this year from $64.78 a barrel in 2018.

Net debt-to-GDP is projected to dip to 14.7 percent at the end of 2019-20 from 14.8 percent in the current fiscal year. It had climbed each year from 5.5 percent in 2014-15.

On Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government presented its 2019-20 budget, which lavished new spending on middle-class voters ahead of a federal election in October.

THE CANADIAN PRESS

OTTAWA- The federal Liberal government plans to spend $4.5 billion over the next five years to try to narrow the socio-economic gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people- part of a plan to keep reconciliation at the forefront of this fall’s campaign narrative.

Speaking to reporters inside the budget lockup, Finance Minister Bill Morneau stressed the Liberals have been committed to reconciliation from the beginning of their mandate.

“It is a continuation of what we’ve been doing since Day One,’’

Morneau said. “It is driven by the fact that we know in this country, we need to get this right. We’ve got a lot of work to do and we are going to stay on it.’’

Part of the budget pledge is $1.2 billion over three years, $404 million per year beginning in 2019-2020, to develop a long-term approach for services for First Nations children.

The policy is named after a Manitoba First Nations boy from Norway House Cree Nation, Jordan River Anderson, who had multiple disabilities. When he was two years old, doctors recommended he move to a special home suited to his medical needs.

He died three years later, after jurisdictional squabbles between federal and provincial governments over payment for his care.

“It should be no surprise that we continue to deal with issues, like Jordan’s Principle, that we’ve been talking about for a long time,’’ Morneau said.

The budget also includes plans to invest $220 million over five years, beginning in 2019-2020, to provide services to Inuit children who face unique challenges to get health and social services due to the remoteness of their communities and limited availability of culturally appropriate care.

The Liberal government is communicating in the budget it is serious about its commitment to Indigenous Peoples, said Rebekah Young, the director of fiscal and provincial economics with Scotiabank.

“We are looking at almost $5 billion (in new spending) over five years, of a total budget spend of $20 billion,’’ she said. “We are talking about a quarter of the budget.’’

The federal budget also includes plans to move ahead with responding to calls to act from the Truth and Reconciliation that spent six years probing the dark legacy of Canada’s residential schools.

The spending plan includes $126.5 million in 2020-21 to establish a national council on reconciliation designed to serve as a permanent reminder of the fraught past between Canada and Indigenous Peoples and to contribute to better understanding of it. There is also $333.7 million over the next five years earmarked for helping to revitalize Indigenous languages, a move that follows legislation introduced in February.

The funding will help create a commissioner of Indigenous languages, the budget said, adding that only one in seven Indigenous children reports being able to carry on a conversation in an Indigenous language.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has repeatedly said there is no relationship more important than the Canadian government’s with Indigenous Peoples, though some Indigenous leaders and the federal NDP have raised concerns about the rate of progress on the file.

Most pollsters agree that jobs and the economy are top issues for Albertans in the provincial election.

That extends to candidates in and around Medicine Hat, where local government has promoted a string of economic announcements as signals of investor confidence and an improving economy.

Local candidates were asked to localize their parties’ plans to boost the economy and ease employment concerns in the short and long term.

The two main parties’ positions are largely in opposition to each other.

The New Democrats, under leader Rachel Notley, says the province needs to continue her government’s diversification efforts to broaden the economy

United Conservative Leader Jason Kenney has said a one-third reduction to the corporate tax rate is required to boost investment, and a signal that the province is business friendly.

Drew Barnes, who is running for re-election in Cypress Medicine Hat under the UCP banner, echoed his leader’s call for and end to carbon pricing and reducing red tape for business.

“Reversing the NDP tax increases and layers of regulatory burden will make a huge economic difference,” he told the News on Friday.

“These measures will attract people to Alberta and our city … reducing the burden on Alberta families and business will enhance our local economy and opportunities.”

The NDP increased taxes for corporations and top income earners by two percentage points in 2015, while reducing small business rates to offset carbon levy costs.

However, after a marked improvement after an oil patch dip in 2017, some economists are contemplating whether the province is entering a second slow-down.

Cypress-Medicine Hat NDP candidate Peter Mueller said the NDP provides stability and a vision of a less volatile economy.

He told the News that cutting government services would have worsened the economic downturn. Diversification – especially in renewable energy sector – will boost the regional outlook, he says.

“The recession hit families hard, and families here in our province are often made up of energy and construction workers, whose partners are teachers and nurses,” he stated.

“I want to make sure this recovery reaches every family. Part of how we need to do that is by getting the pipeline built but also diversifying the economy to create new jobs – like in the renewable sector.”

Brooks-Medicine Hat’s independent candidate is squarely against the carbon pricing.

“Cutting the carbon tax is low hanging fruit,” said Todd Beasley, who also argued government influence on the deregulated market is driving up prices and hurting business.

“(Reducing regulations) has worked very well in the Untied States and we should adopt it as well.”

Colette Smithers, the Alberta Party candidate in Cypress-Medicine Hat, said public infrastructure and diversification, and her party’s “children first” policy would give support to working families by making childcare more affordable.

“I am personally thrilled with this initiative, especially for women,” said Smithers. “It gives them choices, not to be just a parent or just have a career, but it makes it so much more accessible to do both.”

Specific to public works, she would like to see greater consideration for renovating irrigation district facilities and scope to aid agriculture sector.

Lynn MacWilliam, the NDP candidate in Brooks-Medicine Hat, said her party’s platform would ensure the “recovery will be built to last.”

“Southern Alberta is one of the windiest and sunniest places in Canada, and we need to continue to utilize those resources and harness wind and solar power,” she said.

The key item in the NDP jobs platform is a program to entice private investment in petrochemical refining.

Alberta Party leader Stephen Mandel told the News this month that the program should be extended to 10 years.

Notley announced this week she’d double the amount of royalty credits in the program to $7 billion in hopes of attracting $75 billion in private investment to upgrade petroleum.

Brooks-Medicine Hat UCP candidate Michaela Glasgo said major projects and major pipeline are important, however, day-to-day operations in the oilpatch won’t fully recover until the business environment improves, along with prices that would be bolstered by greater export capacity.

“Part of the problem with price is a lack of market access,” she said of local oilfield outlook. “There are a really great group of UCP candidates in southern Alberta, and we would be a great group advertising the region.”

Jim Black, who represents the Alberta Party in the Brooks-Medicine Hat race, said energy sector, while key to the economy, shouldn’t overshadow needs of the farms and ranches in the region.

“I’d like to say (a major pipeline) is a year away, but really it’s more like two or longer,” he said, stating agriculture sector development can be a short-term win.

“A moratorium on the carbon levy – at least until they get the competitive edge back – is very important to the people I’m talking to,” he said. “They’re looking to maintain their competitive advantage over south of the border, but this is a worldwide issue.”

The carbon levy regulations exempts most of the cost for greenhouse growers and on farm fuel, but Black said general transportation costs cut into farm incomes.

The arrival of the turbaned leader into the house on Monday, cheered by all members, coincided with the induction of a senior woman member into Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's cabinet.

Singh, 40, the leader of the New Democratic Party, placed his hand over his heart as he walked into the House of Commons, the lower of house of Parliament, before the daily question period.

He was elected in federal by-elections held on February 25.

Singh's first words as an elected lawmaker were about last week's terrorist attack on two mosques in New Zealand.

""I want to begin by expressing our solidarity with the people of New Zealand who are mourning the attack on Muslim brothers and sisters... in Christchurch,"" he said.

About 50 people were killed last week in the Pacific country's worst-ever mass shooting.

He then launched his first question about housing in Burnaby-South.

""I met a mom in Burnaby. She bought a home, but cannot afford to live there anymore. Her daughter has a good job, but only gets by because she lives in the basement. Her son does not see a future. Like too many Canadians, he has lost all hope,"" Singh said.

""However, the prime minister is telling families like theirs to wait for help. I believe that better is possible. Will the government commit to building half a million new affordable homes?"" he said.

Prime Minister Trudeau responded by congratulating Singh for his entry into the Commons, before touting the government's record on fighting poverty.

Singh's remarks echoed the mood of the House on a crucial day when the prime minister beleaguered by the resignations of his two key cabinet colleagues.

Speculations are rife that the last budget of the Trudeau government with an eye on the general elections in October is expected to have several attractions for the middle class.","Indian-origin Jagmeet Singh creates history, becomes first non-white leader of Canada Parliament",Business Today,https://www.businesstoday.in/current/world/indian-origin-jagmeet-singh-creates-history--becomes-first-non-white-leader-of-canada-parliament/story/329428.html

""They're recognizing that the investment levels are down, they're recognizing that prices are down and that unemployment is up, and yet they're not really taking any meaningful action to support our industry,"" the group’s vice-president of oilsands, Ben Brunnen, said as quoted by CBC.

""The reality is, when we see those indicators all facing down, from an oil and gas perspective, and no recognition from the government of a willingness to support our industry, it's a pretty strong message towards our industry that we're not a priority for this government, and that's disappointing,"" Brunnen added.

The budget includes funds for retraining initiatives that could help with Alberta’s high unemployment problem, but according to CAPP, this is not enough.

Alberta’s oil industry may not be a priority for Ottawa, but it certainly is a priority for everyone running in this year’s elections, scheduled for April 16. The Canadian Press reported this week that oil and gas investments and carbon tax were central topics on the campaign trail.

Incumbent Premier Rachel Notley has promised to increase local oil and gas processing capacity while her rival from the United Conservative party, Jason Kenney, focused on the carbon tax approved by the Notley government.

Notley’s plan aims to reduce the amount of crude oil Alberta exports, therefore reducing the need for transportation capacity including pipelines—nowhere in sight—and oil trains. It should bring in tens of billions of dollars in fresh investments.

Kenney, on the other hand, promised his first order of business would be to repeal the carbon tax that is “punishing” Albertans. This, he said, would save the province more than US$1billion (C$1.4 billion) every year “in one fell swoop.”

To recap, the new First Time Home Buyer’s Incentive will offer first-time buyers an interest-free loan, in the form of a shared-equity mortgage, from the Canada Housing and Mortgage Corporation. The loan will be up to 10 per cent of the purchase price if you’re buying a new-build home, and up to five per cent if you’re buying resale. Only households earning under $120,000 a year are eligible, and the program is capped at four times the applicant’s annual household income, so it will only apply to homes where the mortgage value plus the CMHC loan is $480,000 or less.

article continues below

The Budget document gave an example of how it might work. It said, “For example, if a borrower purchases a new $400,000 home with a five per cent down payment and a 10 per cent CMHC shared equity mortgage ($40,000), the borrower’s total mortgage size would be reduced from $380,000 to $340,000, reducing the borrower’s monthly mortgage costs by as much as $228 per month.”

The CMHC loan will have to be repaid, of course. The Budget document did not say when, but the current widespread assumption is that it gets repaid upon the eventual sale of the home. The loan is interest-free, but it’s a shared-equity mortgage, which suggest CMHC would get back a proportional cut of any uplift in the home’s value, in addition to the original loan amount, although this has not been clarified.

This new program has been met with some surprise, and a mix of positive and negative reactions.

Surprise because it’s glaringly similar to the largely unsuccessful, now-defunct B.C. HOME down payment loan program, which was introduced by the B.C. Liberals when they were in power, and scrapped in 2018 by the B.C. NDP government. That program saw relatively little uptake, as many buyers seemed unenthusiastic about the province sharing a small slice of their home.

Positive reactions on the feds’ new measure have come largely from the real estate and development industry, which have lauded the attempt to not only aid first-time buyers in getting into homeownership, but also to balance any increased demand by encouraging the purchase of new homes, which should theoretically boost supply. This is a well-thought-through move on the part of the Liberals – whether it will work in practice remains to be seen.

Critics pan upper limit

Critics, however, have slammed the new incentive, for two key reasons. First and foremost, they say that the upper home price limit of $480,000 means that the program will have the least significant effect in the most expensive urban regions where it is most needed.

But does that mean that the price limit should have been increased – let’s say, to a more widely encompassing $700,000?

After all, nobody is criticizing the household income eligibility level of $120K a year – such a limit has to be set, and that seems fair. And an applicant-household earning less than $120K really shouldn’t be taking out a home-purchase loan of more than $480K. It would have been more irresponsible of the Liberals to encourage those households to make pricier home purchases than that. (The only people of that income group who should buy a pricier home should be those with a substantial additional down payment, who likely don't need this loan.)

The question then becomes whether a first-time buyer can get into an expensive real estate market like Metro Vancouver or Victoria for $480K. The kneejerk reaction has been something along the lines of, “You can’t buy a shoebox for that in Vancouver!”

Well, a quick search of current listings (March 21, 2019) shows there are just over 2,000 attached resale home listings in the Greater Vancouver and Fraser Valley board regions under $480K (admittedly only a handful of detached houses, but nobody starts in a detached house). Sure, that wide catchment includes inexpensive areas such as Mission, Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows. But there are 98 such listings in Vancouver alone, and hundreds in great starter-home areas like Surrey, Langley and New Westminster. In the Greater Victoria area, there are around 300 resale homes currently available for that price or less. Unfortunately there’s no single source of data on how many new presale homes are available for under that price, but they do exist, especially in places like Langley and Abbotsford, and around the capital region.

Cheap, but not free, money

The other criticism is that the federal government isn’t really offering anything – the buyers are simply borrowing from a cheaper source, as the loan is interest free. But with a federal budget that is not yet balanced, expecting the feds to hand out more than a billion dollars in permanently free money is highly unrealistic.

So will this new measure help people into homeownership, even in pricey cities? I think yes, some people, a bit.

For those who are motivated to buy, this is cheap – not free, but cheap – money that they’d be fools to turn down. The new policy is probably not significant enough to cause a rush of demand, and it may help boost new supply a little. So although it isn’t a cure-all for affordability (nothing is), we do have reason to hope it’ll help a good number of people get out into homeownership without making affordability worse.",Opinion: Will First Time Buyer Incentive really help people into homeownership?,Burnaby Now,https://www.burnabynow.com/federal-election-2019/opinion-will-first-time-buyer-incentive-really-help-people-into-homeownership-1.23671027

According to Statistics Canada, as of 2016, there are about 12,000 people who identify “journalist” as their profession.","Editor’s note: In Canada, the Trudeau government has pledged, controversially, to provide financial support for the country’s ailing news industry. Last week, the release of its annual budget outlined some of the plan’s specifics, which include a tax credit for companies employing journalists, tax benefits for those who subscribe to digital news outlets, and rules to make it easier to make tax-deductible donations to some newsrooms. To illustrate some of the debate around the topic, today we’re publishing three pieces by Canadian journalists, each of whom opposes the plan for distinct reasons. Below is a piece by David Skok, CEO and editor-in-chief of The Logic (and a former Nieman Fellow); also be sure to check out the pieces by Carleton University’s Chris Waddell and The Discourse’s Erin Millar.

Well, it happened. The government capitulated to the demands of traditional publishers with its financial package of “support for Canadian journalism.”

If you missed the news, it’s probably because after months — make that years — of lobbying, public awareness campaigns, and many, many editorials written in the country’s newspapers, there’s been almost no coverage of the media (don’t call it a bailout) package from the country’s traditional newspapers and airwaves since it was announced on Tuesday. Make of that what you will.

I wrote a column last year providing seven recommendations that the government should consider in any journalism policy. None of them were included in the announcement. I was still willing to accept whatever was proposed if it kept the playing field fair for all journalism organizations, but this tax measure was even more prescriptive than I anticipated.

For an organization to qualify for a 25 percent refundable tax credit on salary or wages capped at $55,000, they must be:

Primarily engaged in the production of original news content and in particular, the content must be primarily focused on matters of general interest and reports of current events, including coverage of democratic institutions and processes, and must not be primarily focused on a particular topic such as industry-specific news, sports, recreation, arts, lifestyle or entertainment.

In plain terms, the government is creating a two-tiered system where publications that “primarily focus” on current events yet also happen to have a sports or arts section will get all of their reporters subsidized — but a publication that does the inverse will get nothing.

As Andrew Coyne — one of the few voices that could be found on the topic — wrote this week in the National Post, “The government will subsidize department stores, but not boutiques. Why?…Because that description neatly excludes anyone outside the existing Canadian newspaper industry. And that’s who this policy is designed for: not the future of news but the past; not the scrappy startups who might save the business, but the lumbering dinosaurs who are taking it down.”

They’re also getting into the minds of editors to dictate what areas of coverage are deemed more important than others.

I’ve been working in newsrooms for almost two decades and can tell you with the utmost certainty that there isn’t a single topic area — whether in sports, entertainment, or teen fashion — that doesn’t at some point focus on matters of general interest, current events, and coverage of democratic institutions and processes.

Would a sports publication in Calgary focused on covering the Calgary Flames’ ongoing arena-subsidies discussions with the city not be eligible? Would an entertainment publication reporting on the Canadian film tax credit or Netflix’s relationship with Quebec not be eligible? Would a teen fashion publication focused on gender and LGBTQ+ rights not be eligible? Under the proposed outline, it seems they would not be.

One only has to look at the influence Teen Vogue has had on American discourse since the election of President Donald Trump to recognize how labeling some coverage as worthy of subsidy and others not shows a lack of understanding on the role journalism plays in society.

This is a problematic policy because it will have a direct impact on the daily assigning and editing of a journalism product. But worse, the policy is an insult to the audience.

A great mentor of mine once lashed out at me for lamenting my inability to commission deep investigations at the publication I was working for at the time. “How dare you assume that the recipe in the entertainment section isn’t as important to the reader!” she argued. “Maybe their spouse just died from a sudden illness and the only thing getting that person through the day is the delight they get from baking those cookies from the recipe in your newspaper.”

Never assume to know what “real journalism” is. The program assumes any subject that doesn’t fit its narrow criteria isn’t worthy of support. It speaks to a fundamental misunderstanding of all the important roles that journalism fills in our lives.

There were some other things that also stood out to me. For an organization to be eligible, it needs to employ two or more journalists who work a minimum of 26 hours per week, on average, and who are employed for at least 40 consecutive weeks. I conducted a straw poll of several emerging digital media publications to get a sense of how many full-time employees (FTE) they employ.

Publications younger than 24 months old were far more likely to have fewer than two FTEs. The program will hinder seed-stage journalism development by favoring mature publications (and, generally speaking, publications that don’t reflect a diversity of voices) at the very time it should be kickstarting new approaches. As Erin Millar, founder and CEO of The Discourse, told me, “If we want to see a more diverse and sustainable ecosystem that includes different types of players, the announcement sets us back, not forward.”

The mandatory full-time status for eligibility also ignores the vital role that freelance journalists play in the news ecosystem. According to Statistics Canada, as of 2016, there are about 12,000 people who identify “journalist” as their profession. Of those, it’s safe to assume that the number of people not employed full-time with a newsroom is in the thousands.

In a time with more independent workers who need support than ever, this policy contains nothing that would satisfy those gig economy workers.

Finally, there was no mention of the role the CBC could play in helping to solve some of the legitimate news-desert concerns the policy was aiming to fix. The same day the Canadian government was announcing its program, the BBC announced plans across the pond to launch a charity to fund local news reporting in Britain. It remains a mystery to me why the government chose to create a new policy tool instead of leveraging the one that was sitting right under its nose the whole time.

For the record, I do believe that The Logic would be eligible for the program because we cover democratic institutions. But as I’ve stated since the beginning, and as I’ve tried to outline here, a do-no-harm mantra should’ve been applied to any policy approach. On that, this policy has failed.

A spokesperson for the Liberal Party said the ""highest levels of security are implemented for all data, communications ...","Several Elections Canada webpages and personal websites from MPs don't have the basic encryption necessary to stop your information from being hacked as it's sent from point A to point B.

Pages to request publications from Elections Canada, as well as the websites of Liberal, Conservative and NDP MPs use an outdated, unprotected chain to carry information you send to them through the network.

Liberal Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould, Conservative Finance Critic Pierre Poilievre and the NDP's Ruth Ellen Brosseau had this deficiency on the ""contact me"" form that asks for personal information — like your email, name and address — before sending feedback to your MP. Gould and other Liberal MPs updated their sites after queries from CBC News.

Conservative Party spokesperson Cory Hann said the party's websites all adhere to proper encryption standards, but the sites of individual MPs are not run by the party.

NDP spokesperson Jonathan Gauvin said the party has ""been in the process of updating all sites to ensure they're secure for users"" and they're ""committed to ensuring this is the default for all of our sites.""

There are two different protocols for sending data between your browser and the website you're connected with, the unsecure ""HTTP,"" and ""HTTPS"" — the secure version, with proper encryption — where the ""s"" stands for ""secure.""

Banks and credit card-based sites like Amazon started using HTTPS about 20 years ago, and social media sites have had it in place for more than a decade.

""This is what you can really consider the minimum 'security 101' for your website,"" said Aleksander Essex, a cyber security expert at Western University who specializes in democratic institutions.

He said if major political players — like Elections Canada and MPs — haven't fixed their websites yet, it's time to consider ""what kind of message is that sending.""

Elections Canada said they're aware of the security gaps and are working to fix them.

""We share the view that this is an important security measure. We are working on the final stages of implementing HTTPS on our site,"" they said in an email.

Fears of voter suppression

Basic HTTPS encryption isn't just about protecting information flowing through the internet, Essex said. It's about the user knowing their information will be kept confidential and giving people confidence they're interacting with legitimate organizations.

Without proper security, hackers are able to alter information on a website, including redirecting users to decoy pages. In the case of Elections Canada, Essex said these tactics could be used for voter suppression if information like where to vote is manipulated because the site isn't protected.

Essex said he first reached out to the agency eight months ago to flag the issue.

""I don't see any technical reason that it would take as long as it has,"" he said, adding a single web page can be converted into a HTTPS-safe site in a few minutes.

""Ultimately it comes down to the organization's priorities.""

Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale joins Power & Politics to discuss the government’s new cyber security strategy and what it means for Canadians. 6:30

A spokesperson for the Liberal Party said the ""highest levels of security are implemented for all data, communications, and records.""

When asked if Canadians should be concerned about sharing personal information over Liberal-affiliated websites, Braeden Caley said the party takes data security seriously.

""We are also providing 2019 candidates, campaign teams, and campaign officials with comprehensive resources and guides on best practices for information security online, on social media, and more broadly.""

Not every MP's web page is a security risk. Many MPs are already using HTTPS and all of the parties' primary websites are properly protected.

Similarly, most of Elections Canada's site uses a secure connection when it asks for your information.

'Not sending the right message'

Despite steps to fix the problems, Essex said it should worry Canadians that many MPs and the country's election agency are still operating at 1990s-level internet security.

""They say 'we would like to hear from you please sign up give us your email' and they send it insecurely over the unencrypted connection. It is not sending the right message,"" he said.

It's not a critical vulnerability, but that doesn't mean it should be tolerated.

""Turning this on is like the minimum thing that they could do.""

Political parties have created perplexing cyber security issues, as they are not beholden to privacy laws in Canada.

It's gotten so bad that Canada's Chief Electoral Officer Stéphane Perrault has called them out for being the weak link in the chain.

Of the 1,490 random Canadians asked over March 19 and 20 who they would mostly likely vote for — or would “lean toward” voting for — “if a federal election were held today,” 41 per cent said they would vote Conservative versus 35 per cent for the Liberals, with the NDP coming in third place with 14 per cent. Given the polling methodology’s projected margin of error of “plus or minus three per cent, 19 times out of 20,” those rankings have essentially been locked in the same positions since a Forum Research survey in January 2018 that placed the Conservatives at 43 per cent, the Liberals at 38 per cent and the NDP at 12 per cent. A second Forum poll conducted during the same period found favourable sentiments across the country toward most of the big proposals in the budget.

More than half of its respondents support the planned introduction of a national pharmacare program (55 per cent), while a solid majority was behind offering financial aid to upgrade worker skills and training (57 per cent) and a plan that would allow senior citizens to work part-time while still collecting the guaranteed income supplement (57 per cent). About half of those polled also support financial incentives for first-time home buyers (47 per cent) and people looking to purchase zero-emission vehicles (47 per cent). Less popular is a proposal to allocate more federal money to speed up asylum claims, with 38 per cent opposed and 32 per cent in favour. The introduction of a federal carbon tax, meanwhile, was rejected by 46 per cent of respondents, with 39 per cent saying they oppose it “strongly.” “A lot of the individual measures in the budget are actually fairly popular,” said Forum’s Gary Milakovic. “That’s the thing that’s most interesting: on the individual planks, people are saying ‘Yes, these things are good. We like the idea of national pharmacare, the homebuyers’ incentive is a great idea.’ But when you actually look at the ‘political horse race,’ as we’ve been seeing it for some time now, it’s not shifting the needle in favour of the Liberals. “The one thing that I will say is that there’s been a lot of negative press related to SNC-Lavalin and the government right now, but we haven’t seen that significantly affect our results. They’ve more or less been stable for the last little while … We did a poll slightly after Jody Wilson-Raybould testified and we saw similar numbers from what we’ve seen in the past.” But despite support for most of the proposals put forth by Finance Minister Bill Morneau in Ottawa last Tuesday, the overwhelming opinion among those polled by Forum was that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Liberals are “bad economic managers.” An even 50 per cent of respondents replied “bad” when asked “In general, are the Liberals good economic managers, bad economic managers or neither?” — with 32 per cent saying they were “very bad” — while 30 per cent said “neither.” Just 20 per cent felt the Liberals fell in the “good” category, and only one in 20 respondents felt the job they’re doing qualifies as “very good.”

The current data projects 173 seats for the Tories in the House of Commons if an election were held immediately, with the Liberals nipping at their heels with 143 and the NDP and the Green Party far behind with 21 and one seats, respectively. The new polls show the Conservatives most popular in Alberta, where 70 per cent of respondents would vote for them, and least popular in Quebec, where only 22 per cent would do the same. The Liberals were most popular in Quebec, with 54 per cent support, and least popular in Alberta, at 17 per cent. Ontario, for its part, mirrored the national averages, with 41 per cent of respondents opting for the Conservatives, 37 per cent for the Liberals and 15 per cent for the NDP.

They have to be made fully independent. Opposition committee members have to have the authority to call witnesses whether the government majority approves or not.

We saw what a partisan farce a Commons committee could be when the Liberal majority on the Justice committee voted last week to shut down their already only half-assed investigation into the SNC-Lavalin scandal.

To make an even greater mockery of the democratic process, the Liberals voted to kill off the inquiry behind closed doors, with no members of the public or television cameras present.

The opposition Conservatives and New Democrats did what they could to protest.

On Tuesday afternoon (the same day as the Liberals stuck a knife in the Lavscam hearings), the two main opposition parties tried to drown out Finance Minister Bill Morneau in the Commons chamber itself. When Morneau rose to deliver his annual budget address, the opposition raised several points of order, interrupted with questions of privilege and shouted “Cover up! Cover up!” over his speech.

The Conservative caucus then rose en masse and marched out of the chamber.

Overnight on Wednesday, the Conservatives also held up Commons business by insisting on individual votes on scores of separate budget resolutions, rather than passing them in one big motion, as is the custom.

All of these demonstrations were impressive – plus entirely justified. And they had the indirect effect of sucking all the attention away from the Liberals’ big-spending, feel-good, pre-election budget.

But the protests got the opposition and the Canadian public exactly nowhere on Lavscam.

We know no more now than we did before all the antics and theatrics, because the problem is not a lack of opposition horn blowing and noisemaking, it is the toothless nature of Commons committees. Until that is changed, there will never be any meaningful way to force the truth out when the government of the day would rather the facts stay buried.

Randy Boissonnault, the Liberal MP for Edmonton Centre and one of the leaders of efforts to shut down the Lavscam hearings prematurely, insisted there was no need to continue. Wilson-Raybould had testified, Boissonnault pointed out, as had Michael Wernick, the now “retired” clerk of the Privy Council, and Gerald Butts, the P.M.’s former principal secretary.

“It is now time … [to] return to the work of the Justice committee,” Boissonnault said. (As if getting to the bottom of a potential major breach of Canada’s justice system isn’t the work the Justice committee.)

Remember, it was Boissonnault who tried to convince Canadians that Wilson-Raybould couldn’t be asked to testify the first time because Commons committees are not investigative bodies.

Boissonnault and the Liberal majority on the committee have from the beginning always put Liberal Party interests ahead of the interests of their constituents, as Canadians, to learn what really happened last fall when Trudeau, senior staffers and the supposedly non-partisan clerk tried on many occasions to pressure Wilson-Raybould into cutting SNC a deal in court that would enable the company to avoid prosecution on an enormous and elaborate bribery and fraud scheme.

There aren’t many features of the U.S. congressional system that I would like to adopt in our Parliamentary system, but their independent committee structure is one.

The majority party has lots of control over when House or Senate business and legislation gets discussed and voted on, but the majority cannot prevent the minority party from calling witnesses and entering documents and reports into the committee record.

And there’s no end in sight.

There’s only one sure exit from this scandal. The question now is whether the Trudeau Liberal government is willing to consider it. Or determined to continue bleeding, everyday.

Again last week the Liberals attempted to suffocate the story, shutting down the justice committee and tryng to change the channel to their budget. When that failed, Liberals reacted with internecine attacks on former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board President Jane Philpott.

It was another failure. The counter-attacks on Wilson-Raybould and Philpott gave more fodder to pundit shows and newspaper columnists—and picked the weakest ground to fight on. According to IPSOS pollster Darryl Bricker, surveys show Canadians are twice as likely to believe Wilson-Raybould than Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

For seven weeks the Liberal Party has been losing a war of siege and attrition. In January the Conservatives were languishing, the NDP was on its back and the Liberals were cruising. Now the Liberals risk falling beneath 30 per cent support, Nanos and IPSOS show the NDP has rebounded to 20 per cent and the Conservatives have climbed to the mid or high 30s.

Against this siege the Trudeau Liberals have no ammunition. If the Liberals had evidence that Wilson-Raybould’s story was untrue, Liberal MPs would have brought it to the justice committee weeks ago. But none of the justice committee testimony has refuted the central claim that there were multiple improper attempts to interfere in a criminal prosecution.

Now the siege is about to tighten. Soon, Wilson-Raybould will table more evidence, including emails and texts. Only she knows what it will say. But it will not help the PM. And it will be news.

By now it should be crystal clear to Liberal strategists and party grandees they cannot prevent Canadians from getting the truth about the PMO’s interactions with Wilson-Raybould. There is too much interest in this story—rightfully so, because any attempted interference in a criminal prosecution is profoundly serious—and it appears, one way or another, Wilson-Raybould is determined to tell it.

The Trudeau Liberals need to stop doing what can’t work—and take the only path that might.

The Prime Minister needs to tell Canadians he’s done some real soul-searching. He needs to admit to making mistakes. Ask for forgiveness. Call an inquiry. And commit to working hard to get back on agenda and rebuilding trust.

Yes, it will hurt. More PMO staff may resign. There could be a finding that Trudeau broke the constitutionally-embedded legal principle of non-interference in prosecutions.

But the alternative is more painful. The Trudeau Liberal government isn’t just facing weeks of more damaging evidence with a loser communications strategy. An election is seven months away. Based on polls today, the most likely outcome of is some sort of minority Parliament. And that opens the door to the justice committee—even if the Liberals continue to govern—investigating the scandal fully, calling witnesses and issuing subpoenas.

Those who are loyal to their political principles know that defending what’s not defendable isn’t just a fool’s strategy. It’s political tragedy. Mistakes made can’t be unmade. No amount of spin annihilates them. The true test of political principle and loyalty isn’t telling a leader he’s always right, it’s telling him when he’s wrong. For Liberals, it’s that time now.

“I hope that our candidates will represent our country, but … we won’t do anything to attract people with different backgrounds. I think these people are coming right now,” Bernier told reporters in Ottawa.

Bernier said he “hopes” that the PPC has a “huge diversity” of candidates, but that it won’t impose any diversity requirements on those who run.

In comparison, part of the Liberal Party’s nomination process is to ensure that a “thorough search” has been conducted for women candidates or others who reflect the demographics of the riding they hope to be nominated in. The NDP have also instituted diversity-based rules recently, requiring that leadership candidates in 2017 collect 50 per cent of required signatures from women in the party, and 100 of the required 500 signatures from traditionally marginalized groups.

Bernier and Johanne Mennie, the party’s communications director, held a press conference on Monday to announce that the PPC had opened its online selection process. It will be open until April 23, with candidate selection meetings to follow between May 7 and May 13.

“The PPC is on target and will be ready for the general elections,” Mennie said.

Bernier said that the party will conduct thorough background checks of potential candidates, similarly to what they did for the executives of the party’s electoral district associations (EDA). The party’s leader said it conducted background checks of EDA presidents, as well as checks of their social media accounts.

Bernier said it’s important that candidates share the values of the party, in order to be nominated.

“That’s most important to us; these people must share our values,” Bernier said.

“People who don’t share our values, they can create their own party, they are not welcome in our party,” Bernier said.

The PPC leader also said he hasn’t called any of his former colleagues in the Conservative Party in the House of Commons or the Senate, to try and convince them to join the PPC as candidates. He maintained that his party will field a full 338 candidates in fall’s general election.

The People’s Party ran its first three candidates in the Feb. 25 byelections in Outremont, York–Simcoe and Burnaby South. Jennifer M. Clarke, who was beat out of the Conservative Party nomination in Nanaimo—Ladysmith, is the People’s Party candidate in the byelection in the riding that was recently announced to be held on May 6.

The Hill Times reported Monday that single-term former Conservative MP Corneliu Chisu would be running as a candidate for the People’s Party in the next election.

He said the NFA will in no circumstances lend its support to a People’s Party of Canada candidate. “We do not see ...,"The chair of the Liberal rural caucus says he trusts Border and Organized Crime Minister Bill Blair to take the “right approach” as he prepares to announce whether the government will ban handguns and assault-style weapons following a lengthy consultation.

Liberal MP Francis Drouin (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Ont.), who now chairs the Liberal rural caucus, said a handgun ban would be “an issue” in his riding, but that he trusted Mr. Blair to handle the file.

“Obviously a handgun ban is an issue in the riding. But I think Canadians understand the value of seeing how we address gun violence. I don’t know if a ban is the right question, but I trust minister blair, who is a former chief of police, who will have the right approach on this.”

Independent Senator Pierre Dalphond (De Lorimier, Que.) called on the government to ban all automatic and semi-automatic guns in a March 21 press release, pointing as an example to the New Zealand government’s move last week to ban assault-style weapons from the country in the wake of the shooting massacre of 50 Muslim people in that country by a white supremacist. Gun control advocacy group PolySeSouvient said in a March 22 press release that the action by New Zealand’s government highlighted “the appalling lack of political courage exhibited so far by the Liberal government in response to the 2017 [terrorist shooting] tragedy at the Quebec Mosque.”

Fully automatic guns are already prohibited in Canada, meaning they can only be possessed even by licensed gun owners in limited circumstances. The Quebec Mosque shooter used a semi-automatic rifle to kill six people. Both the Quebec Mosque shooter and the New Zealand shooter were white men, openly racist, who used semi-automatic rifles to murder Muslims.

Liberal MPs from rural ridings have expressed concern in the past about the government’s gun control initiatives, including Mr. Blair’s (Scarborough Southwest, Ont.) consultations on possibly banning handguns and assault weapons, and Bill C-71, which would also extensively reform existing gun control rules. A Liberal MP told The Hill Times a year ago on a not-for-attribution basis that Bill C-71—which has since advanced to committee stage in the Senate—was “scaring the hell out of” Liberal MPs, particularly those from rural ridings. Multiple sources told The Hill Times at the time that former Liberal rural caucus chair T.J. Harvey was rebuked by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Papineau, Que.) when he raised those concerns in a caucus meeting.

National Firearms Association president Sheldon Clare says his organization will try to rally members and supporters in 22 vulnerable Liberal ridings to defeat the incumbents in favour of Conservative MPs. The Conservative Party has strongly opposed any new gun control measures.

“We think that what’s going to end up solving this will be the election,” he said.

A spokesperson for Mr. Blair said his report would be made public “in early 2019.” Mr. Blair told the CBC in January that he had completed the consultations and hoped to bring the results before cabinet in the following two weeks.

Mr. Drouin, who won his seat in 2015 by more than 10,000 votes, said he wasn’t concerned by the NFA’s plans for the coming election campaign.

“It’s not going to change anything for me, no.”

The federal Conservatives have been highlighting Bill C-71 in Facebook ads designed to raise money from their base since the bill was introduced, and Conservative candidates in rural ridings will likely raise it with voters during the election campaign.

Mr. Clare said the NFA’s campaigning “will include organizing our representatives on the ground to encourage their members in local shooting clubs to look critically at the candidates who are presented to them.” He said the campaign would not likely include paid advertising. He declined to identify which ridings the NFA was planning to campaign in.

Mr. Clare said the NFA may urge voters to support NDP candidates in some ridings if it appears that is the best way to unseat a Liberal. He said the NFA will in no circumstances lend its support to a People’s Party of Canada candidate.

“We do not see them as viable candidates at all,” he said.

Gun bill amendments coming in early April

The government’s gun control bill, C-71, is currently before the Senate National Security Committee. Senators expect the committee will start its clause-by-clause examination of the bill during the second week of April.

Opponents of Bill C-71 concede that, like nearly all pieces of government legislation, it will ultimately pass. The Conservative Senate caucus is planning to put forward amendments to at least three parts of the bill, says the party’s critic for the bill in the Red Chamber, Conservative Senator Don Plett (Landmark, Man.): new rules around getting authorization to travel with a gun, the RCMP’s role classifying firearms, and the security of records kept under the legislation.

Bill C-71 will create a new RCMP database to hold information on who has bought and sold guns, and when they did so, though the government says it will not track information on the guns themselves. The bill will require those who sell guns to contact the Canadian Firearms Program (CFP)—a part of the RCMP—to confirm that buyers have a valid firearms license, and thus are allowed to buy and own a gun. The bill will expand background checks for those who apply for a firearms license, require gun retailers to keep records of gun sales and inventory, and restore some powers over gun travel authorizations and classification to the RCMP.

Sen. Plett said the Conservatives would prefer to see the bill scrapped, but will bring forward amendments nonetheless. He said one or more of the amendments would be related to C-71 restoring to the RCMP the power to decide how to classify firearms—as non-restricted, restricted, or prohibited, each of which is more rigorously controlled under law. The previous Conservative government under prime minister Stephen Harper changed the law to give the government the final say on those decisions.

“We believe that that’s something that should be left to Parliament, elected officials,” said Sen. Plett.

Independent Senator André Pratte (De Salaberry, Que.) the bill’s sponsor in the Senate and another member of the Senate National Security Committee, told The Hill Times that he would not be putting forward amendments to the bill.

“The bill is a result of a balancing exercise between the need to better protect public safety, and the concerns and the privileges of gun owners, who are concerned that any new measure on gun control will impose on them an excessive burden,” said Sen. Pratte.

“I think the government was very aware of that, so they tried to arrive at the right balance. They didn’t go as far as the gun control advocates would have liked them to do, and they went further than probably many gun owners would have wished they had done. So they decided to try to strike a balance, and I think the balance is there, frankly.”

Sen. Pratte said he has met with gun control advocates and opponents, and in December travelled with Conservative Senator Dennis Patterson (Nunavut) to Iqaluit to meet with a group of Indigenous hunters who had concerns with the bill.

C-71: what’s in the bill

Here are some of the legal changes that will be brought in under Bill C-71, An Act to amend certain Acts and Regulations in relation to firearms.

Gun retailers will be required to keep records of gun sales and inventory, something many already do. The records will belong to the gun retailers, but police will be able to access the records with a warrant if needed.

Gun retailers will be required to check with the RCMP, through a hotline, that gun buyers still have valid licenses, something some gun retailers already do.

Private individuals selling or giving guns to other private individuals must also check with the RCMP that the person receiving the gun has a valid gun license.

The RCMP will provide gun sellers, private and retail, with a reference number as proof that the buyer’s license was validated. The RCMP will keep the reference number, licence numbers for the buyer and seller, and the date, but no data on the guns sold.

Background checks for those applying for a gun license will look for signs of mental illness “associated with violence,” and for criminal activity, throughout the applicant’s entire life. Background checks currently can only look back five years.

The RCMP is given back control over which guns fall under the different classes established by the government, each of which has different rules and restrictions.

Canada’s chief firearms officer will regain discretion over giving owners of restricted or prohibited guns authorization to transport them. Automatic authorization will be given to transport the weapons home from the store where they were bought, and back and forth from a shooting range.

The government will end a long dispute with Quebec, and provide it with old records from the long-gun registry, something the province has requested. Quebec recently established its own gun registry.

The prime minister fired off a flurry of verbal jabs at Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer, and also former prime minister Stephen Harper, giving a glimpse of what could be a heated campaign for the October election.

“Investing in people and communities is the way to grow the economy. Stephen Harper and the Conservatives still don’t get it. Andrew Sheer doesn’t get it either,” he said to a gym full of enthusiastic supporters.

“Under Stephen Harper, Canada had the worst growth rate we’d had since the depths of the Great Depression under R. B. Bennett.”

Trudeau then accused Sheer’s Conservatives of hoping to continue Harper’s policies by giving tax breaks to the wealthy while cutting programs for the middle and lower classes.

“They still think the way to create economic growth for everyone is to cut programs and give advantages and benefits to the wealthiest,” he said. “Well, that doesn’t trickle down to anyone and it didn’t work for 10 years.”

Trudeau pitched the upcoming election as an opportunity for all Canadians to step up and start talking about the kind of country they want to leave for their children and grandchildren.

“Do we want to invest in the middle class — shine on the world stage,” he asked, before warning that Canada “is seeing the rise of populism, aggressive, fear-based politics, just like the rest of the world.”

The crowd roared its approval when the prime minister suggested the best way to counter divisive populism is by recruiting “strong, compassionate people who’ve focused their lives on bringing people together and on empowering people.”

He lauded Taggart as one of those people from all walks of Canadian life who have invested in their communities in various ways to grow the economy, respond to the challenges of climate change and put Canada on the world stage.

Taggart admitted feeling a bit overwhelmed and emotional at being on stage, especially seeing her children holding up signs that read, “Team Tamara.”

The Order of British Columbia recipient said she wants to be the people’s voice in Ottawa, adding that her media career made her a good listener.

While Taggart steered clear of talking about the specifics of her campaign platform at the event, she has previously said that she wants to focus on affordable housing, protecting the environment while boosting the economy, and women’s health and safety.

She’s likely to face a tough challenge in Vancouver-Kingsway, which has been held by New Democrat MP Don Davies since 2008.

By David Ljunggren and Fergal Smith

OTTAWA/TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau remained under pressure over a corruption scandal on Wednesday as a legislator quit his party's caucus and a pre-election budget aimed at swaying key voters appeared to offer too little to stem the tide of negative news.

The budget - the last before federal elections in October - lavished new spending on middle-class voters but ignored corporations. It also provided a little for key groups such as millennial voters who backed Trudeau in droves in Canada's 2015 election.

The decision by a legislator, who had defended a former minister at the center of a political scandal, to quit the ruling Liberal Party and sit as an independent dealt a fresh blow to Trudeau's embattled government.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations top officials working for him leaned on the then justice minister to ensure construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoided a corruption trial.

The political crisis threatens the government's chances of re-election. Polls have shown that Trudeau's Liberals could lose the vote as the damage from the scandal spreads.

The latest defection overshadowed Tuesday's budget which divided money between a large number of new initiatives and left few Canadians satisfied.

""It's just too broad,"" said Norman Levine, managing director at Portfolio Management Corporation. ""They wanted to please lots of people and ... when you try to please everybody you end up pleasing nobody, because you spread it too thin.""

Rob Edel, chief investment officer at Nicola Wealth Management, noted the government did not commit to reducing a budget deficit that is much larger than the Liberals promised. This was ""a political rather than an economic decision,"" he said.

The Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada as well as the Canadian Chamber of Commerce complained about the lack of tax reform. But the center-left Liberals may not care too much as their core supporters are progressive thinkers, women and younger voters. Finance Minister Bill Morneau stressed budget measures to help first-time home buyers, including allowing people to withdraw up to C$35,000 from a retirement savings account.

But asked on Wednesday how many younger first-time buyers actually had that much money available, he replied ""that will help some people in the middle income range ... not everyone, for sure.""

The main opposition Conservative Party has relentlessly attacked Trudeau over the SNC-Lavalin affair and described the budget as a bribe. Conservative leader Andrew Scheer has continuously demanded Trudeau's resignation, which some Conservatives privately worry is the wrong approach.

Two strategists with deep ties to the party said given the complexity of the affair, and former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould's statement that no one involved had broken any laws, Canadians would not necessarily agree that Trudeau should quit now.

Conservative over-confidence or missteps could be the Liberals' best hope for reversing their slumping poll numbers, pollster Nick Nanos said.

On Tuesday, opposition lawmakers delayed Morneau's budget presentation for an hour.

Conservatives initially drowned out his speech in the House of Commons with shouts and jeers and then walked out en masse, a tactic that did not sit well with some Canadians on social media.

“Canadians now have the necessary information to arrive at a conclusion.”

Given the Liberals on the justice committee released those words about their ‘investigation’ into the five-alarm fire that is the SNC-Lavalin scandal on the very day that Michael Wernick was claimed as another of its victims—based largely on his serial immolation in front of their committee—we’re going to need a new word for “chutzpah”.

Justin Trudeau has now lost his top aide, two of his top ministers, and the country’s top bureaucrat because of SNC, and the Liberals are asking us to “arrive at a conclusion”?

What conclusion do they think anyone can draw from trying to shut down inquiries into this clusterf–k, other than ‘these people definitely have something to hide’?

It’s breathtaking.

So bravo, Liberal Party of Canada; congratulations on achieving in three years a level of cynicism and contempt for the electorate most governments only reach at the tail end of their third mandate. It’s about the only thing the Liberals have managed to deliver that’s under-budget and ahead of schedule.

Principled Liberals must look back at 2015 like it was some kind of fever dream. Trudeau’s Liberals were going to be pro-women, transparent, non-partisan, evidence-based, for the middle class, and free from the all-controlling grip of the PMO. Now it’s 2019 and they’re gleefully trading women, transparency and evidence in favour of special interests, all at the direction of an ultra-partisan PMO.

And before the ‘two wrongs make a right’ brigade pops up to spew their whataboutery: the Liberals were supposed to be better than the gang they replaced, not the same or worse.

Even worse, in this case the Liberals deployed their deep bag of dirty tricks in the service of a company that has done things like bribe hospital managers and foreign governments to get their custom.

Had this firm been headquartered in a place like Calgary, or in an industry Justin Trudeau doesn’t give a toss about—like oil and gas—would the government have let it face the music? This is about politics, not jobs. Full stop.

Indeed, the gang who were all for evidence-based policy a few years back took SNC’s wild claims of catastrophic job loss at more or less face value. The government certainly didn’t press the company hard, if at all. Even Gerry Butts, Trudeau’s High Priest of Facts, could only mumble something about Finance having the figures when asked. Had they bothered to look, Liberals would have found a long-term investment in SNC from the Caisse de dépôt and the resulting commitment to keep SNC HQ in Montreal for years on end. No, SNC said ‘jump’ and Trudeau went through the roof.

And when the whole sordid tale finally came to light in the Feb. 7 edition of The Globe and Mail the Liberals went full Nixon instead of full transparency. Instead of treating the issue of the independence of the criminal justice system seriously the Liberals have tried to downplay it or—worse—treat it as a difference of opinion, a position that is both morally and ethically bankrupt.

From calling the story false to slandering Wilson-Raybould off-the-record, to muzzling her, to circumscribing her ability to speak, to now shutting down the entire committee investigation, the Liberals have resisted transparency at every turn. And if you believe the Ethics Commissioner is going to get to the bottom of this, then you, my friend, qualify for membership in the Trudeau Chapter of the Useful Idiots Club.

Instead of simply believing Wilson-Raybould—or Jane Philpott, for that matter—the Prime Minister has brushed them off as having either poor memories or poor comprehension skills. They simply experienced the inappropriate pressure differently, Trudeau explained, a line he first trotted out last summer to mansplain away an old groping allegation, a route out he had denied to others in his caucus facing similar allegations.

Because Trudeau just doesn’t live by normal standards or rules. He doesn’t pal around with the middle class and those hoping to join them. He hangs out with the jet set, the people who can afford cash for access, with the Aga Khan on his island and the tech titans who are polarizing our societies. These are his people. Of course he listened when SNC came calling.

And as the vice began to grip, Trudeau’s instinct was to politicize the public service in his defense, trotting out Wernick to run interference by caterwauling about the threat of violence on our streets. It was the same trick Trudeau pulled with Daniel Jean during the India trip when a convicted Sikh terrorist was spotted in his entourage. And you thought Stephen Harper was toxic for the non-partisan public service?

What’s worse, nothing will now change Trudeau’s mind on SNC. The company will get its deal, no matter what the federal courts or OECD say. On SNC, the Liberals have become the practitioners of the democratic failure they so harshly condemned in 2015.

The stories that some politicians across Canada shared with me about the downsides of team discipline are disconcerting. Social shunning can be very painful for those ...,"Seeking information, offering suggestions, arguing, saying no — these are all things that backbenchers should be doing regularly inside caucus.

A burning question for observers of the SNC-Lavalin affair is whether former cabinet ministers Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, who publicly opposed actions of their government, will be cut loose from the Liberal caucus. While some, including former deputy prime minister Sheila Copps, urge retribution, others in the party admire these MPs and want them to stay on. Whatever the pair’s political future, my research around party discipline suggests they can expect some rough treatment and career drudgery in the Liberal caucus.

Over the past year, I have had the privilege of interviewing 125 current and former politicians and political staff for a book I am writing about how party discipline has intensified in Canada in recent years. A common theme raised by current and former members of cabinet, party leaders, party whips, private members and political staff is that everyone affiliated with a political party identifies as a member of a team. They form bonds as they go on a journey together to realize common goals. Sparring with adversaries occurs with the confidence that teammates have your back. Members understand they must never be a public distraction for the team leader.

Here are snippets of what some current MPs told me in the months before the SNC-Lavalin story:

In a government caucus, there are those in cabinet, and there are those working hard to join it. Backbenchers know that when they go astray of a certain whipped vote, it doesn’t help their ambitions. We keep saying this is a team sport, but the House of Commons was not set up to be a team sport. — Liberal MP

To rise above the party positions and the leadership’s positions that got you elected is a form of narcissistic conceit. For you to go out against the party line on something, guess what? People aren’t going to vote for you because you’re bucking the party line. It might be once in four years that you can take a different position. — Conservative MP

When I got elected, I naively expected that caucus was the place where MPs could have a free and frank discussion of issues of the day. The biggest single disappointment upon becoming an MP was finding that caucus meetings were structured to begin with the head table sort of providing us with our marching orders. — New Democratic Party MP

Within a political team, there is considerable deference to authority, and individual behaviour conforms to social and institutional norms. Many backbenchers — that is, members who are not part of cabinet — find national caucus meetings to be stifling rather than enlightening. The leadership says they should come to the microphone to share opinions, but there is so much fear that people bottle things up. They loathe the watchful eyes of powerful staff in the leader’s office and who appear to lack respect for the elected.

Some parliamentarians get annoyed that the party leadership, through the whip, seeks to influence behaviour by deciding on their assignments to particular committees, vetting their requests to be away from Ottawa, authorizing participation on parliamentary junkets and generally controlling who gets to speak in the House. A backbencher has shockingly little policy influence. Staying silent in caucus meetings, staying away from a vote in the House, offering no public comment and declining to share social media posts are the most common ways for them to publicly express dissent — except that in a political team a backbencher’s silence is equated with support.

Backbenchers are unfairly derided by pundits as trained seals who mindlessly follow their masters’ orders. In reality, they are interesting people who get involved in party politics hoping to make a difference. But too often independent thinking does give way to a team mentality. The transformation begins the moment they sign a “values contract” when they want to be nominated as party candidates. The contract is signed during the candidate vetting process to screen out people who might attract negative attention during a campaign and those unwilling to commit to the party’s core values, such as the principles articulated in the party constitution. The team ethos is reinforced through a daily barrage of digital messages, including hashtags that emphasize the team leader (such as #TeamTrudeau).

Most government backbenchers settle into a morale-zapping role of repeating approved messages, of jostling for the opportunity to speak in the House, of lobbying ministerial staff and of a public image as government cheerleaders. Those who want to be promoted cooperate with the leadership. Others focus on helping constituents with casework. Team players know not to stray too far from the party line in public.

It appears that Wilson-Raybould and Philpott are less inclined to obey the normal rules of conduct for members of a governing party’s caucus. The corresponding erosion of trust between them and their Liberal colleagues, especially those holding positions of power, will likely cause them to be marginalized.

The worst part of being on the outs with the leadership is not the lost perks or privileges. In my interviews, current and former politicians informed me that the truly horrible bit is how political teammates treat nonconformists. Many members of a political team who praise ministers feel a duty to shun outcasts. Hardcore partisans and leader loyalists will be furious and/or deeply disappointed. Some will keep a distance so as not to jeopardize their own prospects of promotion. It can be difficult to distinguish them from those who find the whole matter too awkward to deal with.

The stories that some politicians across Canada shared with me about the downsides of team discipline are disconcerting. Social shunning can be very painful for those on the receiving end: a lack of eye contact, avoided conversation, people sitting on another side of the room, not being invited to come along for lunch or a drink, and so forth. Outside of caucus meetings, people in positions of power communicate their seething displeasure by ignoring phone calls and being slow to respond to messages. Fortunately, some parliamentarians who disagree with a renegade’s actions will nevertheless go out of their way to be kind, which is a pleasant contrast to those who hide behind a mask of fake smiles. But for the most part, being socially ostracized within a political team is the hardest part of going rogue — and the hurt is largely internalized because the timeworn principle of caucus confidentiality means the poor treatment cannot be publicly discussed.

Occasionally, independent thinkers bristle at the confines of party affiliation. Usually mavericks are lone wolves who gradually became isolated from the team. Months of fruitless internal agitation and social pinpricks erupt in a public outburst that marks the end of the parliamentarian’s time with the party. Those who can’t stomach the public worship of their party leader and the party line have a few options available to them: they can wait until someone else takes the helm; they can wreak havoc internally through various forms of civil disobedience and destabilizing the leader’s authority; they can sit as independents; cross the floor to another party; or relinquish their seat. On occasion a cluster of dissidents leave together to form their own parliamentary group to express a leadership breakdown, such as the Democratic Representative Caucus that split from the Canadian Alliance in 2001 or Québec Debout, which splintered off from the Bloc Québécois in 2018.

Much ink has been spilled in recent years about power imbalances in politics. In January 2018, Minister Patty Hajdu said in the House of Commons that “Parliament Hill features distinct power imbalances…It is a place where often the victimized individual is blamed for the harassment that she herself has experienced.” Still, very little is known about mobbing behaviours toward backbenchers within parliamentary caucuses. Understanding these dynamics is important, because a strong, healthy democracy requires that a diversity of points of view can be safely expressed.

The power imbalances in a governing party’s caucus are stark, given that a prime minister controls upward mobility. It is especially disconcerting when backbenchers affiliated with a governing party are portrayed as troublemakers when they question those in positions of authority. Canada’s system of responsible government fails when backbenchers in a majority government do not hold the cabinet and senior political staff to account.

Encouraging backbenchers to repeat government messages and to refer to “our government” fosters a mistaken identity. Backbenchers need reminding that they are not the government. Probing, pestering, seeking information, offering suggestions, arguing, saying no — these are all things that backbenchers should be regularly doing in a respectful manner. The stars of any political team need to accept that they will be held to account, and they should offer meaningful opportunities for this to happen. They should offer clarity about what would go too far.

Political leaders say that caucus is the place to voice concerns, but in reality caucus is a structure that rewards conformity and frowns on disruption. Ministerial caucus advisory committees used in the Ralph Klein government in Alberta and adopted by Prime Minister Stephen Harper are noteworthy mechanisms that require ministers to engage in meaningful consultation with the caucus. But ensuring that caucus is a safe space for colleagues who challenge authority is another matter.

It would take someone with a strong backbone to advocate for minimum standards for how all members of a caucus should be treated, particularly ways to protect those involved in a reasonable disagreement with the team leader. Perhaps certain Liberal MPs — if they are not ousted from caucus — will explore culture change from within.

Kinsella is a veteran of Liberal election war rooms that supported the campaigns of Dalton McGuinty in Ontario and ...,"Within a day of the official launch of the 2019 Alberta election, the Alberta NDP had already dropped a nasty negative ad.

The ad attacked United Conservative Party (UCP) leader Jason Kenney for comments he made 20 years ago about a campaign he was involved in 30 years ago, in which he challenged the idea that same-sex couples ought to have the rights as couple of the opposite sex.

The ad begins with Kenny clearly boasting about his part in helping to overturn “the first gay spousal law in North America.” (The issue involved a law in San Francisco.)

Then there’s a swell of the kind of ominous tones you hear in any negative ad as a female voice intones that “Kenney stopped dying AIDS patients from seeing their same-sex spouses in hospital.”

And then, the voice actor does what she gets paid to do: Feign a tone of horrified incredulity as she asks: “Is this a premier?”

As attack ads go, it’s a pretty good punch.

WATCH: Jason Kenney invited us to look at his record – so we did. Anyone who brags about barring people from saying their final goodbyes to their loved ones in hospital is just not fit to be Premier. #ableg #abvote pic.twitter.com/XBNgfGsPCI — albertaNDP (@albertaNDP) March 20, 2019

“In order for a so-called negative ad to work, it has to have a centre of truth. It has have an essential truth,” said Warren Kinsella, the author, political commentator, and president of the Toronto-based consultancy The Daisy Group.

Kinsella is a veteran of Liberal election war rooms that supported the campaigns of Dalton McGuinty in Ontario and Jean Chretien at the federal level.

That “essential truth”, in this case, is that Kenney is mean or at least can be mean to his opponents. The cheeky smile that appears on Kenney’s face in that NDP ad after he boasts about defeating a same-sex law is the “killer” part of that ad where that “essential truth” is revealed. Kinsella said he expects the ad to take some of the starch out of the UCP numbers.

But then the NDP, whether provincially or federally, has developed a reputation over the last couple of decades as a party that is definitely not afraid of throwing a punch — and the harder they can hit, the better.

“It’s true. That’s their reputation. They’re good at it,” said Kinsella.

In the 2008 federal election, the NDP whipped up one of the all-time nasty attack ads. It was in French for Quebec voters, aimed at Stephen Harper’s Conservatives.

Among other things, the ad warned that a vote for the Conservatives was a vote for war — as battalions of animated soldiers came marching towards the viewers while images of Harper and George W. Bush floated at the top of the screen.

WATCH: The 2008 NDP election ad attacking the Conservatives

“It was one of the harshest ads to be run in Canadian political history,” said Dennis Matthews, a vice-president at the Toronto-based public affairs firm Enterprise Canada.

Matthews is a veteran of Harper-era campaign war rooms and helped design and write some of the advertising and marketing material that powered some of Harper’s successful election campaigns. He was in the Conservative war room in 2008 when that NDP ad dropped.

“It was over the top, but it really hammered the Conservative vote in Quebec,” Matthews said.

In 2017, the NDP fired some shots at incumbent BC Liberal Premier Christy Clark with vague insinuations she was corrupt. In 2013 in Nova Scotia, NDP ads tried to scare voters away from Stephen McNeil’s Liberals with dark warnings about threats to the health care system. And in the 2015 federal election, an NDP dropped what amounts to the meanest insult of all for a progressive voter: The NDP suggested Justin Trudeau was just like Stephen Harper and Donald Trump.

When asked what they don’t like about politics, voters and even politicians themselves often say they don’t like all the negativity, particularly at election time when there’s a plethora of attack ads often from all parties.

But here’s the thing: When it comes to the chance to hold on to or seize power, political parties like the Alberta NDP and many others go negative because going negative works.

“People pay more attention to those ads,” Kinsella said.

“And negative ads do bring down the support of your opponent,” Matthews said.

WATCH: Kenney says NDP attacks on him are “desperate”

Negative ads are not designed to turn a supporter from one party to a supporter of another party. Instead, they are all about damaging an opponent’s ability to recruit volunteers, fundraise and, most of all, to suppress an opponent’s voter turnout.

The most important thing political parties do leading up to and during a campaign is identify their supporters and then get those supporters to the polls. A strong negative attack ad could, in the case at hand, get potential UCP supporters doubting their commitment to voting.

No one expects a UCP supporter to turn into an NDP supporter. But, there are UCP supporters who may have wished that Brian Jean beat Kenney for the UCP leadership 18 months ago and a good negative campaign against Kenney could get that kind of supporter to stay at home on polling day.

Negative ads are also intended to sap morale of the opposing campaign.

The Alberta NDP has been running an online campaign attacking Kenney for weeks now, mostly through a website, trying to help accomplish all of these objectives.

Kenney has vowed that his party’s political messaging will be positive and will avoid personal attacks. In that way, it’s a vow very similar to the one Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has made for the upcoming 2019 federal election.

It is time for change. Positive change that creates good jobs, brings common sense to government, and builds an Alberta that's strong and free. #ableg #abstrongandfree pic.twitter.com/AK09sL7Tci — Jason Kenney (@jkenney) March 19, 2019

But it’s a vow that’s easy to keep when you are, as Kenney is, ahead in the polls by a long shot. It gets a little tougher when the numbers for you and your party start to fall.

“When the numbers start to change, watch out, here’s comes Willie Horton,” Kinsella said, referring to one of the most devastating and infamous attack ads ever, released by supporters of George H.W. Bush attacking challenger Michael Dukakis for being soft on crime.

The ad blamed Dukakis, a state governor, for allowing Horton, a convicted killer serving a life sentence, to get a weekend furlough and then commit rape, assault and armed robbery. The ad was condemned as racist, but it had a devastating effect on Dukakis, who was soundly defeated by Bush.

But negative ads or negative political messaging can also have serious backlash effects.

Federal Liberals were widely ridiculed, for example, when they tried to scare voters in the 2006 federal election campaign with an ad warning about how, if Harper won, we would see an increase in “military presence in our cities. Canadian cities. Soldiers with guns.”

This ad, part of a series of “scary Harper” ads, started off with some scary drumbeats, followed by a grainy black-and-white image of Harper.

But federal Liberals benefited from an attack gone wrong back in 1993 when the Progressive Conservatives ran an ad that some — including some conservatives — saw as mocking Jean Chrétien for his crooked way of speaking, a result of Bell’s palsy Chretien had as a child.

This attack ad, mild by today’s standards, was widely credited for helping to turn the tide against Kim Campbell and in favour of Chretien.

Perhaps one of the most entertaining attacks ads came in the 2015 election when the NDP candidate in the Toronto riding of St. Paul’s, author Noah Richler, decided to put together a video attacking Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau. Richler would lose to Liberal Carolyn Bennett and would later chronicle the creation of that ad in his book The Candidate: Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail.

But it was an ad that gave the the NDP war room trying to support the national campaign of Thomas Mulcair fits even if it delighted political pundits.

Many of the New Democrats in Mulcair’s war room in 2015 ended up in Alberta, after Notley won power, and are still there. That’s because in Canadian political circles, each major party borrows heavily from and builds on earlier campaigns at all levels.

Liberals, Conservatives and New Democrats all tend to draw from the same group of pollsters, advisors, operatives and war room generals which means that tactics and strategy you might see from one party in a federal election years ago be put to use in a provincial election the same party is contesting now.","ANALYSIS: In Alberta and elsewhere, New Democrats have mastered the art of the negative election ad",Global News,https://globalnews.ca/news/5081715/new-democrats-negative-campaign-ads/

So the top guy at SNC says they never mentioned any numbers for job losses to anybody … so that means someone made up the 9,000 jobs lost if SNC moves, and would that not mean someone lied at the justice committee on the record? More than once that story was uttered as truth. But how can it be the truth if it is denied by the top man at SNC-Lavelin? Justin’s lies just keep catching up with him day after day. Even his most staunch supporters are running into huge logic conflicts that they cannot even deflect away with stupid, repeated talking points and slogans. Maybe someone in Liberal land needs to get his attention and confront the reality before us all? Or is Canada and its well being as a nation just not that important?

JUST MAKE IT UP

It’s possible Jason Kenney did make a mistake in the leadership race but come on Rachel Notley, how can you expect anyone to take you at your word when you turn the truth, eg. a single toll road to be built for heavy oilsands traffic, who will also be the only ones paying the toll, into a complete lie by telling people they will be paying a toll to get anywhere. Let’s see what the investigation comes up with to see if Mr. Kenney is half the liar you are.

TOUGH CHOICES

I will not, nor have I ever voted for the NDP. As for the Liberals, as long as we have a bleeding heart, apologetic for everything, throw tax money away prime minister, the Liberals will never get my vote. As for the UPC and Jason Kenney, I have not voted for him when he was running in my riding, and the candidate that is now running in my riding will probably not get my vote. It’s too bad that the politics in this country both provincially and federally have fallen to the low credibility it has. It’s not about running the province or country, it’s about finger-pointing, the childish bickering, the accusations, the opinions the other guys are wrong and we are right, the my-way-or-no-way attitude, and it’s all BS, political BS that costs us taxpayers. If the UCP wants my vote, then they need someone that can be trusted, honest, accountable, responsible, and has integrity. Unfortunately the last person I feel that fit this bill was Danielle Smith of the former Wildrose Party. Too bad she didn’t stick it out as she would have probably been premier and we probably wouldn’t be in the mess we are now. If the UCP are going to win this election, they need to get someone in position that the voters can support and respect, now!

Hopefully after these clowns are voted out, the signs will stay up for awhile so we know which neighbours to avoid, like the plague!

NO DEBATE

It’s too bad that Caylan Ford resigned from the Calgary Mountain View election race. It is quite apparent that if one offers a legitimate contrary perspective to any liberal leftist view you are branded a racist, a bigot or an Islamophobe. The irony is that the Liberals claim to be tolerant and inclusive of all ideas when in fact the opposite is true. The leftists in this country are so intolerant, such that when you have dissenting opinion they are unable to debate and can only resort to a fallacious argumentative strategy avoiding discussion of the topic and instead attacking the character or motives of the person making the argument. The leftists are only interested in being right and disinterested in healthy democratic debate. By suppressing genuine free speech democracy dies and all of us will suffer in the end.

PATRICK ANCELIN

(Now more than ever, you must be careful what you say.)

UNACCOUNTABLE

There is something terribly and fundamentally wrong with Canada’s justice system when the Liberal government under Justin Trudeau can shut down the SNC-Lavalin inquiry when they know they have been caught with their fingers in the cookie jar. Now the whole truth will never be made public. It’s like asking a caught-in-the-act bank robber how many years he wants to spend in prison and he replies, “none!” That’s exactly what the Liberal Party did when they shut down the inquiry. There should be some world court to hold a country’s government accountable for their actions and allow the truth to be heard. This fall’s federal election is when Canadians can have their say like the song goes, “Nah, nah, nah, nah, hey, hey, hey, goodbye.”

Wow, D’Arcy Lanovaz, president CUPE local 38. You can’t make this stuff up. The union is frustrated to the point of being angry. Wow, wow, wow. Apparently this group haven’t been paying attention since the crash of oil prices and the tragic election of CUPE’s Matron Saint, Ms. Notley. How many tens and tens of thousands of families have lost their livelihoods and homes, not to mention their families, while our natural resource sector struggles under the fumbling of Justin and Rachel. Where do these union types think the money comes from? How tough can these double- and triple-dipping pension types have it. Taxpayers deserve much better. The smartest thing the City of Calgary could do is start trimming the fat to get back to the real world. But that won’t happen so up, up, up go the taxes while the downward spiral of living standards continue. Keep up the good work, D’arcy.

HATE BREEDS HATE

I’m very saddened by the events that occurred in New Zealand, I honestly feel for those innocents and their families. Things like that should never happen. However, I believe it is a double edged sword. Hate breeds hate, this man had an agenda (even if it was misguided) because of Islamic actions in other parts of the world. I don’t condone it at all, but I also notice how the entire world is up in arms about this killing, but when an Islamic radical goes on a killing spree it’s just another news day, nobody is up in arms, nobody is protesting, especially within the Islamic community. It’s very sad, but it’s the truth. (I know you will never print this because it’s the truth.)

(Attacks are not ignored and are not ‘just another news day.’ All violence and threats of violence must be condemned.)

SHARE SOME LOVE

In light of the horrific Christchurch shootings, here’s my take on the hatred and violence we face in the world today. I was just contemplating about the shootings in two mosques in New Zealand as well as all the other recent shootings in places of worship. If you visit these places of worship, you’ll notice that there’s no hatred being preached in any of them. However, if you look at the world today, you’ll notice there’s less unity among people. I believe the culprit for all this hate is divisive politics, polarizing media, and lack of understanding between people. Many have lost the ability to listen to those who’re different from them. This is where all hate begins. When one person feels they don’t need to hear the other side. Let us all show each other love and unity. If you know someone of a different race or culture or faith, reach out to them, show some love and make sure you stand up for them.

BUT WHAT IF …

So Jody Wilson-Raybould is seeking re-election as a Liberal so that she can change the culture of conflict, partisanship etc. in government, which was one of her goals the first time. This is providing PM Justin Trudeau accepts her nomination and allows her to run under the Liberal banner, and we have heard that many times before from all kinds of political hopefuls. She claims that she never expected the national focus even though she is an accomplished lawyer. If she would have agreed to an independent, high-level retired judge advising her on the SNC-Lavalin affair, the end choice would still be hers but any controversy may not have been. She might still have her old job but now even if re-elected it could take a while to get off the backbench.

Came out of college indoctrinated with the lefty, socialist ideologies pushed throughout our school system. Everyone should be paid the same, why keep score during a game, someone’s feelings might get hurt, give him a good grade for doing bad in school. It really makes me sick. Not one thought of common sense in this article. All he keeps saying is it’s not fair. Well, whaaaa! Go cry in your beer. He mentions nothing of experience. Only age, race and gender. Typical liberal talking points. As an employer, I put huge stock in experience. I don’t want to retrain a new employee if I don’t have to. I will pay good employees more money to stay but you have to show me you’re worth the added investment. The article says “teenagers deserve the same wage” based on what? Why do they deserve the same wage? What have they done to show they deserve the same wage? What responsibilities do they have that requires the same wage? The writer suggest that kids need to earn more money to support their families? Really! That’s your MO. Do you know how silly that sounds. This thought process is a socialist ideology. People should be paid what they are worth to an employer and for a youth with zero experience and zero responsibilities, it’s worth very little.

DAVE SMITH

(Plenty of people would agree with you. And Ricky.)

A ROUGH GAME

So the NDP wants to make a mountain out of a molehill regarding the PC leadership campaign that saw Jason Kenney win. I have a news flash for them, that’s how the game is played. Remember Ed Stelmach? Third place on the ballot behind Jim Dinning and Ted Morton. Morton threw his support behind Stelmach and boom, Dinning is out. Too bad, really, Jim Dinning would have made a hell of a good premier. Look at B.C. The NDP were losing and the Green Party throws in behind them and it’s bye bye Liberals. As I said, it’s just the way the game’s played and all the parties do it. I’m not saying it’s right, but that’s just how it is. Don’t let Notley’s misfits get in your head over it. They’re sucking in the polls and will try anything to gain some traction.

JOHN HANCOCK

(When your track record is dismal, you need to find a shiny object.)

DON’T BLAME RACHEL

Hilarious to see Roy Peterson say “on election day, vote as you please, but for the sake of our kids, not NDP.” So somehow the Notley NDP government has been detrimental to the youth of Alberta? The government that finally got shovels into the ground on many badly needed schools? The government that raised the minimum wage to help bring the youth and working poor out of poverty? Somehow Jason Kenney’s racist and bigoted policies will better serve the youth of Alberta? Kenney really needs to pick up a book on how trickle down economics has never worked. Perhaps reading a book on being a decent human being might be a boost for Jason, too.

OUT TO LUNCH

This whole mess with the added fee for every bag of garbage outside of your bin is insane. The fact that the citizens of Calgary are becoming jaded sheep is beyond insane. The reason why I say this is because in the March 18 issue, people actually said that they agree with people paying more who generate more trash, 62% in fact. Are these 62% of the people forgetting that our lovely council downtown slashed the service in half while keeping the price the same?! Take my extra $3 out of the money that you are keeping for doing half the job, better yet, go back to collections every week and we won’t have to worry about extra bags. Not to mention the green cart (which I don’t use) also had its service cut in half over the winter but the rates also stayed the same. It’s always so easy for council to just charge more money instead of thinking of ways to make the system more efficient and doing their jobs properly. I wonder if they have put very much thought into how much it will cost to clean up all the illegal dump sites in ditches and such that will pop up because of this. It already exists as there is scum out there too cheap to take their garbage and dispose of it properly so this will only increase the problem further and they will be kidding themselves if they don’t think this.

People's Party of Canada ...","OTTAWA — With a federal election looming this fall, the Liberals and Conservatives are bracing for an ideological battle that pits the merits of balancing the books against spending on consumer confidence — and many Canadians may actually agree with both of them, a new poll suggests.

The Leger poll was conducted for The Canadian Press this week shortly after the government released its latest federal budget, which promises billions in new spending on measures like job retraining, services for seniors and incentives for first-time homebuyers.

article continues below

The budget also leaves government coffers with average annual deficit of around $18 billion over the last four years — a far cry from the modest deficits and balanced 2019 books that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised during the 2015 election campaign.

The Liberals argue the spending is necessary to make a real difference in the lives of Canadians, while Conservatives accuse the government of wasting money and saddling future generations with unnecessary debt.

Both messages, however, resonated with Canadians, the Leger poll suggests: while a substantial percentage of respondents agreed the Liberal deficits were bad, many also expressed support for the centrepiece spending measures featured in Tuesday's spending blueprint.

Some 44 per cent of respondents said they believed the decision to run four years of deficits was the wrong call, while 20 per cent called it the right move and 35 per cent were not sure.

A large majority also voiced support for some big-ticket items in Tuesday's budget, including a plan to expand high-speed internet to remote and underserved areas of Canada, which garnered the support of 76 per cent of respondents, and a suite of measures to help workers to learn new job skills, which got a thumbs-up from three quarters of those polled.

Measures in the budget designed to make it easier for more Canadian families to buy their first home got a 68 per cent approval rating, while 55 per cent cheered proposed financial incentives to foster electric-vehicle sales.

As for the budget itself, 12 per cent of respondents said they were satisfied, while 19 per cent felt the opposite. The remainder of respondents either said they didn't know, or remained neutral — an amorphous body of swing votes the parties will no doubt be courting as the election clock ticks down to October.

""If you're the Liberals, the clear story is to say: 'Well, we needed to go into deficit to help the economy and do all of these great things that you agree with,'"" said Leger executive vice-president Christian Bourque.

""The story for the Conservatives is to say: 'It's not right. We can't do this, period.' So I believe we'll hear a lot about not necessarily the budget, but about public finances more generally in the weeks to come. And I think that will be a ballot-box question.""

Leger's internet-based survey, which cannot be assigned a margin of error because online polls are not considered random samples, was conducted March 19 and 20 using computer-assisted web-interviewing technology.

It heard from 1,513 Canadians who are eligible to vote and were recruited from the firm's online panel. The results were weighted to reflect age, gender, mother tongue, region and level of education to reflect the makeup of Canada's population.

The poll also suggested the Liberals have been bleeding support over the past month as the government struggled to contain the damage caused by the ongoing SNC-Lavalin affair.

Overall, 31 per cent of respondents polled said they would vote for the Liberals if an election were held now, a decline of three percentage points from February and a total loss of eight percentage points since November.

Yet while 37 per cent said they would back the Conservatives — a one-point bump from February and four-point increase since November — Bourque said most of the gain has come from voters in the West and may not translate into a big gain of seats in Parliament.

The NDP and Greens, meanwhile, saw their support increase by two points from February to 14 and 10 per cent, respectively, which Bourque said could represent trouble for the Liberals.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer also jumped ahead of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the question of who would make a better prime minister, earning the support of 25 per cent of respondents, compared with 24 per cent for Trudeau.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, who made his debut in the House of Commons this week, stood at eight per cent while Green party Leader Elizabeth May was supported by seven per cent of respondents. People's Party of Canada Leader Maxime Bernier came in at four per cent.

The results are surprising, said Bourque: none of the leaders are as popular as their parties, which suggests that while the shine may have come off Trudeau, that popularity has yet to migrate to anyone else.

""It's as if right now there is a bit of a void in terms of leadership,"" Bourque said.

""There's not one clear person who's driving support like Jack Layton did in 2011, like Justin Trudeau did in 2015 … who is kind of pulling support up for their political party.""

81,Business,2019-03-21T16:41:00.0000000Z,"In an emailed response, the Liberal Party said it returned the money and improved its donation acceptance procedures. The Conservative Party of Canada did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Dogwood, a B.C. environmental organization ...","Through Elections BC's political donations database, the Star verified that between 2005 and 2013, SNC-Lavalin and the company's chairman of the board at the time, Gwyn Morgan, donated a combined total of $196,157 to the BC Liberal Party.

During the same period, SNC-Lavalin was part of engineering consortiums that worked on the Canada Line and Evergreen Line rail transit projects in Metro Vancouver, the William R. Bennett Bridge in Kelowna and upgrades to the Sea to Sky Highway between Vancouver and Whistler.

In an emailed response to the Star, Nicolas Ryan, a communications staffer with SNC-Lavalin, said many of Dogwood's assertions in the post were ""erroneous"" but did not elaborate.

The company is also part of a consortium bidding on the Pattullo Bridge in New Westminster, B.C., a project worth $1.37 billion.

Expanding the analysis to Alberta, the Star found that between 2005 to 2014, SCN-Lavalin and its subsidiaries — including SNC Transmission Ltd., SNC Transmission 11 Ltd., and SNC Transmission 111 Ltd. — donated a total of $54,504 to Alberta's Progressive Conservative Party.

During that time, the company worked on the Western Alberta Transmission Line.

No investigations have been conducted to prove any connection between the donations and the contracts in either province.

Ryan pointed to a compliance agreement SNC-Lavalin signed with Elections Canada after the company adopted new ethics and compliance measures, and another agreement the company signed with the federal government after being criminally charged in 2015 with fraud and bribery in relation to allegations the company paid $47.7 million to officials in Libya. The latter agreement allows SNC-Lavalin to continue to get government contracts because of the effort it has made to improve ethics and compliance, according to a Dec. 10, 2015 company press release.

The company has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges. The allegations have not been proven in court. All allegations of wrongdoing by SNC-Lavalin occurred prior to 2013.

The BC Liberal Party and Alberta's United Conservative Party did not respond to interview requests. The Star attempted to reach Morgan through Encana, the oil-and-gas company he founded, but did not receive a response.

Last week, Canada's former attorney general and justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, told a parliamentary committee that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and others in his office had repeatedly pressured her to give SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution agreement rather than face a criminal trial on the fraud and bribery charges.

If found guilty, SNC-Lavalin could face a 10-year ban on bidding on federal government contracts. For its part, SNC-Lavalin says it is a changed company, has replaced board members and senior executives and put in place a ""world-class ethics and compliance framework."" The company, which employs 8,700 people in Canada and nearly 35,000 worldwide, has warned that employees and pensioners could be put at risk without a deferred prosecution agreement.

Taxpayer-funded infrastructure projects make up a significant portion of SNC-Lavalin's business: a Star analysis found that the company was awarded $68 million in new federal work in 2018, not including projects SNC-Lavalin is involved in as part of a consortium of companies. Examples of consortiums SNC is a part of include Ottawa's new $2.1-billion light rail line and a $2.8-billion contract to upgrade Montreal's regional transit system.

Transparency is a major subject of debate in B.C., which was once known as the ""Wild West"" of political donations because it had no limits on who could donate or how much.

The topic was an election issue in 2017. The BC Liberals, which had governed for 16 years, ultimately lost that election and were replaced by an NDP government supported by the Greens. The new government moved quickly to ban corporate and union donations and capped individual donations at $1,200.

Even though the donation rules have changed, Dogwood is still calling for a Charbonneau-style inquiry into B.C.'s anything-goes period.

The Quebec commission found a widespread system of companies bribing politicians to get government contracts. As a result of the inquiry, SNC-Lavalin agreed in a 2016 deal to reimburse Quebec municipalities for contracts obtained through questionable means.

The commission also sparked a 2013 Elections Quebec audit, which found that between 2006 and 2011 more than 500 companies used their employees and others to illegally funnel nearly $13 million in donations to political parties in the province. The audit did not examine the awarding of contracts but did find that the majority of the illegal donations came from employees of consulting engineering firms and construction companies.

A similar inquiry in B.C. would show whether the link between donations and government contracts is more than coincidence, said Sammartino.

Dogwood analyzed provincial road maintenance contracts and political donations between 2013 and 2016. The non-profit found companies that donated to the then-governing BC Liberals received a higher number of contracts and those contracts were higher in value: 90 non-donating companies received $539 million in contracts, while 44 donating companies received $758 million in contracts.

Dogwood's analysis, which Sammartino shared with the Star, also found donations tended to be made around the same time the companies bid, received winning bids or started work on the contracts.

""The Green party is about citizenship, democracy and true accounting,” she told the Times. “We are a party based on looking after people, community and the planet. We understand that the economy of the future needs to embrace innovation, evidence-based practice and good stewardship of resources, planet and wealth.

Former Cambridge mayor Doug Craig originally threw his hat in the ring in the nomination race, but bowed out, throwing his support behind Calver.

The nomination vote is set for April 8 at the Armenian Community Centre of Cambridge.

Alan Keeso, who earned master degrees in biodiversity and business at Oxford University, decided to venture into politics upon his return from the United Kingdom and worked on Kitchener South-Hespeler Conservative MPP Amy Fee’s campaign.

Keeso plans to focus on fiscal responsibility and economic strength.

“Primarily there is a big concern on fiscal responsibility, tax dollars going toward servicing the debt, versus services people need, so there is a real call for return to fiscal responsibility (for) future generations, as well and what that debt is going to do them,"" he said in a recent interview.

Louise Witt, a social worker whose 15-year-old son was diagnosed with autism in 2005, likened the Liberals’ approach to autism in Budget 2019, delivered on Tuesday, to “putting a Band-Aid on a cancer.”

This final budget before the Oct. 21 federal election earmarks $12 million over three years to the Canadian Association for Community Living, in partnership with the Canadian Autism Spectrum Disorders Alliance for the Ready, Willing and Able Program.

The budget document notes that people with intellectual disabilities, and Austism Spectrum Disorders, encounter unique barrier in securing employment and funding to help overcome these barriers will be provided through the Opportunities Fund for Persons with Disabilities.

Ken Hardie, Liberal MP for Fleetwood-Port Kells told the Now-Leader he’s “pleased to see some action taken on autism, which is a big thing in our riding. We’re into a lot of discussions about more support for autism, so there’s a Ready, Willing and Able provision in there that’ll be intended on helping autistic people find work. If they’re capable of doing some work, we’re going to help them find it.”

Ken Hardie, Liberal MP for Fleetwood-Port Kells. (File photo)

Witt is one of many parents across Canada who have been lobbying various levels of government for “science-based” autism treatment and services.

“This is a neurological condition, a health condition that has been thrown into the realm of social services,” Witt said. “We’ve put a medical condition in the realm of social services and are not willing to accept the fact there is science-based treatment that’s well known, that’s demonstrated.”

The Liberal Party of Canada, she noted, had given “overwhelming support” at its biennial convention in Winnipeg in May 2016 to a non-binding health policy resolution that called for autism treatment – applied behaviour analysis – to be covered under Medicare.

The resolution called for the Canada Health Act “be amended to include Medicare coverage for Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or, alternatively, the Government of Canada work with all provincial and territorial governments to ensure inclusion of ABA for ASD within their respective Medical Services Plans.

But she, and many other Canadian parents, are still waiting for the Liberals to make good on that.

“It is just a drop in the ocean, really,” Witt said of the budget provisions. “I mean, what the resolution talks about is providing actual treatment right after a diagnosis. For higher-functioning individuals, they may have the hope for employment, steady employment, they’ve very under-employed and unemployed at huge rates, so Ready, Willing and Able is certainly a good idea, but that’s like putting a Band-Aid on a cancer, really. This is a much greater issue – this is the most pervasive developmental disorder for children across the country, one in 66.

In 2007 a Senate report entitled Pay now or pay later called for a national autism strategy.

“That was ignored,” Witt said. “The Liberals when they were in opposition with the Harper government, one of their MPs presented a private member’s bill calling exactly for Medicare covering autism treatment. So in opposition they’re prepared to do one thing, and in government a different one.”

She said she “absolutely” gives the Liberal budget a failing grade on autism because it leaves so much out.

“Maybe a year or two ago they gave $20 million for a website. While a website is not treatment, and the website doesn’t even exist yet – I believe it’s supposed to be sort of this one place you can go to get all this quality research on the condition, and how to treat it, well that’s great – it doesn’t actually mean treatment for an individual with a diagnosis.”

Witt recalled that Hardie staged a townhall meeting in October 2017 that was attended by “desperate and tearful” families.

“I mean, it was packed, people came out of the woodwork and people with autism, their families, people were in tears, they had to cut off the lineup of people at the microphone wanting to talk. It dangled a little bit of hope out there, and we’ve been through this over and over and over, for years and years and years and years, and we’ve got a massive crisis going on.”

“It’s clearly not politically expedient for them to pay attention,” she said. “I must ask, is the Trudeau government about to write off yet another generation of children with autism, just as the previous Harper government did?”

The Whitby, Ont., MP has been a vocal supporter of Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, two cabinet ministers who resigned over the SNC-Lavalin affair.

She also accused Trudeau earlier this month of yelling at her angrily when she informed him that she would not be seeking re-election this fall — an accusation the Prime Minister’s Office has denied.

Conservatives pounced on Caesar-Chavannes’s defection Wednesday, arguing that her departure, added to the departures of Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from cabinet, prove that Trudeau is a “fake feminist.”

Conservative House leader Candice Bergen said the “good old boys” in the Prime Minister’s Office wanted Wilson-Raybould to avert a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin and when she refused, “she was promptly fired and silenced.”

“The prime minister is really good at yelling and screaming at women, as the member from Whitby knows, and he’s also a very good actor. But, Mr. Speaker, he’s a fake feminist,” Bergen told the House of Commons.

Trudeau said he’ll take no lessons on feminism from Conservatives who “still want to challenge a woman’s right to choose” to have an abortion.

Caesar-Chavannes, first elected in 2015, has been a relatively high-profile backbencher, primarily as an advocate for the rights of black Canadians. She’s gotten into several Twitter wars with Maxime Bernier, leader of the People’s Party of Canada, who once accused her of thinking “the world revolves around your skin colour.” On another occasion, she apologized to Bernier after telling him to “check your privilege and be quiet” when he questioned funding for minority groups.

She also made news in 2016 when she openly talked about her battle with depression.

At the time, Caesar-Chavannes, who was initially named parliamentary secretary to the prime minister, praised Trudeau’s understanding of mental illness but she has since soured on his leadership.

Throughout the SNC-Lavalin saga, she has used social media to send messages of solidarity — accompanied by a clenched-fist emoji — to Wilson-Raybould and Philpott.

In January, she used a speech at Parliament’s annual dinner tribute to Scottish poet Robbie Burns to take a swipe at Trudeau for moving Wilson-Raybould out of the prestigious justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs in a small cabinet shuffle earlier that month, to be replaced by Montreal MP David Lametti. Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet a few weeks later.

Had Burns been an MP, Caesar-Chavannes said, Wilson-Raybould would have been asked to remove him from Parliament.

“If she didn’t succeed, she would have been fired. If she succeeded in removing Robbie Burns, she would have been fired. You can’t have an Indian doing that to the white man. Lametti can, you can’t. The lads are better at that sort of thing,” she said.","Celina Caesar-Chavannes quits Liberal caucus, will sit as an independent MP",Ottawa Citizen,https://ottawacitizen.com/news/canada/celina-caesar-chavannes-quits-liberal-caucus-sits-as-independent-mp-2/wcm/e604392c-24d4-40eb-b8c7-9c5fc63847cb

Former Supreme Court of Canada judge Frank Iacobucci, who is now senior ...","The SNC-Lavalin scandal has proven to be an insatiable beast with tentacles reaching deep into the political and legal worlds — perhaps even as far as the Supreme Court of Canada.

Politically, the allegations of interference with the justice system have deeply damaged the “sunny ways” Liberal brand and catapulted the Conservative Party ahead of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in pre-election opinion polls. And, as most scandals do, the SNC affair has led to a series of high-profile resignations. Former minister of justice and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould may have been the first out the door, but her departure was quickly followed by the principal secretary to the prime minister, Gerald Butts, the president of the Treasury Board, Jane Philpott, and, most recently, the clerk of the Privy Council, Michael Wernick.

The government, in its scramble to defuse the political crises, launched a half-hearted study into the allegations before the Liberal-controlled justice committee appointed Anne McLellan to advise the PMO on the role of justice minister and attorney general in cabinet.

But none of this, rightly so given that the rule of law is at stake, has quieted the continuing questions about Trudeau’s integrity and his leadership.

And now there seems to be a rising grumbling that the legal profession should consider what activities former judges can be permitted to engage in after retirement.

After all, the short history of the SNC scandal does reveal a who’s who of the legal profession.

Former Supreme Court of Canada judge Frank Iacobucci, who is now senior counsel at the law firm Torys, was actively involved in SNC-Lavalin’s defence — even signing his name to a letter to the Public Prosecution Service advocating for a deferred persecution agreement.

Wilson-Raybould hired former Supreme Court justice Thomas Cromwell to provide her with legal advice about the scope and application of solicitor-client privilege.

Even the PMO got into the former judge game by floating the idea of retaining former Supreme Court Chief justice Beverley McLachlin to provide a legal opinion on deferred prosecution agreements.

The re-examination of permissible post-judicial activities may all just be a convenient distraction for those who wish to turn the channel away from the actions of the prime minister and his office. But there may be some merit considering what activities judges should be permitted to engage in during their golden years.

Should judges go gently into the good night of retirement? Or should they rage, rage against the dying of the light?

Should former judges have been involved in the SNC case at all?

Well, there are rules about what activities a retired judge can undertake after returning to practice.

In Ontario, a lawyer who was formerly a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada, the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the Federal Court of Appeal or the Superior Court of Justice is barred from advocating in any court or before any administrative board or tribunal absent special permission that can only be granted in exceptional circumstances. Former judges of the Ontario Court of Justice are unable to appear before a court for a period of three years from the date of their retirement.

The Federation of Law Societies has also released a discussion paper on post-judicial returns to legal practice.

But none of the rules — proposed or on the books — would have applied in the SNC case. And that may actually be a good thing.

Prohibiting retired judges from practising law carries hidden costs. Restrictions may limit the pool of qualified lawyers who would want to apply for judicial appointment — many potential applicants won’t want to view the bench as the end of their career. Limiting post-retirement work may indeed encourage judges to serve until mandatory retirement, which risks ossifying our courts and discouraging younger applicants. And limitations on post-retirement work ignores the fact that judges, even after retirement, can make valuable contributions to society through continued legal work. Rules that limit judicial practice could have the effect of discouraging the insight and expertise retired judges can bring to pro bono work and public policy development.

Some have suggested that former judges should not be involved in any litigation that may end up before the Supreme Court or cases that may become political. But it is impossible to determine to which cases that limit would apply until it actually happens.

It seems that the solution to the perceived problem of post-judicial activities may create more problems than it solves.

Sure, there is always a risk that the public may perceive that the involvement of a retired judge in a particular case renders the legal system unfair. This is a valid concern and perhaps there needs to be public education about the current rules of professional conduct. But, in reality, judges are very comfortable disagreeing with each other and being disagreed with. Indeed, the PPSC did not seem to be swayed by anything Iacobucci said on the SNC case — the fact he was a former Supreme Court justice did not seem to move the needle at all.

The real problem may actually be with those in politics who seek to use retired judges as a political weapon.

Former prime minister Stephen Harper did it when he released former Supreme Court judge Ian Binnie’s opinion on the Marc Nadon case — a case that the government clearly knew was going to be controversial.

Iacobucci may have unsuccessfully advocated on SNC’s behalf, but it was the clerk of the privy council, as part of the PMO attempts to influence Wilson-Raybould’s decision, who wielded the name as a weapon, telling her that: “Iacobucci is not a shrinking violet.""

And it was the PMO who was quite keen on the idea of “retaining an ex Supreme Court of Canada judge” to provide “cover in the business community and the legal community.”

So, while examining the scope of work retired judges should be permitted to engage in is not a bad idea, a better idea would be to insist on better and more ethical behaviour from our politicians.

She describes herself as a “feminist woman” who is “strongly pro-choice” and she sees her values aligning with Liberal Party policy. She sees climate change as one ...","KENTVILLE, N.S. —

She firmly believes that our future and national purpose will be best served by a re-elected Liberal government in Ottawa.

Pauline Raven, a two-term Kings County councillor, is the latest candidate to declare intentions to seek the Liberal nomination in Kings-Hants.

When it comes to her decision, Raven said that she discovered somewhere along the way that it’s “what I do anyway.” She has always been involved in community work, raised funds for worthwhile causes and helped bring projects together.

Raven said she enjoys it. She began at age 14 with a “War on Want” anti-poverty campaign and said she never looked back.

Raven authored the Nova Scotia Child Poverty Report Card for 10 years. She has campaigned for environmental protection, the fight for women’s rights and racial justice and the preservation of agricultural land through fundraising for the Annapolis Valley Farmland Trust.

Raven said that countries that do well with farmland protection and food security tend to be those that have national policies. She said she has a lot to learn when it comes to exploring the issue at the federal level.

Raven said that during her first term as a Kings County councillor, it was “a difficult chamber to be in.” She immersed herself in work to help community members so that they got value from her service as councillor. She also forged valuable contacts within the provincial and federal governments.

“I feel I’m well situated to be up and running at the job quite quickly if I’m successful with the nomination and if I’m then successful in October,” Raven said.

It came as a big surprise when former Kings-Hants MP Scott Brison stepped down. She thought about waiting to see who stepped forward to seek the nomination before throwing her hat in the ring but then decided that “this was for me at this point in time.”

Raven said she is going to get along with the other candidates, the best person is going to win the nomination and they’ll then move forward together. She knows the “Liberal family” in the Valley. She likes them and feels that she can work well with them.

Raven has worked with different Liberal candidates over the last eight years, including Brison. She also ran Kings North Liberal candidate Geoff Turner’s campaign in the 2017 provincial election.

She anticipates that it’s going to be “a difficult time on the doorsteps” for candidates as politics has taken on “a bit of a nasty demeanor.” Raven said Kings-Hants is anybody’s seat to win in this kind of political environment. She believes that being a seasoned campaigner on the doorstep will help keep the seat Liberal.

“In the context of Canada as a whole, I think that’s important,” Raven said.

She describes herself as a “feminist woman” who is “strongly pro-choice” and she sees her values aligning with Liberal Party policy. She sees climate change as one of the biggest issues to address. It’s a priority for our young people and should be a priority for everyone.

In Kings County, she’s excited about a four-megawatt solar array that could soon be established at the former Meadowview landfill, which is in Raven’s municipal constituency. She started working with Brison on the project in 2014. Council is also working toward an industrial wind energy farm in the municipality’s southwest quadrant.

“It takes time, it takes patience, it takes waiting until you’ve got the right momentum to get it done,” Raven said.

Controversy in Ottawa

Raven said the controversy in Ottawa surrounding allegations by the Conservative Party that Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau interfered politically with the SNC-Lavalin trial has come up as she speaks to people about supporting her nomination.

Raven said local municipalities, provincial governments and the federal government sometimes contract consulting work to SNC-Lavalin. The company is a large part of Canada’s framework when it comes to getting consulting and engineering work done. Regardless of the outcome, she believes the firm will remain part of the country’s corporate landscape.

She said the media and opposition will “grab onto something” regardless of which party is in power. She doesn’t believe that we can be “totally distracted” by that.

“I think we have to work with provincial and federal counterparts regardless of who’s in there to try to bring the kinds of things that we need to the Valley,” Raven said. “I think I know how to do that. For me, that’s what it’s about and that’s what I will be saying to people.”

Her feeling is that change is required within all of our political parties to make Ottawa a friendlier, more collaborative workplace. It can’t stay as oppositional as it has been.

Boy, was I wrong: The Liberals remain flat-footed, more stumbling zombies than dancing queens. The SNC-Lavalin scandal has consumed every last bit of oxygen in Ottawa in a week where Finance Minister Bill Morneau barely got the chance to deliver his budget in the House, let alone defend it in Question Period.

Instead, his budget speech was drowned out by opposition chants of “Let her speak,” a reference to former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould. Question Period was cancelled two days in a row due to a Conservative-led filibuster that forced MPs to vote morning and night on motions for the Liberals to waive Raybould-Wilson’s privilege. They slept on cots, they almost lost the confidence of the House in the confusion and fatigue of it all, and they apparently snacked in the Commons when they weren’t supposed to.

That’s to say nothing of an interview former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott gave to Maclean’s, hinting darkly that there’s “much more to the story that needs to be told,” or the resignation of MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes from the Liberal caucus, all in the same week as the budget.

In short, more than six weeks into this affair, I am running out of ways to describe how horrendously badly it’s been going for this government. Budget 2019 wasn’t merely opportunity lost for Trudeau; it was life-savings potentially squandered. (Note the word “potentially” – I’ll come back to this.)

The fact is, public opinion data show this was indeed a budget well choreographed and crafted for those whose support the party desperately needs this fall. But so far, few have managed to examine the budget performance; they’re too busy listening to reports of the theatre on fire.

Nonetheless, consider how much economic worries are shaping political lines in this country. Polling conducted before the budget indicated people on different sides of the political spectrum had very different priorities. Those who say they would consider voting Liberal or NDP in the next election identified poverty, income inequality and housing affordability as top issues in the country, by – in many cases – ratios of more than three-to-one over those who said they would consider the Conservative party this fall.

It seems then, that had Team Trudeau managed to get on message, there would have been plenty to communicate to centre-left voters. Things such as incentives and borrowing breaks for first-time buyers. Or boasts that child poverty has been reduced dramatically due to the introduction of the Canada Child Benefit.

Had Team Trudeau managed to get on message, there would have been plenty to communicate to centre-left voters.

These messages might have been further used against the Conservatives. Those who say they’d consider voting for Andrew Scheer’s party this fall are more likely to identify as top issues the government’s deficit spending and taxation (by huge margins) than are would-be Liberals and New Democrats. In other words, rather than try to defend from the back foot a shattered promise of not returning the country to balanced budgets within three years, this government could have simply touted the achievements (real or perceived) that those deficits purchased to its own base, with little attempt to appease the fiscal hawks.

All that work, gone to waste for now. A month and a half ago, it seemed inconceivable the Liberals couldn’t cut through the noise of this scandal or make the case for their budget decisions.

However, it’s worth noting that the coming seven months are akin to the last seven seasons of Game of Thrones: more bingeworthy twists and turns than Liberal stomachs may wish to endure, but enough time for them to use their strategic swords to cut through the opposition attacks and make the case for another term.

Though winter lingers in Ottawa, the summer barbecue season comes closer with each passing day. Liberal MPs may be squirming from uncomfortable SNC-Lavalin questions from constituents, but they will still have plenty of budget content with which to keep trying to change the subject.

UCP leader Jason Kenney said, “It’s ridiculous that the Liberal-appointed ... campaign in which every party agrees many Albertans are already ...","A Senate committee has ruled there will be no hearings in Alberta on Bill C-48, the atrocious tanker moratorium, which should really be called the Alberta Product Ban.

The committee will travel to Terrace and Prince Rupert, B.C. But the senators have twice voted down pleas to hold hearings in Alberta and Saskatchewan.

On Friday NDP Leader Rachel Notley sent a letter asking the Senate to reconsider. She urged Albertans to do the same.

“They don’t think the people of Alberta should be heard . . . I gotta tell you, this is kind of an unprecedented stampede of stupid,” Notley said.

“I’m stunned. Albertans deserve better from Canada,” she said.

UCP leader Jason Kenney said, “It’s ridiculous that the Liberal-appointed majority in the Senate won’t even consider hearings in Alberta, where the Trudeau government’s series of anti-oil and gas policies are having a damaging impact on jobs and communities across our province.”

Bill C-48 has passed the Commons and is now in the hands of this Senate transport committee, the last line of defence against final approval.

Tankers, obviously, are all about ocean transport of products transported from inland places.

But the Senate’s transport committee is not interested in hearing from provinces that need transport.

If that bunch won’t listen, who ever will?

Veteran Alberta senator Elaine McCoy told the committee there would “effectively be a ban on any kind of shipping of oil from Canada from that region.

“That means that we as a country will have told three provinces that they cannot exploit or sell their natural resources. Those provinces are British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan.”

McCoy isn’t a committee member, so she could speak but not vote. The same is true for fierce C-48 opponent Senator Doug Black, who says: “It angers me, as a senator from Alberta, that is being hurt, which I would suggest is being targeted, that my colleagues wouldn’t say ‘I can find two days to go and listen to Albertans.’”

The committee has rigged these hearings to ensure that most of the testimony comes from coastal supporters of Bill C-48.

Inside Alberta podcast

In this edition of Inside Alberta, Don Braid and Chris Varcoe discuss polls, the “kamikaze candidate” and the importance of trust in an election campaign that promises to be the most divisive in recent memory.

It’s hard to miss the echo of Bill C-69, the equally horrible legislation that focuses on environment and social concerns for project approval, to the exclusion of economic benefit.

Bill C-48 was conceived on a whim by Justin Trudeau before he was prime minister. It’s part of the Liberal plan to ensure that nothing like Northern Gateway can ever be proposed again. The Liberals are even deaf to First Nations who want to build a northern pipeline.

Clearly, the craven majority on the Senate committee is unwilling to cross Trudeau’s dewy romantic vision of that lovely coast, whatever the cost to prairie economies.

This news drops into Alberta at the start of an election campaign in which every party agrees many Albertans are already furious at Ottawa.

On Friday, a new Environics Institute survey showed that a majority of people in Alberta and Saskatchewan think we get so little out of Canada that we might as well leave.

Discontent is almost as strong in Atlantic Canada. And that part of the country, by clueless coincidence, was also excluded from the hearings on Bill C-48.

Some Atlantic senators wanted hearings there because the region has knowledge to share about safe tanker transport of oil products. That might actually have helped senators understand that tankers can co-exist with a clean, healthy environment.

No such federal ban is proposed for the Atlantic, of course, even though much of the landscape there is every bit as pristine and precious as B.C.’s north coast.

Black has done research and could find no comparable ban to C-48 anywhere in the world.

But nothing quite like Alberta’s oilsands industry exists anywhere in the world, either — so how else can a bunch of tame, unelected senators give it a hard time?

OTTAWA — Celina Caesar-Chavannes has informed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that she's leaving the federal Liberal caucus and will sit as an Independent MP.

The Whitby, Ont., MP has been a vocal supporter of Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, two cabinet ministers who resigned over the SNC-Lavalin affair.

In an interview with The Globe and Mail last week, she also accused Trudeau of yelling at her angrily when she informed him that she would not be seeking re-election this fall — an accusation the Prime Minister's Office has denied.

In a tweet Wednesday, Caesar-Chavannes said that interview ""has had unintended effects on those I care about. Although that was not the intention, it was the consequence, and I am sorry. I no longer want to distract from the great work my caucus colleagues are doing.""

But Conservatives pounced on the defection, arguing that Caesar-Chavannes's exit, added to the departures of Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from cabinet, prove that Trudeau is a ""fake feminist.""

Conservative House leader Candice Bergen said the ""good old boys"" in the Prime Minister's Office wanted Wilson-Raybould to avert a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin and when she refused, ""she was promptly fired and silenced.

""The prime minister is really good at yelling and screaming at women, as the member from Whitby knows, and he's also a very good actor. But, Mr. Speaker, he's a fake feminist,"" Bergen told the House of Commons.

Trudeau said he'll take no lessons on feminism from Conservatives who ""still want to challenge a woman's right to choose"" to have an abortion.

Caesar-Chavannes, first elected in 2015, has been a relatively high-profile backbencher, primarily as an advocate for the rights of black Canadians.

She's gotten into several Twitter wars with Maxime Bernier, leader of the People's Party of Canada, who once accused her of thinking ""the world revolves around your skin colour."" On another occasion, she apologized to Bernier after telling him to ""check your privilege and be quiet"" when he questioned funding for minority groups.

She also made news in 2016 when she openly talked about her battle with depression.

At the time, Caesar-Chavannes, who was initially named parliamentary secretary to the prime minister, praised Trudeau's understanding of mental illness. She has since soured on his leadership.

Throughout the SNC-Lavalin saga, she has used social media to send messages of solidarity — accompanied by a clenched-fist emoji — to Wilson-Raybould and Philpott.

A few hours after leaving the Liberal caucus on Wednesday, Caesar-Chavannes voted for a Conservative motion calling on Trudeau to waive cabinet confidentiality to allow Wilson-Raybould to testify more fully about the affair.

In January, she used a speech at Parliament's annual dinner tribute to Scottish poet Robbie Burns to take a swipe at Trudeau for moving Wilson-Raybould out of the prestigious justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs in a small cabinet shuffle earlier that month, to be replaced by Montreal MP David Lametti.

Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet a few weeks later, although both she and Philpott, who resigned subsequently from cabinet, remain members of the Liberal caucus.

Had Burns been an MP, Caesar-Chavannes said, Wilson-Raybould would have been asked to remove him from Parliament.

""If she didn't succeed, she would have been fired. If she succeeded in removing Robbie Burns, she would have been fired. You can't have an Indian doing that to the white man. Lametti can, you can’t. The lads are better at that sort of thing,"" she said.

The party states in a news release that a recent poll found ""a shocking 50 per cent of Albertans surveyed said they support secession from Canada.""

Kenney says in the release that most Albertans are proud Canadians, but they will no longer tolerate the rest the country benefiting from the province's resources while trying to hold back its economy.

Watch: Kenney says his campaign is focused on jobs

His comments come in the wake of the British Columbia government's effort to pass legislation that would impact the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline, which runs from Edmonton to Metro Vancouver.

They also reflect his view of the federal government's Bill C-69, which would change how projects such as oil and gas pipelines are reviewed.

Kenney says that in the midst of economic crisis, Alberta is ""under assault from other governments in Canada.""

""We are by far the biggest contributor to the federation. We have always played by the rules, paid our taxes, and produced wealth for other Canadians,"" Kenney said in a statement on Saturday.

""And it's why we need to stand up and fight for a fair deal, a new deal, for Alberta in the Canadian federation.""

Kenney repeated during a campaign stop in Red Deer on Saturday an earlier pledge to hold a referendum on federal equalization payments if his party wins the provincial election on April 16.

Dave Chidley/CP Alberta Premier Rachel Notley makes an announcement in Calgary on March 19, 2019.

Kenney last week said a UCP government would hold a referendum on equalization on Oct. 18, 2021 — the same date as the next municipal elections in Alberta — if what he dubs the ""no more pipelines'' law hasn't been mothballed, and if there is still no progress on pipelines.

Kenney further says if he becomes premier, he would also call for Ottawa to cut federal income tax for Albertans equal to the amount of the Canada Health Transfer and Canada Social Transfer.

He says that would allow Alberta to raise its tax rates to give Albertans more control over their own money.

NDP Leader Rachel Notley, who spoke at a campaign rally in Edmonton on Sunday, noted she compelled the federal government to buy the stalled Trans Mountain project to keep it alive.

""Pipeline, pipeline, pipeline. That is two more times saying the word pipeline than Mr. Kenney did in the House of Commons in the 10 years that he was representing Alberta in Ottawa,"" Notley told the rally, referring to the UCP leader's time as a federal cabinet minister under former prime minister Stephen Harper.

""We led the largest pipeline campaign across Canada and we have made the need to build pipelines a majority opinion across this country, including in British Columbia.""

Pipeline, pipeline, pipeline. That is two more times saying the word pipeline than Mr. Kenney did in the House of Commons in the 10 years that he was representing Alberta in Ottawa. Rachel Notley

On Sunday, Kenney further pledged a UCP government would seek to form federal and provincial agreement on resource corridors to create pre-approved, guaranteed land corridors for Canadian products.

He also said the UCP would demand an exemption for Albertans to the stress tests recently imposed by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, and would create an Alberta parole board.

Notley, meanwhile, repeated accusations Sunday that Kenney's proposed rollback of corporate tax increases was a giveaway to profitable corporations. She also summarized the UCP's first week of the campaign, where a candidate resigned over online comments she reportedly made about white nationalists, and her replacement was accused of calling for wives to obey their husbands.

""In all fairness, in responding to this, Mr. Kenney did say, listen, he wasn't aiming for perfection with his candidates. Well, Mr. Kenney, mission accomplished,"" Notley said to cheers from the crowd.

She promised an announcement Monday on child care.

Also Sunday, Alberta Party leader Stephen Mandel promised to introduce a single provincial identification card that would replace the current drivers' licences, health cards, provincial ID and the card necessary for buying hunting and fishing licences.

Now, says Brown, it’s time for Liberal insiders to convince ...","On Friday, Conservative House Leader Candice Bergen offered some advice to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that he is likely to ignore. Let Jody Wilson-Raybould have her (additional) say. Stop muzzling her with cabinet confidence and solicitor-client privilege. Waive it.

Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners Want Justice? Then Let the Youth Lead When The Tyee’s Katie Hyslop won a major honour, here’s how she used the platform it provided.

“The longer he continues this cover-up,” Bergen said of Trudeau, “the longer he moves heaven and earth to keep himself protected, the worse this gets for him.”

Does it get worse? Or will Canadians tire of the saga and move on, as the Liberals this week bet by moving to shut down the inquiry?

Martyn Brown, who as premier Gordon Campbell’s chief of staff handled scandals buffeting the B.C. government during the 2000s, thinks that this week Trudeau has moved closer to the brink of disaster. The heightened prospect of an RCMP investigation makes Trudeau an anchor sinking the party he once rescued with his leadership.

Now, says Brown, it’s time for Liberal insiders to convince Trudeau to step down.

More bad days for the PM

In one twist this week, Wilson-Raybould promised to dump a pile of more documents on the Justice Committee in order to prove her allegations of undue political interference are correct, even if she isn’t allowed to testify in person.

In another turn, Celina Caesar-Chavannes, who said she’d been bullied by a shouting Trudeau, left the Liberal caucus to sit as an independent MP.

Meanwhile, SNC-Lavalin’s CEO said Trudeau’s team is wrong to imply that his company asked to be spared a criminal trial or else it would move from Montreal with 9,000 Canadian jobs sacrificed.

But the biggest bombshell, in Brown’s view, was dropped by former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott, Trudeau’s other cabinet minister to resign in dismay over LavScam.

What Philpott had to say in her interview with Maclean’s magazine on March 21 proves she’d “gone rogue,” says Brown.

“I’m not accusing anybody of anything illegal or contrary to the Criminal Code,” emphasizes Brown. But Philpott raised enough questions to possibly prod the RCMP to launch an investigation, and that would mean a severe hit to Trudeau’s political fortunes.

On the phone with The Tyee March 21, Brown laid out his reasoning:

Philpott is “now basically saying in this interview with Maclean’s that Jody Wilson-Raybould was bullied, that there is much more to the story. And so she’s flatly contradicting [Trudeau’s] version of events.”

Philpott has given “new legs” to the demand by five previous attorneys general and the Tories for an RCMP investigation. In Maclean’s she makes it clear she could not remain in “solidarity with cabinet,” because she “felt that there was evidence of an attempt to politically interfere with the justice system in its work on the criminal trial that has been described by some as the most important and serious prosecution of corporate corruption in modern Canadian history.”

She also reveals that she raised deep concerns about the DPA file on SNC-Lavalin a full month before the affair became public.

She says this, Brown notes, as we find out the PMO’s claims about harm to the public interest if SNC-Lavalin were to be criminally prosecuted are baloney.

“What we need to know is, in this period, particularly after Jan. 14 when the shuffle took place, was cabinet misled by false threats or false information of the sort we’ve now learned about? That SNC was leaving Montreal, which [we know] now is patently untrue. Or that Canada was going to lose 9,000 jobs, which the present CEO now says was patently untrue. Was cabinet misled by that? Because if so, that would be a reason for the RCMP to investigate.”

The Mounties would be particularly interested in finding out, says Brown, “if false information was used to try to pressure Jody Wilson-Raybould to get her to politically intervene for something that anyone in government knew wasn’t true. Or if the government knew that it wasn’t true that jobs would be lost, that the company would move, as it was trying to suggest to her was the reason in the public interest, then the public interest argument goes out the window.

“That’s the only legal argument the government currently has. Even though by law they’re precluded in the Criminal Code from considering the national economic interest, they’re trying to couch it in this phrase, ‘the public interest,’ to say that because it was in the public interest, that’s why they could talk to her.

“But if the public interest argument is based on a lie, and they knew that, then all that you’re left with is a political motive, an electoral motive that would be self-serving. And that to me would raise questions of obstruction of justice, breach of trust, all sorts of things that the RCMP would suddenly be concerned with.

“I think that’s what’s really changed, the stakes have been elevated by both what the present CEO has said and what Philpott has said.”

Veteran of scandal management

Brown was chief of staff for premier Campbell on Dec. 28, 2003, the day RCMP officers arrived at the B.C. legislature and carted away boxes of evidence for what would become a years-long scandal involving the botched billion-dollar sell-off of the province’s public rail system.

Neither Campbell nor Brown was charged with any wrongdoing. But eight years later, Brown was the first witness called for the resulting trial, which ended with guilty pleas to fraud by two ministerial aides.

If Trudeau gets a knock on his door by the Mounties any time soon, he might want to give Brown a call for a bit of advice.

Then again, the PM likely won’t like what he hears. Brown, who writes a column for the Georgia Straight, declares in his latest that the Liberals’ best chance of winning the fall election is to “lance the boil” that is Trudeau.

As he told The Tyee in an email today, “The fear of losing Trudeau needs to be flipped on its head if left-leaning progressives want to minimize the chances of a Scheer victory this fall. The Liberals can now only hope to regain the moral high ground that is so vital for securing the values they purport to represent by replacing their leader. They can own the ethical hill they are now choosing to die upon by defending the indefensible by selecting a new leader who the heroines Wilson-Raybould and Philpott and Celina Caesar-Chavannes can all rally behind.”

Brown figures, “I am perhaps one of the first to suggest that Trudeau should be dumped by his caucus in their party’s political interest.”

As such, he joins a club that includes The Tyee’s Crawford Kilian who wrote a column published here March 5 headlined: “Trudeau’s Resignation Is the Party’s Only Hope.”

Steadfast and clear-eyed in his ideological stand against Khalistani extremism, the former federal minister and Liberal MP revels in speaking his mind even if it is contrary to the party line. One thing he doesn’t skip is his at least once-a-year trip to his native village Dosanjh Kalan near Jalandhar from where he, then 17-year-old, had migrated first to Britain and later Canada in the ’60s. Dosanjh spoke to Executive Editor Ramesh Vinayak in Chandigarh on Saturday on a range of issues from the new wave of migration from Punjab, India-Canada relations and Punjabi diaspora to ethics in politics. Edited excerpts:

Punjab has in recent years seen a wave of migration of young population to the West, particularly Canada. What do you make of this?

Canada needs people and also knows that people from India, including Punjab, are well-versed with English as a language, more than the Chinese. The number of Indian students has outstripped the Chinese. They allow foreign students to stay as permanent residents because they need a skilled workforce. Canada’s population will decline if we didn’t have immigrants. This, from the Canadian perspective, is a better way of continuing to increase its population. It is a smart move to bring both talent and money into Canada.

What does it mean for Punjab?

I’m conflicted on this. I’m a Canadian and also an Indian. Punjab should be worried because it is losing energy. It’s like a safety valve. You are losing the young and talented, the aspiring young men and women who want to do better in life. If they start leaving in a significant number, that urge and pressure for change in Punjab itself is released. Punjab will suffer in the long run. There is also outflow of money. Previously, you had remittances coming into Punjab. That is low now. The money flow is in the other direction to support studies because foreign fees are high. Families are selling assets to finance their children abroad, hoping they will be immigrants. Punjab has to find a strategy to use its own youth to fuel growth here.

Why don’t youngsters see hope here?

It is a humongous problem. Successive governments have failed to create that sense of hope.

What is your take on the India-Canada relations that turned frostier sinceCanadian prime minister Justin Trudeau’s visit last year?

This strain goes back to 1998 when Canada imposed sanctions after India conducted the nuclear test. When I became premier of British Columbia in 2000, I was officially invited by New Delhi and met prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. For a while, things were unclogged, but Trudeau’s election in 2013 set the whole process in reverse motion. That was partly because of the Government of India’s perception that his associates from the Indo-Canadian community are essentially Khalistanis or Khalistan sympathisers. Then, Trudeau’s trip was bungled completely. Little was accomplished. The two PMs may not have seen eye to eye. Sometimes the relationship between countries depends on the chemistry between the leaders. Since then, the relationship is on the backburner.

Khalistani extremism has become the most sticking issue in bilateral ties?

That is my belief, too. Because it goes back to the time when the Trudeau government forestalled Capt Amarinder Singh’s travel to Canada ahead of the 2017 Punjab assembly polls. He had just wanted to speak to the Punjabi diaspora who don’t vote here. That was offensive and hypocritical as Trudeau, during his India trip later, visited all kinds of temples in all kinds of garbs – and all this was meant for elections back home.

New Delhi blames the Trudeau dispensation for soft-pedalling on pro-Khalistan elements who spew venom against India?

Until recently, the leaders of most Canadian political parties, including Liberals, have been participating in religious processions, including the Baisakhi parade, where floats glorifying Khalistani terrorists are put up. Trudeau’s trip highlighted the tensions and it generated a debate in Canada. Now, Canadian politicians have been put on notice that this is improper and they should not be doing it. Hopefully, that implicit condoning and glorification of terrorists will stop.

How serious is the threat of Khalistani extremism?

In Canada, the United Kingdom and parts of the United States, it is a serious issue. Not in the sense of numbers but in the sense that if five or 10 people stand up and say that we are aggrieved at what happened in India in 1984. Because of the religious sentiments, other people don’t say anything and they simply follow the lead. But in terms of the real impact on India, it is less so because India is a big place. Even 3,000 diehard Khalistanis in two or three foreign countries are not going to make much impact on India. In fact, it is much more dangerous for the host societies. Because the dream of Khalistan will remain in the cranial cavities of the second or third generation who were born and raised in Canada, and some of them have never visited India. They are fed the lie of Sikhs today being persecuted, massacred and discriminated against. If you continue to believe that lie and there is nothing to counter it, it becomes a problem in the form of a ghetto of Khalistani ideology developing in Canada which may be more worried about some perceived grievances and imagined situation in Punjab than the real issues in the home country. That is more dangerous for Canada.

Given that pro-Khalistan ideology has no resonance in Punjab, what keeps it alive in Canada?

At one level, it is linked to identity politics. More important is the recent past. Post the 1984 massacre, people were angry. But they realised that it was an aberration. That Hindus and Sikhs have never had problems. There has been an unquestionable integrity between the two communities. If you have a riot or a massacre, people still need to live with each other. They realised that ordinary people saved each other and that neighbours are not enemies but friends as they have been for centuries. So there is that ameliorative effect of living together. So there is an opportunity to heal because you see everyone living together, inter-marrying and no discrimination. Manmohan Singh became the prime minister. The country had a Sikh army chief. Those became healing symbols. But in Canada, if you are an immigrant or born and raised there and if you have that anger and grievance in your head, there is no context to heal it. In the ’60s when I went to Canada, there were few Hindu temples. Most Indians worshipped at gurdwaras. That had brought the communities together. Today, there is no such thing. Though there are personal relationships and inter-faith marriages, there is no composite living as it is in Chandigarh or in my ancestral village in Jalandhar. That fragmentation of life allows these grievances to fester in people’s heads without any counter to it. That will remain a problem for long unless the leadership in places such as Canada begins to say to these people: ‘Hey, we see no problem in Punjab. If you see it, go and fight it. But in Canada we need to live together, worry about the here and now, and move on’.

What kind of sway do Khalistanis have among Sikhs overseas?

They are a tiny minority. In terms of sway, it is the silence of the majority that allows Khalistanis to claims that they have vast support.

The 2018 Public Report on the Terrorism Threat to Canada, tabled recently in the Canadian parliament, acknowledged Khalistan extremism as terror threat. Is it a signal that the Trudeau government has woken up to India’s sensitivities and is attempting a course correction?

I found that report encouraging. Of course, the Khalistani elements were upset and so were some of Trudeau’s ministers and MPs at the mention of Sikh radicalism. I wouldn’t call it a course correction. But, it’s a beginning and may help thaw Indo-Canadian relations.

Which are the social issues facing the Punjabi diaspora in Canada?

The gang problem has been more significant than the drug issue. The gang problem revolves around drugs. We’ve lost more than 200 youngsters, mostly Sikhs, since the ‘90s. I was the attorney general when the first Punjabi kid was killed and he happened to be a Dosanjh from my village.

How has the diaspora’s participation in power politics in Canada changed?

There are more people participating; that’s good. I worry more about the quality and caliber of people coming to politics. They say more the merrier. But, I say ‘better the merrier’.

You speak passionately about ethics in politics. How does India fare?

Not to be critical or partisan but it saddens me when I look at the canvas of Indian politics. There is really no moral or ethical leadership in this country. Not to criticise any one current or past, but we must recognise that ethically India is wanting; Indians are wanting. Without a deep sense of ethics in each and every Indian, India will not make the progress as fast or the kind of progress it could make. India produced so many prophets, saints and reformers because this country needed them. Unfortunately, they did not succeed in transforming India ethically. We believe that once there was ‘satyug’. My belief is that India has always been in search of ‘satyug’, but has not achieved it. I wish it does in my lifetime.

94,,2019-03-25T18:14:00.0000000Z,But since then inflation has been tamed and growth has been steady: Canada has had only one recession ... mostly on the care and feeding of Liberal client groups. Remember infrastructure?,"The 2019 federal budget, like all recent federal budgets, is a tribute to the pleasures of endless economic growth.

In the days when inflation was high, interest rates were volatile and growth was very stop and go, budgeting was hard work. Reining in runaway deficits absorbed most of the energies of finance ministers for the better part of three decades.

But since then inflation has been tamed and growth has been steady: Canada has had only one recession in the last quarter-century, and a mild one at that. Budgeting in such times is comparative child’s play — governments, at the federal level at least, have to positively go out of their way to run deficits.

Indeed, so steady has the revenue-gusher been — no government has ever had as much money to play with, measured in inflation-adjusted dollars per citizen — that the Liberals have been obliged to perform quite heroic feats of spending just to keep pace. Though real per capita spending is at all-time record levels, the deficit remains stubbornly below one per cent of GDP — hardly a deficit at all, really. My God, in the fiscal year just ending, the deficit actually fell: revenues came in faster (6.8 per cent) than even the Liberals could spend them (4.9 per cent).

I’ve said before that these are deficits of choice, rather than necessity. A better way to describe them might be deficits for show. Not even the Liberals still pretend deficits of this size would have any impact on growth, nor have they: real growth per capita in the bad old Harper years, from fiscal 2007 to 2016, averaged 0.9 per cent — versus 0.7 per cent, actual and projected, in the shining new era ushered in by the Liberals (2017-2024).

Indeed, they’re not even supposed to. Their impact is, first, symbolic — behold, we run deficits because we like to, whereas the previous government did so only grudgingly! — and second, to permit the government to spend more, mostly on the care and feeding of Liberal client groups.

Remember infrastructure? That was supposed to differentiate the new Liberal deficit spending from the old Liberal deficit spending. It wasn’t about pork-barrel politics, or short-run economic fixes. It was about making strategic investments that would increase productivity for the long run. Only it hasn’t quite worked out that way, has it?

The budget boasts that federal infrastructure spending has increased from $8 billion in fiscal 2016 to $14 billion in the current fiscal year. That’s an increase of $6 billion, which sounds like a lot, until you realize total program spending has increased by $47-billion in the same period. At one point the Liberals used to claim one dollar in three of new spending would go to infrastructure. The actual result: more like one in eight.

It is time, then, for the conversation to move on: from how spending is financed to what it is spent on, from the size of government to its composition, from the macro to the micro. Deficits of this size are not going to ruin us, as the opposition claims; neither would eliminating them, as the finance minister pretends.

The quantity of spending isn’t so much the issue as the quality. It isn’t that we can’t afford it: it’s that, in the rush to get all that spending out the door, little thought appears to have been given to whether the money is being spent in the best way, or whether it should be spent at all.

The most telling table in the budget is the last: the one that tallies up the estimated savings from the several “comprehensive reviews” of spending the government claims to have undertaken. The total annual saving: $237 million. Out of a budget of $323.5 billion.

Perhaps one day something a little more stringent will be attempted. And perhaps this budget’s signature initiatives on training and housing, which give every impression of having been cooked up in the Prime Minister’s Office, if not in party election planning sessions, will be the subject.

The training chapter notes, with evident satisfaction, that the government now spends close to $7.5 billion a year on skill development “across more than 100 distinct programs.” Given the country’s acute and growing skills shortages, some questions might be asked about their efficacy. Some, but not too many: a review of skills programming provided “an opportunity to reflect on past successes and determine where more can be done.”

Such a forgiving attitude to the past does not bode well for the future. Has any serious analysis been done of the new Canada Training Benefit — how it will interact with provincial programs, what sort of training will be eligible, and so on?

Likewise for the government’s suite of new policies to make housing more affordable. The budget acknowledges the only real solution to high house prices in the long run is to increase the supply of houses. But the specific measures it announces would mostly stimulate the demand — notably a First-Time Home Buyer Incentive that would involve the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, worryingly, in lending directly to prospective buyers. The details are sketchier than sketchy, but any benefit would more than likely be capitalized into prices. Would anyone really be made better off?

But why ask hard questions, when growth is endless and budgets need never be balanced? Except … even if the business cycle has been abolished, and growth does persist, it will be much slower growth than we have known, now that the Baby Boomers are hitting their retirement years. That may not be of much concern to the feds, who largely insulated themselves, in the deficit-slashing years, from the fiscal consequences. But it’s a huge problem for the provinces, who will have to pay to look after all those aging Boomers.

What would the budget do to stimulate growth in the long run — to improve Canada’s sluggish productivity record, to arrest the alarming decline in business investment, to reform Canada’s complex, growth-killing corporate and personal income tax system?

Er, nothing, as it happens. For as it has been said, in the long run we are all out of office.","Andrew Coyne: Federal budget a testament to the pleasures of endless growth.

How can we believe anything he says?

First, we learned that the budget doesn’t balance itself. Trudeau ran on the plank of modest deficits in the first few years leading to a balanced budget in 2019. What we learned last week was that, in fact, we are looking at an eye-popping $19 billion this year with no plan to balance our budget at all.

Does Trudeau really still think that magically the budget will balance itself?

We should pray that we don’t hit a recession or interest rates continue to increase. Not only do we not have a cushion to land on, we have a giant pothole to fall into.

Second, remember the plan to change the election system from first past the post?

On June 17, 2015, Trudeau not only announced it as a pillar of his campaign but said he would introduce electoral reform within 18 months of taking over government.

It looked like an urgent thing to him. Why the haste?

“(Prime Minister Stephen) Harper has turned Ottawa into a partisan swamp promoting partisan interests at the expense of public trust” he said.

After two months of LavScam and the resignation of four of some of the most powerful people in government, that quote fits Trudeau as perfectly as one of his bespoke suits. The worst part of the saga was former top bureaucrat Michael Wernick, who quit last week. His disgraceful appearances at the justice committee made him a full-time member of the Liberal party swamp.

Turns out electoral reform was a Trudeau ruse to get rid of Harper. Less than one year into his new mandate, Trudeau pulled the plug on it. Why?

“Under Mr. Harper, there were so many people who were unhappy with the government and his approach that people said, ‘We need electoral reform in order to stop having governments we don’t like,’” Trudeau told Quebec’s Le Devoir.

“However, under the current system, they now have a government with which they are more satisfied and the thirst to change the electoral system is less striking.”

Trudeau was never serious about electoral reform. It was yet again a cynical vote-buying scheme. Now that he won under the traditional system, why risk toying with the current system?

Third, turns out our “sunny ways” feminist was a fake. Gender party is a good thing — that is, if you respect women and women’s voices in cabinet. We were treated to ElbowGate a year after the election: Trudeau, showing his true colours, rushed across the aisle of the House of Commons to manhandle the Conservative whip while accidentally elbowing NDP MP Ruth Ellen Brosseau.

It was a strange combination of lack of respect for women and an illustration that Trudeau may be in need of anger management.

Then the Kokanee Grope made headlines, an incident from 2000 in which Trudeau was accused by a journalist, then 18, of “groping” and “inappropriate handling” at the Kokanee Summit, a music festival.

More recent, two powerful ministers, then-attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould and then-Treasury Board minister Jane Philpott, quit cabinet, having lost confidence in Trudeau over his handling of LavScam.

But the most blistering defection was from the Liberal caucus. Whitby MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes announced she will sit as an Independent. Apparently, her crime was to tell Trudeau about her plan not to seek re-election and he went ballistic on her.

“He was yelling. He was yelling that I didn’t appreciate him, that he’d given me so much,” Caesar-Chavannes said. There were two similar interactions. More indication that our PM may needs a little anger management, perhaps?

But cheer up. Some strains of pot apparently have anti-depressant qualities.

Trudeau has at least provided us a way to be cheerful about the depressing state of his government.

Manthorpe, a former Hong Kong correspondent, Vancouver Sun columnist and Business in Vancouver contributor, is on a speaking tour for his new book Claws of the Panda. He spoke March 13 to a decidedly anti-Communist Party of China crowd hosted by the Vancouver-based society Friends of Hong Kong.

article continues below

Claws of the Panda is an overview of Canada’s relationship with the authoritarian regime and the influence Beijing has on Canadian politicians and Canada’s Chinese diaspora. However, it was written before the arrest of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou on December 1, 2018.

Manthorpe said the fallout from Meng’s arrest is the worst crisis in Canada-China relations since the two countries established mutual diplomatic relations in 1970.”

Manthorpe drew chuckles when he expressed how “queasy” he got at recent political interference in the Meng case by former ambassador to China John McCallum. Equally worrisome for Canada’s upholding of the rule of law, he said, is the alleged interference by the Prime Minister’s Office in the possible prosecution of construction firm SNC-Lavalin for bribing the Libyan government.

On the whole, he said, there is a “gulf” between China’s civic, judicial and human rights values and those upheld by Canada domestically and internationally. One example, before Meng, was when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau went to China expecting to discuss trade and democratic values, only for Beijing to “send him packing with a flea in his ear.”

The Meng crisis should be “welcomed” and it should force scholars and naive politicians to re-examine Canada’s relationship with the authoritarian regime, he said.

“The first task is for Canadian policy and opinion makers is to realize the Huawei crisis is an opportunity to sweep away the self-delusion that has clouded their view of the People’s Republic of China few decades,” Manthorpe said.

Manthorpe prefaced his speech and Q&A session at the downtown Vancouver Public Library by noting that his research speaks to the authoritarian regime of the People’s Republic of China and not Canada’s 1.5-million-person ethnic Chinese diaspora. He acknowledged that speaking frankly about the subject locally is difficult given the social and cultural ties Canada, and especially Vancouver, has with China, Taiwan and especially Hong Kong, a city with about 300,000 Canadian passport holders.

He expressed disappointment after hearing about one person who did not want to attend his talk, fearing it would be an “anti-Chinese” event.

Manthorpe said raising legitimate issues about Canada-China relations usually provokes controversy.

“We saw it, for example, in the whole business of the investment in real estate in Vancouver and Toronto. We saw real estate agents rolling out the racism card,” he said, adding that Chinese government officials accused Canada of white supremacy after Meng’s arrest.

To maintain objectivity, Manthorpe said, he wrote his book entirely from the public record.

His book delves into, among other things, how agents of the authoritarian regime exert pressure on ethnic Chinese people overseas who have either personal or business ties to China.

China, he says, employs agents in Canada who meddle in local political affairs via organized, typically pro-business or “friendship” groups. Local politicians, he notes, are increasingly falling under the influence of those groups.

“These agents have been able to come over here and work with no pushback from Canadian authorities,” he said. “The fact that we have very similar campaigns in Australia and New Zealand as we have in Canada gives me great satisfaction that I’m not a conspiracy theorist.”

There is some hope of pushback within government, however, he said. Last May, in Vancouver, China’s propaganda wing, the United Front Work Department, organized the ninth Conference of the World Guangdong Community Federation, which saw over 200 Chinese nationals slated to attend the event denied visas. Premier John Horgan, MLA Teresa Wat, MP Alice Wong and Richmond Mayor Malcolm Brodie attended the conference, among others.

The United Front is reportedly used to quash dissent and stifle criticism of the Communist Party of China while promoting the party’s political goals, such as bringing Hong Kong and Taiwan into its grasp or undermining the liberal democratic order.

Manthorpe stressed Sino-Canadian relationships will likely need to be developed outside of government activity given the level of influence pro-Beijing groups are exerting on Canadian politicians.

He also called interference in local Chinese media “quite appalling,” noting a free exchange of ideas in the Mandarin-language press is fundamental.

Canadians, he said, should keep in mind the repressed minorities in China and those who are threatened and punished for speaking out against the Chinese government.

A protesting First Nations woman who was pushed to the ground during Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Climate Action Rally at the Danforth Music Hall on March 4, says the prime minister “witnessed” her being assaulted, and “did nothing.”

The woman is 26-year-old Vanessa Gray, a community organizer from the Aamjiwnaang First Nation. In a press release written a few days after the incident, Gray said it is disturbing that many of the people who attended the event, including Trudeau himself, did nothing.

At the event, Trudeau was interrupted several times during his speech by hecklers and protestors in the crowd, who were immediately ushered out by security.

Gray said she went to ensure that the voices of Indigenous people were present and draw attention to the ongoing colonial and environmental violence that indigenous people experience in Canada.

Before arriving at the event, Gray hid a Canadian flag in her shirt that said, “No Justice on Stolen Native Land.”

She said it was to remind those at the event that ground zero of environmental violence is occurring right now on unceded land.

Videos and photographs of the incident have been making the rounds online.

During Trudeau’s speech, Gray threw her flag and shouted “No Justice on Stolen Native Land.” Seconds later, an older white man, in a blue shirt, pushed her down to the floor.

“Shocked, but not deterred I rose up and continued to speak, ‘No Justice on Stolen Native Land.’ I said this over and over until security pulled me from the rally,” she wrote in her statement.

While Gray was quickly escorted out, the man, who is yet to be identified, remained inside the event and continued to cheer Trudeau on.

In a video taken during the event, Trudeau can be seen witnessing the scuffle and uttering “Oh boy, oh boy,” moments after Gray is pushed to the ground.

Gray has been speaking up against environmental violence for eight years.

She and her lawyer Nick Cake, with Millars Law, are considering her legal options. Cake said they are in a preliminary stage and are reviewing all options and working to determine the best possible path.

“Our options include filing a police report because police didn’t take any action on that day. Another avenue will be civil remedies that may be available. Another would be to leverage a conversation between Vanessa and the prime minister’s office,” he said.

“Situations like this have a way of fizzling off and falling off into the background and essentially being forgotten about. It’s our intention to keep this fresh and to keep it going so it does not become outdated or a situation that lacks the public’s interest,” Cake said.

In an email statement, Liberal Party spokesperson Parker Lund said the safety of all Canadians attending such events is a top priority and that the incident has been brought to their attention.

The “Pardon Truck,” run by the Cannabis Amnesty campaign and licensed cannabis producer DOJA, parked outside the Vancouver Public Library where its small crew of petitioners geared up to collect 10,000 signatures to take to Ottawa.

They spoke with passersby near their ornately decorated “jam van” about their call for policy-makers to pass legislation that goes beyond pardons, and instead expunges simple possession convictions from criminal records.

Before legalization on Oct. 17 last year, people convicted of simple possession could face up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. In 2016, 17,733 people were charged with cannabis possession, down 3,600 from 2015, according to Statistics Canada.

On March 1, Minister of Public Safety Ralph Goodale tabled Bill C-93 to provide no-cost, expedited pardons for simple possession (up to 30 grams) of cannabis. The bill scraps a $631 application fee and five-year waiting period for a pardon after conviction.

But NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and NDP MP Murray Rankin have repeatedly called for expungement instead of pardons for convictions on possession crimes that longer exist in law. Rankin’s Bill C-415 to establish a procedure for expungement, tabled last October, found the support of People’s Party of Canada Leader Maxime Bernier.

The “Pardon Truck” people also believes Goodale’s bill doesn’t go far enough.

“We actually want an expungement, which is completely destroying the record,” said David Duarte, with DOJA. “This will never be brought up again and we can kind of help those people move forward with their lives.”

Duarte said the truck, which did a similar tour last fall, will also stop in Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg and Toronto. Organizers are also soliciting signatures at pardon.life and cannabisamnesty.ca.

Sarah Leamon, a Vancouver criminal defence lawyer, said that a pardon still considers a person culpable for committing an offence, but acknowledges that they have been reintegrated into society and “no longer need to have the label of criminal.” Police officers and border officials can still see the conviction on their record but employers or landlords will not find it during background checks, Leamon said.

“What an expungement says is you were convicted of this criminal act but you never should have been,” Leamon said. “You are not morally culpable for it, this never should have been a crime, we were wrong to have prosecuted it and it was an unjust conviction, essentially.”

Leamon said expungements are rare and most often used in historical prosecutions against LGBTQ people.

She has heard arguments that people fighting past simple possession charges knew they were breaking the law before legalization. Those convictions still carry a moral culpability, in some people’s minds, Leamon said.

On the other hand, some people have been saddled with criminal records for trying to access cannabis for medical purposes, she said.

“I do applaud the Liberal government for recognizing this as something that’s very important, this issue of pardons and amnesty,” she said.

“But I think that there are some arguments to be made that it doesn’t go far enough. I would personally like to see more cannabis-related convictions being eligible for this expedited pardon system, and I would also like them to consider expungements in some cases.”

Outside the library, many people stopped to ask about the truck and petition.

David Stewart, who works for an education company, said he supported the push for expungement.

“I work a job where I send people to go teach English overseas and I’ve had to turn great people away because they have just a minor criminal possession of marijuana (charge),” he said. “It’s long overdue.”

Stewart believes cannabis is relatively harmless, when compared to alcohol, and people shouldn’t be punished for using it.

“We all know that it’s a disproportionate amount of people that are affected that are people of colour, from our First Nations community, so I think to have expungement is just kind of righting the wrongs of the past with cannabis rules,” he said.

Thomas Jordan, who works in hospitality, said a pardon still leaves a person with a “monkey on their back” for life.

“If there’s still a record of what people have done in the past, people can still look it up — like our friends across the border — and cause inconvenience and nonsense,” he said.

“I think they need to just get rid of any record of any contact with the product, because it shouldn’t have been illegal to start with.”

Alberta NDP Leader Rachel Notley was in Edmonton Sunday afternoon giving a speech to hundreds of screaming supporters at the Polish Hall, 10960 104 St NW, Edmonton. It is the only event on her scheduled Sunday.

Notley said the NDP inherited an economy that is “deeply damaged” and said an elected NDP will balance the books by 2023 without making “reckless cuts.”

Mandel in Edmonton

Alberta Party Leader Stephen Mandel is door-knocking Sunday morning in the Edmonton-McClung riding. It is the only event he is scheduled for Sunday.

However, the Alberta Party released plans Sunday to do away with paper and plastic government ID cards in favour of digital identification. According to a Sunday news release, the plan would see plastic and paper identification for health care, drivers’ licenses, provincial ID and the Alberta WIN cards all converted digitally to a “government identification app with a portal to allow Albertans more flexibility when presenting ID.”

“My paper AHS card is a daily reminder Alberta is still using solutions from the 1970s,” Mandel said in the news release. “It’s time to start living in the present by consolidating identification for government licensing and access to services. Digital identity is commonplace. If we don’t develop or modernize, we’ll simply be left behind.”

Khan in Calgary

Alberta Liberal Leader Dave Khan is in Calgary Sunday making calls from his campaign office from 9-10:30 a.m., attending a campaign office grand opening for Calgary North East candidate Gul Khan from 1-3 p.m., and finally door knocking in the Calgary-Mountain View riding from 4:30-7 p.m.

On Sunday, the Alberta Liberals unveiled their platform policy for new Canadians, pledging to improve access to foreign credential upgrades, boosting settlement funding and investing in adult education and English-as-a-second-language programs.

“We will make it easier for immigrants to access Alberta Government services,” Khan said in a news release. “We will provide those services in more languages. We will establish a telephone service that allows new Canadians to speak to government agents with the help of a translator.

“New Canadians are vital to Alberta. Immigrants help us unlock our economic potential and the diversity they create enriches the multicultural fabric of our nation.”

UCP in Slave Lake

UCP candidate for Athabasca-Barrhead-Westlock, Glenn Van Dijken, is in Slave Lake Sunday to detail the party’s plan to “stand up for Alberta’s forestry workers.”

Van Dijken will make the announcement at 1 p.m. at the Vanderwell Contractors Ltd (Mill), 695 West Mitsue Industry Road, in Slave Lake.

(A previous version of this story said Jason Kenney will be in Slave Lake Sunday but he will not be participating in the announcement.)

In a Sunday news release, van Dijken called out the NDP government for “restricting timber access” and “over-regulation”, and said a UCP government would set up a Caribou Range Task Force to review the NDP’s Alberta Caribou Draft Plan.

“It is essential that forest companies have long-term access to a sustainable secure fibre supply,” van Dijken said. “We need to get behind our foresters. For Albertans, this is a vital industry.”

On Saturday night, the party confirmed Sanjay Patel as the UCP candidate in the Edmonton-Ellerslie riding.

“Like many Albertans, Sanjay Patel came to Canada seeking opportunity. Sanjay received a Bachelor of Science degree in India, and since coming to Alberta, he has worked in the construction industry,” Kenney said in a Saturday news release. “Sanjay will be a huge asset to the United Conservative team as we work to present Albertans with a common-sense alternative to the NDP. I am pleased to welcome Sanjay as the United Conservative candidate in Edmonton-Ellerslie.”

Looking back to other periods ...","WELLS: On that note, I want to welcome to The Message Graeme MacKay, the Hamilton Spectator's award winning editorial cartoonist. In fact it occurred to me as I was preparing for the episode that the sign Beware of Cartoonist is funny and also has deeper meetings or layers to it, just as your work always does, because in fact you occupy a physical space in the newsroom off on your own — separate from the reporters. And you also play a singular role at The Spectator which is to offer an opinion, a point of view on everything from politics to Hamilton's quirks and the vast canvas of human nature and to do so editorial cartoons. That's me giving my spin how you might see your job. How do you see what you do?

MACKAY: Yeah, I occupy a very isolated corner of the newsroom way at the other end and by the exit door to the newsroom too so there's a symbolic thing there. I guess I'm lucky enough to have a position that I have because it's sort of like a visual columnist. But I guess my job is to poke the powers and do it in a depiction way in a drawing and it's a wonderful job that I have for sure.

WELLS: And you've been in The Spec 22 years this September is my guess. That means you're a young buck compared to me. You started at The Spec four months after I did?

MACKAY: Yes. But I bet you, they probably gave you a computer. Right?

WELLS: They did! You are right about that.

MACKAY: I didn't get a computer for like, three or four years after. And I think it took like half a year to get a phone. That was 1997.

WELLS: Those were the perks back then. So we'll talk a little bit about the road travelled for you and then how you do what you do in this age of Trump and Trudeau. I was thinking I feel the limitations of audio here where your work is so visual.

MACKAY: Sure.

WELLS: But Ayesha Nasir, the producer of The Message, will post some of your work on our site and a link to your website which I was going through. There's a ton of material on there for readers. Archives and —

MACKAY: I'm very proud of my website.

WELLS: It's a great website. I wish I had something that showed some of my past work you know, so yeah, that's terrific. But to start, today's cartoon — by the way you create five editorial cartoons per week at The Spec, is that right?

MACKAY: Right.

WELLS: And your work is nationally syndicated so it appears online and in newspapers throughout Canada and sometimes in the US. The cartoon today, just to take a random one because it's in the paper today, it features Doug Ford.

Editorial cartoon for Wednesday, March 6, 2019. | Graeme MacKay, The Hamilton Spectator

We have Ford. In the background of the cartoon, there's a big carnival happening. Fireworks in the sky and a carnival tent is labelled SNC-LAV-SCAM. Big party happening in the background and in the foreground we have Doug Ford looking very much like a mob boss standing over someone bearing something in the dirt led by car headlights — which symbolize what?

MACKAY: Well there's, obviously, some interference happening on both the provincial and federal level. It's an edgy cartoon and I could have gotten into trouble with that. I had to like go to my editor Howard Elliot, just to make sure that we wouldn't get sued because it's —

WELLS: It's pretty suggestive.

MACKAY: Yeah, it's very suggestive. You're saying what, the premier is killing people off? I guess in a metaphorical way, he did. Or his deputy, one of his deputies, actually fired the deputy commissioner of the OPP.

WELLS: Just this week, right?

MACKAY: Yeah. But, you know, it's just interesting because we've been obsessed by the SNC-Lavalin story for weeks now. And there's other things that are happening. We as cartoonists just have to be careful not to get too obsessed with the media and keep our eye on other, you know, nasty things that might be happening and I think what's happening in Ontario right now is ... it's fodder for cartoons for sure.

WELLS: I've heard and seen some criticism of the coverage of LAV-SCAM, that the media is all in and everyone is now trying to outdo the other, that is, not to say it's not a huge story, which it is. But it's a good opportunity, for you to kind of shine the light somewhere else like you're doing here.

MACKAY: Well, you gotta wonder like, are people really focused in on the LAV-SCAM thing and are they more focused on what's happening with Ford? I mean, I don't know. Until polls come out, we don't know. Maybe for the vast majority of people outside the bubbles that really follow these political things nobody really cares. But I guess time will tell.

WELLS: Would you anticipate when you draw Doug Ford in this sort of manner, do you ever sort of expect to get a an email or call from someone who's a fan and not a fan of yours? Perhaps who is angry about the depiction.

MACKAY: I expect with my job that I'm not gonna have 100% happiness. I think with a good cartoon you're going to get as many people oppose as people who like it. So yeah, on various social media platforms, I get an earful from people who are totally upset with my cartoon. We get the odd letters to the Editor, a lot of them I don't even see. They just cross Howard's desk and he protects me from seeing some of these angry emails and letters and whatnot. But yeah, I think if you're not getting feedback, you're not doing your job properly as a cartoonist.

WELLS: Do you have thick skin as far as that goes? I mean, your job is to stir the pot. I think if I got a letter taking a shot at my story — I'm probably more thin skinned — I might feel defensive at first. I guess it depends on the nature of —

MACKAY: I think I get more defensive when people obviously don't understand and they show they don't understand satire. They're not seeing the bigger picture that sometimes you need to use Certain metaphors and situations that cast affliction on certain people in order to skewer the person who's the power. I think in some countries like in France and Britain, they get that. But here, it's almost like it's a continuous kind of thing where you got ""Well, no, this is how it works here."" And, ""This is what satire is all about."" But I can understand that even satire has to adapt to the changing norms and everything that happens with society.

WELLS: And satire is not polite.

MACKAY: It's not polite and it's not fair sometimes, either.

WELLS: That's right. One of your favourite cartoonists and friends in the fraternity of cartoonists, I suppose, is Michael deAdder. He apologized recently. He did one of the LAV-SCAM cartoons where he depicted Jody Wilson-Raybould tied up with her mouth taped, in a boxing ring, with Trudeau poised to take her on in the ring. So her hands are tied down her back, her mouth is covered up.

MACKAY: I did actually the almost exact same cartoon too.

WELLS: Did you?

MACKAY: Yeah and we were lumped into this whole sort of thing with hate and misogyny and that sort of thing. I posted my cartoon online and deAdder saw it and then he messaged me and said I'm in the middle of tweeting that same cartoon but just giving you the heads-up that this is going in my paper tomorrow. And he's on the Atlantic Coast so he didn't have much of a timeline.

WELLS: Right, he's in Halifax.

MACKAY: Seven o'clock in the evening. So we go ahead and then everything hits the fan the next day it was posted.

WELLS: I saw on Twitter, I mean I just saw a bit of it, but he apologized and then he sort of apologized for the apology. But people started giving a hard time for apologizing.

MACKAY: I think the big difference there is that he's a freelancer so he doesn't answer to an editor. My editor is Howard Elliot and he cleared it. He looked at it and he didn't raise any worry it about or anything. There's been subsequent apologies since then and they all come from freelancers who don't have those filters that thank goodness I have here at The Spectator because I've never apologized for a cartoon.

WELLS: You haven't? I was going to ask you about that.

MACKAY: Not here. I have come close but no I haven't.

Editorial Cartoon for Friday, February 15, 2019 | Graeme MacKay, The Hamilton Spectator -

WELLS: With that one, people are missing the whole boxing analogy. Trudeau was famous at least for people following his career for boxing publicly.

MACKAY: Well, the Liberal Party and his supporters have made a big deal. He punched out Patrick Brazeau and it was, you know, ""Look what he did here!"" and all of you can look at that like well yeah, he was an Indigenous guy too that he punched out. But, you know, it was taken as a positive thing and it was an important thing because it was before he became prime minister. And a lot of people will say hell, he's just a weakling who only cares about his hair and his looks and selfies and that sort of thing. So let's go and prove that he's a capable guy. And I've used that in other cartoons. His punching acumen when dealing with Donald Trump and that sort of thing.

WELLS: Right, right. The first time I covered him ever in Hamilton was when he came here. And he did a big thing at the gym downtown where he put on a big workout. He was quite happy to to sweat for the cameras.

MACKAY: I'm kind of amazed that we as cartoonists haven't really capitalized on this whole thing because you could you can see the good in that. But you can also see the ugly side of being a boxer as well, and I think both Mike and I did that job as was expected in a satirist.

WELLS: How often would you say an editor like Howard or Paul Berton editor in chief comes to you with an idea that they would like to see done, or an issue say that they like to see done by you in the paper? And how often is it just you percentagewise?

MACKAY: They never come to me. I can tell you they never instruct me or say ""Oh, you gotta like lay off."" Although in the early days they would tell me to lay off way back when I started out. I came on and it was a different approach that I had towards my job. I was scathing towards the mayor who was Bob Morrow and I did some nasty cartoons about him and my boss who actually happened to be Howard. Howard has been my boss for a long time and I remember he told me so you gotta back off on the mayor because he's starting to like badger us. I think that says something. There's something about ... it's easier to go after a politician who's in Ottawa or London or Washington but when it comes to City Hall here these are people that you got to deal with.

WELLS: We have reporters.

MACKAY: And reporters have to deal with them as well. If you keep it up they're going to stop answering the phones when a reporter calls.

WELLS: Right. So then each day, the cartoon ... that is you picking the topic and give your spin on it.

MACKAY: Yeah as I say it's like you or Andrew or Jeff Mahoney. I'm given the liberty of a columnist. However it hasn't always been that way. I mean we've had different editors as you know and they have different definitions on what my role is. I can fight against it but they're the ones paying me.

WELLS: Let's roll back a little bit to your road here. So you grew up in Dundas and attended junior art classes at the Dundas Valley School of Art. I was reading from a piece that the spec ran when you were first hired that's on your website. You were a news geek as a kid and used to doodle in class and draw your teachers and classmates and in grade four through the whole class and ran off photocopies for all of them on demand.

MACKAY: Yeah!

WELLS: Does it make you popular or not popular?

MACKAY: Oh sure, sure. I still had bullies going after me and stuff like that. But if you're a pretty good cartoonist or an artist, you often are like a hit, if you can use that art against the authority of a teacher.

WELLS: What cartoons or comics did you enjoy reading most when you were growing up?

MACKAY: You know, I didn't read a heck of a lot of comic books. I was definitely into MAD Magazine and Cracked. I loved MAD Magazine. And I think that's probably because it was parody. It was like an early form. I didn't know who the president United States was when I'm nine or 10 years old but I knew about being bombarded by all these products on TV. Actually I was thinking also of Wacky Packs. Remember Wacky Packs? They're these candy things and you get gum and then inside would be all these stickers that were parodies of products. Instead of Captain Crunch it was a sticker showing a box with Captain Crud. I think that was the germ of my fascination with just making fun of, you know, on a pop culture thing that extended to politics which came very soon after that I guess.

WELLS: In MAD magazine, as a kid, I would enjoy the parodies of movies. In very highly detail, they would go through the plot of the movie and just ridicule notions of it.

MACKAY: Don Martin and Al Jaffee and Sergio ... wonderful, wonderful cartoonists.

WELLS: In the introduction to your book, which was published in 2017, which is titled ""You might be from Hamilton if ..."", The Spectator's Scott Radley wrote the introduction to the book. He mentioned MAD Magazine and he also said that a lot of kids growing up probably wanted to be a cartoonist and I was going to tell you that I can attest to that. Back in grade five or six I gave my speech, when we all had to give speeches back in the day, you to stand in front of class give a speech. I gave mine on how my career aspiration was to be a cartoonist and I was a huge Peanuts fan. Charles M. Shulz, the whole thing. I had sketch books but I couldn't draw and so set me back a little bit. When did you know that you wanted to draw, and for a living, and be a newspaper editorial cartoonist specifically?

MACKAY: Well I've always drawn. I guess I'm the nerd who instead of going out and playing football or hockey or whatever I stayed in and drew. But I guess, like I said, it was parody I was fascinated with. I was a television junkie too let's be honest. With MAD Magazine, I was also into SCTV and Saturday Night Live — a lot of these great comedy shows that would make fun of the politics of the day. So you know you had Saturday Night Live making fun of the president of the day, which they do so fine even to this day. And so, you know, that made me wonder: what are they talking about here? So, I guess I came of age to find the fascination of politics when Ronald Reagan was president. That was the time when Pierre Trudeau was the prime minister and I know I would always hear the family discussions at the dinner table. On Sunday night, my grandparents would come over and they would freak out over the latest thing that Pierre Trudeau was doing to the country. And so that started an interest in reading the newspapers and by that time I was delivering the Hamilton Spectator and I could open the paper and I'd see the wonderful works of Blaine, the cartoonist here for so long. And so that naturally went to well, what are they drawing in the Toronto Star? What are they drawing in the Globe? And so I just became aware of a lot of the cartoonists at that time period in the early 80s and it's a lifetime fascination starting from there.

WELLS: It's interesting. SCTV was, I loved that it was just so clever energy in not just politics with shows like that on SCTV but the powerful, the famous to be skewered and made fun of whether it was Bob Hope or whoever. I'd love to see that on Netflix. They got to bring SCTV on Netflix.

MACKAY: That would be wonderful, wouldn't it?

WELLS: Political cartoons have been around a long time, if you're Googling anyways. It suggests that the first one ever might have been in 1754 by Ben Franklin. And just to give the audience the visual: it's a snake that's been cut into several sections to show disunity among the new colonies that were not yet the United States. And the caption is, join or die. And we were just talking before the show briefly, but how you actually did a cartoon years ago, that was a take on Franklin's cartoon.

MACKAY: Yeah, it was to apply to the amalgamation of Hamilton. So you know, they were amalgamating all the colonies back at that time, and the threats were out there. Well, that was sort of the same thing that was happening back in around 1999 and 2000, when the province, was compelling us to amalgamate. I did that cartoon and I showed it to the editor and he didn't know what I was talking about so much I guess. Typical journalist doesn't know the history of satire.

WELLS: Back to the drawing board.

MACKAY: Exactly.

WELLS: I think that one and your work and the best editorial cartoons show how carefully chosen words of a little bit of information convey so much. Just randomly going through your website ... maybe because this one appeared on my birthday ... but the one that is lamenting the end of summer. It says ""RIP summer"" and it has you know these ...

MACKAY: They're Grim Reapers.

WELLS: Grim Reapers carrying this pumpkin man who's heralding the pumpkin spice is back. I just think it's awesome. Pumpkin spice of course is a great flair but it does signal that something is coming to an end.

MACKAY: I'm just around so many people that say Oh, have you had this beer? It's pumpkin spice. It's like no I don't want pumpkin spice. All the coffee shops were bringing their coffee so that's a perfect cultural thing that gets away from the politics. Like I said, I know that there are people who are who are shutting out the politics and they're sick of it and everything and so it's important for us to do some of the cultural references and sort of jab at it, which means we have to put up with every year like pumpkin spice and whatever.

WELLS: I love that stuff. Of course at Christmas time all the different flavours. I'm just like what is that? You know all the different flavours. I don't even know what they are.

MACKAY: The other thing on coffee that drives me crazy is the Roll Up The Rim thing. It's like a sport for me every year to come up with another, you know, let's mock the Roll Up The Rim campaign because it's just ... I walk to work and I see the results of Roll Up The Rim. All these dirty cups all over the place.

WELLS: I've never done it.

MACKAY: Have you not?

WELLS: I prefer my lattes and stuff from elsewhere. Whatever that makes me I don't know. But you know, you gotta hand it to them. They certainly tapped into something.

MACKAY: I do. But it's, you know, take some responsibility because these cups are all over the place. And I know there's been an outcry and it's been getting louder every year. You know, this is the disposable ... like this is the crap that you're adding to the landscape through this. It's just horrible.

WELLS: Is one of your challenges determining how much information to provide in a cartoon? Some of your work, some of your cartoons, have layers and layers of background information, little bits and minutiae within the cartoon. And others have a very simple — what appears to be simple — message although, as I say, with the one about pumpkin spice, simple yet there's a lot to it. That's kind of under the surface. Is that something you think about consciously, or you just kind of go with it?

MACKAY: It depends on how I feel. I guess it's kind of nice to be able to put those little Easter eggs in and just give a little extra fun for the viewer. I mean, I'm a big fan of the intricate cartoons. I know there's a wonderful thing about simplicity of cartoons, but I think from time to time was nice to do these elaborate things.

WELLS: Where people can kind of dig into it and get what they can out of it. Of course, then some people aren't getting half of what you're trying to convey sometimes.

MACKAY: Also if the gag is kind of weak then it's you know, I spice it up. I pumpkin spice it up with more details.

WELLS: I said you were an award-winning cartoonist and you're a two-time recipient of a United Nation citation. The Ranan Lurie Political Cartoon.

MACKAY: Ranan Lurie. He's a famous cartoonist from — I don't know where he's from — Egypt, I think. And he's obviously very rich. He throws his money around and rewards people.

WELLS: Which is fabulous. And then last year you were nominated for a City of Hamilton Arts Award.

MACKAY: Yeah, I was nominated. I didn't win.

WELLS: So what you do is absolutely art. And it's punditry and commentary. Do you see yourself more as an artist or commentator?

MACKAY: I would love to do more art. And a lot of us cartoonists do. I would like to do more art, I'd like to do oil paintings. I look at our colleague here, Lee Munn who does some outstanding artwork. Landscapes and things like that. Boy, that would be a dream of mine to go back to the basics of what I learned at the DVSA and take a sketch book out there and draw stuff. Because that's what I did. I used to do that. I used to go out to museums and draw vases and statue heads and things like that. It's a wonderful, therapeutic thing to do.

WELLS: Just to quickly go back to the politics. I meant to ask you earlier: I'm sure there are followers of your work, or people who dip in on your work on occasion, who think they can pinpoint ... There are people who think they can pinpoint The Spectator's political leanings. Even if we had one, which I don't think that the paper does. I don't think it has a particular leaning but I'm sure there's some who think they can label you along the spectrum. And they'd probably be wrong no matter what they say.

MACKAY: Yeah. Good luck. Cause I don't even know where I am. That's right. One thing that drives me crazy is partisanship. It drives me nuts because I will put something on Twitter and I can easily predict who's going to be weighing and then saying such and such. But you know, there's your example right there. You've got a Doug Ford cartoon there and I'm making fun of a guy. He happens to be a Progressive Conservative. But the day before, I'm making fun of Justin Trudeau, he happens to be a federal Liberal. And then I'm making fun of Trump and I'm making fun of all kinds of political parties. Again, it isn't about partisanship to be a cartoonist. Put that all away. It's all about jabbing the powers. It just so happens, we are in a really good situation now. We had a Conservative in Queen's Park in a Liberal in Ottawa.

WELLS: It's kind of an ideal situation for you.

MACKAY: Yeah, it is. But I think in the past, I might have come here with a bit of a partisan leaning towards the centre right. But I can't ... I'm not there at all. I think over time and being around smart people like we have The Spectator, you know, you've learned something. And I certainly have being here.

WELLS: I've talked about how this is such a rich time for cartoonists, in Canada with Justin Trudeau's reign and the dawn of the age of Trump. Looking back to other periods in your career to this point, is this the most interesting time or have they all been interesting?

MACKAY: We were having some great scandal times right now. But in 22 years you can think back, I mean, there's the gas plant scandal, the Gomery scandal, money in bags that Mulroney was passing to Karlheinz Schreiber. Look at the scandal happening in Washington right now. So I think what happens is you get a series of scandals adding up and that's what lends itself to the eventual defeat of a government. I don't know if this SNC-Lavalin thing is going to topple the government. I doubt it will. I think in a life of government there's a series. I mean we had a Liberal government in Ontario that was very plagued with scandals and it lasted for how many terms. And now we got a new government that's starting up its own scandals so scandals are just part of life, right?

WELLS: It's the fuel for the fire for a cartoonist. Graeme, I'm fascinated by the work you do. As I've already pointed out I envious because you're doing what I wanted to do when I was a kid. It's great what you bring to the Spectator adding colour and perspective and wit to our pages and you're one of the best in the business. And that's in Canada and the US. So I want to say thanks for coming on the show.

MACKAY: Well, thanks. It's a pleasure. Thanks, Jon and Ayesha.

WELLS: Thanks to the audience. And again, you can see Graeme MacKay's archives and other information on the link that we'll put on our podcast webpage. And my thanks to Ayesha Nasir, as always, and we'll talk to you later on The Message.

OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced a May byelection in British Columbia to fill a seat vacated by a former New Democrat MP.

The Prime Minister's Office has set May 6 as the date for the ballot for Nanaimo-Ladysmith.

The riding opened up when former NDP member of Parliament Sheila Malcolmson resigned in January to run successfully for the provincial New Democrats.

Malcolmson was one of several NDP MPs who decided not to run again in October's federal election.

The list includes B.C.'s Murray Rankin, Alberta's Linda Duncan, Ontario's Irene Mathyssen and David Christopherson, Quebec's Helene Laverdiere, Romeo Saganash, Marjolaine Boutin-Sweet and Anne Minh-Thu Quach, and B.C.'s Fin Donnelly.

Bob Chamberlin, a long-serving chief councillor of a First Nation based on Gilford Island in the Broughton Archipelago off northeastern Vancouver Island, has said he intends to seek the NDP candidacy in Nanaimo-Ladysmith.

Chamberlin has worked in the Kwikwasutinuxw Haxwa'mis First Nation and as vice president of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs. He has also worked with Liberal and Conservative governments, served as chair of several agencies and boards, and advocated on a range of issues.

Paul Manly, a researcher, filmmaker and communications specialist who has lived and worked in Nanaimo since 2002, is running for the Green party. Manly finished fourth in the riding in the general election of 2015, earning 19.8 per cent of the vote.

The Conservatives have selected 32-year-old financial manager John Hirst to run in the riding while Jennifer Clarke, who lost the nomination to Hirst, will represent the new People's Party of Canada, led by Quebec MP Maxime Bernier.

We could’ve had a great many discussions about Reconciliation, political party loyalty and how it engages gender and racial power dynamics ...","Erin Gee, Erica Ifill, and Amy Kishek are co-hosts of the Bad + Bitchy Podcast.

Earlier this month, we started seeing criticism on Twitter about the lack of diverse voices and perspectives on the SNC-Lavalin affair.

To what extent do media project the image of a White Canada? Do white people interrogate how the mirror they see themselves in is totally distorted? (Looking for replies of between 80-110%) — Nora Loreto (@NoLore) March 5, 2019

The experiences of cishet white women = not an appropriate litmus test in this situation. The movement to get more women into politics needs to recognize how starkly different white women’s experiences of political life are from those of Indigenous, Black & other WOC/POC. https://t.co/j3VhmEuM21 — Rosella Chibambo (@Chibambo) March 9, 2019

Some came from Indigenous women who lamented the lack of column space for their perspectives on an issue that affected Canada’s first Indigenous attorney general.

Written by actual indigenous journalists who are getting paid for their work. That too would be a nice change instead of asking random indigenous (or worse, non-indigenous) people to contribute 'opinions' off the cuff to a staff reporter. https://t.co/X5eg3tD7hg — JE Barnard (@J_E_Barnard) March 7, 2019

Others came from former political staffers, including Lauren Dobson-Hughes, who took particular issue with how media outlets continue to commission op-eds from former political advisors at the expense of new voices:

For example, (and no disrespect to him, who I enjoy reading), do we need 14 columns in 14 days across 3 outlets from an ex-PM’s DComms on the same topic? Meanwhile, none of these outlets have picked up talent like @vmochama and it’s so damn glaring — Lauren Dobson-Hughes (@ldobsonhughes) March 5, 2019

She even went as far as to identify some women of colour whose perspectives she was interested in hearing — and how by not offering paid opportunities for diverse perspectives, media outlets in this country were effectively showing why they are in continual decline. When we mentioned that two ideas we had pitched had been passed on, Dobson-Hughes elevated our voice and signalled that in turning down active solicitations, media was, indeed, reinforcing a tired ideological bubble.

Also, if you commissioned one of the 14 ex-DComms columns on SNC* and turned down @badandbitchy, please accept your role in the reason your industry needs a bailouthttps://t.co/dpLwbS7e6q *I like AM and his writing this isn’t about that — Lauren Dobson-Hughes (@ldobsonhughes) March 5, 2019

And yet we pitched three different ideas to seven different outlets and had only one picked up, by a publication with which we enjoyed a strong existing relationship.

Our approach to discussing the scandal has been through one we know well: being racialized women at work and the power dynamics that exist for us there. Many women don’t necessarily recognize these dynamics, and by giving us a platform, we’re able to raise awareness of the patriarchal systems that structure our day-to-day lives. But more than that, in linking the SNC-Lavalin affair to the workplace, we can show how these issues are systemic and that by allowing an echo chamber of Canadian pundits to say how wonderful Gerry Butts is, we are ignoring the things that not only got him to his privileged position in the first place, but also allow him to be taken as credible despite limited evidence to support his claims.

What has largely been missing from the national discourse regarding the SNC-Lavalin scandal is a discussion of power: power relationships, access to power, and how that power is wielded. We could’ve had a great many discussions about Reconciliation, political party loyalty and how it engages gender and racial power dynamics, and allyship. That sadly hasn’t happened; not because those perspectives aren’t out there, but because the Canadian media complex is a small, incestuous one that prioritizes opinions from those upholding the status quo. We’ve been treated to a parade of op-eds and punditry arguing over the validity of Deferred Prosecution Agreements, the ethics and morality of the current government, and jobs, jobs, jobs — to say nothing of an endless debate over what constitutes “pressure.” Other perspectives have by and large been absent. What makes this all the more concerning is the suggestion in Wilson-Raybould’s testimony that the Liberal government has been all keyed up, whatever the issue of the day, to line up opinion pieces supporting their policy agenda.

Consider how different our public policy outcomes would be if lobbyists, government-relations professionals, and former political staffers did not dominate the newspaper columns or the evening punditry panels.

The perspectives the Canadian mainstream media chooses to project are those from a particular elite class: the political, cultural, media, and business establishments predominantly hailing from Toronto, Ottawa, and/or Montreal. These media outlets seek their consensus while the demographics of society change and technological progress marches on.

The one pitch of ours that did get picked up was published on International Women’s Day and remains among the few pieces that views the SNC-Lavalin situation from the perspective of not only Jody Wilson-Raybould, but also women writ large.

Meanwhile, a recent weekend edition of The Globe and Mail had a two-page spread of columns on the subject, three of which were written by men named David.

With this approach by legacy media, the cost is ultimately borne by society. As we peel back the layers of this scandal’s implications, we uncover truths about ourselves as a country. Yet most analysis of Canadian political culture remains frozen in the past, when society was perceived as more homogenous, where Indigenous peoples were afterthoughts (if thought of at all), when Joe stood in a movie theatre with a screen behind him projecting Canadian cultural cues that no longer apply for a beer that no one drinks anymore. This is the Canada the media still chooses to use as a baseline for reporting — a false image of the Canadian citizen upon which most commentary is built. But context is continually changing, and for a growing number of Canadians, this isn’t a Canada we know; our Canada looks like something else entirely, and it is against this backdrop that political and social analysis must take place.

Canada’s media, in centring the perspectives of a white, mostly male elite, is saying that not only are newsrooms not for people who are from marginalized backgrounds, but neither is the news. How many people can truly identify with Paul Wells’s waxing poetic about the symphony? Why couldn’t political issues be viewed through the lens of pop culture and Cardi B? In continuing to align politics with cultural notes that are typically considered “high-brow,” we are saying that news and politics are just that. And that’s nothing to say of the misguided belief that pop culture is “low-brow” and therefore incapable of being a reflection of our current affairs. The news should be accessible to all. But Canada has only so many Denise Balkissoons to go around.

The future of the media is a media that looks as diverse as the population it’s trying to serve. This whole SNC-Lavalin scandal provided a great opportunity for the Canadian media establishment to show its value — namely why we should fund it directly at the source — and to re-establish itself as a beacon of thoughtful and prescient analysis. Instead, what we got was either the same old hackery, or tepid analysis from those who have seen us through every other scandal this century. Independent media may be an antidote, but is a patchwork quilt of coverage and requires the investment of both time and money. And investing in these perspectives is vital to our collective understanding of ourselves and each other.

But there are rules and one of the more important rules here (and most everywhere in the country) is that you confine your politics to your own jurisdiction.

Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe crossed that line this week in a tweet directed at Alberta voters urging them to unite behind one conservative party to defeat NDP Premier Rachel Notley.

“Dear Albertans, Prior to the formation of @SaskParty 20 years ago, our province was the example of what dividing the free enterprise movement will do: electing NDP governments, over and over again. United we win, divided we lose,” Moe tweeted.

Moe is supposed to be the premier for everyone in Saskatchewan. And he is addressing Albertans?

Essentially, Moe is engaging in the online equivalent of physically knocking on doors for Jason Kenney and Alberta’s United Conservative Party.

Why would he or others around him not get that there may be a problem here?

Sure, Moe has the right to his personal views and stating them in public likely surprises no one. Sure, it’s common to hear barbs thrown across the floor of the Assembly after the election in another province.

But there’s a reason why you have never seen other Saskatchewan premiers like Brad Wall or Lorne Calvert or Roy Romanow or Grant Devine campaigning for another province while in office. Unlike Moe, they were cognizant of their duties, responsibilities and who elected them.

You weren’t elected by anyone in Alberta. You don’t represent “the free enterprise movement.” Nowhere in your job description does it state that it’s your role to prevent “electing NDP governments.” Your job is not to hurry Rachel Notley along to her political demise, which seems an inevitability, anyway.

Good heavens. Can anyone imagine what Scott Moe would be saying if Rachel Notley started campaigning for Ryan Meili? Golden rule here.

Consider how Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was rightly crucified for doing the same thing by stumping for then-Liberal premier Kathleen Wynne. So Moe is now following Trudeau’s lead? How’d that work out for either Wynne or Trudeau?

Mostly, though, you don’t do it because it’s bad for business.

It’s bad when you go to Conference of Confederation meetings and you have to stand shoulder to shoulder with Alberta’s premier — regardless of who that is — to fight for critical regional issues like pipelines. What would happen if Saskatchewan did have an NDP premier and Jason Kenney decided he couldn’t work with the NDP on pipelines? Would Saskatchewan be right to be miffed?

It’s bad the next time Saskatchewan has to go to a western premiers’ conference to talk about the New West Partnership or to talk about stocking Saskatchewan beer in Alberta or even barring Alberta licence plates at Saskatchewan work sites. (Sadly, the latter seems to have been a largely mythical issue that likely did arise over the Sask. Party government’s need to pick a fight with Alberta over something.)

It’s really bad because it represents a mindset of partisanship taking precedent over what’s good for the province. If Moe needs any reminding how problematic this is, he may want to recognize he’s complaining we don’t have a good equalization formula after Wall and his government abandoned pursuit of the equalization formula everyone in this province really wanted so as not to embarrass former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper for what amounted to an unworkable national promise.

But worst of all, it can only heighten the nastiness because voters see it as one more thing that was once unacceptable now becoming acceptable.

We witnessed elected Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities delegates screaming “traitor” at 40-year-elected MP Ralph Goodale. We heard at SARM mindless rants about separation and shipping the socialists to Venezuela.

Is Moe or anyone else thinking about whether this helps political discourse in Saskatchewan? Wouldn’t we be better off to tone down the animosity and rhetoric?

An explosion in the casual use of cocaine was highlighted by the Sunday Mail last week as we exposed increased use of the drug at Scotland's football grounds.

Here, Liberal Democrat health spokesman Alex Cole-Hamilton discusses some of his party's radical solutions.

Scotland has the highest rate of drug deaths anywhere in Europe.

Last year, almost 1000 people died as a result of drug misuse and last week, we discovered there are more than 55,000 Scots living with a drug problem.

There has been a huge increase in the volume of some of the most potent Class A substances being seized over the last year.

The Sunday Mail’s reports on cocaine use at football grounds illustrate how commonplace this drug has become.

The amount of heroin confiscated by the police has doubled, the number of ecstasy pills has risen threefold and the number of seizures of cocaine soared by 11 per cent.

Problematic substance use has a horrendous impact on the most vulnerable people in our society.

Lib Dem research last year revealed 600 babies in Scotland had been born dependent on harmful substances since 2015 because their mothers had been taking drugs while pregnant.

We need to act now and offer positive and practical solutions.

In 2016-17, the SNP cut funding to drug services by 20 per cent. That is, in part, responsible for a surge in drug deaths and an HIV epidemic in Glasgow.

Put simply, the cost of that short-sighted decision can be measured in human lives.

The SNP’s policy response to these realities has been found wanting.

Their last strategy to combat drug misuse utterly failed. Their new one is feeble, risking another decade of tragedy.

The problem is the Government has, for years, been looking at drugs through the wrong lens.

This is not a criminal issue, it’s a health one. Two-thirds of Scotland’s prisons are overcrowded and people are still being sent to jail for possession of drugs for personal use.

(Image: Getty)

This puts unnecessary pressure on our justice system. And with up to half of people leaving prisons testing positive for drugs, it’s clear that placing drug users in jail won’t stop this ghastly cycle.

The new strategy makes a flimsy commitment to address this but it does not go far enough. People with addictions benefit far more from treatment and education than being locked up – as do the communities they return to.

Scotland’s problematic relationship with drugs stems from the decision to drastically cut funding to drug and alcohol partnerships.

These cuts rocked the foundations of the services many depended on and, unsurprisingly, even though much of the funding has been restored, the sector is yet to recover. Helping people overcome addiction will ease the strain on our NHS.

Doctors and nurses work flat-out to keep the health service going without the resources or staff back-up they need and deserve.

(Image: Getty Images)

If the courts were making more use of drug treatment and testing orders and if drug support facilities had the scope to grow in strength, we would be in very different place.

So, here are some ideas for the Home Office and the Scottish Government:

1. Make a crystal-clear commitment to stop sending people caught with drugs for their own use to prison.

2. Allow humane proposals to establish heroin-assisted treatment clinics to progress. This is a way of reducing harm to the individual and society.

3. Take a liberal and sensible approach to cannabis. Legalise it and take the market out of the hands of criminals.

Canada, South Africa and 10 states within the US have already made this move.

It would protect our young people, bring in a £1billion to the Treasury each year and lighten the load on overstretched police who are required to spend a painstaking amount of time dealing with cannabis possession for personal use.","As drugs epidemic spirals and funding for services goes down, we risk another decade of tragedy",Daily Record,https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/drugs-epidemic-spirals-funding-services-14177696

Notley, meanwhile, later warned of the threat of “American-style” health care under a UCP government.

With a backdrop of Calgary’s downtown skyline, where office vacancy rate is between 25 and 30 per cent, Kenney lashed into the premier, calling her an accomplice in keeping that space empty and the city’s employment rate Canada’s highest.

The carbon tax meant to ease the way for pipelines and Notley’s failure to support the Northern Gateway and Keystone XL pipelines are incriminating evidence, said the UCP leader.

“Rachel Notley sold out to Justin Trudeau and all we got in exchange is a carbon tax and no pipelines,” said Kenney, who also mentioned the proposed federal Bill C-69 that critics contend will make it far more difficult to build energy projects.

“Notley can’t even bring herself to call for a full repeal of Bill C-69.”

Alberta’s economy took a huge nosedive when oil prices plunged globally in late 2014, months before the NDP took power, but Kenney argues other oil-producing jurisdictions have seen greater recovery since.

If necessary, Kenney said a UCP government will launch a constitutional challenge against the legislation, turn off oil taps to a pipeline-obstructionist B.C., and forge a pro-energy alliance with other provinces.

If a pipeline to tidewater isn’t built by 2021, a UCP government would also hold a provincial referendum on reforming equalization payments he says yields $3 billion annually from Alberta taxpayers that sends $20 billion more a year to federal coffers than it receives.

That referendum would be held Oct. 18, 2021.

“Let’s not give up on Canada because of the Notley-Trudeau alliance, let’s end the alliance,” he said.

It was pointed out to Kenney that it was the Harper government — in which he was a cabinet minister — that forged that equalization formula.

Kenney admitted he was “in the cabinet when there were a couple of different versions of equalization” but that times have changed dramatically since then, with Alberta now facing considerable economic challenges.

“We didn’t have provinces trying to block Alberta pipelines,” he said.

Kenney also said he accepts the scientific consensus that human beings are responsible for climate change, but added he won’t insist his candidates or MLAs — some of whom have voiced skepticism — follow suit.

“There’s a spectrum of views about this and this is not a party with a rigid ideological orthodoxy, this is not an issue that has come up for debate (within the UCP),” he said.

Meanwhile, Alberta will get 2,000 more long-term-care beds if the NDP is re-elected, a plan put at risk by “American-style” health care under the UCP, Rachel Notley said Thursday.

Speaking in Lethbridge, the NDP leader said her government already delivered 2,000 of those beds for seniors after taking power in 2015.

“Despite that increase, we know we need to keep building those,” she said of the $170-million investment.

“When you work your entire life to make Alberta prosper, you deserve a government that stands for you.”

In Lethbridge, and again at a rally in the Calgary-North East riding Thursday evening, Notley took aim at Kenney, who has pushed for privatizing some aspects of health care such as laundry services.

“He wants to privatize large parts of our health-care system,” Notley told a crowd of cheering supporters and candidates in Calgary.

“With an aging population, you can bet that that is going to hurt. And why? Why does he want to hurt people with these cuts? To pay for reckless corporate tax giveaways.”

At the Calgary rally, Notley described Kenney as “dithering” on the Springbank dam project and said the UCP leader wants to freeze education funding.

“With 15,000 more kids entering school every year, that is going to hurt,” Notley said.

On pipelines, Notley told the crowd that: “when times were their toughest, I stood up and I compelled the federal government to step up.

“Mr. Kenney thinks that the way to get a pipeline built is by yelling at the rest of Canada and building a firewall, but here’s the thing: you don’t build pipelines through firewalls,” Notley said. “Mark my words: this pipeline will be built and we are going to be the ones to get it done.”

The NDP leader also brought up the topic of racism and referred to the UCP losing a “star candidate” earlier this week.

“The bottom line is this: racism and hate have no place in today’s Alberta and they have absolutely no place in our legislature,” Notley said.

In a message directed at Albertans who have voted Conservative in the past, Notley positioned the NDP as the “moderate mainstream of today’s Alberta.”

At another rally Thursday evening, Alberta Party Leader Stephen Mandel took aim at both Notley and Kenney, describing the NDP as a “far left” party and the UCP as a “far right” party. Mandel positioned the Alberta Party as a “centrist party that cares about people and business.”

“They try to represent something that they’re not,” he said of the other two parties. “We’re the only one not misrepresenting, because we are who we are. We’re not something from the right or something from the left; we’re an amalgam of people who want to see this province move forward in an effective and creative way.”

Related

At her announcement in Lethbridge, Notley said more long-term health-care beds will free up spaces in acute-care hospitals that are now too often occupied by seniors.

The groups Friends of Medicare and Public Interest Alberta said that investment is welcome news but questioned how many of those beds would be privately or publicly operated, adding they much prefer the latter.

“It is disappointing that the NDP’s announcement seems to leave the door open to for-profit corporations providing this care, which means more public money being wasted on corporate profits,” said Public Interest Alberta executive director Joel French, who added 1,700 of the previously created 2,000 beds are privately run.

Also on Thursday, Liberal Leader David Khan unveiled an Indigenous policy platform his government would pursue to make juries, the legislature and school curricula more representative of First Nations.

“The time for rhetoric is over and the time for reconciliation is now . . . we must move beyond just apologies toward real healing and real co-operation,” said Khan, who has worked with First Nations as a lawyer.

The newly-hired executive director at the Kamloops Chamber of Commerce has been let go following a series of controversial Facebook posts.

John Perks suddenly changed the privacy settings on his Facebook page on Friday morning after contents of some posts began circulating on social media.

“Today, the Kamloops Chamber of Commerce is announcing that John Perks will not be employed as its executive director as previously announced,” chamber president Joshua Knaak said in a press release issued on Sunday afternoon.

Shortly after the hiring announcement, some of Perk’s recently shared Facebook posts began to get noticed, including a post that denies climate change is real, a post that refers to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as an “idiot,” a post that refers to substance-abuse addicts as “junkies” and a post that claims the migrant caravan from Central America to Mexico was staged for the media.

There is also a post Perks shared that states pro-choice advocates should be forced to watch an abortion procedure and a post referring to Muslims that is incorrectly attributed to a quote by former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill: “When Muslims are in the minority, they are very concerned with minority rights; when they are in the majority there are no minority rights.”

In defence of the posts, Perks told Kamloops This Week that he did not know his Facebook page was public and that anyone who knows him would not conclude what the posts might otherwise lead them to believe.

One post is a screenshot that implies climate change is along the same lines as “unicorns, Superman, the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, the tooth fairy and old washed up communists becoming president” — referring to Bernie Sanders, who was featured in the posts’s content.

But Perks said that he does, indeed, believe in human-caused climate change “100 per cent” and was only sharing the post to highlight the absurdity of the comment.

Another was a meme post that read, “When your Liberal friend finally wakes up… And thanks you for making him realize Justin Trudeau is an idiot!”

When asked why he — now the chamber’s executive director and someone who will be liaising with government of all levels, including federal, on a regular basis — would share a post calling the prime minister an idiot, Perks said he didn’t recall ever doing so.

“Justin Trudeau is a smart and intelligent man. He’s the prime minister of Canada,” Perks said. “He is due respect and the honour to be in that office. There has to be healthy dialogue if there are differences and that’s what I believe in.”

Another post shared by Perks purports the migrant caravan that travelled to the United States’ southern border was staged for the media.

“My point of posting that was not to say anything about the border wall or security, it was that I couldn’t believe the media is exploiting this crisis in Honduras and exploiting women and children at risk,” he said.

Other recent posts on Perks’ page include pro-Donald Trump and anti-Democrat messages. He said he was a Trump supporter and he admits he was at one point.

“I went to his inauguration, but there’s a lot of things I do not agree with — about 90 per cent,” he said.

In January, Perks shared an image celebrating Trump’s national emergency declaration for funding the country’s controversial southern border wall. The image also denigrated former president Barack Obama’s emergency declarations to lift sanctions preventing aid to countries like Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Ukraine.

Perks also shared posts from the alt-right news website Breitbart, though he told KTW he did not know what Breitbart was.

Perks also shared a post by Facebook page National Conservative News Network Canada, a far-right website similar to Breitbart. The post compared the cost of epinephrine pens to the cost of Narcan and referred to drug-users as “junkies.”

“The messed-up part of that from my perspective is that there are costs behind a medical system that is supposed to be socialized,” he said.

As for drug users being referred to as “junkies,” Perks’ defence of sharing the post was that he has a close family member who is a drug addict. He said it is not prejudiced against drug users.

“Like I said, I didn’t know anybody else would see that. I probably have 2,000 friend requests waiting. I don’t add everybody to my personal Facebook page,” he said.

Perks said he made his Facebook page private on Friday morning because he has personal family photos on the page and wants to protect his family.

Kamloops Chamber of Commerce president Joshua Knaak said Perks went through a “rigorous” vetting process that included not only its board of directors, but also a third-party consultant.

“We saw enough of his social media. We saw enough of him so that we were confident in the person we got,” Knaak said.

“We met the candidate on two separate occasions to get the context that I think is missing. The only way others are going to be able to get that context is to meet John and see what he does.”

I remember seeing in the streets ...","At the heart of the crisis of trust in politics lies the corrosion of public service by the ethos of private gain.

There is little doubt that the western world is going through a serious political crisis, which can be best described as a crisis of trust in its political institutions and governments.

Two things often seem, though, to be overlooked. First, the crisis of trust in institutions is not limited to the west—it is general. The crisis in the west just receives more attention because western media are dominant and because it was assumed that economically more advanced liberal societies should not suffer such a disconnect between rulers and ruled.

Secondly, the crisis is longstanding: it goes further back in time than the 2008 financial crash and the malaise created by globalisation. Arguably, its source is the impressive and somewhat unexpected success of introducing capitalist relations into all domains of life—including into our private lives and, importantly, into politics.

The neoliberal revolutions of the early 1980s, associated with the then US president, Ronald Reagan, and the UK premier, Margaret Thatcher—not forgetting the Chinese ‘paramount leader’, Deng Xiaoping—were supported by revolutions in economic thinking, such as public-choice theory and libertarianism, which explicitly began to treat the political space as an extension of everyday economics. Politicians were seen as just another set of entrepreneurs who, instead of taking their skills and risk-taking preferences to banking or software development, moved into politics. It was thought normal that goal-directed, self-interested rational behaviour need not be limited to the economic sphere—it was more general and embraced politics as well.

Vindicated

This view of the world was amazingly vindicated. Not only did politicians often behave in a self-serving manner (which perhaps they had often done in the past too), but such behaviour began to be expected of them. Not necessarily approved of, but expected in the sense that it was not considered odd or unusual that politicians would first and foremost think of their own financial interests.

They could cash out on the connection and power they had acquired in office by finding lucrative jobs in the private sector (José Manuel Barroso, Tony Blair, Jim Kim from the World Bank). They could give multi-million-dollar speeches to corporate moguls (Barrack Obama, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton). They could sit on a plethora of company boards.

Or, some, coming from the private sector (Silvio Berlusconi, Thaksin Shinawatra), would openly advertise their political parties as just clientilistic organisations: if you have a problem and want it solved, join the party.

The list of politicians who took their own (and their supporters’) money-making to be the normal function of homo economicus once in office is long. We know some of its most prominent members, often by failure—when their activities went a bit too far or when they were unable fully to hide them. We know them through financial scandals and at times jail terms. For example, two out of the last three Brazilian presidents are in prison for bribery. All five former Peruvian presidents have been jailed for corruption, are under investigation or are fugitives from justice. The daughter of Uzbekistan’s late president has been imprisoned for multi-billion dollar embezzlement schemes. The shadow of prosecution hangs over the former Angolan president’s daughter, and chair of its state oil company, the richest woman in Africa, were she to return to the country.

In Europe, the former French president Nicolas Sarkozy has been subject to investigation in connection with a number of financial scandals, the most serious arising from reports of illicit financial support for his 2007 election campaign by the late Libyan dictator Muammar Gadhafi. The former German chancellor Helmut Kohl had to resign as honorary chair of the Christian Democratic Union in 2000 after revelations of secret party bank accounts over which he presided.

The US president, Donald Trump, has refused to disclose his multi-year tax returns and failed to put his business dealings into a blind trust to insulate him from external inducements. His Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, has been able to parlay political power into wealth way beyond his income.

Just business

Politicians, east and west, north and south, have thus fully confirmed to neoliberal ‘economic imperialism’—the idea that all human activities are driven by the desire for material success, that success in money-making is the indicator of our social worth and that politics is just another line of business.

The problem with this approach, applied to the political space, is that it breeds cynicism among the population, because the official lingo of politicians has to be centred on public interest and public service—yet the reality, and the ideological justification for that reality, are entirely different. The discrepancy is moreover easy to spot. Every government official then becomes seen as a hypocrite who is telling us that he is there because he is interested in the public good, whereas it is clear that he is in politics to line his pockets now or in the future—or, if already rich, to make sure no adverse political decisions are taken against his ‘empire’.

Is it then strange that no trust will be evinced regarding anything politicians say? Is it strange that their every action would be seen as having been motivated by personal interest or dictated by lobbyists? Actually, both the market revolution of the 1980s and the dominant economic paradigm tell us that it should be precisely so. And that that is for the best.

No easy solution

The mistrust of governing elites is thus due to the extremely successful projection of the capitalist mode of behaviour and operations into all spheres of human activity, including politics. It just happens that, if one does so, one can no longer expect that people will believe that policies are driven by the ideal of public service.

The problem has no easy solution. To regain trust, politics needs to be subtracted from the fields where normal capitalist rules hold. But to do so requires that politicians reject the standard set of values implicit in the capitalist system—maximisation of financial interest. How and where are we to find such people? Should we, like Tibetans, look for the new leaders in faraway places untainted #by hyper-commercialisation? Since this does not seem even remotely likely, I think we need to get adjusted to the idea of continued mistrust, and a wide chasm between the political elite and most of the population.

This could make politics very bumpy for a long time. It is the apogee of capitalism that is responsible for the bumpiness, and for our—inevitable—political malaise.",The apogee of capitalism and our political malaise,Social Europe,https://www.socialeurope.eu/our-political-malaise

Derek Fildebrandt said that policy is part of the FCP plan to fundamentally change Alberta's relationship with the federal government.

""Only the Freedom Conservative Party is dedicated to breaking the grip of Ottawa and putting Alberta first,"" he said as he unveiled the first plank of his party's platform at the Bridgeland Community Association in northeast Calgary.

Fildebrandt also promised the FCP would demand that Alberta be allowed to collect its own taxes, control policing in the province and control immigration.

""I am tired of Alberta being treated as a second-class colony,"" he said, promising that if major changes don't happen soon, his party would also hold a referendum independence for Alberta.

He summed up his first policy announcement as, ""More Alberta, less Ottawa.""

The FCP bills itself as ""a coalition of grassroots conservatives, libertarians and Alberta patriots.""

Fildebrandt says that means the party is against ""big government socialism"" as well as ""big business corporate welfare.""

""Instead, we embrace a brave new future for Alberta,"" he said.

""We embrace a conservatism that isn't just for small government in business and your wallet, but small government in every part of everyone's life. Our fundamental philosophy is that if you are not hurting anybody else, it's not the government's bloody business.""

Fildebrandt, the sitting MLA for Strathmore-Brooks, said Wednesday that he expects to field roughly 30 candidates in the election, which is set for April 16.

He says the party has been careful to field candidates only in ridings where the NDP has very little chance of winning so that the UCP and FCP don't split the vote.

Fildebrandt also threw barbs at UCP Leader Jason Kenney over the co-called kamikaze affair — allegations that Jeff Callaway's campaign for the UCP leadership was little more than a collaborative effort with Kenney's team to attack their mutual opponent, Brian Jean.

Fildebrandt said politicians are humans and make mistakes and should admit them, yet Kenney has blamed everyone but himself for the controversy.

Fildebrandt first won his seat in the Legislature in 2015 as a member of the now-defunct Wildrose Party.

At a campaign event in Red Deer Saturday, Kenney said a UCP government would end Alberta’s agreement with the Parole Board of Canada and pass legislation creating an Alberta Parole Board.

While Quebec and Ontario have their own parole boards, Alberta contracts with the arm’s length federal institution to provide the service.

The policy is meant to address concerns that repeat offenders, including parolees, are driving big increases in property crime in rural Alberta. But two criminologists contacted by Postmedia are critical of the proposal.

Parole is a form of release that allows offenders to serve the remainder of their sentences in the community under supervision. Parole eligibility dates vary for each inmate. Federal inmates who are not subject to a parole ineligibility period are typically eligible one-third of the way through their sentence — though eligibility is no guarantee of release.

Related

UCP spokeswoman Christine Myatt said the provincial board would decide whether inmates serving sentences in provincial jails — which hold inmates sentenced to two years or less — should be allowed conditional release. The national parole board would continue to be responsible for parole decisions regarding federal inmates.

The proposal was one of nine policies Kenney announced Saturday that take aim at what he described as unfair arrangements with the federal government.

During the speech, Kenney attacked the “alliance” between NDP Leader Rachel Notley and Justin Trudeau and also pledged to use the “prospect of a referendum” on equalization payments to force action on pipelines.

A UCP news release said “much of the recent property crime wave in Alberta has been connected to repeat offenders, including those on parole.” An earlier UCP report on crime in rural Alberta referred to a “revolving door” justice system.

In an email, Myatt said a provincial parole board wouldn’t necessarily be more stringent in granting supervised release. It would, however, be “more in touch with the current crime issues facing Alberta, including recidivism in property crime for those already on parole.”

Keith Spencer, a former criminologist at the University of Alberta, isn’t convinced.

“All it’s going to do is add more cost, and it isn’t going to produce any better results,” he said.

Spencer, who previously worked as an assistant district director with the National Parole Service, said the idea of a provincial parole board is not new.

He said jurisdictions that have looked at the idea typically balk at the cost. It’s also unlikely to be politically palatable, because it shifts the blame if a paroled inmate goes on to commit a high-profile crime.

“I think the government would be smart to stay out of … a justice system where you can never be a winner,” Spencer said. “Because you can have 99 successes and one failure and you only get credit for the failure.”

Anthony Doob, a University of Toronto criminology professor who studies parole, said only a tiny number of people across the country are granted parole from provincial institutions.

In an email, he said Kenney may be right about the role of repeat offenders in Alberta’s rural crime problems, but added it was “very, very unlikely” that much of Alberta’s property crime can be attributed to people on parole from provincial jails.

Postmedia asked the NDP for comment on the UCP proposal but did not hear back by press time.

He said if major political players — like Elections Canada and MPs — haven't fixed their websites yet, it's time to consider ""what kind of message is that sending.""","Several webpages from Elections Canada and MPs lack basic data protections, expert says

Several Elections Canada webpages and personal websites from MPs don't have the basic encryption necessary to stop your information from being hacked as it's sent from point A to point B.

Pages to request publications from Elections Canada, as well as the websites of Liberal, Conservative and NDP MPs use an outdated, unprotected chain to carry information you send to them through the network.

Liberal Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould, Conservative Finance Critic Pierre Poilievre and the NDP's Ruth Ellen Brosseau had this deficiency on the ""contact me"" form that asks for personal information — like your email, name and address — before sending feedback to your MP. Gould and other Liberal MPs updated their sites after queries from CBC News.

Conservative Party spokesperson Cory Hann said the party's websites all adhere to proper encryption standards, but the sites of individual MPs are not run by the party.

NDP spokesperson Jonathan Gauvin said the party has ""been in the process of updating all sites to ensure they're secure for users"" and they're ""committed to ensuring this is the default for all of our sites.""

There are two different protocols for sending data between your browser and the website you're connected with, the unsecure ""HTTP,"" and ""HTTPS"" — the secure version, with proper encryption — where the ""s"" stands for ""secure.""

Banks and credit card-based sites like Amazon started using HTTPS about 20 years ago, and social media sites have had it in place for more than a decade.

""This is what you can really consider the minimum 'security 101' for your website,"" said Aleksander Essex, a cyber security expert at Western University who specializes in democratic institutions.

He said if major political players — like Elections Canada and MPs — haven't fixed their websites yet, it's time to consider ""what kind of message is that sending.""

Elections Canada said they're aware of the security gaps and are working to fix them.

""We share the view that this is an important security measure. We are working on the final stages of implementing HTTPS on our site,"" they said in an email.

Fears of voter suppression

Basic HTTPS encryption isn't just about protecting information flowing through the internet, Essex said. It's about the user knowing their information will be kept confidential and giving people confidence they're interacting with legitimate organizations.

Without proper security, hackers are able to alter information on a website, including redirecting users to decoy pages. In the case of Elections Canada, Essex said these tactics could be used for voter suppression if information like where to vote is manipulated because the site isn't protected.

Essex said he first reached out to the agency eight months ago to flag the issue.

""I don't see any technical reason that it would take as long as it has,"" he said, adding a single web page can be converted into a HTTPS-safe site in a few minutes.

""Ultimately it comes down to the organization's priorities.""

A spokesperson for the Liberal Party said the ""highest levels of security are implemented for all data, communications, and records.""

When asked if Canadians should be concerned about sharing personal information over Liberal-affiliated websites, Braeden Caley said the party takes data security seriously.

""We are also providing 2019 candidates, campaign teams, and campaign officials with comprehensive resources and guides on best practices for information security online, on social media, and more broadly.""

Not every MP's web page is a security risk. Many MPs are already using HTTPS and all of the parties' primary websites are properly protected.

Similarly, most of Elections Canada's site uses a secure connection when it asks for your information.

'Not sending the right message'

Despite steps to fix the problems, Essex said it should worry Canadians that many MPs and the country's election agency are still operating at 1990s-level internet security.

""They say 'we would like to hear from you please sign up give us your email' and they send it insecurely over the unencrypted connection. It is not sending the right message,"" he said.

The party states in a news release that a recent poll found ""a shocking 50 per cent of Albertans surveyed said they support secession from Canada.""

Kenney says in the release that most Albertans are proud Canadians, but they will no longer tolerate the rest the country benefiting from the province's resources while trying to hold back its economy.

Watch: Kenney says his campaign is focused on jobs

His comments come in the wake of the British Columbia government's effort to pass legislation that would impact the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline, which runs from Edmonton to Metro Vancouver.

They also reflect his view of the federal government's Bill C-69, which would change how projects such as oil and gas pipelines are reviewed.

Kenney says that in the midst of economic crisis, Alberta is ""under assault from other governments in Canada.""

""We are by far the biggest contributor to the federation. We have always played by the rules, paid our taxes, and produced wealth for other Canadians,"" Kenney said in a statement on Saturday.

""And it's why we need to stand up and fight for a fair deal, a new deal, for Alberta in the Canadian federation.""

Kenney repeated during a campaign stop in Red Deer on Saturday an earlier pledge to hold a referendum on federal equalization payments if his party wins the provincial election on April 16.

Dave Chidley/CP Alberta Premier Rachel Notley makes an announcement in Calgary on March 19, 2019.

Kenney last week said a UCP government would hold a referendum on equalization on Oct. 18, 2021 — the same date as the next municipal elections in Alberta — if what he dubs the ""no more pipelines'' law hasn't been mothballed, and if there is still no progress on pipelines.

Kenney further says if he becomes premier, he would also call for Ottawa to cut federal income tax for Albertans equal to the amount of the Canada Health Transfer and Canada Social Transfer.

He says that would allow Alberta to raise its tax rates to give Albertans more control over their own money.

NDP Leader Rachel Notley, who spoke at a campaign rally in Edmonton on Sunday, noted she compelled the federal government to buy the stalled Trans Mountain project to keep it alive.

""Pipeline, pipeline, pipeline. That is two more times saying the word pipeline than Mr. Kenney did in the House of Commons in the 10 years that he was representing Alberta in Ottawa,"" Notley told the rally, referring to the UCP leader's time as a federal cabinet minister under former prime minister Stephen Harper.

""We led the largest pipeline campaign across Canada and we have made the need to build pipelines a majority opinion across this country, including in British Columbia.""

Pipeline, pipeline, pipeline. That is two more times saying the word pipeline than Mr. Kenney did in the House of Commons in the 10 years that he was representing Alberta in Ottawa. Rachel Notley

On Sunday, Kenney further pledged a UCP government would seek to form federal and provincial agreement on resource corridors to create pre-approved, guaranteed land corridors for Canadian products.

He also said the UCP would demand an exemption for Albertans to the stress tests recently imposed by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, and would create an Alberta parole board.

Notley, meanwhile, repeated accusations Sunday that Kenney's proposed rollback of corporate tax increases was a giveaway to profitable corporations. She also summarized the UCP's first week of the campaign, where a candidate resigned over online comments she reportedly made about white nationalists, and her replacement was accused of calling for wives to obey their husbands.

""In all fairness, in responding to this, Mr. Kenney did say, listen, he wasn't aiming for perfection with his candidates. Well, Mr. Kenney, mission accomplished,"" Notley said to cheers from the crowd.

She promised an announcement Monday on child care.

Also Sunday, Alberta Party leader Stephen Mandel promised to introduce a single provincial identification card that would replace the current drivers' licences, health cards, provincial ID and the card necessary for buying hunting and fishing licences.

The Freedom Conservative Party, which is less than a year old, will put forward ""30-odd"" candidates for the provincial election, slated for April 16, he said.

Alberta's rights to self-govern are top of mind, Fildebrandt said, alluding to Quebec's separation movement.

Freedom Conservatives would, he said, offer voters the chance to decide ""if they want to continue the relationship with Ottawa,"" should the federal government not ""accept reasonable demands for equality for Alberta within Canada.""

""We want to be treated the same as… Quebec, to have control of our own immigration, our own tax collection, our own police force, our own pension and EI — and the complete end of equalization,"" Fildebrandt said.

The provincial election was announced Monday, and the other main contenders — the NDP, United Conservative Party, Alberta Party and Alberta Liberals — all held events to discuss their messages for the race.

'Not running paper candidates'

The Freedom Conservatives were missing from the first day of announcements. Instead, the party has an event scheduled for Thursday in Calgary to discuss platform points.

""We're not running paper candidates everywhere just to have a number of candidates,"" Fildebrandt said Wednesday. ""We want to have people running where we believe they can actually win.""

The party has strategically placed candidates in ridings where it believes the NDP are less likely to win a seat, he said.

Candidates will promise to answer to their constituents, he said, and not ""other politicians,"" as he accused UCP candidates of doing.

“I hope that our candidates will represent our country, but … we won’t do anything to attract people with different backgrounds. I think these people are coming right now,” Bernier told reporters in Ottawa.

Bernier said he “hopes” that the PPC has a “huge diversity” of candidates, but that it won’t impose any diversity requirements on those who run.

In comparison, part of the Liberal Party’s nomination process is to ensure that a “thorough search” has been conducted for women candidates or others who reflect the demographics of the riding they hope to be nominated in. The NDP have also instituted diversity-based rules recently, requiring that leadership candidates in 2017 collect 50 per cent of required signatures from women in the party, and 100 of the required 500 signatures from traditionally marginalized groups.

Bernier and Johanne Mennie, the party’s communications director, held a press conference on Monday to announce that the PPC had opened its online selection process. It will be open until April 23, with candidate selection meetings to follow between May 7 and May 13.

“The PPC is on target and will be ready for the general elections,” Mennie said.

Bernier said that the party will conduct thorough background checks of potential candidates, similarly to what they did for the executives of the party’s electoral district associations (EDA). The party’s leader said it conducted background checks of EDA presidents, as well as checks of their social media accounts.

Bernier said it’s important that candidates share the values of the party, in order to be nominated.

“That’s most important to us; these people must share our values,” Bernier said.

“People who don’t share our values, they can create their own party, they are not welcome in our party,” Bernier said.

The PPC leader also said he hasn’t called any of his former colleagues in the Conservative Party in the House of Commons or the Senate, to try and convince them to join the PPC as candidates. He maintained that his party will field a full 338 candidates in fall’s general election.

The People’s Party ran its first three candidates in the Feb. 25 byelections in Outremont, York–Simcoe and Burnaby South. Jennifer M. Clarke, who was beat out of the Conservative Party nomination in Nanaimo—Ladysmith, is the People’s Party candidate in the byelection in the riding that was recently announced to be held on May 6.

The ad attacked United Conservative Party (UCP) leader Jason Kenney for comments he made 20 years ago about a campaign he was involved in 30 years ago, in which he challenged the idea that same-sex couples ought to have the rights as couple of the opposite sex.

The ad begins with Kenny clearly boasting about his part in helping to overturn “the first gay spousal law in North America.” (The issue involved a law in San Francisco.)

Then there’s a swell of the kind of ominous tones you hear in any negative ad as a female voice intones that “Kenney stopped dying AIDS patients from seeing their same-sex spouses in hospital.”

And then, the voice actor does what she gets paid to do: Feign a tone of horrified incredulity as she asks: “Is this a premier?”

As attack ads go, it’s a pretty good punch.

“In order for a so-called negative ad to work, it has to have a centre of truth. It has have an essential truth,” said Warren Kinsella, the author, political commentator, and president of the Toronto-based consultancy The Daisy Group.

Kinsella is a veteran of Liberal election war rooms that supported the campaigns of Dalton McGuinty in Ontario and Jean Chretien at the federal level.

That “essential truth”, in this case, is that Kenney is mean or at least can be mean to his opponents. The cheeky smile that appears on Kenney’s face in that NDP ad after he boasts about defeating a same-sex law is the “killer” part of that ad where that “essential truth” is revealed. Kinsella said he expects the ad to take some of the starch out of the UCP numbers.

But then the NDP, whether provincially or federally, has developed a reputation over the last couple of decades as a party that is definitely not afraid of throwing a punch — and the harder they can hit, the better.

“It’s true. That’s their reputation. They’re good at it,” said Kinsella.

In the 2008 federal election, the NDP whipped up one of the all-time nasty attack ads. It was in French for Quebec voters, aimed at Stephen Harper’s Conservatives.

Among other things, the ad warned that a vote for the Conservatives was a vote for war — as battalions of animated soldiers came marching towards the viewers while images of Harper and George W. Bush floated at the top of the screen.

WATCH: The 2008 NDP election ad attacking the Conservatives

“It was one of the harshest ads to be run in Canadian political history,” said Dennis Matthews, a vice-president at the Toronto-based public affairs firm Enterprise Canada.

Matthews is a veteran of Harper-era campaign war rooms and helped design and write some of the advertising and marketing material that powered some of Harper’s successful election campaigns. He was in the Conservative war room in 2008 when that NDP ad dropped.

“It was over the top, but it really hammered the Conservative vote in Quebec,” Matthews said.

In 2017, the NDP fired some shots at incumbent BC Liberal Premier Christy Clark with vague insinuations she was corrupt. In 2013 in Nova Scotia, NDP ads tried to scare voters away from Stephen McNeil’s Liberals with dark warnings about threats to the health care system. And in the 2015 federal election, an NDP dropped what amounts to the meanest insult of all for a progressive voter: The NDP suggested Justin Trudeau was just like Stephen Harper and Donald Trump.

When asked what they don’t like about politics, voters and even politicians themselves often say they don’t like all the negativity, particularly at election time when there’s a plethora of attack ads often from all parties.

But here’s the thing: When it comes to the chance to hold on to or seize power, political parties like the Alberta NDP and many others go negative because going negative works.

“People pay more attention to those ads,” Kinsella said.

“And negative ads do bring down the support of your opponent,” Matthews said.

WATCH: Kenney says NDP attacks on him are “desperate”

Negative ads are not designed to turn a supporter from one party to a supporter of another party. Instead, they are all about damaging an opponent’s ability to recruit volunteers, fundraise and, most of all, to suppress an opponent’s voter turnout.

The most important thing political parties do leading up to and during a campaign is identify their supporters and then get those supporters to the polls. A strong negative attack ad could, in the case at hand, get potential UCP supporters doubting their commitment to voting.

No one expects a UCP supporter to turn into an NDP supporter. But, there are UCP supporters who may have wished that Brian Jean beat Kenney for the UCP leadership 18 months ago and a good negative campaign against Kenney could get that kind of supporter to stay at home on polling day.

Negative ads are also intended to sap morale of the opposing campaign.

The Alberta NDP has been running an online campaign attacking Kenney for weeks now, mostly through a website, trying to help accomplish all of these objectives.

Kenney has vowed that his party’s political messaging will be positive and will avoid personal attacks. In that way, it’s a vow very similar to the one Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has made for the upcoming 2019 federal election.

It is time for change. Positive change that creates good jobs, brings common sense to government, and builds an Alberta that's strong and free. #ableg #abstrongandfree pic.twitter.com/AK09sL7Tci — Jason Kenney (@jkenney) March 19, 2019

But it’s a vow that’s easy to keep when you are, as Kenney is, ahead in the polls by a long shot. It gets a little tougher when the numbers for you and your party start to fall.

“When the numbers start to change, watch out, here’s comes Willie Horton,” Kinsella said, referring to one of the most devastating and infamous attack ads ever, released by supporters of George H.W. Bush attacking challenger Michael Dukakis for being soft on crime.

The ad blamed Dukakis, a state governor, for allowing Horton, a convicted killer serving a life sentence, to get a weekend furlough and then commit rape, assault and armed robbery. The ad was condemned as racist, but it had a devastating effect on Dukakis, who was soundly defeated by Bush.

But negative ads or negative political messaging can also have serious backlash effects.

Federal Liberals were widely ridiculed, for example, when they tried to scare voters in the 2006 federal election campaign with an ad warning about how, if Harper won, we would see an increase in “military presence in our cities. Canadian cities. Soldiers with guns.”

This ad, part of a series of “scary Harper” ads, started off with some scary drumbeats, followed by a grainy black-and-white image of Harper.

But federal Liberals benefited from an attack gone wrong back in 1993 when the Progressive Conservatives ran an ad that some — including some conservatives — saw as mocking Jean Chrétien for his crooked way of speaking, a result of Bell’s palsy Chretien had as a child.

This attack ad, mild by today’s standards, was widely credited for helping to turn the tide against Kim Campbell and in favour of Chretien.

Perhaps one of the most entertaining attacks ads came in the 2015 election when the NDP candidate in the Toronto riding of St. Paul’s, author Noah Richler, decided to put together a video attacking Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau. Richler would lose to Liberal Carolyn Bennett and would later chronicle the creation of that ad in his book The Candidate: Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail.

But it was an ad that gave the the NDP war room trying to support the national campaign of Thomas Mulcair fits even if it delighted political pundits.

Many of the New Democrats in Mulcair’s war room in 2015 ended up in Alberta, after Notley won power, and are still there. That’s because in Canadian political circles, each major party borrows heavily from and builds on earlier campaigns at all levels.

Liberals, Conservatives and New Democrats all tend to draw from the same group of pollsters, advisors, operatives and war room generals which means that tactics and strategy you might see from one party in a federal election years ago be put to use in a provincial election the same party is contesting now.","ANALYSIS: In Alberta and elsewhere, New Democrats have mastered the art of the negative election ad",Global News,https://globalnews.ca/news/5081715/new-democrats-negative-campaign-ads/

""When I heard your speech, being a Muslim and a resident of Canada, it was the most proud moment for me.","OTTAWA — Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer tried to dismiss accusations Saturday that he and his party have not done enough to distance themselves from groups that advocate violence against the Muslim community.

Speaking at the annual Manning Networking Conference, the Tory leader was asked by someone in the audience why he was unwilling to condemn Islamophobia.

WATCH: Scheer tackles Islamophobia, vows to balance federal budget at Manning Conference.

""I don't believe that's true,"" Scheer responded, noting that the House of Commons unanimously passed a motion earlier this week condemning the terrorist attacks against two mosques in New Zealand and the need to ""confront hatred, Islamophobia, and white supremacy, in all their forms.""

""I reject anyone who would, you know, who would speak out based on Islamaphobic principles whether or not, you know, that's somebody who is trying to lump all people of the Muslim faith in together, or whether it is people who are trying to antagonise elements of the society to have a more negative reaction to those who practice that faith,"" Scheer told the crowd of Conservatives, peppering his comments with uncharacteristic ""ums"" and ""ahs.""

""To me the important thing is to speak out against those who would in any way give oxygen or space to those who are trying to promote one group of people over the other,"" he said.

Scheer was criticized this week for failing to do just that.



The president of the Canadian Labour Congress, Hassan Yussuff, told reporters Thursday that Scheer should be held responsible for failing to condemn yellow-vest protesters who showed up in Ottawa in February to demonstrate against pipeline delays while spewing anti-immigrant rhetoric.

""For the leader of the Opposition not able to condemn them ... and stand on a stage with someone who is associated with hate and racism and somehow to not acknowledge that? ... That is a fundamental, I think, failing on his part, and I condemn his behaviour,"" Yussuff said at an event outlining efforts by the union movement to combat Islamophobia and the steady rise in hate crimes targeting Muslims.

""I don't think he should be excused for it, because he should know better, and if he doesn't, something is fundamentally wrong with his leadership, in my view,"" Hassan said.

Scheer spoke to the crowd of protesters, many of whom had lost their jobs in the energy sector and driven from Alberta and Scheer's home province of Saskatchewan to make their point to the government. The protesters also heard from Faith Goldy, the social media personality with white nationalist ties.

Ihsaan Gardee, the executive director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims, said he was concerned that not calling out behaviour against Muslims would give licence to others to act on their hatred and their ideologies.

""We are looking to our leaders for leadership, and being naively ignorant or wilfully blind, neither is acceptable and Canadians should demand better,"" he said.

Earlier during Scheer's chat with Global television's Mercedes Stephenson, the Tory leader was asked how he deals with accusations that he is ""not being tough enough"" with groups advocating violence.

""I deal with [it] by pointing out that the criticisms are completely baseless,"" Scheer responded.

Last week, the Conservative leader was criticized for issuing a statement in response to the massacre in New Zealand without mentioning that the attacks had taken place in mosques, against Muslims gathered for Friday prayers.

There are no words strong enough to condemn this kind of vile hatred. I am praying for peace for the families of those lost and recovery for those injured. 2/2 — Andrew Scheer (@AndrewScheer) March 15, 2019

He said his statement condemned hateful ideology by anyone who promotes any type of superiority of one race or religion over others. ""I condemn that unequivocally.""

The Liberals, Scheer said, had tried to ""score cheap political points in a very disgusting manner"" by politicizing his original statement and the attacks. The Liberals, he noted, did not levy the same criticism against Governor General Julie Payette's comments, which also did not mention the victims were Muslims.

The Tories, he said, are an open, inclusive and welcoming party for people of all faiths and backgrounds.

In a speech in the House of Commons on Monday, the prime minister said events such as the carnage in Christchurch were precisely the right time to talk about politics.

""The best way to support people is to acknowledge that there is a problem and take concrete steps to fix it,"" he said. ""As a global community, we have a choice to make. Will we denounce our leaders who turn a blind eye to those who incite violence?

Will we bury our heads in the sand today only to bury them in our hands later? Prime Minister Justin Trudeau

On Friday, during a town hall meeting in Thunder Bay, a foreign student from Pakistan took the opportunity to thank the prime minister for his words.

""When I heard your speech, being a Muslim and a resident of Canada, it was the most proud moment for me. That prime minister of Canada, Mr. Justin Trudeau, has addressed Muslims. Undoubtedly, your words matter. They affect and they impact. Mr. Prime Minister, I thank you very much,"" she said. ""Undoubtedly, I feel more secure, among all the countries, in Canada right now,"" she said as Trudeau smiled, his head bowed. She received a standing ovation from the crowd.

The Liberals have sought to differentiate themselves from the Tories vis-à-vis their relationship with Muslim Canadians.

Scheer, in some ways, has helped them. He voted, for example, against a motion two years ago condemning Islamophobia and all forms of systemic racism and religious discrimination. The motion called for a study on Islamophobia, data collection on hate crimes and a government strategy to deal with religious discrimination.

Scheer argued that the motion, by singling out one faith, was not inclusive. He raised concerns that by not exactly defining Islamophobia, it could lead to stifling of free speech for those who criticize the religion.",Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer Rejects Accusations He's Soft On Islamophobia,HuffPost Canada,https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2019/03/23/conservative-leader-andrew-scheer-rejects-accusations-hes-soft-on-islamophobia_a_23699178/

Well-placed sources say the former justice minister’s choice for chief justice was a moment of “significant disagreement” with Trudeau, who has touted the Liberals as “the party of the charter” and whose late father, Pierre Trudeau, spearheaded the drive to enshrine the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in the Constitution in 1982.

The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal discussions about a Supreme Court appointment, which are typically considered highly confidential.

For her part, Wilson-Raybould said Monday “there was no conflict between the PM and myself.”

In an email, she characterized the matter as part of the normal process of appointing a Supreme Court justice, which involves “typically CONFIDENTIAL conversations and communications — back and forths between the PM and the AG (attorney general) on potential candidates for appointment.”

She said she’s “not at liberty to comment” on the “veracity” of what the sources said occurred, adding, “Commentary/reporting in this regard with respect to a SCC appointment(s) could compromise the integrity of the appointments process and potentially sitting justices.”

The issue suggests Trudeau may have had reasons unrelated to the SNC-Lavalin affair for moving Wilson-Raybould out of the prestigious Justice portfolio earlier this year — a cabinet shuffle that touched off a full-blown political crisis for the governing Liberals.

Wilson-Raybould has said she believes she was moved to Veterans Affairs as punishment for refusing to intervene to stop a criminal prosecution of the Montreal engineering giant on bribery charges related to contracts in Libya. Trudeau has denied the SNC matter had anything to do with the decision.

She resigned a month later amid allegations she was improperly pressured by the Prime Minister’s Office to interfere in the SNC-Lavalin case, triggering a furor that has engulfed the Trudeau government ever since.

The issue, the sources say, arose after Beverley McLachlin announced in June 2017 her decision to retire that December after 28 years on the high court, including 17 as chief justice.

Her retirement meant the government would have to choose a new chief justice and find another bilingual judge from western or northern Canada to sit on the nine-member bench.

Trudeau created an independent, non-partisan advisory board, headed by former Conservative prime minister Kim Campbell, to identify qualified candidates to fill the western/northern vacancy and submit a short list of three to five names for consideration.

According to the sources, one of the names on the eventual list was Glenn Joyal, who had been appointed in 2011 by former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper as chief justice of Manitoba’s Court of Queen’s Bench.

Wilson-Raybould then sent Trudeau a 60-plus-page memo arguing that Joyal should not only be added to the top court but should be named chief justice as well.

Only once before in Canadian history — in 1906, when Sir Wilfrid Laurier appointed his justice minister to the top judicial job — has a prime minister chosen a chief justice who was not already sitting on the Supreme Court.

Wilson-Raybould’s pick puzzled Trudeau but he became disturbed after doing some research into Joyal’s views on the charter, the sources said.

Joyal had criticized the judiciary for broadly interpreting charter rights and expanding them to apply to things not explicitly mentioned in the charter or, in his view, intended by provincial premiers when they agreed to enshrine a charter in the Constitution.

The Supreme Court’s liberal interpretation has led to things like legalization of same-sex marriage, the right of women to choose to have an abortion and the legalization of medical assistance in dying, among other things Â­– developments Trudeau has celebrated.

In a January 2017 speech to the Canadian Constitution Foundation’s Law and Freedom Conference, Joyal echoed conservative arguments that the top court has usurped the supremacy of elected legislatures to determine social policy.

The charter, Joyal argued, was the result of a compromise between Pierre Trudeau and premiers, most of whom had originally opposed inclusion of a charter in the Constitution. The compromise was intended to maintain a balance between the judiciary and the legislative branch of government, with provisions allowing governments to limit or override rights altogether in some circumstances.

Since then, judicial interpretation of the charter has ignored the intentions of the drafters and “led without question to a level of judicial potency that was not anticipated back in 1982,” Joyal said in the speech, a video of which is available on the foundation’s website. That, in turn, has resulted in a “less potent and less influential legislative branch that seldom has the final word.”

“With the ‘constitutionalizing’ of more and more political and social issues into fundamental rights, the Canadian judiciary has all but removed those issues, in a fairly permanent way, from the realm of future civic engagement and future political debate,” he said.

Joyal was particularly critical of the Supreme Court’s interpretation of section 7 of the charter Â­– the section which guarantees everyone the right to life, liberty and security of the person and under which the top court struck down Canada’s abortion law and the prohibition on medically assisted death.

The court’s liberal interpretation of that section “has become, particularly in recent years, the single most fertile source for the discovery of new rights and the de facto constitutionalization of political and social issues,” he said.

Trudeau rejected Wilson-Raybould’s advice. He ended up appointing Sheila Martin, a judge on the appeal courts of Alberta, Northwest Territories and Nunavut, to fill the vacant western Canadian seat on the bench. Sitting Supreme Court Justice Richard Wagner was elevated to the role of chief justice.

Wilson-Raybould’s advocacy of Joyal for the top judicial job may not come as a total surprise to some Liberals, who’ve privately noted what they consider her conservative, restrictive approach to charter rights in a number of bills, including those dealing with assisted dying, impaired driving and genetic discrimination.

Jane Philpott, as health minister at the time, was jointly responsible with Wilson-Raybould for the assisted dying legislation.

“Wives, respect your husbands. Submit to your husbands. Husbands, love your wives,” the pastor said in the clip. The UCP named Wong on Thursday as the replacement for Caylan Ford in the Alberta election race. Critics have also raised concerns about Wong’s ties to Journey Canada, which is alleged to offer conversion therapy for members of the LGBTQ community. Ford resigned after Facebook messages surfaced this week in which she promoted racist white supremacist talking points, saying, among other things, that she is “somewhat saddened by the demographic replacement of white peoples in their homelands.”

UCP spokesperson Matt Solberg defended Wong on Friday, saying in an email: “It should come as no surprise that a pastor quoted the Bible (Ephesians 5) while delivering a sermon.” The full Bible verse Solberg referenced reads: “Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.” Pam Rocker, a gay Christian activist based in Calgary, called Wong’s comments “troubling.” “I think that verse in particular has been used against women in really harmful ways, in terms of justifying abuse and not being able to get a divorce because you should be doing what your husband says. I think it’s really dangerous,” she said. “When you look at Scriptures, there are Scriptures that seem to advocate for women not to even speak in church, for slavery, for all children in a village being killed. As a person of faith, you have to look at any sacred text in any religion with a huge amount of education and discernment.”

Rocker said Wong’s interpretation of the Scripture seems to reinforce heterosexism and assumptions that genders are not equal, and that men and women have to behave in certain ways. “All of that translates into, when you are making laws, who do you prioritize? And that’s the thing that I would be concerned about,” she said.

Wong is quoted in a 2013 report from the group, and Journey’s annual reports list the Calgary Chinese Alliance Church as a partnering organization. Wong said in an email statement to Star Edmonton that he is not formally affiliated with Journey, but has attended some of its events in the past. “In particular, I attended some spiritual support groups for adults that provide a safe and accepting place for people to share together,” Wong wrote. “To be clear, I do not and would not support conversion therapy in any form, nor would I participate in such an activity in any way. I believe that all must be respected and treated with dignity, and that coercion has no place in our society.” Rocker said while Journey and its proponents don’t use the term conversion therapy, in part because they teach LGBTQ attendees to refrain from acting on their sexual urges rather than changing their sexuality, she considers it a type of conversion therapy. “I don’t know how (Wong) could be involved in Journey Canada and not be involved in conversion therapy, because that’s what they do,” she said. Calgary-Mountain View is a contentious riding. Alberta Liberal Party Leader David Khan, the NDP’s Kathleen Ganley, and Alberta Party candidate and former broadcaster Angela Kokott are all vying for the same seat as Wong.

The United Conservative Party is threatening to pull Alberta out of Canada’s equalization deal, while the NDP is promising more long-term care beds.

Premier Rachel Notley spent the day in Lethbridge, where she promised funding for 2,000 more long-term care beds to try and relieve wait times and alleviate the stress on emergency rooms.

“For the last four years, we've built up our hospitals and our long-term care homes,” said Notley. “As your premier, I will continue fighting for patients and their providers. I will continue fighting for your loved ones.”

UCP Leader Jason Kenney made a stop in Calgary, where he promised a tougher stance against Ottawa, British Columbia, and anyone else who gets in the way of Alberta’s energy sector.

“We will use the ""turn off the taps"" legislation,” said Kenney. “We will demand a fair deal for Alberta in Canada.”

Kenney also suggested that if Ottawa doesn’t shoot down Bill C-69 and ensure that progress is made on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion by the fall of 2021, he will hold and Alberta-wide referendum on opting out of equalization payments.

The locations for both party leaders may show that southern Alberta is a target for both campaigns according to one political expert—and where they go next could indicate where the parties are looking to protect or steal votes.

“In the first couple days of this campaign, everybody is promise-happy,” said Bob Murray, a local political analyst. “Where they're campaigning is gonna tell us a lot more than what we're gonna know right now about the perceptions of where the numbers might be adjusting and where those battleground areas will emerge.”

The election will be held on April 16.

The RCMP and Alberta’s election commissioner are currently investigating allegations related to the 2017 leadership race.

The ongoing probe has experts wondering how much it will affect voters’ decisions at the ballot box on April 16. Early polls favoured the UCP and experts aren’t sure to what extent the “kamikaze” candidate story will affect the party’s chances. Star Calgary spoke to Calgarians on their lunch breaks Wednesday and Thursday to see whether it’ll play a part in their decision. For many voters who were already planning on supporting the NDP, this latest story only confirms the feelings they said they already had about Kenney.

Karen Chu said she doesn’t trust Kenney, but added that has more to do with her concerns around alleged white supremacist and racist views in his party. “I was talking to a friend this morning about how Alberta is a conservative province. I know that. But if a conservative party was elected, I’ve never had concerns about whether the leader would do a good job, would be a professional. But now I’m actually concerned and worried,” Chu said.

Chu’s friend, Matt Leadbeater agreed, having only just heard about the kamikaze story. Leadbeater said he thinks if he was on the fence about who to vote for April 16, this would push him away from the UCP. He also said Kenney’s long political career makes him trust the conservative leader less than other candidates coming to politics from other lines of work. “He’s a politician, that’s his job. So it would not surprise me that he’s a little bit sneaky or anything,” Leadbeater said. Maria Calder said that while following Alberta’s parties leading up to this week, she’s felt irritated and distrustful of Kenney to the point she’s fed up hearing about him and seeing him in the media.

I don’t want to hear about it.” But to some voters, it’s less important than Alberta’s other election issues.

Others, like Ryan Faulkner, said even after learning of this story, he figures he’ll continue to vote conservative this election, as he always has.

But the Green Party of Canada isn’t just a one-topic party, he added. The party’s position on election reform, social justice, implementing a universal wage, and creating stable non-precarious employment, resonates with Cull.

“The Greens are consensus builders. They don’t whip their votes, so I can speak my mind as I run this campaign,” he said.

“I’ve been working on the community level for a long time, but the one thing I’ve noticed is the work we do on a community level has to be supported upstream.

Iain Duncan Smith, a Brexiteer and former leader of the Conservative Party, told the BBC on Sunday: “What happened over last four days was as close to a national humiliation as I ...","LONDON — Your average Brit will tell you they’re sick and tired of Brexit, that the country has had enough, it’s knackered. But clearly, they have not had nearly enough. Britain is obsessed with Brexit.

It’s not an exaggeration to say that ordinary people hurry home to watch Parliament TV in the evening. The streaming service — Britain’s low-rent C-Span — is posting record-breaking numbers, for a seemingly endless number of “non-binding” votes.

It’s a national humiliation, pretty much everyone agrees. But it’s also mesmerizing. Like a train wreck on a loop.

A recent poll by YouGov found that 64 per cent of the public had “Brexit fatigue,” while only 20 per cent said they didn’t.

But the brinkmanship, the high-stakes debates, the snakes and ladders – for those who like political drama, these are undeniably gripping times.

House of Commons Speaker John Bercow – the “order! order!” fellow with the colorful ties and erudite put-downs – has become a rock star, in need of a body guard.

In ways once unimaginable, the public now knows who Chris Grayling is. The hapless transport minister paid a fortune to a company to run ferries if Britain crashes out of the European Union with no deal, only to discover the company had no, umm, actual ferries.

You don’t travel across the country with two small children to spend hours walking in crowds unless you really really feel it’s important

More than five million people have signed an online petition to cancel Brexit. The website has crashed. Multiple times.

Organizers said turnout for the “Put It to the People” march in London on Saturday exceeded one million, making it one of the biggest demonstrations Britain has seen. Ever.

Oh, they care.

They brought their children to London. They brought their dogs. They made costumes.

Helen Farr, 41, a university lecturer, traveled from Southampton with her two small children, ages 1 and 5, to be at the march. This was non-essential travel on packed trains with a child in diapers.

“You don’t travel across the country with two small children to spend hours walking in crowds unless you really really feel it’s important,” she said, pushing her buggy through throngs waving blue flags of the EU.

The atmosphere? “Positively febrile,” according to the British press. We had to look that one up. It means fevered, intensely and nervously active.

An overexcited foreign correspondent in Brussels told the BBC this was “the biggest EU story since the fall of the Berlin wall.”

Across the pond, the Mueller report is big news.

But in London, the press revealed that the Ministry of Defense has set up an operations room in “a bunker” at its main Whitehall building to deal with a potential no-deal Brexit, under the banner of “Operation Redfold.”

The last time the British government was operating out of a bunker in Whitehall? The Blitz.

On Sunday, the airwaves were filled with stories about “coups” and “plotters” and how Prime Minister Theresa May was on the way out, in days if not hours.

The Sunday Times front page: “Cabinet coup to ditch Theresa May for emergency PM.”

The very same newspaper on Monday? Never mind.

The Sun tabloid printed a front-page editorial, “TIME’S UP THERESA! Theresa May has shown courage – but to seal her deal and deliver Brexit, she needs to resign.”

This made a big splash. For about ten minutes.

It’s not that some “plotters” wouldn’t mind seeing the prime minister off.

But here’s the problem. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox told BBC Breakfast on Monday the government was “constrained by the fact that we have a Leave electorate and a Parliament that leans towards Remain and the government doesn’t have a majority in the House of Commons.”

Finance Minister Phillip Hammond advised Sky News, “Changing the prime minister wouldn’t help us. Changing the party in government wouldn’t help us. We’ve got to address the question of what type of Brexit is acceptable to Parliament, what type of way forward Parliament can agree on, so we can can avoid what would be an economic catastrophe of a no-deal exit.”

“Catastrophe.” His words, not ours.

What might happen this week? What time is it?

“Quite openly now, people in government are talking about something more dramatic as a way out,” the BBC political editor Laura Kuesnssberg reported. “Cryptically they call that a ‘democratic event.’ What would we call that? An election.”

This was supposed to be the week Britain left the EU. But an extension has prolonged the agony. Tune into the talk shows, and it’s more of the same debates over and over and over again: The vexing issue of the Irish backstop, the arcane internal tensions of Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party; the complexity of the customs union; and, yes, the “Norway option.”

The big talking points today are: Will the government hold a third meaning vote on its twice-defeated withdrawal deal? Can Parliament seize control of the Brexit process through a series of “indicative votes”? Will May survive the week?

While Brexit may be gripping for some, it’s anxiety-inducing for others. Iain Duncan Smith, a Brexiteer and former leader of the Conservative Party, told the BBC on Sunday: “What happened over last four days was as close to a national humiliation as I think I’ve seen,” he said.

He said May’s speech on Wednesday night, where she blamed the very lawmakers she needs to back her vote, was a “tactical mistake,” and that Britain accepting the new Brexit deadlines proposed by the EU was “as close to being humiliated as any prime minister I’ve ever seen in Britain.”

Notley in Edmonton

Alberta NDP Leader Rachel Notley was in Edmonton Sunday afternoon giving a speech to hundreds of screaming supporters at the Polish Hall, 10960 104 St NW, Edmonton. It is the only event on her scheduled Sunday.

Notley said the NDP inherited an economy that is “deeply damaged” and said an elected NDP will balance the books by 2023 without making “reckless cuts.”

Mandel in Edmonton

Alberta Party Leader Stephen Mandel is door-knocking Sunday morning in the Edmonton-McClung riding. It is the only event he is scheduled for Sunday.

However, the Alberta Party released plans Sunday to do away with paper and plastic government ID cards in favour of digital identification. According to a Sunday news release, the plan would see plastic and paper identification for health care, drivers’ licenses, provincial ID and the Alberta WIN cards all converted digitally to a “government identification app with a portal to allow Albertans more flexibility when presenting ID.”

“My paper AHS card is a daily reminder Alberta is still using solutions from the 1970s,” Mandel said in the news release. “It’s time to start living in the present by consolidating identification for government licensing and access to services. Digital identity is commonplace. If we don’t develop or modernize, we’ll simply be left behind.”

Khan in Calgary

Alberta Liberal Leader Dave Khan is in Calgary Sunday making calls from his campaign office from 9-10:30 a.m., attending a campaign office grand opening for Calgary North East candidate Gul Khan from 1-3 p.m., and finally door knocking in the Calgary-Mountain View riding from 4:30-7 p.m.

On Sunday, the Alberta Liberals unveiled their platform policy for new Canadians, pledging to improve access to foreign credential upgrades, boosting settlement funding and investing in adult education and English-as-a-second-language programs.

“We will make it easier for immigrants to access Alberta Government services,” Khan said in a news release. “We will provide those services in more languages. We will establish a telephone service that allows new Canadians to speak to government agents with the help of a translator.

“New Canadians are vital to Alberta. Immigrants help us unlock our economic potential and the diversity they create enriches the multicultural fabric of our nation.”

UCP in Slave Lake

UCP candidate for Athabasca-Barrhead-Westlock, Glenn Van Dijken, is in Slave Lake Sunday to detail the party’s plan to “stand up for Alberta’s forestry workers.”

Van Dijken will make the announcement at 1 p.m. at the Vanderwell Contractors Ltd (Mill), 695 West Mitsue Industry Road, in Slave Lake.

(A previous version of this story said Jason Kenney will be in Slave Lake Sunday but he will not be participating in the announcement.)

In a Sunday news release, van Dijken called out the NDP government for “restricting timber access” and “over-regulation”, and said a UCP government would set up a Caribou Range Task Force to review the NDP’s Alberta Caribou Draft Plan.

“It is essential that forest companies have long-term access to a sustainable secure fibre supply,” van Dijken said. “We need to get behind our foresters. For Albertans, this is a vital industry.”

On Saturday night, the party confirmed Sanjay Patel as the UCP candidate in the Edmonton-Ellerslie riding.

“Like many Albertans, Sanjay Patel came to Canada seeking opportunity. Sanjay received a Bachelor of Science degree in India, and since coming to Alberta, he has worked in the construction industry,” Kenney said in a Saturday news release. “Sanjay will be a huge asset to the United Conservative team as we work to present Albertans with a common-sense alternative to the NDP. I am pleased to welcome Sanjay as the United Conservative candidate in Edmonton-Ellerslie.”

The United Conservative Party is equally vague on the proposal.,"Many people with diabetes rely on specific equipment to help them manage their condition but they say the province isn’t keeping up with technology to keep them healthy.

Diabetics, like Susan Dafoe, use an insulin pump to help manage blood sugar levels. The devices are a more efficient and less painful way of monitoring the condition because they do away with needles and constant testing.

“It’s completely changed my life actually. I did multiple daily injections for almost 30 years, so switching to a pump was a big deal for me. At first I wasn’t quite sure, but it’s been life changing.”

Dafoe wears her pump around the clock and the unit produces insulin as needed through a single port.

Since 2013, the province has covered the cost of insulin pumps, which is about $7,000.

However, many of those original pumps had a five-year warranty that’s now run out.

Dafoe says the pumps have newer technology that allows the devices to automatically administer insulin based on the user’s blood sugar levels. She adds they have a number of other helpful features too.

“My blood sugar goes to my phone every five minutes and I have a continuous read of my blood sugars all day. It has a lot of different features than some of the pumps: it’s touch screen, it’s smaller, it’s faster but the biggest feature is the continuous monitor.”

The new pumps have already been approved by Health Canada and Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Ontario have already agreed to cover the costs of those pumps but, so far Alberta hasn’t followed suit. That’s something that Dafoe finds frustrating.

“If something happens to my pump, that could put me in danger, really. It’s not a good situation. I still have supplies, I am still using my pump and it’s still working, but the fact that it hasn’t been approved yet just wasn’t something that I expected.”

The government hasn’t provided any explanation why it's been dragging its feet on approving the new pumps.

“I can tell you we definitely take the advice of our officials very seriously and we will gather that evidence and make those decisions,” said Health Minister Sarah Hoffman last week.

The United Conservative Party is equally vague on the proposal.

“A United Conservative government would consult with stakeholders and take the advice of medical and health department experts when making these kinds of decisions,” Christine Myatt said in an email to CTV News.

When it comes down to it, Dafoe says she just wants the best pump to help her manage her diabetes.

“Technology is changing all the time, so I really would like the best technology and the newest technology versus having the same technology for five years.”

If the pump is approved by the program, the entire cost is covered. But if it’s not, users would need to spend thousands of dollars on a new pump and thousands more every few months for supplies.

But there are rules and one of the more important rules here (and most everywhere in the country) is that you confine your politics to your own jurisdiction.

Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe crossed that line this week in a tweet directed at Alberta voters urging them to unite behind one conservative party to defeat NDP Premier Rachel Notley.

“Dear Albertans, Prior to the formation of @SaskParty 20 years ago, our province was the example of what dividing the free enterprise movement will do: electing NDP governments, over and over again. United we win, divided we lose,” Moe tweeted.

Moe is supposed to be the premier for everyone in Saskatchewan. And he is addressing Albertans?

Essentially, Moe is engaging in the online equivalent of physically knocking on doors for Jason Kenney and Alberta’s United Conservative Party.

Why would he or others around him not get that there may be a problem here?

Sure, Moe has the right to his personal views and stating them in public likely surprises no one. Sure, it’s common to hear barbs thrown across the floor of the Assembly after the election in another province.

But there’s a reason why you have never seen other Saskatchewan premiers like Brad Wall or Lorne Calvert or Roy Romanow or Grant Devine campaigning for another province while in office. Unlike Moe, they were cognizant of their duties, responsibilities and who elected them.

You weren’t elected by anyone in Alberta. You don’t represent “the free enterprise movement.” Nowhere in your job description does it state that it’s your role to prevent “electing NDP governments.” Your job is not to hurry Rachel Notley along to her political demise, which seems an inevitability, anyway.

Good heavens. Can anyone imagine what Scott Moe would be saying if Rachel Notley started campaigning for Ryan Meili? Golden rule here.

Consider how Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was rightly crucified for doing the same thing by stumping for then-Liberal premier Kathleen Wynne. So Moe is now following Trudeau’s lead? How’d that work out for either Wynne or Trudeau?

Mostly, though, you don’t do it because it’s bad for business.

It’s bad when you go to Conference of Confederation meetings and you have to stand shoulder to shoulder with Alberta’s premier — regardless of who that is — to fight for critical regional issues like pipelines. What would happen if Saskatchewan did have an NDP premier and Jason Kenney decided he couldn’t work with the NDP on pipelines? Would Saskatchewan be right to be miffed?

It’s bad the next time Saskatchewan has to go to a western premiers’ conference to talk about the New West Partnership or to talk about stocking Saskatchewan beer in Alberta or even barring Alberta licence plates at Saskatchewan work sites. (Sadly, the latter seems to have been a largely mythical issue that likely did arise over the Sask. Party government’s need to pick a fight with Alberta over something.)

It’s really bad because it represents a mindset of partisanship taking precedent over what’s good for the province. If Moe needs any reminding how problematic this is, he may want to recognize he’s complaining we don’t have a good equalization formula after Wall and his government abandoned pursuit of the equalization formula everyone in this province really wanted so as not to embarrass former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper for what amounted to an unworkable national promise.

But worst of all, it can only heighten the nastiness because voters see it as one more thing that was once unacceptable now becoming acceptable.

We witnessed elected Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities delegates screaming “traitor” at 40-year-elected MP Ralph Goodale. We heard at SARM mindless rants about separation and shipping the socialists to Venezuela.

Is Moe or anyone else thinking about whether this helps political discourse in Saskatchewan? Wouldn’t we be better off to tone down the animosity and rhetoric?

In refusing to recognize the tort at this time, the court rejected the argument made by the plaintiff’s lawyer in Merrifield v. Canada (Attorney General) that the new tort was necessary because of society’s increased “recognition that harassment is wrongful conduct.”

“It was apparent that the court didn’t want to have these kinds of claims brought into court at this time,” says Laura Young of Laura Young Law Offices in Toronto, who represented Peter Merrifield. “So, harassed employees are now stuck with proving intentional infliction of mental suffering.”

Ultimately, the court found that there was no compelling policy rationale to recognize the tort of harassment.

“While it is true that there is increased and long-overdue societal recognition that workplace harassment is completely unacceptable conduct, the Court of Appeal simply did not see any legal gaps warranting the recognition of a new tort at this time,” says Paul Boshyk, a Toronto partner in McMillan LLP’s advocacy and employment group. “In essence, the court concluded that the tort of harassment was a less onerous version of the already well-established tort of intentional infliction of mental suffering.”

Boshyk says human rights tribunals have, in recent years, shown an increased willingness to award significant damages to employees in workplace harassment cases. He cites O.P.T. v. Presteve Foods, the 2015 landmark decision where the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario ordered an employer to pay record-high damages of $150,000 for “injury to dignity, feelings and self-respect” after it found that the employer engaged in a persistent and ongoing pattern of sexual harassment in the workplace.

To some extent, the decision should not be a surprise.

In 2010, Juriansz, the senior judge in Merrifield, was a member of the unanimous bench that decided Piresferreira v. Ayotte. In that case, the bench declined to recognize a new tort of negligent infliction of mental suffering — essentially the equivalent of the harassment tort put forward in Merrifield.

The court also noted the Supreme Court of Canada’s ruling in Wallace v. United Grain Growers, where Justice Frank Iacobucci (now retired), writing for the majority, intimated that the recognition of a new tort in the employment context, which is a contractual relationship, was better left to the Legislature.

Here, Merrifield was indeed an RCMP employee member and a member of the force’s threat assessment group, whose responsibilities included protecting politicians. Following what he characterized as seven years of bullying and harassment from his superiors stemming from his alleged breach of RCMP regulations after he sought a Conservative Party nomination in Barrie, Ont., Merrifield left his job and in 2007 sued for harassment, international infliction of mental suffering, loss of income and general damages.

After a 40-day trial that ended in 2016, Justice Mary Vallee of the Superior Court of Justice recognized harassment as a freestanding tort. She awarded Merrifield $100,000 in general damages, $41,000 in special damages and $825,000 in costs.

But a unanimous Court of Appeal composed of justices Russell Juriansz, David Brown and Grant Huscroft ruled that Vallee had erred in recognizing the new tort. Doing so, the court concluded, was not a matter of judicial discretion that allowed judges to create new torts “anytime” they considered it appropriate to do so.

“This is not a case whose facts cry out for the creation of a novel legal remedy,” the court wrote — while stating in virtually the same breath that it did not “foreclose the development of a properly conceived tort of harassment that might apply in appropriate contexts.”

Merrifield wasn’t a case that cried out for an award based on intentional infliction of mental suffering either. In allowing the defendant’s appeal and dismissing the action, the appellate court concluded that the trial judge had made “palpable and overriding errors” in her findings of fact and incorrectly applied the legal test for intentional infliction of mental suffering.

(As if getting to the bottom of a potential major breach of Canada’s justice system isn’t the work the Justice committee.),"House of Commons committees have to be reformed. They have to be made fully independent. Opposition committee members have to have the authority to call witnesses whether the government majority approves or not.

We saw what a partisan farce a Commons committee could be when the Liberal majority on the Justice committee voted last week to shut down their already only half-assed investigation into the SNC-Lavalin scandal.

To make an even greater mockery of the democratic process, the Liberals voted to kill off the inquiry behind closed doors, with no members of the public or television cameras present.

The opposition Conservatives and New Democrats did what they could to protest.

On Tuesday afternoon (the same day as the Liberals stuck a knife in the Lavscam hearings), the two main opposition parties tried to drown out Finance Minister Bill Morneau in the Commons chamber itself. When Morneau rose to deliver his annual budget address, the opposition raised several points of order, interrupted with questions of privilege and shouted “Cover up! Cover up!” over his speech.

The Conservative caucus then rose en masse and marched out of the chamber.

Overnight on Wednesday, the Conservatives also held up Commons business by insisting on individual votes on scores of separate budget resolutions, rather than passing them in one big motion, as is the custom.

All of these demonstrations were impressive – plus entirely justified. And they had the indirect effect of sucking all the attention away from the Liberals’ big-spending, feel-good, pre-election budget.

But the protests got the opposition and the Canadian public exactly nowhere on Lavscam.

We know no more now than we did before all the antics and theatrics, because the problem is not a lack of opposition horn blowing and noisemaking, it is the toothless nature of Commons committees. Until that is changed, there will never be any meaningful way to force the truth out when the government of the day would rather the facts stay buried.

Randy Boissonnault, the Liberal MP for Edmonton Centre and one of the leaders of efforts to shut down the Lavscam hearings prematurely, insisted there was no need to continue. Wilson-Raybould had testified, Boissonnault pointed out, as had Michael Wernick, the now “retired” clerk of the Privy Council, and Gerald Butts, the P.M.’s former principal secretary.

“It is now time … [to] return to the work of the Justice committee,” Boissonnault said. (As if getting to the bottom of a potential major breach of Canada’s justice system isn’t the work the Justice committee.)

Remember, it was Boissonnault who tried to convince Canadians that Wilson-Raybould couldn’t be asked to testify the first time because Commons committees are not investigative bodies.

Boissonnault and the Liberal majority on the committee have from the beginning always put Liberal Party interests ahead of the interests of their constituents, as Canadians, to learn what really happened last fall when Trudeau, senior staffers and the supposedly non-partisan clerk tried on many occasions to pressure Wilson-Raybould into cutting SNC a deal in court that would enable the company to avoid prosecution on an enormous and elaborate bribery and fraud scheme.

There aren’t many features of the U.S. congressional system that I would like to adopt in our Parliamentary system, but their independent committee structure is one.

The majority party has lots of control over when House or Senate business and legislation gets discussed and voted on, but the majority cannot prevent the minority party from calling witnesses and entering documents and reports into the committee record.

Canadians now have to hope federal ethics commissioner Mario Dion gets to the bottom of Lavscam or the RCMP opens an investigation. But independent committees wouldn’t have to sit around waiting for either of those to happen.",GUNTER: It's time to give House of Commons committees some teeth,Toronto Sun,https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/gunter-its-time-to-give-house-of-commons-committees-some-teeth

* Management consultant Michelle Cornfield for the Liberals;

* Sun Life Financial manager John Hirst for the Conservatives;

Last year, Hirst soundly defeated Clarke to become the Conservative candidate.

Paul Manly ran for the Greens in 2015 after being rejected by the NDP.

The Green candidate, Manly, ran in 2015 and is the son of former NDP MP Jim Manly, who represented Cowichan-Malahat–The Islands from 1980 to 1988.

Manly's father was arrested in Gaza in 2012 after being part of group of protesters aboard the MV Estelle that tried to break through an Israeli blockade.

“We had hoped that the New Democrats and other parties also would speak out. Not particularly for me but for the people of Gaza and of Palestine,” Jim Manly told the Straight in 2015. “And they didn’t and this has never been Paul’s central issue. It’s been a very important issue for Eva—my wife—and myself. But it’s never been Paul’s central issue.”

Freedom Conservative Party leads charge of election outsiders ...","The first thing to understand is that it isn’t to be drunk like a shot of booze.

The thimble-sized glasses that the ancient Japanese drink of sake is so often served in is likely what first caused such confusion among Canadians.

But these days, more and more people — especially here in Calgary — are becoming accustomed to what was, until recently, often looked upon as a tipple only to be imbibed in rare visits to Japanese restaurants.

Calgarian Toshiki Uehara has keenly watched this development and, as co-managing director of the city-based premium sake importing company, Sake Gami, expects this increasing popularity to gather even more momentum as an increasing number of restaurants and cocktail bars include the drink on their menus.

The recent approval of the massive Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) is expected to fuel such future growth, as Canada and Japan have both signed on to the global free trade deal, which should see tariffs reduced on a vast range of items in the years ahead.

Uehara, who has lived in Calgary for 25 years, said sake exports to Canada have tripled over the past decade and are now more than $265 million a year. The increase is such that this country ranks seventh in the world for importing sake — ahead of all other western countries, except the United States.

While cities such as Vancouver and Toronto have long had a loyal following for the drink, the growing popularity in Calgary is relatively new. Uehara and his business partner saw an opportunity five years ago.

“Here in Calgary and Alberta premium sake was relatively unknown: that was our starting point. We thought there was room to grow and now consumer demand is really catching up,” he said.

“Now, many restaurants offer premium sake and have an excellent selection, not just by the bottle but many places are now selling by the glass. Today our focus is not just Japanese restaurants but French, Chinese, oyster bars, steak houses, cocktail bars — you name it,” added Uehara, who is a trained sake sommelier as well as a professional importer of the premium brands.

He said many people are surprised to discover that sake has an alcohol content of around 16 per cent, making it much more similar to wine than it is to drinks such as vodka or whisky.

“Some people might assume it is high in alcohol but that perception is changing. Now people are tending to drink more seriously and sip instead of drinking it in one go, which is one of the reasons wine lovers are enjoying sake much more these days. It can be enjoyed at different temperatures, which changes its characteristics and nuances of taste,” added Uehara.

While sales of sake in Alberta are increasing at around 20 per cent a year, it is still not a staple at regular liquor stores across the province, although specialty wine outlets are beginning to show an interest in stocking the drink.

Uehara believes it is just a matter of time for wider acceptance on store shelves but, for now, he is continuing to market the vast variety of high-quality sake mainly to restaurants.

Just as wine relies upon the different variety of grape used in production, sake is dependent upon the grains of rice used in its fermentation process. There are more than 100 different types of rice used, all of them separate from the type of rice used in food servings for dishes such as sushi.

“Sake rice is different from table rice. It is larger and has starch concentrated in the middle as opposed to table rice that has starch all mixed throughout. That is why you hear about the polishing rate — the more the rice is polished the closer you get to that starch in the middle, and that starch is what becomes the core part of the premium sake,” he said.",Sake quickly becoming the toast of Calgary,Calgary Herald,https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/sake-quickly-becoming-the-toast-of-calgary

The Prime Minister's Office has set May 6 as the date for the ballot for Nanaimo-Ladysmith.

The riding opened up when former NDP member of Parliament Sheila Malcolmson resigned in January to run successfully for the provincial New Democrats.

Malcolmson was one of several New Democrat MPs who decided not to run again in October's federal election.

The list includes B.C.'s Murray Rankin, Alberta's Linda Duncan, Ontario's Irene Mathyssen and David Christopherson, Quebec's Helene Laverdiere, Romeo Saganash, Marjolaine Boutin-Sweet and Anne Minh-Thu Quach, and B.C.'s Fin Donnelly.

Bob Chamberlin, a long-serving chief councillor of a First Nation based on Gilford Island in the Broughton Archipelago off northeastern Vancouver Island, has said he intends to seek the NDP candidacy in Nanaimo-Ladysmith.

Chamberlin has worked in the Kwikwasutinuxw Haxwa'mis First Nation and as vice-president of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs. He has also worked with Liberal and Conservative governments, served as chair of several agencies and boards and advocated on a range of issues.

Paul Manly, a researcher, filmmaker and communications specialist who has lived and worked in Nanaimo since 2002, is running for the Green party. Manly finished fourth in the riding in the general election of 2015, earning 19.8 per cent of the vote.

The newly-hired executive director at the Kamloops Chamber of Commerce has been let go following a series of controversial Facebook posts.

John Perks suddenly changed the privacy settings on his Facebook page on Friday morning after contents of some posts began circulating on social media.

“Today, the Kamloops Chamber of Commerce is announcing that John Perks will not be employed as its executive director as previously announced,” chamber president Joshua Knaak said in a press release issued on Sunday afternoon.

Shortly after the hiring announcement, some of Perk’s recently shared Facebook posts began to get noticed, including a post that denies climate change is real, a post that refers to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as an “idiot,” a post that refers to substance-abuse addicts as “junkies” and a post that claims the migrant caravan from Central America to Mexico was staged for the media.

There is also a post Perks shared that states pro-choice advocates should be forced to watch an abortion procedure and a post referring to Muslims that is incorrectly attributed to a quote by former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill: “When Muslims are in the minority, they are very concerned with minority rights; when they are in the majority there are no minority rights.”

STORY: https://t.co/Koxferhw0c pic.twitter.com/Di3KsyGhbU — Kat Slepian (@katslepian) March 25, 2019

In defence of the posts, Perks told Kamloops This Week that he did not know his Facebook page was public and that anyone who knows him would not conclude what the posts might otherwise lead them to believe.

One post is a screenshot that implies climate change is along the same lines as “unicorns, Superman, the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, the tooth fairy and old washed up communists becoming president” — referring to Bernie Sanders, who was featured in the posts’s content.

But Perks said that he does, indeed, believe in human-caused climate change “100 per cent” and was only sharing the post to highlight the absurdity of the comment.

Another was a meme post that read, “When your Liberal friend finally wakes up… And thanks you for making him realize Justin Trudeau is an idiot!”

When asked why he — now the chamber’s executive director and someone who will be liaising with government of all levels, including federal, on a regular basis — would share a post calling the prime minister an idiot, Perks said he didn’t recall ever doing so.

“Justin Trudeau is a smart and intelligent man. He’s the prime minister of Canada,” Perks said. “He is due respect and the honour to be in that office. There has to be healthy dialogue if there are differences and that’s what I believe in.”

Another post shared by Perks purports the migrant caravan that travelled to the United States’ southern border was staged for the media.

“My point of posting that was not to say anything about the border wall or security, it was that I couldn’t believe the media is exploiting this crisis in Honduras and exploiting women and children at risk,” he said.

Other recent posts on Perks’ page include pro-Donald Trump and anti-Democrat messages. He said he was a Trump supporter and he admits he was at one point.

“I went to his inauguration, but there’s a lot of things I do not agree with — about 90 per cent,” he said.

In January, Perks shared an image celebrating Trump’s national emergency declaration for funding the country’s controversial southern border wall. The image also denigrated former president Barack Obama’s emergency declarations to lift sanctions preventing aid to countries like Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Ukraine.

Perks also shared posts from the alt-right news website Breitbart, though he told KTW he did not know what Breitbart was.

Perks also shared a post by Facebook page National Conservative News Network Canada, a far-right website similar to Breitbart. The post compared the cost of epinephrine pens to the cost of Narcan and referred to drug-users as “junkies.”

“The messed-up part of that from my perspective is that there are costs behind a medical system that is supposed to be socialized,” he said.

As for drug users being referred to as “junkies,” Perks’ defence of sharing the post was that he has a close family member who is a drug addict. He said it is not prejudiced against drug users.

“Like I said, I didn’t know anybody else would see that. I probably have 2,000 friend requests waiting. I don’t add everybody to my personal Facebook page,” he said.

Perks said he made his Facebook page private on Friday morning because he has personal family photos on the page and wants to protect his family.

Kamloops Chamber of Commerce president Joshua Knaak said Perks went through a “rigorous” vetting process that included not only its board of directors, but also a third-party consultant.

“We saw enough of his social media. We saw enough of him so that we were confident in the person we got,” Knaak said.

“We met the candidate on two separate occasions to get the context that I think is missing. The only way others are going to be able to get that context is to meet John and see what he does.”

How can we believe anything he says?

First, we learned that the budget doesn’t balance itself. Trudeau ran on the plank of modest deficits in the first few years leading to a balanced budget in 2019. What we learned last week was that, in fact, we are looking at an eye-popping $19 billion this year with no plan to balance our budget at all.

Does Trudeau really still think that magically the budget will balance itself?

We should pray that we don’t hit a recession or interest rates continue to increase. Not only do we not have a cushion to land on, we have a giant pothole to fall into.

Second, remember the plan to change the election system from first past the post?

On June 17, 2015, Trudeau not only announced it as a pillar of his campaign but said he would introduce electoral reform within 18 months of taking over government.

It looked like an urgent thing to him. Why the haste?

“(Prime Minister Stephen) Harper has turned Ottawa into a partisan swamp promoting partisan interests at the expense of public trust” he said.

After two months of LavScam and the resignation of four of some of the most powerful people in government, that quote fits Trudeau as perfectly as one of his bespoke suits. The worst part of the saga was former top bureaucrat Michael Wernick, who quit last week. His disgraceful appearances at the justice committee made him a full-time member of the Liberal party swamp.

Turns out electoral reform was a Trudeau ruse to get rid of Harper. Less than one year into his new mandate, Trudeau pulled the plug on it. Why?

“Under Mr. Harper, there were so many people who were unhappy with the government and his approach that people said, ‘We need electoral reform in order to stop having governments we don’t like,’” Trudeau told Quebec’s Le Devoir.

“However, under the current system, they now have a government with which they are more satisfied and the thirst to change the electoral system is less striking.”

Trudeau was never serious about electoral reform. It was yet again a cynical vote-buying scheme. Now that he won under the traditional system, why risk toying with the current system?

Third, turns out our “sunny ways” feminist was a fake. Gender party is a good thing — that is, if you respect women and women’s voices in cabinet. We were treated to ElbowGate a year after the election: Trudeau, showing his true colours, rushed across the aisle of the House of Commons to manhandle the Conservative whip while accidentally elbowing NDP MP Ruth Ellen Brosseau.

It was a strange combination of lack of respect for women and an illustration that Trudeau may be in need of anger management.

Then the Kokanee Grope made headlines, an incident from 2000 in which Trudeau was accused by a journalist, then 18, of “groping” and “inappropriate handling” at the Kokanee Summit, a music festival.

More recent, two powerful ministers, then-attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould and then-Treasury Board minister Jane Philpott, quit cabinet, having lost confidence in Trudeau over his handling of LavScam.

But the most blistering defection was from the Liberal caucus. Whitby MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes announced she will sit as an Independent. Apparently, her crime was to tell Trudeau about her plan not to seek re-election and he went ballistic on her.

“He was yelling. He was yelling that I didn’t appreciate him, that he’d given me so much,” Caesar-Chavannes said. There were two similar interactions. More indication that our PM may needs a little anger management, perhaps?

But cheer up. Some strains of pot apparently have anti-depressant qualities.

Trudeau has at least provided us a way to be cheerful about the depressing state of his government.

Most pollsters agree that jobs and the economy are top issues for Albertans in the provincial election.

That extends to candidates in and around Medicine Hat, where local government has promoted a string of economic announcements as signals of investor confidence and an improving economy.

Local candidates were asked to localize their parties’ plans to boost the economy and ease employment concerns in the short and long term.

The two main parties’ positions are largely in opposition to each other.

The New Democrats, under leader Rachel Notley, says the province needs to continue her government’s diversification efforts to broaden the economy

United Conservative Leader Jason Kenney has said a one-third reduction to the corporate tax rate is required to boost investment, and a signal that the province is business friendly.

Drew Barnes, who is running for re-election in Cypress Medicine Hat under the UCP banner, echoed his leader’s call for and end to carbon pricing and reducing red tape for business.

“Reversing the NDP tax increases and layers of regulatory burden will make a huge economic difference,” he told the News on Friday.

“These measures will attract people to Alberta and our city … reducing the burden on Alberta families and business will enhance our local economy and opportunities.”

The NDP increased taxes for corporations and top income earners by two percentage points in 2015, while reducing small business rates to offset carbon levy costs.

However, after a marked improvement after an oil patch dip in 2017, some economists are contemplating whether the province is entering a second slow-down.

Cypress-Medicine Hat NDP candidate Peter Mueller said the NDP provides stability and a vision of a less volatile economy.

He told the News that cutting government services would have worsened the economic downturn. Diversification – especially in renewable energy sector – will boost the regional outlook, he says.

“The recession hit families hard, and families here in our province are often made up of energy and construction workers, whose partners are teachers and nurses,” he stated.

“I want to make sure this recovery reaches every family. Part of how we need to do that is by getting the pipeline built but also diversifying the economy to create new jobs – like in the renewable sector.”

Brooks-Medicine Hat’s independent candidate is squarely against the carbon pricing.

“Cutting the carbon tax is low hanging fruit,” said Todd Beasley, who also argued government influence on the deregulated market is driving up prices and hurting business.

“(Reducing regulations) has worked very well in the Untied States and we should adopt it as well.”

Colette Smithers, the Alberta Party candidate in Cypress-Medicine Hat, said public infrastructure and diversification, and her party’s “children first” policy would give support to working families by making childcare more affordable.

“I am personally thrilled with this initiative, especially for women,” said Smithers. “It gives them choices, not to be just a parent or just have a career, but it makes it so much more accessible to do both.”

Specific to public works, she would like to see greater consideration for renovating irrigation district facilities and scope to aid agriculture sector.

Lynn MacWilliam, the NDP candidate in Brooks-Medicine Hat, said her party’s platform would ensure the “recovery will be built to last.”

“Southern Alberta is one of the windiest and sunniest places in Canada, and we need to continue to utilize those resources and harness wind and solar power,” she said.

The key item in the NDP jobs platform is a program to entice private investment in petrochemical refining.

Alberta Party leader Stephen Mandel told the News this month that the program should be extended to 10 years.

Notley announced this week she’d double the amount of royalty credits in the program to $7 billion in hopes of attracting $75 billion in private investment to upgrade petroleum.

Brooks-Medicine Hat UCP candidate Michaela Glasgo said major projects and major pipeline are important, however, day-to-day operations in the oilpatch won’t fully recover until the business environment improves, along with prices that would be bolstered by greater export capacity.

“Part of the problem with price is a lack of market access,” she said of local oilfield outlook. “There are a really great group of UCP candidates in southern Alberta, and we would be a great group advertising the region.”

Jim Black, who represents the Alberta Party in the Brooks-Medicine Hat race, said energy sector, while key to the economy, shouldn’t overshadow needs of the farms and ranches in the region.

“I’d like to say (a major pipeline) is a year away, but really it’s more like two or longer,” he said, stating agriculture sector development can be a short-term win.

“A moratorium on the carbon levy – at least until they get the competitive edge back – is very important to the people I’m talking to,” he said. “They’re looking to maintain their competitive advantage over south of the border, but this is a worldwide issue.”

The carbon levy regulations exempts most of the cost for greenhouse growers and on farm fuel, but Black said general transportation costs cut into farm incomes.

In fact it occurred to me as I was preparing for the episode that the sign Beware of Cartoonist is funny and also has deeper meetings or layers to it, just as your work always does, because in fact you occupy a physical space in the newsroom off on your own — separate from the reporters. And you also play a singular role at The Spectator which is to offer an opinion, a point of view on everything from politics to Hamilton's quirks and the vast canvas of human nature and to do so editorial cartoons. That's me giving my spin how you might see your job. How do you see what you do?

MACKAY: Yeah, I occupy a very isolated corner of the newsroom way at the other end and by the exit door to the newsroom too so there's a symbolic thing there. I guess I'm lucky enough to have a position that I have because it's sort of like a visual columnist. But I guess my job is to poke the powers and do it in a depiction way in a drawing and it's a wonderful job that I have for sure.

WELLS: And you've been in The Spec 22 years this September is my guess. That means you're a young buck compared to me. You started at The Spec four months after I did?

MACKAY: Yes. But I bet you, they probably gave you a computer. Right?

WELLS: They did! You are right about that.

MACKAY: I didn't get a computer for like, three or four years after. And I think it took like half a year to get a phone. That was 1997.

WELLS: Those were the perks back then. So we'll talk a little bit about the road travelled for you and then how you do what you do in this age of Trump and Trudeau. I was thinking I feel the limitations of audio here where your work is so visual.

MACKAY: I'm very proud of my website.

WELLS: It's a great website. I wish I had something that showed some of my past work you know, so yeah, that's terrific. But to start, today's cartoon — by the way you create five editorial cartoons per week at The Spec, is that right?

MACKAY: Right.

WELLS: And your work is nationally syndicated so it appears online and in newspapers throughout Canada and sometimes in the US. The cartoon today, just to take a random one because it's in the paper today, it features Doug Ford.

Editorial cartoon for Wednesday, March 6, 2019. | Graeme MacKay, The Hamilton Spectator

We have Ford. In the background of the cartoon, there's a big carnival happening. Fireworks in the sky and a carnival tent is labelled SNC-LAV-SCAM. Big party happening in the background and in the foreground we have Doug Ford looking very much like a mob boss standing over someone bearing something in the dirt led by car headlights — which symbolize what?

MACKAY: Well there's, obviously, some interference happening on both the provincial and federal level. It's an edgy cartoon and I could have gotten into trouble with that. I had to like go to my editor Howard Elliot, just to make sure that we wouldn't get sued because it's —

WELLS: It's pretty suggestive.

MACKAY: Yeah, it's very suggestive. You're saying what, the premier is killing people off? I guess in a metaphorical way, he did. Or his deputy, one of his deputies, actually fired the deputy commissioner of the OPP.

WELLS: Just this week, right?

MACKAY: Yeah. But, you know, it's just interesting because we've been obsessed by the SNC-Lavalin story for weeks now. And there's other things that are happening. We as cartoonists just have to be careful not to get too obsessed with the media and keep our eye on other, you know, nasty things that might be happening and I think what's happening in Ontario right now is ... it's fodder for cartoons for sure.

WELLS: I've heard and seen some criticism of the coverage of LAV-SCAM, that the media is all in and everyone is now trying to outdo the other, that is, not to say it's not a huge story, which it is. But it's a good opportunity, for you to kind of shine the light somewhere else like you're doing here.

MACKAY: Well, you gotta wonder like, are people really focused in on the LAV-SCAM thing and are they more focused on what's happening with Ford? I mean, I don't know. Until polls come out, we don't know. Maybe for the vast majority of people outside the bubbles that really follow these political things nobody really cares. But I guess time will tell.

WELLS: Would you anticipate when you draw Doug Ford in this sort of manner, do you ever sort of expect to get a an email or call from someone who's a fan and not a fan of yours? Perhaps who is angry about the depiction.

MACKAY: I expect with my job that I'm not gonna have 100% happiness. I think with a good cartoon you're going to get as many people oppose as people who like it. So yeah, on various social media platforms, I get an earful from people who are totally upset with my cartoon. We get the odd letters to the Editor, a lot of them I don't even see. They just cross Howard's desk and he protects me from seeing some of these angry emails and letters and whatnot. But yeah, I think if you're not getting feedback, you're not doing your job properly as a cartoonist.

WELLS: Do you have thick skin as far as that goes? I mean, your job is to stir the pot. I think if I got a letter taking a shot at my story — I'm probably more thin skinned — I might feel defensive at first. I guess it depends on the nature of —

MACKAY: I think I get more defensive when people obviously don't understand and they show they don't understand satire. They're not seeing the bigger picture that sometimes you need to use Certain metaphors and situations that cast affliction on certain people in order to skewer the person who's the power. I think in some countries like in France and Britain, they get that. But here, it's almost like it's a continuous kind of thing where you got ""Well, no, this is how it works here."" And, ""This is what satire is all about."" But I can understand that even satire has to adapt to the changing norms and everything that happens with society.

WELLS: And satire is not polite.

MACKAY: It's not polite and it's not fair sometimes, either.

WELLS: That's right. One of your favourite cartoonists and friends in the fraternity of cartoonists, I suppose, is Michael deAdder. He apologized recently. He did one of the LAV-SCAM cartoons where he depicted Jody Wilson-Raybould tied up with her mouth taped, in a boxing ring, with Trudeau poised to take her on in the ring. So her hands are tied down her back, her mouth is covered up.

MACKAY: I did actually the almost exact same cartoon too.

WELLS: Did you?

MACKAY: Yeah and we were lumped into this whole sort of thing with hate and misogyny and that sort of thing. I posted my cartoon online and deAdder saw it and then he messaged me and said I'm in the middle of tweeting that same cartoon but just giving you the heads-up that this is going in my paper tomorrow. And he's on the Atlantic Coast so he didn't have much of a timeline.

WELLS: Right, he's in Halifax.

MACKAY: Seven o'clock in the evening. So we go ahead and then everything hits the fan the next day it was posted.

WELLS: I saw on Twitter, I mean I just saw a bit of it, but he apologized and then he sort of apologized for the apology. But people started giving a hard time for apologizing.

MACKAY: I think the big difference there is that he's a freelancer so he doesn't answer to an editor. My editor is Howard Elliot and he cleared it. He looked at it and he didn't raise any worry it about or anything. There's been subsequent apologies since then and they all come from freelancers who don't have those filters that thank goodness I have here at The Spectator because I've never apologized for a cartoon.

WELLS: You haven't? I was going to ask you about that.

MACKAY: Not here. I have come close but no I haven't.

Editorial Cartoon for Friday, February 15, 2019 | Graeme MacKay, The Hamilton Spectator -

WELLS: With that one, people are missing the whole boxing analogy. Trudeau was famous at least for people following his career for boxing publicly.

MACKAY: Well, the Liberal Party and his supporters have made a big deal. He punched out Patrick Brazeau and it was, you know, ""Look what he did here!"" and all of you can look at that like well yeah, he was an Indigenous guy too that he punched out. But, you know, it was taken as a positive thing and it was an important thing because it was before he became prime minister. And a lot of people will say hell, he's just a weakling who only cares about his hair and his looks and selfies and that sort of thing. So let's go and prove that he's a capable guy. And I've used that in other cartoons. His punching acumen when dealing with Donald Trump and that sort of thing.

WELLS: Right, right. The first time I covered him ever in Hamilton was when he came here. And he did a big thing at the gym downtown where he put on a big workout. He was quite happy to to sweat for the cameras.

MACKAY: I'm kind of amazed that we as cartoonists haven't really capitalized on this whole thing because you could you can see the good in that. But you can also see the ugly side of being a boxer as well, and I think both Mike and I did that job as was expected in a satirist.

WELLS: How often would you say an editor like Howard or Paul Berton editor in chief comes to you with an idea that they would like to see done, or an issue say that they like to see done by you in the paper? And how often is it just you percentagewise?

MACKAY: They never come to me. I can tell you they never instruct me or say ""Oh, you gotta like lay off."" Although in the early days they would tell me to lay off way back when I started out. I came on and it was a different approach that I had towards my job. I was scathing towards the mayor who was Bob Morrow and I did some nasty cartoons about him and my boss who actually happened to be Howard. Howard has been my boss for a long time and I remember he told me so you gotta back off on the mayor because he's starting to like badger us. I think that says something. There's something about ... it's easier to go after a politician who's in Ottawa or London or Washington but when it comes to City Hall here these are people that you got to deal with.

WELLS: We have reporters.

MACKAY: And reporters have to deal with them as well. If you keep it up they're going to stop answering the phones when a reporter calls.

WELLS: Right. So then each day, the cartoon ... that is you picking the topic and give your spin on it.

MACKAY: Yeah as I say it's like you or Andrew or Jeff Mahoney. I'm given the liberty of a columnist. However it hasn't always been that way. I mean we've had different editors as you know and they have different definitions on what my role is. I can fight against it but they're the ones paying me.

WELLS: Let's roll back a little bit to your road here. So you grew up in Dundas and attended junior art classes at the Dundas Valley School of Art. I was reading from a piece that the spec ran when you were first hired that's on your website. You were a news geek as a kid and used to doodle in class and draw your teachers and classmates and in grade four through the whole class and ran off photocopies for all of them on demand.

MACKAY: Yeah!

WELLS: Does it make you popular or not popular?

MACKAY: Oh sure, sure. I still had bullies going after me and stuff like that. But if you're a pretty good cartoonist or an artist, you often are like a hit, if you can use that art against the authority of a teacher.

WELLS: What cartoons or comics did you enjoy reading most when you were growing up?

MACKAY: You know, I didn't read a heck of a lot of comic books. I was definitely into MAD Magazine and Cracked. I loved MAD Magazine. And I think that's probably because it was parody. It was like an early form. I didn't know who the president United States was when I'm nine or 10 years old but I knew about being bombarded by all these products on TV. Actually I was thinking also of Wacky Packs. Remember Wacky Packs? They're these candy things and you get gum and then inside would be all these stickers that were parodies of products. Instead of Captain Crunch it was a sticker showing a box with Captain Crud. I think that was the germ of my fascination with just making fun of, you know, on a pop culture thing that extended to politics which came very soon after that I guess.

WELLS: In MAD magazine, as a kid, I would enjoy the parodies of movies. In very highly detail, they would go through the plot of the movie and just ridicule notions of it.

MACKAY: Don Martin and Al Jaffee and Sergio ... wonderful, wonderful cartoonists.

WELLS: In the introduction to your book, which was published in 2017, which is titled ""You might be from Hamilton if ..."", The Spectator's Scott Radley wrote the introduction to the book. He mentioned MAD Magazine and he also said that a lot of kids growing up probably wanted to be a cartoonist and I was going to tell you that I can attest to that. Back in grade five or six I gave my speech, when we all had to give speeches back in the day, you to stand in front of class give a speech. I gave mine on how my career aspiration was to be a cartoonist and I was a huge Peanuts fan. Charles M. Shulz, the whole thing. I had sketch books but I couldn't draw and so set me back a little bit. When did you know that you wanted to draw, and for a living, and be a newspaper editorial cartoonist specifically?

MACKAY: Well I've always drawn. I guess I'm the nerd who instead of going out and playing football or hockey or whatever I stayed in and drew. But I guess, like I said, it was parody I was fascinated with. I was a television junkie too let's be honest. With MAD Magazine, I was also into SCTV and Saturday Night Live — a lot of these great comedy shows that would make fun of the politics of the day. So you know you had Saturday Night Live making fun of the president of the day, which they do so fine even to this day. And so, you know, that made me wonder: what are they talking about here? So, I guess I came of age to find the fascination of politics when Ronald Reagan was president. That was the time when Pierre Trudeau was the prime minister and I know I would always hear the family discussions at the dinner table. On Sunday night, my grandparents would come over and they would freak out over the latest thing that Pierre Trudeau was doing to the country. And so that started an interest in reading the newspapers and by that time I was delivering the Hamilton Spectator and I could open the paper and I'd see the wonderful works of Blaine, the cartoonist here for so long. And so that naturally went to well, what are they drawing in the Toronto Star? What are they drawing in the Globe? And so I just became aware of a lot of the cartoonists at that time period in the early 80s and it's a lifetime fascination starting from there.

WELLS: It's interesting. SCTV was, I loved that it was just so clever energy in not just politics with shows like that on SCTV but the powerful, the famous to be skewered and made fun of whether it was Bob Hope or whoever. I'd love to see that on Netflix. They got to bring SCTV on Netflix.

MACKAY: That would be wonderful, wouldn't it?

WELLS: Political cartoons have been around a long time, if you're Googling anyways. It suggests that the first one ever might have been in 1754 by Ben Franklin. And just to give the audience the visual: it's a snake that's been cut into several sections to show disunity among the new colonies that were not yet the United States. And the caption is, join or die. And we were just talking before the show briefly, but how you actually did a cartoon years ago, that was a take on Franklin's cartoon.

MACKAY: Yeah, it was to apply to the amalgamation of Hamilton. So you know, they were amalgamating all the colonies back at that time, and the threats were out there. Well, that was sort of the same thing that was happening back in around 1999 and 2000, when the province, was compelling us to amalgamate. I did that cartoon and I showed it to the editor and he didn't know what I was talking about so much I guess. Typical journalist doesn't know the history of satire.

WELLS: Back to the drawing board.

MACKAY: Exactly.

WELLS: I think that one and your work and the best editorial cartoons show how carefully chosen words of a little bit of information convey so much. Just randomly going through your website ... maybe because this one appeared on my birthday ... but the one that is lamenting the end of summer. It says ""RIP summer"" and it has you know these ...

MACKAY: They're Grim Reapers.

WELLS: Grim Reapers carrying this pumpkin man who's heralding the pumpkin spice is back. I just think it's awesome. Pumpkin spice of course is a great flair but it does signal that something is coming to an end.

MACKAY: I'm just around so many people that say Oh, have you had this beer? It's pumpkin spice. It's like no I don't want pumpkin spice. All the coffee shops were bringing their coffee so that's a perfect cultural thing that gets away from the politics. Like I said, I know that there are people who are who are shutting out the politics and they're sick of it and everything and so it's important for us to do some of the cultural references and sort of jab at it, which means we have to put up with every year like pumpkin spice and whatever.

WELLS: I love that stuff. Of course at Christmas time all the different flavours. I'm just like what is that? You know all the different flavours. I don't even know what they are.

MACKAY: The other thing on coffee that drives me crazy is the Roll Up The Rim thing. It's like a sport for me every year to come up with another, you know, let's mock the Roll Up The Rim campaign because it's just ... I walk to work and I see the results of Roll Up The Rim. All these dirty cups all over the place.

WELLS: I've never done it.

MACKAY: Have you not?

WELLS: I prefer my lattes and stuff from elsewhere. Whatever that makes me I don't know. But you know, you gotta hand it to them. They certainly tapped into something.

MACKAY: I do. But it's, you know, take some responsibility because these cups are all over the place. And I know there's been an outcry and it's been getting louder every year. You know, this is the disposable ... like this is the crap that you're adding to the landscape through this. It's just horrible.

WELLS: Is one of your challenges determining how much information to provide in a cartoon? Some of your work, some of your cartoons, have layers and layers of background information, little bits and minutiae within the cartoon. And others have a very simple — what appears to be simple — message although, as I say, with the one about pumpkin spice, simple yet there's a lot to it. That's kind of under the surface. Is that something you think about consciously, or you just kind of go with it?

MACKAY: It depends on how I feel. I guess it's kind of nice to be able to put those little Easter eggs in and just give a little extra fun for the viewer. I mean, I'm a big fan of the intricate cartoons. I know there's a wonderful thing about simplicity of cartoons, but I think from time to time was nice to do these elaborate things.

WELLS: Where people can kind of dig into it and get what they can out of it. Of course, then some people aren't getting half of what you're trying to convey sometimes.

MACKAY: Also if the gag is kind of weak then it's you know, I spice it up. I pumpkin spice it up with more details.

WELLS: I said you were an award-winning cartoonist and you're a two-time recipient of a United Nation citation. The Ranan Lurie Political Cartoon.

MACKAY: Ranan Lurie. He's a famous cartoonist from — I don't know where he's from — Egypt, I think. And he's obviously very rich. He throws his money around and rewards people.

WELLS: Which is fabulous. And then last year you were nominated for a City of Hamilton Arts Award.

MACKAY: Yeah, I was nominated. I didn't win.

WELLS: So what you do is absolutely art. And it's punditry and commentary. Do you see yourself more as an artist or commentator?

MACKAY: I would love to do more art. And a lot of us cartoonists do. I would like to do more art, I'd like to do oil paintings. I look at our colleague here, Lee Munn who does some outstanding artwork. Landscapes and things like that. Boy, that would be a dream of mine to go back to the basics of what I learned at the DVSA and take a sketch book out there and draw stuff. Because that's what I did. I used to do that. I used to go out to museums and draw vases and statue heads and things like that. It's a wonderful, therapeutic thing to do.

WELLS: Just to quickly go back to the politics. I meant to ask you earlier: I'm sure there are followers of your work, or people who dip in on your work on occasion, who think they can pinpoint ... There are people who think they can pinpoint The Spectator's political leanings. Even if we had one, which I don't think that the paper does. I don't think it has a particular leaning but I'm sure there's some who think they can label you along the spectrum. And they'd probably be wrong no matter what they say.

MACKAY: Yeah. Good luck. Cause I don't even know where I am. That's right. One thing that drives me crazy is partisanship. It drives me nuts because I will put something on Twitter and I can easily predict who's going to be weighing and then saying such and such. But you know, there's your example right there. You've got a Doug Ford cartoon there and I'm making fun of a guy. He happens to be a Progressive Conservative. But the day before, I'm making fun of Justin Trudeau, he happens to be a federal Liberal. And then I'm making fun of Trump and I'm making fun of all kinds of political parties. Again, it isn't about partisanship to be a cartoonist. Put that all away. It's all about jabbing the powers. It just so happens, we are in a really good situation now. We had a Conservative in Queen's Park in a Liberal in Ottawa.

WELLS: It's kind of an ideal situation for you.

MACKAY: Yeah, it is. But I think in the past, I might have come here with a bit of a partisan leaning towards the centre right. But I can't ... I'm not there at all. I think over time and being around smart people like we have The Spectator, you know, you've learned something. And I certainly have being here.

WELLS: I've talked about how this is such a rich time for cartoonists, in Canada with Justin Trudeau's reign and the dawn of the age of Trump. Looking back to other periods in your career to this point, is this the most interesting time or have they all been interesting?

MACKAY: We were having some great scandal times right now. But in 22 years you can think back, I mean, there's the gas plant scandal, the Gomery scandal, money in bags that Mulroney was passing to Karlheinz Schreiber. Look at the scandal happening in Washington right now. So I think what happens is you get a series of scandals adding up and that's what lends itself to the eventual defeat of a government. I don't know if this SNC-Lavalin thing is going to topple the government. I doubt it will. I think in a life of government there's a series. I mean we had a Liberal government in Ontario that was very plagued with scandals and it lasted for how many terms. And now we got a new government that's starting up its own scandals so scandals are just part of life, right?

WELLS: It's the fuel for the fire for a cartoonist. Graeme, I'm fascinated by the work you do. As I've already pointed out I envious because you're doing what I wanted to do when I was a kid. It's great what you bring to the Spectator adding colour and perspective and wit to our pages and you're one of the best in the business. And that's in Canada and the US. So I want to say thanks for coming on the show.

MACKAY: Well, thanks. It's a pleasure. Thanks, Jon and Ayesha.

WELLS: Thanks to the audience. And again, you can see Graeme MacKay's archives and other information on the link that we'll put on our podcast webpage. And my thanks to Ayesha Nasir, as always, and we'll talk to you later on The Message.

Republicans have mocked the Green New Deal as a progressive ...","To Democratic supporters, the Green New Deal is a touchstone, a call to arms to combat climate change with the full measure of the nation’s resources and technological might. “A mission to save all of creation,” in the words of Massachusetts Sen. Edward Markey, one the plan’s lead authors.

READ MORE: ‘Green New Deal’ aims to transform the U.S. economy — here’s what exactly it means

To Republican opponents, the much-hyped plan is a dystopian nightmare, a roadmap to national bankruptcy in pursuit of zealous environmentalism. “A big green bomb” for the economy, says Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming.

Lost in the clamor is the reality that, if passed, the Green New Deal would require the government to do absolutely nothing. It exists only as a nonbinding resolution because Democrats have yet to fill in the potentially treacherous details of how to pay for the Green New Deal, how to carry it out and what, exactly, it will do.

Announced to great fanfare in February, the Green New Deal calls for a “10-year national mobilization” on the scale of the original New Deal to shift the U.S. economy away from fossil fuels such as oil and coal and replace them with renewable sources such as wind and solar power. It calls for meeting “100 per cent of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable and zero-emission energy sources,” including nuclear power.

WATCH: Trump jokingly says he ‘encourages’ Green New Deal

The plan has broad support among Democratic activists, and all six of the 2020 presidential contenders serving in the Senate have signed on as co-sponsors, putting it at the forefront of the party’s sprawling primary race.

Republicans have mocked the Green New Deal as a progressive pipedream that would drive the economy off a cliff and lead to a huge tax increase. They call it more evidence of the creep of “socialism” in the Democratic Party, along with “Medicare for All” and a sweeping elections reform package that would allow public financing of congressional campaigns.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who has scheduled a vote on the resolution next week, has led the GOP’s assault on the Green New Deal, jabbing at it repeatedly at news conferences and in floor speeches.

READ MORE: Some Democrats worry about 2020 prospects as candidates rush to embrace the left

“Just a good old-fashioned, state-planned economy. Garden-variety 20th-century socialism,” McConnell said in a recent speech. “Our Democratic colleagues have taken all the debunked philosophies of the last hundred years, rolled them into one giant package, and thrown a little ‘green’ paint on them to make them look new.”

Utah Rep. Rob Bishop went further, calling the proposal “tantamount to genocide” for rural America and warning it could outlaw hamburgers, among other things.

In truth, the text of the resolution makes no reference to banning cows, but Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York — the main Democratic co-sponsor with Markey — has said in interviews that the U.S. has “got to address factory farming” to combat climate change.

McConnell and other Republicans frequently cite a whopping $93 trillion price tag for the resolution, a figure derived from a right-leaning think tank that even its author says is overly precise. President Donald Trump has rounded that up to $100 trillion and warns it would “shut down American energy.”

WATCH: Democrats outline ‘Green New Deal’ to tackle climate change, create renewable energy jobs

The attacks have succeeded in putting Democrats on the spot, with some backing the resolution, others downplaying it as aspirational and those in positions of power — such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi — calling it one proposal among many to address climate change.

Ocasio-Cortez and the other backers are undeterred. They insist the nation can eliminate carbon emissions by 2030 — a target most experts call unrealistic — and say a transformation of the nation’s energy use is simply a matter of political will.

“Leader McConnell thinks the Green New Deal is just a resolution, but the Green New Deal is a revolution,” said Markey. “The Green New Deal has struck a powerful chord in this country, and it is igniting the movement of young people who are ready to make this the organizing issue for their generation.”

The plan goes far beyond energy to urge national health care coverage and job guarantees, high-quality education and affordable housing, as well as “upgrading all existing buildings in the United States” to be energy-efficient.

In calling for a vote, McConnell hopes to test how far Senate Democrats — including the presidential candidates — are willing to go to accede to the party’s newly empowered liberal wing, at the risk of leaving moderate voters behind.

Major labour unions, traditionally aligned with Democrats, oppose the plan. The AFL-CIO says it makes promises “that are not achievable or realistic,” adding that the union “will not stand by and allow threats to our members’ jobs and their families’ standard of living go unanswered.”

READ MORE: Fact check: Trump says Dems threaten cow ownership, air travel and border security

Democrats hope to thwart McConnell by voting “present” on the resolution. The idea is to signal their disgust at what they call a “sham” vote that seeks to quash public debate by blocking public hearings or expert testimony about the consequences of inaction on climate change.

“We know they don’t like the Green New Deal,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said of Republicans. “But what is their plan then?”

Jason Grumet, president of the independent Bipartisan Policy Center, said climate change has inspired “magical thinking” on both sides of the political divide.

“Most members of the Republican Party believe that climate change is real but tend to avert their eyes when people say it’s not, because why pick up the fight?” Grumet said at a Senate hearing this month.

And most Democrats “know we’re not going to eliminate fossil fuels in 10 years or go to 100 per cent renewables” as power sources, he said. “But they kind of avert their eyes because that’s where the energy of the party is and nobody wants to be on the wrong end. And we just end up ceding to the edges” of both parties.",Green New Deal sparks ongoing debate as Republicans label it economy killer,Global News,https://globalnews.ca/news/5090002/green-new-deal-debate-republicans/

Yes, the United Conservative Party will appear on ballots for the first time, since it didn't exist the last time Albertans went to the polls in a general election.

But most Albertans are well aware of the UCP — especially after the first week of the campaign, which was dominated by Jason Kenney's party and its main rival, Rachel Notley's New Democratic Party.

In total, there are now 13 political parties registered with Elections Alberta.

The dormant Progressive Conservative and Wildrose parties are still on the list, but won't field any candidates. That's due to the merger of the two parties under the UCP banner in 2017.

New choices include the Alberta Independence Party, added to the list of registered political parties just this week, and the Alberta Advantage Party.

3 ways to get on the list

Drew Westwater, deputy returning officer with Elections Alberta, said after the election was called on Tuesday, the Alberta Independence Party was able to endorse candidates in at least half of the 87 electoral divisions.

According to the Election Finances and Contributions Disclosures Act, there are three ways to qualify a party for registration:

hold at least three seats in the legislative assembly;

endorse candidates in at least half of the electoral divisions in Alberta;

collect 7,868 signatures on a petition to illustrate support. (The number represents 0.3 per cent of electors eligible to vote in the last general election.)

""I know this is a new one for Alberta,"" Westwater said of the Alberta Independence Party.

""It's the first time someone has done that and qualified under this provision of the act.

""Now we have a new party for electors to choose from in the upcoming election.""

Westwater said that by qualifying as a registered political party, the party's candidates can officially appear on the ballot under their party name. Without the party being registered, those candidates would have to list as ""independent.""

New parties try to get attention

Another new party appearing for the first time this election is the four-month-old Alberta Advantage Party.

Leader Marilyn Burns knows she faces a big challenge in getting noticed, but said the consequences of not being on the ballot are bigger.

The leader of the new Alberta Advantage Party, Marilyn Burns, says it's a challenge to get noticed, but important that Albertans have a choice in the election. (Alberta Advantage Party)

Supporters combed Alberta to gather 8,600 signatures on a petition to form the Alberta Advantage Party, said Burns.

The process of canvassing voters directly, said Burns, has given her a good indication of how people are feeling going into the election.

""What we've heard loud and clear, and continue to hear, is a visceral hatred for the NDP that is not going to change no matter what Jason Kenney does,"" she said.

That sentiment is balanced by ""the strong dislike and distrust of Jason Kenney,"" Burns added.

Choice and consequences

The upstart Freedom Conservative Party was created in 2018 by former UCP MLA Derek Fildebrandt.

Fildebrandt anticipates more about 30 FCP candidates will run in the election. He said his biggest challenge is to get people to think of options when they go to the polls.

""The media tend to give the impression you've only got two choices in politics.You've got the red team and you've got the blue team,"" Fildebrandt said in an interview with Radio-Canada.

""You've got Diet Coke and you've got Coke Zero, and there's a lot more to it than that.""

Little room for small parties

Mount Royal University political scientist Duane Bratt said this election is significant because it has put Alberta into the position of a two-party race for perhaps the first time in recent history.

""We've gone into new terrain here,"" Bratt said.

The bill vetoed by Kelly would have provided ...","TOPEKA, Kan. — Kansas' new Democratic governor on Monday vetoed a tax relief bill approved by the Republican-controlled Legislature, arguing it would repeat an infamous fiscal experiment that failed under a GOP predecessor.

Gov. Laura Kelly signalled for weeks that she would reject Republican leaders' top priority this year, a measure aimed at preventing individuals and businesses from paying more in state income taxes because of changes in federal tax laws at the end of 2017. Kelly's top priorities are boosting funding for public schools and expanding the state's Medicaid health coverage for the needy.

""We cannot fix our state if we repeat the mistakes of the past,"" Kelly said Monday.

A clash was inevitable. Allowing the tax relief to become law would have undermined the state's ability to sustain Kelly's proposals for education funding and Medicaid expansion. Republican leaders have yet to muster the two-thirds majorities necessary to override a veto and enact the tax bill, so Kelly is likely to prevail.

Republicans argued that failing to enact tax relief would allow an unlegislated tax increase. They said the issue was akin to deciding whether to return a lost wallet full of cash after finding it on the sidewalk with the owner's ID inside.

The governor and fellow Democrats noted the persistent budget woes that Kansas experienced after Republican legislators jumped into cutting income taxes in 2012 and 2013 at the urging of then-GOP Gov. Sam Brownback. Voters came to view the experiment as a failure, and bipartisan majorities reversed most of the tax cuts in 2017.

Kelly's administration projected that under the bill, taxpayers would save $209 million during the state budget year beginning in July.

Like other states, Kansas faced the issue of revising its income tax code because it is tied to the federal tax code. While changes in federal tax laws championed by President Donald Trump lowered rates, they also included provisions that raised money for Kansas, in party by discouraging individual filers from claiming itemized deductions.

The bill vetoed by Kelly would have provided relief to taxpayers who have itemized on their state returns. It would have allowed them to keep itemizing even if they don't on their federal returns, something previously prohibited.

Republican legislators also attached a provision to lower the state's sales tax on groceries to 5.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent to make the bill harder for Kelly to veto. Kelly herself promised during her campaign last year to work to lower the tax.

But much of the relief in the bill would have gone to large businesses that faced paying state income taxes on income generated by operations outside the U.S. because of the federal changes.

Preliminary election results show the party of junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha leading with 7.5 million votes, as former prime minister turned Democrat Party leader Abhisit Vejjajiva stepped down.

Close behind Prayuth’s Palang Pracharat party with 7 million votes is the main opposition Pheu Thai Party, which has won every election since 2001.

A new party, Future Forward, which was anti-junta and became popular with young voters, claimed nearly 5.2 million votes. But voters deserted the Democrat Party, the country’s oldest political party, according to partial results released by the Election Commission.

Democratic Party leader Abhisit stepped down due to the poor showing.

“I must take responsibility for this. I resign from my leadership of the Democrat Party,” said the former prime minister, who held that position from 2008 to 2011.

Election Commission chairman Ittiporn Boonprakong said the unofficial results of Sunday’s poll would be announced 10am local time on Monday rather than 8.30pm on Sunday, as had been expected.

Ittiporn did not give a reason for the delay, but the Election Commission said nearly six per cent of votes were disqualified

Pheu Thai’s secretary general, Phumtham Wechayachai, said the party was waiting for official results but believed there were irregularities. The party wants to inspect disqualified and spoiled ballots, he said.

“Even the reported numbers from the Election Commission and each media outlet are different. We have our own number too. The Election Commission report even paused for a while. It will be clearer once the official result is announced,” Mr Phumtham said.

It was the country’s first general election since 2011, and comes after a 2014 military coup.

Thailand has been under direct military rule since then-army chief Prayuth overthrew an elected government linked to exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who himself was thrown out by the army in 2006.

The non-aligned Democrat Party, which many had thought could hold the balance of power between pro-military ...","Partial results from Sunday's election in Thailand showed a pro-military party slightly ahead of the populist party leading a ""democratic front,"" an unexpected and, for many, stunning outcome from the country's first poll since a 2014 army coup.

With 93 per cent of overall votes counted, the Election Commission reported the pro-military party Palang Pracharat, which is seeking to keep junta chief Prayuth Chan-ocha in power, was leading with 7.59 million votes.

Trailing with 7.12 million votes was Pheu Thai, a party linked to exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, whose loyalists have won every election since 2001.

The numbers were for the popular vote, but these did not reflect parliamentary constituency seats that would ultimately be won. Pheu Thai could still win the lion's share of these because of its concentrated popularity in the north and northeast of the country.

Nevertheless, there was dismay among many voters who had hoped that the poll would loosen the grip on power that traditional elites and the military have held in a country that has one of the highest measures of inequality in the world.

At Pheu Thai's headquarters in Bangkok, the mood fluctuated from cheerful to quiet disbelief.

""I didn't think this is likely. I don't think this is what the people wanted,"" said Pheu Thai supporter Polnotcha Chakphet.

A #PrayforThailand hashtag started trending on Twitter as the results trickled out, and some people tweeted that they would leave the country if Prayuth was returned to power to remain prime minister.

The Election Commission chairman said unofficial results would be announced on Monday afternoon. The commission said turnout was 66 per cent, based on 90 per cent of the vote counted.

Royal role

The royal family, which wields great influence and commands the devotion of millions of Thais, played a part in the election though how far it influenced the outcome was unclear.

On the eve of the vote, King Maha Vajiralongkorn made an unexpected and cryptic statement, recalling a comment made by his father in 1969 on the need to put ""good people"" in power and to prevent ""bad people from … creating chaos.""

His message was a departure from the approach of his late father, who died in 2016. In his latter years, the former king usually kept a distance between the monarchy and politics.

Although the king did not refer to any of the sides in the election race, there was speculation on social media that it was a coded reference to main political factions — broadly the middle class and urban establishment, who identify with the monarchy and the military, and their pro-Thaksin opponents.

King Vajiralongkorn also weighed in on electoral affairs last month after a startling turn of events when a pro-Thaksin party nominated Princess Ubolratana, the king's sister, as its prime ministerial candidate.

Within hours, the king issued a statement saying her candidacy was ""inappropriate"" and she was disqualified.

Still, the connection between the princess and Thaksin persisted in voters' minds, particularly after they were seen hugging on Friday at the wedding of his daughter in Hong Kong.

""We had a lot of drama in the last hours before the election,"" said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political analyst at Chulalongkorn University. ""Thaksin overplayed with a royal involvement and that was countered by his opponent.""

Deck stacked for military

Thailand has been racked for the past 15 years by crippling street protests both by Thaksin's opponents and supporters that destabilized governments and hamstrung business.

The country has been under direct military rule for nearly five years since then-army chief Prayuth overthrew an elected government linked to populist Thaksin, who himself was thrown out by the army in 2006.

The election will determine the makeup of parliament's 500-seat House of Representatives. The lower house and the upper house, the Senate — which is appointed entirely by the ruling junta — will together select the next prime minister.

Critics have said a new, junta-devised electoral system gives a built-in advantage to pro-military parties and appears designed to prevent Pheu Thai from returning to power.

The provision means Prayuth's Palang Pracharat Party and allies have to win only 126 seats in the House, while Pheu Thai and its potential ""democratic front"" partners would need 376.

The non-aligned Democrat Party, which many had thought could hold the balance of power between pro-military and ""democratic front"" factions, appeared to have been deserted by many voters.

The purpose behind the “repressive measures being taken in Jammu and Kashmir by the BJP-led government is to show the electorate how tough the saffron party is against Kashmiris,” Mufti claimed.

“Choking democratic space and punishing people collectively is unfortunately a new policy adopted by the government of India to deal with Kashmir,” the former chief minister said at a PDP youth convention here.

Referring to a ban imposed on the JKLF and the Jamaat-e-Islami Jammu and Kashmir, she said it was ironical that while on one hand, the central government claims to have launched a rehabilitation scheme for militants who lay down arms, on the other, organisations like Jammat and JKLF, which have rejected violence as a method of achieving any goal, are slapped with bans.

“The JKLF is committed to resolution through political means, while the Jamaat-e-Islami is a religious and social organisation running schools and orphanages across the state. Such repressive measures will shrink the already limited space and will only increase the level of alienation and frustration among the people,” Mufti said.

The PDP chief termed the upcoming elections crucial for determining the future of the state.","Govt’s new policy is to choke democratic space in Kashmir, says Mehbooba Mufti",The Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com/elections/govts-new-policy-is-to-choke-democratic-space-in-kashmir-says-mehbooba-mufti-5640646/

The effort begins with a midweek vote on the Green New Deal, a loosely defined effort to combat climate change by dramatically reducing greenhouse-gas emissions coupled with job creation. Democrats have spent years proposing different versions of legislation to rein in the effects of climate change, but Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., has taken the Green New Deal and raised it to a new level with her political star power.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., believes the proposal, written by Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., embraced by several top Democratic presidential contenders but criticized by the AFL-CIO as unrealistic, would be politically divisive for a party that has made winning back Midwest battleground states a top priority for 2020.

""The prevailing fashions in New York and San Francisco, that's what is defining today's Democrats,"" McConnell said during a floor speech two weeks ago.

By citing those two cities, McConnell made clear that Republicans want to turn the 29-year-old from the Bronx into a political weapon akin to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).

He has taken the original Green New Deal proposal, put it in his own resolution and scheduled what amounts to a show vote as the bill lacks the votes in the Republican-led Senate. But it's doubtful the strategy will produce any immediate signs of division, as Democrats have largely rallied around the strategy from Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) to vote present.

The liberal activists who have helped Ocasio-Cortez elevate the Green New Deal are on board with the plan, dismissing McConnell as someone who sides with industry over the environment.

""The only reason he is calling for this vote is to score some points for the oil and gas executives who bankroll his campaigns. This vote is a sham,"" Stephen O'Hanlon, spokesman of the Sunrise Movement, told The Washington Post's Energy 202 newsletter.

A week after Democrats won the House majority in the 2018 midterms, Ocasio-Cortez joined members of the Sunrise Movement protesting in Pelosi's congressional office demanding she restart a special committee to study climate change.

Markey called the McConnell effort ""a sham"" and plans to vote present even though he unveiled the proposal with Ocasio-Cortez.

But the Republicans seem intent, for now at least, to keep banking on the political newcomer's image as one that will drive voters away from Democrats.

A week ago, as word spread that Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Tex.) was considering a run against Sen. John Cornyn (R), the National Republican Senatorial Committee released what has become a staple of GOP research, showing Castro's votes aligned with Pelosi 97 percent of the time.

Then, the NRSC added a new wrinkle, touting that he ""votes with AOC 94% of the time,"" referring to Ocasio-Cortez, and that he co-sponsored the Green New Deal.

The committee's Twitter page has pinned a Feb. 11 tweet at the top of the feed, showing Ocasio-Cortez's image from the news conference when she and Markey unveiled the plan.

Initial polling on the first-term Democrat indicates that her image has taken a hit, as 31 percent of Americans have a favorable image of Ocasio-Cortez while 41 percent have a negative view, according to a Gallup poll released March 15.

But those numbers skew in that direction almost entirely because Republicans have become so fixated on her.

Following such a heavy focus on her from conservative media outlets and Fox News, 73 percent of Republicans have an unfavorable opinion of her — more than the 56 percent of Democrats who have a favorable opinion.

""Fox News has turned into 'AOC TMZ',"" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted after the poll's release.

Republicans have a way to go to transform Ocasio-Cortez and her proposals into something resembling what they did a decade ago with anti-Pelosi ads that became the fulcrum of the 2010 midterm campaign that swung sharply against Democrats.

Democrats are pushing back by focusing on the danger of climate change and not making it about any individual politician, and they believe that several Senate Republicans could face political peril on the issue.

A Gallup poll last year found that 62 percent of adults thought that the government was doing ""too little"" to protect the environment, while an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that 66 percent believe climate change is a ""serious problem.""

Last fall, 13 federal agencies said climate change posed an environmental and economic threat that would worsen if the nation failed to combat global warming.

Schumer has offered a brief, simple resolution that begins with the most basic statement possible — ""climate change is real"" — and requests Congress to take ""immediate action"" on the issue.

View photos From demonetisation to GST, from foreign affairs to new schemes, it is Modi who takes all the decisions and also announces them with fanfare.","In his first election rally in West Bengal last week, Congress president Rahul Gandhi attacked Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, accusing her doing things her way without consulting others.

Without taking Mamata’s name, Rahul said “She neither talks to anyone nor takes anybody’s suggestion. She does whatever she feels like. Does Bengal not have any voice? Bengal is being run by just one person. Should one person be allowed to run an entire state?” he said at a rally in Chanchole.

Well, Mamata is not alone in this. There are two other leaders constituting a trilogy of 3 ‘M’s – Mayawati and Modi – who neither listen nor talk to fellow partymen for suggestions.

The three have a mind of their own making them totally unpredictable. Fear is often the key.

Mamata runs the state and her party with an iron fist. She sets the rules even if they are chaotic, changes them at her whim and fancy, and brooks no opposition.

The other lady in the group, Mayawati, the Behenji of Uttar Pradesh, is no ‘behen’ (sister) to anyone except, probably, to her ego. She takes all the decisions, partymen dread her and, like Mamata, she is a one-woman army. She too is unpredictable and can change decisions and alliances in a jiffy.

But unlike Mamata, Maya has an eye on Delhi; specifically, the PM chair. Mamata is reluctant to leave Bengal and move to Delhi knowing well that the moment she does that, an aggressive BJP and hungry-for-revenge Communist Party (Marxist) would make life miserable for the Trinamool.

Maya has no chair to protect in her state. Her voter base is solid and she could easily move over to Delhi and further shore up her party in Uttar Pradesh and elsewhere. Unlike Mamata, Maya has started spreading her wings to other states including the south. However small, her Bahujan Samaj Party has set up outposts in Karnataka, Kerala and Maharashtra, apart from the Hindi belt, trying to rally the splintered Dalit votes together.

That brings us to the third ‘M’ – Modi, who runs the party and the government his way. What Rahul Gandhi said of Mamata is applicable to Modi too – he neither talks to anyone nor takes anybody’s suggestion. He does whatever he feels like. And, as Rahul wondered, should one person be allowed to run an entire state, in this case the entire nation.

From demonetisation to GST, from foreign affairs to new schemes, it is Modi who takes all the decisions and also announces them with fanfare. Ministers are just either implementers of Modi’s decisions or, like Sushma Swaraj whose role is to rescue or help people in distress through posts on Twitter.

The rather infamous saying ‘India is Indira and Indira is India’ that eulogised Indira Gandhi to a larger than life status is also applicable to Modi. He is the party, the government, the decision-maker and does not entertain any opposition.

Mr Chan-ocha's party campaigned on maintaining order and upholding traditional values of loyalty and devotion to the monarch.

""I am happy to see citizens come out and exercise their voting rights,"" Mr Chan-ocha told reporters on Sunday after casting his vote. ""I want to see love and unity. Everybody has one vote, one voice. Everybody wants democracy.""

The anti-Thaksin Yellow Shirts, mostly middle class and urban royalists who accuse his parties of corruption, have repeatedly taken to the streets, prompting the military to launch two coups in a decade.

Thaksin's supporters, known as the Red Shirts, also occupied much of Bangkok's main business and shopping districts for months in 2010 after a court dissolved a pro-Thaksin government, again paralysing commerce until a crackdown that left at least 90 people dead and saw landmark buildings burned.

While the election results are due to be announced within a few hours of polls closing at 5pm (10am GMT), the make-up of the next government may not be clear for weeks, since no one party is likely to have enough seats for an outright win.

The country's king made an unexpected and cryptic statement hours before the vote, recalling a comment made by his late father in 1969 on the need to put ""good people"" in power and to prevent ""bad people from ... creating chaos"".

Although he did not refer to any of the sides in the race, there was speculation on social media that it was a coded reference to the country's political factions - broadly the middle class and urban establishment, who identify with the monarchy and the military, and their pro-Thaksin opponents.

The king's intervention was a departure from the approach of his father, who in his latter years usually kept a distance between the monarchy and politics.

It followed a startling turn of events last month when a party allied to Pheu Thai nominated Princess Ubolratana, the king's sister, as its prime ministerial candidate. It was then disqualified by a court after the king said it was ""inappropriate"" for members of the royal family to enter politics.

""What happened last month ... and then the announcement last night shows that, in contrast to the former reign, that the monarchy is actively interested in monitoring what's going on and it feels that it has some stake in the future direction of the country,"" said David Streckfuss, a Thailand-based independent scholar.

The junta-written electoral rules ensure the military will continue to have a say in the next government, even if Mr Chan-ocha does not stay on as prime minister.

Pro-Thaksin parties are expected to win the largest number of seats in the House of Representatives. However, the new system appears designed to prevent it from forming a government because it includes the junta-appointed 250-seat Senate in the vote for prime minister.

The provision means Mr Chan-ocha's Palang Pracharat Party and allies have to win only 126 seats in the House, while Pheu Thai and its potential ""democratic front"" partners would need 376.

Among the potential Pheu Thai allies is the new Future Forward Party, led by 40-year-old billionaire Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, whose criticism of the junta has been scathing and faces charges under the Computer Crimes Act for a critical Facebook speech. Prosecutors have said they will decide whether to put him on trial days after the election.

""The current government has not done much for the economy. Old parties may end up fighting again, so I think the new party is better,"" said Somkiat Rattanawibun, a 42-year-old business owner told Reuters after casting his vote in Bangkok.

Two officially non-aligned parties could be decisive in whether pro-military or ""democratic front"" factions make up the next government.

Former Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, leader of the anti-Thaksin Democrats, has portrayed himself as a third way between the ""dictatorship"" of keeping Mr Chan-ocha and a return to the ""corruption"" on Thaksinism, but he would likely have to side with one or the other to form a government.

The Bhumjaithai Party of Anutin Charnvirakul placed third in the last election of 2011 and has grabbed attention for populist campaign promises such as legalisation of recreational marijuana and a four-day work week. It's unclear which side he would choose.

Regardless of the make-up of the government, the election result is likely to yield a shaky coalition that will do little to soothe Thailand's deep political divides and may not be able to accomplish much, said Paul Chambers, lecturer in political science at Naresuan University in northern Thailand.

""There could be a stable government coming out of it in the short term,"" he said. ""But that kind of coalition is not going to last that long.""

The progressive mayor never mentioned Palestinian conditions ...,"New York Mayor Bill de Blasio gave the “simple, clear, progressive case for the state of Israel” at the Israel lobby group AIPAC this morning, and his speech was a monument in the Democratic Party’s racism against Palestinians.

The progressive mayor never mentioned Palestinian conditions under occupation, he never mentioned Palestinians’ second-class rights in Israel, and while touching again and again on the Jewish history of persecution and “exclusion” and “expulsion”, de Blasio never acknowledged that 750,000 Palestinians had been expelled from their lands at the birth of Israel in 1947-49. As such, his speech was also a monument of Democratic denial of the Palestinian Nakba, or catastrophe.

De Blasio mentioned Palestinians only once. His ten-minute-long speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference focused on rising dangers to Jews around the world from “nativism, fascism, and white supremacy” and therefore the need for a Jewish state.

“I know that antisemitism is dangerous,” he said. “That reinforces my commitment to the survival and the security of the State of Israel. Because the Jewish people cannot be safe without the state of Israel…. Israel at its core is there to shelter an oppressed people.”

Progressives fight oppression everywhere and support inclusion, de Blasio said. “The Jewish people have faced 1000s of years of exclusion and expulsion,” and he emphasized that that history did not end in 1948 with the establishment of the state of Israel.

That statement was a pointed denial of the expulsion of Palestinians.

De Blasio also said that as a progressive what he sees in Israel is not its technological and material achievements but “I see a multi-racial democracy,” one that guarantees health care. The mayor thereby denied Palestinian outrage at Israel’s 2018 nation-state law. That law states that only Jews have the right of self-determination in Israel, grants “national value” to “Jewish settlement” as opposed to Palestinian towns, and downgrades Arabic’s official status.

De Blasio’s appearance was especially fraught because many Democratic candidates for president have refused to attend the policy conference at the Washington, D.C., convention center because of AIPAC’s support for Netanyahu, even as Netanyahu makes anti-Palestinian statements in his reelection campaign. Many progressive groups called on politicians to boycott the conference, while the liberal Zionist group J Street called on those pols who did go to the conference to call out the “bigotry” of Trump and Netanyahu.

De Blasio ignored all these injunctions, offering only the mildest criticism of the Israeli government. “I have some real disagreements with the current Israeli government,” he said. But he quickly added that those criticisms do not detract from the “requirement” that Israel must be defended. Even “if I criticize some policies of the today’s Israeli government,” he said, it is because “I want the idea of the Israeli nation to thrive forever.”

Then the 57-year-old mayor launched into a full-throated attack on the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement (BDS), which he said is “contrary to the progressive imperative to protect all oppressed people everywhere and always” and “affronts the idea of Israel as a guaranteed refuge for the Jewish people.”

Throughout these remarks, de Blasio never mentioned the denial of Palestinian rights that caused Palestinian civil society to launch the BDS campaign. It was in speaking of BDS that he made his sole reference to Palestinians, stating that “I fear that [BDS] could undermine the Israeli economy” and demolish the two-state solution, which is the best hope for Palestinians.

“We must confront the threat to progress that is BDS,” he said.

De Blasio bragged of leading the most diverse city in the world, which includes a large population of Jews. His speech concluded with a memory of a Brooklyn sabbath dinner 15 years ago at which his host showed his daughter her tattoo from Auschwitz.

That memory, he said, means that we “must never ask the Jewish people to defend their lives alone… we must always stand beside you.”

Reporters wait for the general election results in Bangkok, Thailand, March 24, 2019. REUTERS/Soe Zeya Tun

With 93 percent of overall votes counted, the Election Commission reported the pro-military party Palang Pracharat, which is seeking to keep junta chief Prayuth Chan-ocha in power, was leading with 7.59 million votes.

Trailing with 7.12 million votes was Pheu Thai, a party linked to exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, whose loyalists have won every election since 2001.

The numbers were for the popular vote, but these did not reflect parliamentary constituency seats that would ultimately be won. Pheu Thai could still win the lion’s share of these because of its concentrated popularity in the north and northeast of the country.

Nevertheless, there was dismay among many voters who had hoped that the poll would loosen the grip on power that traditional elites and the military have held in a country that has one of the highest measures of inequality in the world.

At Pheu Thai’s headquarters in Bangkok, the mood fluctuated from cheerful to quiet disbelief.

“I didn’t think this is likely. I don’t think this is what the people wanted,” said Pheu Thai supporter Polnotcha Chakphet.

A #PrayforThailand hashtag started trending on Twitter as the results trickled out, and some people tweeted that they would leave the country if Prayuth was returned to power to remain prime minister.

The Election Commission chairman said unofficial results would be announced on Monday afternoon. The commission said turnout was 66 percent, based on 90 percent of the vote counted.

ROYAL ROLE

The royal family, which wields great influence and commands the devotion of millions of Thais, played a part in the election though how far it influenced the outcome was unclear.

On the eve of the vote, King Maha Vajiralongkorn made an unexpected and cryptic statement, recalling a comment made by his late father in 1969 on the need to put “good people” in power and to prevent “bad people from ... creating chaos”.

His message was a departure from the approach of his late father, who died in 2016: in his latter years, the former king usually kept a distance between the monarchy and politics.

Although the king did not refer to any of the sides in the election race, there was speculation on social media that it was a coded reference to main political factions - broadly the middle class and urban establishment, who identify with the monarchy and the military, and their pro-Thaksin opponents.

King Vajiralongkorn also weighed in on electoral affairs last month after a startling turn of events when a pro-Thaksin party nominated Princess Ubolratana, the king’s sister, as its prime ministerial candidate.

Within hours, the king issued a statement saying her candidacy was “inappropriate” and she was disqualified.

Still, the connection between the princess and Thaksin persisted in voters’ minds, particularly after they were seen hugging on Friday at the wedding of his daughter in Hong Kong.

“We had a lot of dramas in the last hours before the election,” said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political analyst at Chulalongkorn University told Reuters. “Thaksin overplayed with a royal involvement and that was countered by his opponent.”

DECK STACKED FOR MILITARY

Thailand has been racked for the past 15 years by crippling street protests both by Thaksin’s opponents and supporters that destabilized governments and hamstrung business.

The country has been under direct military rule for nearly five years since then-army chief Prayuth overthrew an elected government linked to populist Thaksin, who himself was thrown out by the army in 2006.

The election will determine the make-up of parliament’s 500-seat House of Representatives. The lower house and the upper house, the Senate - which is appointed entirely by the ruling junta - will together select the next prime minister.

Critics have said a new, junta-devised electoral system gives a built-in advantage to pro-military parties and appears designed to prevent Pheu Thai from returning to power.

The provision means Prayuth’s Palang Pracharat Party and allies have to win only 126 seats in the House, while Pheu Thai and its potential “democratic front” partners would need 376.

The non-aligned Democrat Party, which many had thought could hold the balance of power between pro-military and “democratic front” factions, appeared to have been deserted by many voters. Its leader, former Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, announced his resignation within five hours of the polls closing.","Thai voters go to polls as coup-leader, 'democratic front' face off",Reuters,https://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKCN1R5027-OCATP

Early results, announced by the country’s election commission after 89 per cent of votes had been counted, put Phalang Pracharat, led by military junta chief Prayuth Chan-o-cha, ahead with seven million votes. The opposition Pheu Thai party had 6.6 million.

However, in a late twist, Ittiporn Boonprakong, the commission’s chairman, said that the full unofficial results would only be declared this morning, without giving any reason for such a delay.

Polling day saw a high turnout among Thailand’s 51.2 million eligible voters, many of whom were determined to cast their ballots after five years under military rule headed by General Prayuth.

The close result reflects deep divisions that remain between supporters of the pro-monarchy junta and those who back Pheu Thai and other parties aligned with Thaksin Shinawatra, the billionaire former prime minister who now lives in exile.

Junta critics have blamed rule by the military for the poor performance of the economy and a lack of democratic freedoms, while its supporters claim the army has stabilised the country.

The odds are weighted in favour of the junta returning to power through the civilian Phalang Pracharat Party, due to recent electoral reforms which have been denounced by opposition parties as unfair.

The official election results do not have to be declared until May 8.

Early polls also indicated a strong performance for the new Future Forward party led by Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, a charismatic young motor-parts tycoon.

(AP) — The leader of Louisiana's Democratic Party isn't expected to face prosecution for illegally entering a Baton Rouge casino last month while struggling to control a gambling addiction.

East Baton Rouge Parish District Attorney Hillar Moore told news outlets he doesn't think the criminal justice system ""needs to be involved in this matter"" involving state Sen. Karen Carter Peterson.

""We try not to prosecute cases where people make mistakes and take the appropriate steps to address their action, as opposed to people who don't or who commit violent acts,"" Moore told The Advocate . ""This case doesn't affect public safety.""

Peterson, a New Orleans Democrat, was reportedly ejected from L'Auberge Casino and Hotel on Feb. 27 by the Louisiana State Police and given a misdemeanor citation.

After news of the citation became public, Peterson released a statement acknowledging she is a compulsive gambler. She said two years ago she voluntarily put her name on a list of people banned from Louisiana gambling establishments.

If someone signed up for the program is found in a casino, staff is obligated to remove the person immediately or the casino faces a hefty fine. State police are allowed to cite the person with a misdemeanor offense. Anyone who enrolls must stay on the exclusion list from casinos for at least five years.

Moore said he's had several conversations with Peterson since the summons was issued. He said Peterson has met with her clergy and sought out counselors. The district attorney said he'll talk to Peterson again before making a decision about formally dropping the misdemeanor charges, but said he would move to prosecute her only if he discovers something that causes him to view her activities more critically.

Peterson is being treated no different from other people who receive the same misdemeanor citation, Moore said.

""She is getting a whole lot more scrutiny than anyone else who has ever gotten one of these,"" he told NOLA.com/The Times-Picayune .

As a state senator, Peterson sits on the Judiciary B Committee, which scrutinizes gambling laws.

""Candidates should be running ...","(Bloomberg) -- The probe into whether Donald Trump or his associates conspired with Russia to sway the 2016 election has consumed Washington for nearly two years. Yet it’s made barely a ripple on the campaign trail for more than a dozen Democrats vying for the White House.

Voters rarely mention it, and the Democrats running for president in 2020 are largely following their lead.

""It is worth noting that the only 2020 presidential candidate making the Mueller investigation central to their political argument is Donald J. Trump,"" Ian Sams, a spokesman for Senator Kamala Harris, said Sunday.

One of the lessons of the 2018 midterm elections, in which Democrats retook the House and scored significant wins in state and local elections, was that the Russia investigation doesn’t sway many voters. Attitudes about Trump, whether the investigations into his administration or perceptions about his character, are already entrenched. Voters are more tuned into issues such as income inequality, health care and taxes.

“Our campaign is about the issues that matter to people: raising their wages and incomes, giving their kids’ teachers a raise, expanding health care to all Americans, finally confronting the existential threat of climate change, using common sense to implement gun safety measures,” Sams said in a text message.

Mueller’s Report

Special Counsel Robert Mueller sent his conclusions to the Justice Department on Friday and Attorney General William Barr released a four-page summary Sunday. Barr said that while Mueller’s report does not “conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.” Barr’s summary said that the Mueller report “did not establish” that Trump or members of his 2016 campaign coordinated with the Russian government to manipulate the election.

Even the progressives who have been focused on the Russia probe and the potential for a revelation that would topple Trump would be hard-pressed to find meaningful differences among the presidential candidates on the issue.

Full Disclosure

In a tweet that largely reflected the responses from most of the 2020 candidates to the end of Mueller’s investigation and the summary released by Barr, Beto O’Rourke said, “Release the full Mueller report to the American people and their representatives. There must be transparency and accountability.” Others like Harris, Senators Bernie Sanders and Amy Klobuchar and candidate John Delaney similarly said the full report ought to be disclosed.

At her campaign launch Sunday outside Trump Tower in New York, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand took a dig at Trump when she said the U.S. public should be able to see the Mueller report.

“It’s not often that I agree with Richard Nixon, but he was right to say that the American people have a right to know whether or not their president is a crook,” she said.

Then she quickly turned to discussing the need to combat climate change and invest in the country’s infrastructure.

Moving On

For a lot of voters, that’s enough.

“I’m looking to the New York district court to come down on Trump for financial injustices and so on,” 59-year-old Roxanne Cordonier said at a rally for Democrat Pete Buttigieg in Greenville, South Carolina. “So I’m kind of glad it’s over; now we can move on.”

There’s little evidence that the probe has dented Trump’s standing with voters. The Gallup poll, which regularly tracks presidential job approval, has found Trump’s approval rating to be remarkably stable, between the high 30s and low 40s, since Mueller’s appointment in 2017.

Trump has repeated attacked the Mueller probe and depicted himself as the victim of a ""witch hunt."" He said Monday he’s ""glad it’s over.""

Even with the Mueller 22-month investigation wrapped up, Democrats in the House will continue their own probes of Trump, his administration and his businesses. Six committees, including Judiciary, Intelligence, Financial Services and Oversight, already have investigations under way. Party leaders are wary of being perceived by voters overreaching against Trump and have sought to tamp down the clamor for impeachment.

Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said on MSNBC Sunday that Democrats would be wrong to try to end the Trump presidency by way of investigation, and should instead examine the root causes of what allowed him to rise to power.","For 2020 Democratic Candidates, Russia Probe Remains a Sideshow",Yahoo News,https://news.yahoo.com/2020-democratic-candidates-russia-probe-171523292.html

East Baton Rouge Parish District Attorney Hillar Moore told news outlets he doesn't think the criminal justice system ""needs to be involved in this matter"" involving state Sen. Karen Carter Peterson.

""We try not to prosecute cases where people make mistakes and take the appropriate steps to address their action, as opposed to people who don't or who commit violent acts,"" Moore told The Advocate . ""This case doesn't affect public safety.""

Peterson, a New Orleans Democrat, was reportedly ejected from L'Auberge Casino and Hotel on Feb. 27 by the Louisiana State Police and given a misdemeanor citation.

After news of the citation became public, Peterson released a statement acknowledging she is a compulsive gambler. She said two years ago she voluntarily put her name on a list of people banned from Louisiana gambling establishments.

If someone signed up for the program is found in a casino, staff is obligated to remove the person immediately or the casino faces a hefty fine. State police are allowed to cite the person with a misdemeanor offense. Anyone who enrolls must stay on the exclusion list from casinos for at least five years.

Moore said he's had several conversations with Peterson since the summons was issued. He said Peterson has met with her clergy and sought out counselors. The district attorney said he'll talk to Peterson again before making a decision about formally dropping the misdemeanor charges, but said he would move to prosecute her only if he discovers something that causes him to view her activities more critically.

Peterson is being treated no different from other people who receive the same misdemeanor citation, Moore said.

""She is getting a whole lot more scrutiny than anyone else who has ever gotten one of these,"" he told NOLA.com/The Times-Picayune .

As a state senator, Peterson sits on the Judiciary B Committee, which scrutinizes gambling laws. Colleagues said they were shocked to learn Peterson was struggling with gambling, but they didn't think it had interfered with her duties or judgment as a member of the Legislature.",No prosecution planned for Louisiana Democratic Party leader,The Beaumont Enterprise,https://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/article/No-prosecution-planned-for-Louisiana-Democratic-13714397.php
164,Politics,2019-03-25T18:38:00.0000000Z,"Tom Udall of New Mexico announced today that he ... Democratic than the nation as a whole. As chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2018, Lujan was credited with leading his party to the House majority last year.","U.S. Sen. Tom Udall of New Mexico announced today that he will not seek a third term next year, making him the first Democratic incumbent to retire since 2016. Udall will turn 71 in May. The race will move to the Likely Democrat column.



New Mexico hasn’t been an easy state for Republicans in recent years. Although voters elected a Republican Governor in 2010 and 2014, Susanna Martinez was very unpopular when she left office at the end of 2018. Democrat Michelle Lujan Grisham easily won the open gubernatorial contest over then-Republican U.S. Rep. Steve Pearce, 57 percent to 43 percent.



Republicans haven’t held a U.S. Senate seat since the late U.S. Sen. Pete Domenici retired in 2008. In fact, Udall won the seat Domenici vacated that year. While the GOP had maintained a foothold in the 2nd congressional district, which covers nearly the entire bottom two-thirds of the state and has a PVI of R+6, they lost it in 2018 when Democrat Xochitl Torres Small inched past Republican Yvette Herrell, 51 percent to 49 percent. This leaves Republicans shut out of the state’s congressional delegation, all statewide constitutional offices, and in the minority in both chambers of the state legislature. In addition, a Republican presidential nominee hasn’t carried the state since 2004 when then-President George W. Bush narrowly won; he had narrowly lost the state in 2000. President Donald Trump lost the state by eight points in 2016.



Given Republicans’ recent electoral losses, it’s not that surprising that they don’t have much of a bench of tested and successful potential candidates. Not only was Martinez too unpopular at the end of her term to make her a viable candidate, but she has always said that she has no interest in leaving New Mexico. Former U.S. Rep. Heather Wilson would be a strong candidate, although she is resigning her current post as Secretary of the Air Force at the end of May to become the president of the University of Texas at El Paso. Pearce, the former congressman and 2018 gubernatorial nominee, is likely to look at running, as will Herrell, who spent eight years in the state House of Representatives before making her unsuccessful bid for Congress last year. Beyond those two names, it’s hard to know who might take a serious look at running.



It’s also unclear at this writing who might seek the Democratic nomination. One possibility is U.S. Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, who represents the 3rd congressional district, which encompasses the northern third of the state and includes Santa Fe. The district has a PVI of D+8, meaning that it votes eight points more Democratic than the nation as a whole. As chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2018, Lujan was credited with leading his party to the House majority last year. Progressives are floating Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver as a potential candidate. She won a special election in 2016 and was easily elected to a full term last year.



Both U.S. Reps. Torres Small and Deb Haaland, who represents the 1st congressional district, will make the list of potential candidates (progressives are floating Haaland’s name) but are freshmen in the House. This doesn’t preclude them from running, but they wouldn’t be considered invincible.



It will take some time for the fields to form on both sides. While Democrats remain in a strong position to retain the seat, it will move to the Likely Democrat column while the situation sorts itself out.

REUTERS/Ann Wang

By Panu Wongcha-um and Patpicha Tanakasempipat

BANGKOK (Reuters) - A pro-military party was leading in Thailand's first election since a 2014 coup, with the unofficial result delayed until Monday afternoon likely to indicate whether junta chief Prayuth Chan-ocha can gain enough seats to remain prime minister.

The Election Commission had been scheduled to announce the unofficial results Sunday night for the 500-seat lower House of Representatives but later said it was delayed until Monday, without giving a reason.

But with Prayuth's Palang Pracharat party all but guaranteed the support of the junta-appointed upper house, the Senate, under new electoral rules the junta drafted, it looked in a good position to keep Prayuth in office five years after he overthrew an elected government.

With 93 percent of overall votes counted, the Election Commission reported Palang Pracharat was leading with 7.64 million votes.

Trailing with 7.16 million votes was Pheu Thai, a party linked to the self-exiled ousted former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, whose loyalists have won every election since 2001.

Palang Pracharat leader Uttama Savanayana cautioned the final results were not yet in but he seemed confident.

""We are pleased,"" Uttama said. ""As for discussion with other parties about forming the next government, we haven't got to that stage yet.""

The numbers released were for the popular vote, but these did not reflect parliamentary constituency seats that would ultimately be won. Pheu Thai could still win the lion's share of these because of its concentrated popularity in the north and northeast of the country.

Pheu Thai was on track to win at least 129 seats and Palang Pracharat at least 102 seats, based on a Reuters tally of the partial results of the 350 constituency seats contested.

Another 150 ""party seats"" will be allocated under a complex formula that favours smaller parties and is based on the total number of votes cast.

The strong showing by the pro-junta Palang Pracharat prompted dismay among many voters who had hoped that the poll would loosen the grip on power that traditional elites and the military have held in a country that has one of the highest measures of inequality in the world.

The Election Commission chairman said turnout was 66 percent, based on 90 percent of the vote counted.

At Pheu Thai's headquarters in Bangkok, the mood fluctuated from cheerful to quiet disbelief.

""I didn't think this is likely. I don't think this is what the people wanted,"" said Pheu Thai supporter Polnotcha Chakphet.

Pheu Thai leader Viroj Pao-in told reporters there had been some reports of vote-buying, though he stopped short of questioning the overall results.





ROYAL ROLE

The royal family, which wields great influence and commands the devotion of millions of Thais, played a part in the election though how far it influenced the outcome was unclear.

On the eve of the vote, King Maha Vajiralongkorn made an unexpected and cryptic statement, urging voters to put ""good people"" in power and to prevent ""bad people from ... creating chaos"".

His message was a departure from the approach of his late father, who died in 2016: in his latter years, the former king usually kept a distance between the monarchy and politics.

Although the king did not refer to any of the sides in the election race, there was speculation on social media that it was a coded reference to main political factions - broadly the middle class and urban establishment, who identify with the monarchy and the military, and their pro-Thaksin opponents.

King Vajiralongkorn also weighed in on electoral affairs last month after a startling turn of events when a pro-Thaksin party nominated Princess Ubolratana, the king's sister, as its prime ministerial candidate.

Within hours, the king issued a statement saying her candidacy was ""inappropriate"" and she was disqualified.

Still, the connection between the princess and Thaksin persisted in voters' minds, particularly after they were seen hugging on Friday at the wedding of his daughter in Hong Kong.

""We had a lot of dramas in the last hours before the election,"" said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political analyst at Chulalongkorn University told Reuters. ""Thaksin overplayed with a royal involvement and that was countered by his opponent.""

But the conference won’t be a showcase for Democratic contenders for a ...,"WASHINGTON (JTA) — The Democratic candidates are steering clear of AIPAC’s big policy conference, but celebrations by the pro-Israel lobby’s critics on the left may be premature.



This week MoveOn, the progressive advocacy group, asked candidates not to attend the conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, and has been keeping a list of the no-shows: Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; Washington Gov. Jay Inslee; South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; former Housing Secretary Julian Castro; former Maryland Rep. John Delaney; and former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke. (Howard Schultz, the Starbucks mogul considering an independent run, also is not attending.)

However, only Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who said in 2016 that he “would very much have enjoyed speaking at the AIPAC conference,” explained why he wasn’t going this year in language that closely hews to MoveOn’s arguments for snubbing the event.“He’s concerned about the platform AIPAC is providing for leaders who have expressed bigotry and oppose a two-state solution,” his policy director, Josh Orton, told The Huffington Post.MoveOn’s reasons included AIPAC’s opposition to the Iran deal; its inclusion of speakers who the group says peddle Islamophobic rhetoric; alleged war crimes condoned by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu; a deal struck by Netanyahu that could bring a far-right party into the Knesset; and AIPAC’s supposed refusal to condemn white nationalists in President Donald Trump’s orbit.But the conference won’t be a showcase for Democratic contenders for a perhaps more prosaic reason: AIPAC hasn’t rolled out the welcome mat.The truth is, AIPAC does not welcome candidates as speakers in non-election years. An AIPAC official confirmed the policy to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, but would not explain it. A best guess is that when there are more than a dozen candidates in play, it’s too unwieldy. By the time March of an election year rolls around, it’s down to three or four, which makes the logistics easier.So why aren’t the other Democrats attending, if only just to schmooze? JTA asked a number of them, and is awaiting their responses, but one plausible reason is that they are campaigning. Until 2007, AIPAC allowed candidates to hold salons on the convention campus — no fundraising allowed, but an opportunity to meet and greet folks who might want to give once they get away from the convention. In 2007, the buzz at Obama’s salon was, well, buzzier than at Hillary Clinton’s, a harbinger of what was to be.AIPAC has ceased the practice, which means just stopping by the convention is wasted time for an eager campaigner. (AIPAC since 2015 has stopped its roll call, when executives and lay leaders would read out the names of the politicians in attendance.)So MoveOn’s “victory” list appears a little disingenuous. Harris, for example, teased her presidential candidacy at AIPAC two years ago and again last year — there are no definitive signs she is turning on the lobby. Delaney’s campaign told The Hill that he wanted to attend — he was “very disappointed” — but had a scheduling conflict.“We have attended every year since he has been in Congress and we very much look forward to being back next year,” his campaign said.But its complaints about AIPAC focus attention about fault lines on the left over Israel.It’s notable that some things Sanders and MoveOn object to about the lobby have changed since 2016, when Sanders was eager to speak to AIPAC — but much has not.MoveOn’s No. 1 reason — that AIPAC took the lead in opposing the Iran nuclear deal — happened in 2015, when the Obama administration negotiated the deal. So did the Israeli elections, when Netanyahu incurred the Obama administration’s wrath for referring to Arab voters in what seemed to be racist terms. Israel’s last war was with Hamas in the Gaza Strip in 2014, and before that in 2012. Netanyahu, moreover, is considered among his citizens to be among the Israeli prime ministers who have shown the greatest restraint in wartime.AIPAC has had speakers from Israel’s right who do not want a two-state solution, and in 2016 — the year Sanders thought it was a good idea to speak to the conference — The Nation singled out a number of speakers perceived as Islamophobic. By contrast, this year AIPAC distanced itself from a speaker who attacked Muslim lawmakers, and the speaker withdrew.In 2016, AIPAC did not condemn white nationalists associated with Trump (it did reprimand Trump for dissing Barack Obama), and it is true that unlike other groups, the lobby has not singled out administration figures like Steve Bannon or Stephen Miller. But AIPAC rarely speaks out on any issue that does not directly concern Israel — although it was, uncharacteristically, among the groups that expressed dismay in 2017 after Trump equivocated following the deadly neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville, Virginia.AIPAC — again, unlike other Jewish groups — did not directly condemn Netanyahu for his deal with the far-right Jewish Power party, but (again unusually for AIPAC) it did condemn the party itself.AIPAC is trying hard to cultivate Democrats, the party that still garners the loyalty of most American Jews, and explicitly backs the two-state solution, while Netanyahu and Trump have both retreated from it, and a number of the conference’s sidebar sessions are about how to get there. Its legislative agenda this year is devoid of the items that only Republicans are advancing, including proposals to recognize Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights. The Iran deal damaged the relationship between AIPAC and Democrats, but not beyond repair.So what really has changed for Sanders? He was critical of the lobby in 2016, using its friendship with Hillary Clinton to attack her in a debate, but was also eager to engage.Perhaps the lobby is collateral damage from the broken relationship between Netanyahu and Democrats. It was bad enough that the Israeli leader dissed Obama in 2015 by speaking out against the president’s Iran policy in Congress, but his intimacy with Trump appears to be too much to bear for the party — certainly, the liberal wing that Sanders represents.There’s no question that Sanders’ surprisingly strong candidacy in 2016 made it easier for candidates this year to criticize Israel. This week, O’Rourke and Buttigieg took aim at Israeli policies, and Warren has done so as well. Sanders now posts campaign videos that speak of “apartheid-like” conditions in areas controlled by Israel. Harris, Sanders and Warren defended Rep. Ilhan Omar, the Minnesota Democrat accused of criticizing Israel and AIPAC in terms seen as anti-Semitic, while the party’s congressional leadership was preparing to condemn her.The same three senators, along with Gillibrand and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., another presidential candidate, voted last month against an AIPAC-backed bill that would have protected states with laws targeting the boycott Israel movement. Each senator said the anti-boycott measure infringed on speech freedoms and that they opposed the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement targeting Israel. It remains to be seen whether Booker, Gillibrand, Warren and Harris are comfortable with MoveOn’s boycott of AIPAC.Keep an eye on next year’s policy conference, when candidates will not be able to brush off AIPAC without explaining why — and might be less inclined to do so as they begin to pivot from pleasing the Democratic base and reaching out to independent voters. That’s a reality MoveOn appears to recognize — it has said that attending the conference will not be a litmus test in how it otherwise treats candidates.A version of this post first appeared in The Tell , Ron Kampeas’ weekly newsletter on Jewish news from Washington.

Juana Summers, The Associated Press





NEW YORK -- Democratic presidential candidate Kirsten Gillibrand on Sunday called President Donald Trump a ""coward"" who ""punches down"" and says that he is ""tearing apart the moral fabric of our country.""

Gillibrand also urged the full release of special counsel Robert Mueller's report in the Russia investigation, stressing that ""nobody in this country, not even the president, is above the law, or immune from accountability."" Attorney General William Barr was expected to release a summary of principal conclusions as soon as Sunday, but Democrats want to see the full details.

In what her campaign billed as Gillibrand's first major speech as a presidential candidate, the New York senator said the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Manhattan is ""a shrine to greed, division and vanity.""

Gillibrand is trying to position herself in the crowded field of Democrats seeking the party's nomination. While some hopefuls have shied away from mentioning Trump, Gillibrand has not hesitated to do so.

""He demonizes the vulnerable and he punches down. He puts his name in bold on every building,"" Gillibrand said. ""He does all of this because he wants you to believe he is strong. He is not. Our president is a coward.""

Gillibrand's speech comes as the nation awaits the key findings of Mueller's report, which has loomed over Trump's presidency.

She said Sunday, ""It is not often that I agree with Richard Nixon, but he was right to say that the American people have the right to know whether their president is a crook.""

The speech in front of the Trump International Hotel & Tower appears to be a re-launch of Gillibrand's campaign. She announced last January that she was exploring a run, then spent months travelling the country campaigning and raising money.

Gillibrand praised the bravery of high school students organizing to end gun violence, young people brought to the country illegally as children who are fighting for ""their right to call this country home,"" and ""of course, the formerly well-behaved women who organized, ran for office, voted and won in 2018.""

""That is brave,"" she said.

Gillibrand also talked about her own courage, which she said is evidenced by her ability to win a House seat in a district seen as a Republican stronghold, by fighting for funds to cover the cost of medical care for rescue workers and survivors of the 2001 attack on the World Trade Center, and by fighting on behalf of survivors of sexual assault and harassment at the Pentagon, in Congress and on college campuses.","In speech at Trump hotel, Gillibrand calls Trump a coward",CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/in-speech-at-trump-hotel-gillibrand-calls-trump-a-coward-1.4349757

GUWAHATI – The BJP has suffered a major setback in the northeast with 23 of its leaders quitting the party in the last two days.

In Arunachal Pradesh, 20 BJP leaders, including two ministers and six MLAs, joined the National People’s Party (NPP) late on Tuesday evening. This move took the strength of the NPP to 13 in the Assembly. The BJP still has 40 MLAs in ther 60-member House.

Arunachal Pradesh goes to polls on April 11 to elect 2 Lok Sabha MPs and 60 new members to the state assembly.

“Two sitting ministers Kumar Waii and Jarkar Gamlin and six other BJP legislators formally joined our party. Former BJP general secretary Jarpum Gamlin and two other former MLAs and 8 other BJP leaders have also joined us,” said NPP legislator from Roing Mutchu Mithi.

NPP is heading the Meghalaya government that also includes the is BJP. The NPP is also a constituent of the BJP-led North East Democratic Alliance but both parties are contesting the Lok Sabha polls lections separately.

NPP is also part of the BJP-led government in Manipur and the NDPP-led government in Nagaland where BJP is also a partner.

In Tripura, BJP state vice-president Subal Bhowmik were among three BJP leaders who joined the Congress on Tuesday. The other two are former Minister Prakash Das and firebrand leader Debashish Sen.

After joining the Congress, Bhowmik said some people are against him being given a ticket for Lok Sabha elections. “I don’t want to be a burden in the party where there is no internal democracy. I have decided to join the Congress back,” Bhowmik said.

Bhowmik was with Congress since late 1970s. He became an MLA in 2008 on a Congress ticket. He left the party to float his own party Tripura Pragatisheel Grameen Congress after the Congress was defeated in 2013 Assembly polls.

The Alliance is following in the footsteps of independent groups like Farnworth and Kearsley First in Bolton and various new opposition groupings in Wigan that have had candidates elected recently.

""The people of Salford want a change from party politics and end to the patronage that silences councillors from truly representing their communities"" Councillor Paul Wilson told the Salford Star today ""We need to make it appealing to vote again. I believe Salford residents want transparency and honesty.""

Paul Wilson will be standing as an Independent candidate in his current seat of Weaste, and Dave Pike and Darren Goulden state that more announcements of further candidates will follow shortly...

""We're hopeful that with this announcement and the political turmoil both locally and nationally more individuals will come forward"" they explain ""We see this as a huge springboard for the all outs next year and envisage a very different looking Council in May 2020...""

Meanwhile, while not joining the Alliance, Green Party local election and General Election candidate, Bryan Blears, agrees with the new coalition's sentiments...

""There hasn't been a proper opposition in Salford for years and people have been let down as a result"" he told the Salford Star earlier ""Our Labour-led Council has been too willing to sit back and blame 'Tory cuts' for all of the problems in our city. But simply blaming the cuts is not good enough. People in Salford are fed up of excuses, they want solutions.

""In the past few months I have met with various groups in and around Salford and it is incredible how many people are crying out for political change"" he added ""I think that this year is going to be a big wake-up call for some of the people currently in charge. In particular, the way that this Council has allowed private developers to run roughshod over our Green Belt land is deeply concerning for people concerned with the future of our city.

""I would urge anybody who cares about Salford to get out and get involved in local politics, because we desperately need things to change"" he concluded.

Yet the voices of opposition to the leadership plans frequently get sidelined, regardless of party.

That leaves it to a new wave of lawmakers to step up to the task, fighting the continuing effort to expand vouchers and scholarships, grow the charter school system and offer more school choice in a manner they see as potentially harmful to the district public schools.

Rep. Anna Eskamani, D-Orlando, is among the newest voices in the debate. She didn’t plan to make education a top priority — she didn’t even ask to be on any of the committees. But upon her arrival on the PreK-12 Quality subcommittee, the 28-year-old lawmaker quickly studied up and became one of the more vocal and articulate members who doesn’t agree with what she considers the move to privatize public education.

In her efforts, she seeks compromise when possible, without caving on key positions. She spoke with reporter Jeff Solochek about the variety of issues, from a proposed requirement for Bible courses in high schools to school safety, that she’s already had to weigh in on.

The tweet from the account for the Republican National Committee read: “On this St Paddy’s Day, a special message from noted Irishman Robert Francis O’Rourke.” The words were posted over a photograph of Mr O’Rourke taken by police in 1998 following his arrest for drink-driving. A green leprechaun hat had been added to Mr O’Rourke’s head and the photograph was captioned: “Please drink responsibly.”

Charges against Mr O’Rourke arising from the 1998 incident were later dismissed.

In a statement, the AOH said it was “shocked and appalled that on St Patrick’s Day, a day when America celebrates and honours the contributions that Irish-Americans have made to our great country, the GOP would launch an attack on a prospective presidential candidate based solely on his Irish heritage.

“Such a scurrilous, stereotype-laced attack is more in keeping with the 19th-century Native American Party, aka the Know Nothings, than the party of Lincoln, who wept when he kissed a regimental flag of the Irish Brigade in honour of the sacrifice that so many sons of Erin had made in America’s Civil War.”

‘Offensive meme’

The AOH statement said the “offensive meme is nothing more than a 21st-century version of the scurrilous anti-Irish cartoons of Thomas Nast”.

The AOH said it had hoped that the days when “a candidate’s Irish ancestry would be used as . . . campaign fodder were confined to the dark past.

“Sadly, this toxic tweet from the GOP proves we were optimistic and premature in our beliefs.”

Founded at New York’s St James’ Church in May 1836, the AOH has members in 46 states of the US. Its website notes that it is now 793 days since there has been a US ambassador to Ireland.

Members of the AOH national board, president Judge James McKay, national treasurer Sean Pender and national director Dan Dennehy, had what is described on the organisation’s website as “an unforgettable meeting with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar” during a visit to Dublin last month.",Historic Irish-American group criticises Republican Party over ‘scurrilous’ St Patrick’s Day tweet,The Irish Times,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/religion-and-beliefs/historic-irish-american-group-criticises-republican-party-over-scurrilous-st-patrick-s-day-tweet-1.3837199

I have just voted for the Australian Labor Party (ALP) in the New South Wales elections, casting my vote also to the local Labor candidate, Stephen Bali, in the Blacktown constituency. I have voted by post without waiting for the final election day of 23 March. However, I was not so impressed by the ALP’s rather wishy-washy and lacklustre statements and stand on the horrific shooting and massacre in Christchurch, New Zealand, by an Australian ‘barbarian’ when Muslim devotees were worshiping in two mosques in that city on Friday the last (15 March). I don’t give the actual name of this ‘barbarian,’ heeding the advice of the Labor leader and the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern.





ALP statements



When Bill Shorten, the ALP leader, first said almost immediately after the incident, ‘Do not share the footage. Do not watch the footage. This is not part of normal life,’ he was right. Because a primary objective of the ‘barbarian’ was to inflame the emotions of all extreme sides, portray himself as a hero to his side, and perhaps create a major calamity in the country and outside.



The ‘barbarian’ had a camera fixed to his head and broadcasted his cruelty, brutality and viciousness to the world through the social media. There were over 1.5 million people viewing the footage without any censorship. Only after strong protests from the New Zealand PM, and many others, that the social media circulations were curtailed by the owners of the Facebook, Twitter and You Tube.



It is also true that ‘this is not part of our normal life.’ How could it be? That is exactly why it should have been condemned at the outset, in the strongest possible terms, particularly by a labour or a social democratic party. It was done in New Zealand, but not so much in Australia. It should have been condemned not because it was ‘callously planned,’ but because it was a terrorist attack.



Subsequent statements of Shorten also were somewhat subdued, in my observation. Whatever the contribution that the thinking of the Liberal/National Party and its present leader, Scott Morrison, has made in inflaming sentiments against migrants or refugees at times, on this incident, he came forward in condemning the massacre in strongest terms. This was lacking on the part of the ALP and its leader.



It has become a puzzle to me, personally, because under ‘normal circumstances’ and in day-to-day politics, Bill Shorten appeared to me ‘a principled, rational, and a sober leader,’ compared to Scott Morrison or others. Perhaps this ‘merit’ could have been the ‘debit’ during the crisis situation.



The Christchurch massacre on last fateful Friday undoubtedly was a crisis situation where all democratic political leaders should have shown their true mettle against terrorism and extremism. The New Zealand Labor leader, Jacinda Ardern, has shown that enough appearing almost continuously on media, updating the nation on the events, giving a true and a sober analysis, meeting with the grieving families, and also within 72 hours taking measures to tighten the gun laws, one of the reasons for the scale of the massacre.





Australian connection



If the reason for the ALP’s lacklustre response was anchored in the leadership, Bill Shorten and others might be able to correct that in the future collectively. However can there be other or more profound reasons? This is something that the ALP and others should contemplate on which might even have some relevance in understanding the Christchurch massacre, the motives of the ‘barbarian’ and political roots of the whole incident. The ‘barbarian’ originated in Australia. However, no Australian leader, as far as I know, visited Christchurch in sympathy with the aggrieved community or condemn the massacre jointly with the New Zealand leaders.



Obviously the ALP leaders, the present and past, are busy these days with the New South Wales (NSW) elections. Perhaps they don’t have much time to focus on the Christchurch massacre! I have so far not seen any official party statement on the matter. However, what transpired the day before is a statement made by the NSW Labor leader, Michael Daley, with overtones on Asian migration and migration in general. The statement has been made six months ago when he was the deputy leader. What he has said exactly is the following:



“Our young children will flee and who are they being replaced with? They are being replaced by young people from typically Asia with PhDs. So there’s a transformation happening in Sydney now where our kids are moving out and foreigners are moving in and taking their jobs.”



After uncovering this speech by the opponents (even he must have forgotten), he has apologised to the possible aggrieved parties as a gentleman politician. However, the Liberal Party leader, Scott Morrison, has utilised it to condemn the remarks as ‘appalling, upsetting and offensive,’ disregarding what he has been possibly saying in similar or more offensive manner in the past. This is part of power politics. What can be troubling moreover in all these undercurrents is that there is a clear unease, fear or anxiety among the ‘old settlers’ against the ‘newcomers.’ Daley has used the expressions like ‘our young people,’ and ‘our kids,’ in contrast to ‘people from Asia’ and ‘foreigners’.



There are undoubtedly problematic issues particularly in a country like Australia related to migration, refugees, jobs and property due to economic and other issues. Some of them are obviously labour issues. However it should not be that difficult to distinguish them from racism, possible racism or xenophobia. No person or party can be considered perfect. However a labour party should try its best to be beyond these tribal or archaic feelings. There are so many indications that the ALP is not completely free from these ailments. One of its former leaders, Mark Latham, is now with Paulin Hanson’s One Nation Party which is grossly a xenophobic party, not to call ‘racist.’





Broader issues



When Bill Shorten attended the Islamic Council of Victoria, the following day of the massacre, he was perfectly correct in saying: “Not all right-wing extremist hate speech ends in violence, but all right-wing extremist violence started in hate speech.” However, ‘hate speech’ or sentiments expressed closer to hate speech are not just on the margins of the politics of Australia, but sometimes almost at the centre. They are not just the ‘evil-jokers on the margins.’ Such simple dismissive language is also not sufficient. As Shorten himself has admitted, there can be a link between political rhetoric on immigration and the Christchurch terror attack. Where that could be rectified and addressed? This is the crucial question.



It was extremely disturbing that at the wake of the massacre, Senator Fraser Anning, former One Nation and now independent senator, went to the extent of blaming the victims. He has said, “Real cause of the bloodshed on New Zealand streets today is the immigration program which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand in the first place.” To correct him, there was no bloodshed in the streets of New Zealand, but the brutal shooting of Muslim devotees at Friday prayer at two mosques in Christchurch.



When Anning was uttering those words in Melbourne, he was whacked with an egg by a 17-year-old teenager in protest. But that was also a violent act that cannot be condoned by any means. More disturbing was Anning’s reactions, violently attacking again and again the now dubbed ‘Egg Boy,’ showing his true colours.



Anti-Muslim sentiments or Islamophobia is almost everywhere and disturbingly growing. On the other extreme, there are violent and terrorist acts committed by people who belong to the Islamic side or in that name even in Australia. This is apart from IS and similar movements. These are the extremes on both sides that should be abated and curtailed internationally. This cannot be done through other extremes like egg throwing or ‘blaming and naming’ without context or excessively. The Greens are also trying to exploit the situation for their cheap political gain and it was excessive for them to name Michael Daley a ‘racist’ just because of his single comment. There are no perfect ‘puritans’ in this world.





Necessary measures



At least the ‘Egg Boy’ was on the right side, although excessive in his reactions. However it is not clear where the young generations in general stand on these issues. The ‘barbarian’ himself was just 28 years. What appears clear is that almost all these violent people have largely been males. How are they brought up and/or educated? These are necessary questions to ask. There can be various measures that could be taken in abating such developments or preventing them.



Security measures and strict gun control should take immediate priority. If there were strict gun controls, at least the number of casualties could have been curtailed in the Christchurch massacre. Security measures to track the suspicious people or potential terrorists are equally important, respecting the rights and dignity of all.



Political leaders and especially parliamentarians should refrain from hate speech, acrimonious criticisms and extreme postulations through perhaps codes of ethics and self-control. A new political culture is necessary even in Australia. Even if the two major parties, the Liberals and the Labor, were fairly reasonable in handling the main crisis, they appeared to lose the balance when the Turkish President, Tayyip Erdogan, fired his typical rhetorical barrage, exacerbating Islamic sentiments in his country. This is exactly what the ‘barbarian’ intended to instigate.



There should be careful editing and restrictions on extremism, hate speech and pictures of them in the social media in particular (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, etc.) and the media in general, again respecting the general norms of freedom of speech and expression.



Most important might be the education. While students are prepared for NAPLAN (National Assessment Program – Language and Numeracy) they should also be prepared for NAPTAC (National Assessment Program – Tolerance and Coexistence). The ALP has already launched an exemplary reform program for future education in Australia. But it should incorporate NAPTAC, multiculturalism and indigenous education as well. Having to know about Australia’s indigenous heritage, their grieving and grievances might sober the minds of the young generations of the ‘old settlers’ as well as the ‘new ones’.",Christchurch massacre and the Australian Labor Party,FT,http://www.ft.lk/columns/Christchurch-massacre-and-the-Australian-Labor-Party/4-675294

Confusion over the outcome of Sunday’s election raised the specter of a protracted struggle to form a government, spoiling hopes of a clear cut result that could have ended 15 years of political turmoil in Southeast Asia’s second largest economy.

Both the pro-army party seeking to keep coup leader Prayuth Chan-ocha on as prime minister and the opposition party linked to self-exiled former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, claimed they would command enough parliamentary seats to form a coalition government.

The pro-Thaksin Pheu Thai party said it was considering a legal challenge over what it said were poll irregularities after partial results showed Prayuth’s Palang Pracharat party with an unexpected lead in the popular vote.

The strong early showing for Palang Pracharat increased the likelihood that Prayuth, who was army chief when he overthrew a Pheu Thai government in 2014, would stay in power, although that outcome was not certain.

“There are irregularities in this election that we’re not comfortable with. These affect the nation’s credibility and people’s trust,” said Sudarat Keyuraphan, candidate for prime minister of the Pheu Thai Party.

“We’ve voiced our concerns before for vote-buying, abuse of power, and cheating. All three have manifested. We will fight back through legal means,” she told a news conference.

Thailand has been racked since 2004 by street protests of both opponents and supporters of Thaksin. Parties linked to Thaksin have won every previous election since 2001, but the populist telecoms billionaire was thrown out by the army in 2006 and a government led by his sister was ousted in 2014.

Thaksin wrote an opinion piece headlined “The Election in Thailand Was Rigged” in The New York Times on Monday.

“I knew that the junta running Thailand wanted to stay in power, but I cannot believe how far it has gone to manipulate the general election on Sunday,” he wrote.

Earlier on Monday, election commission official Nat Laosisawakul blamed delays and irregularities in results on “human error” and said a full count of the vote would be released on Friday.

“We have nothing to hide,” he said.

DECK STACKED FOR MILITARY

The lower house and the upper house Senate, whose 250 members are appointed by the junta, will together select the next prime minister based on the support of a simple majority of 376 lawmakers.

That means Prayuth’s party and allies have to win only 126 seats in the lower house to vote him in as prime minister, while Pheu Thai and its potential “democratic front” partners would need 376 all from the lower house to choose the next premier.

The House of Representatives, the lower house, has a total 500 seats, and on Monday the Election Commission posted the winners of the 350 seats that were contested on a first-past-the post basis.

The, as yet, unofficial results showed Pheu Thai leading with 137 seats to 96 seats for junta leader Prayuth’s party.

However, official results for the lower house’s remaining 150 “party seats”, which will be allocated by a complex formula involving voter turnout, will not be announced until May 9.

It might, however, be possible to roughly calculate the shares of the 150 “party seats” on Friday, when the Election Commission is due to give a breakdown of votes cast.

“CHEATING” TRENDS ON TWITTER

The strong popular vote showing by the pro-junta Palang Pracharat Party stunned voters who had hoped the poll would loosen the grip that traditional elites and the military hold on power in a country that has one of the highest measures of inequality in the world.

Many Thais took to social media to voice their suspicions about the results of an election that critics had said was systematically skewed in favor of the military from the outset because of the junta-appointed Senate’s role in selecting the prime minister.

Thai-language hashtags that translated as “Election Commission screw-up” and “cheating the election” were trending on Twitter in Thailand.

Many tweets referred to inconsistencies between the numbers for voter turnout and ballots cast in some parliamentary constituencies. Some questioned the overall turnout of less than 70 percent, which was much lower than expected.

Future Forward, a new party that appears to have made a spectacular election debut, winning 30 of the 350 constituency seats thanks to its appeal to young voters, also questioned the poll numbers.

“There are obviously some irregularities with the numbers because they don’t add up. This is making people skeptical of the election results,” said Future Forward spokeswoman Pannika Wanich.

A change.org petition launched a week ago to impeach the Election Commission had garnered almost 600,000 signatures by Monday evening, up from around 200,000 at the start of the day.","Surprise, suspicion in Thailand as pro-army party leads election race",Reuters,https://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKCN1R50Q1-OCATP

The key input here was cheap credit, land, and permissions, all of which the mayor could secure. Land, especially farmland, could simply be expropriated from the current occupier for little compensation, especially since all land technically belonged to the state. The expropriated land could then be turned over to the real-estate developer, sometimes at a significant markup that added to the coffers of the city government.

Such actions became increasingly necessary as the central government started retaining most of the tax revenues in the early 1990s, forcing city and provincial governments to become entrepreneurial in raising money. Invariably, some of the funds generated from such legally murky actions also went to bolster the personal income of the party officials as compensation for their “entrepreneurship”.

Corruption was not the only motivator. Many party bosses showed keen interest in such investment because economic growth in their region was an important consideration for their promotion up the party hierarchy. Others did so because the local government obtained shares in the start-up, which gave it a continuing stake in the company’s growth.

At any rate, the onerous rules and regulations as well as the relatively murky property rights were an important obstacle to any ordinary person setting up business, but were not a problem for those with party connections. The party thus fostered private enterprise while keeping control over who was allowed to open businesses or expand.

~~~

The Repressed Household

The subsidised inputs to corporations had to be paid for by someone – that was the ordinary householder. Given her productivity, not only were her wages lower than they would have been in a more developed economy (as in many developing countries, they were held down by massive surplus labour in agriculture), her taxes paid for the other subsidies granted to the corporate sector, she paid the high prices charged by local monopolists, and she re- ceived low interest rates on her deposits (the government capped the rates payable on deposits at a low level, in order to allow banks to profitably make cheap loans to corporations and developers).

Even while the household received miserable returns on its deposited savings, the government had taken away its promise of a safe job and guaranteed pension. Chinese labour unions did not really fight for worker wages or rights, except when signaled to do so by the government – they were essen- tially there to control and channel worker dissatisfaction. Furthermore, in 1979, China’s one-child policy effectively mandated a maximum of one child per couple. It resulted in six adults – four grandparents and two parents – depending on that one child for support in their old age, if they did not have savings of their own.

The household had further challenges. Its most important property – the house and the land it stood on – was insecure, as we have already seen. Also, industrial growth, as well as the blind eye that was turned to violations of regulations, polluted the air people breathed, the water they drank, and the food they ate. China was becoming the workshop to the world, but its people were paying for it with a deteriorating quality of life as the country drew in the dirty factories and power plants that were closing everywhere else.

China therefore followed a unique growth path. Ordinary households bore a burden that would not have been possible in a more democratic environment. There were important compensations. Because the system generated very modern infrastructure and investment rapidly, the economy grew fast. Many new jobs were created, and the productivity of existing jobs increased quickly. So average wages grew fast, even though they were lower than the additional value each worker created. China was growing rich quickly, so it was easy to ignore the distortions.

Nevertheless, a large share of the income generated in the country ended up as savings rather than final consumption by the households – partly because it was locked up as corporate profits of state-owned corporations that were not paid out but reinvested and partly because households saved more, worried about the removal of the safety net and the insecurity of property. Chinese private consumption to GDP fell from about 50 per cent in 1990 to about 47 per cent in 2000. In the next decade, when China grew very fast, consumption fell further to a meager 35.5 per cent of income in 2010.

The Chinese household paid a price for the jobs that growth generated, but the growth was spectacular. Hundreds of millions of Chinese have been lifted from poverty into relatively comfortable middle-class lives since the reforms started.

Party Control and Crony Competition

The party therefore facilitated growth, not by opening access to all but by using its good offices to clear the path for select business. At the same time, it tightened its political control. A 2005 white paper by the party defined democratic government as “the Chinese Communist Party governing on behalf of the people”. This meant more than single-party rule, it meant extending the party’s tentacles more directly into business.

Every large state-owned enterprise had a party cell, with the party boss often a more powerful figure than the company CEO.13 The party decided overall strategy and senior appointments in the company. This ensured the party had firm control of the state-owned enterprises, and their enormous funds. Of course, this also enabled party members to do favours for one another, including appointing one another’s children to cozy jobs.

Membership in the party was increasingly the route to success in China. Private-sector firms soon read the writing on the wall and created their own cells. In the internationally known consumer electronics and home appliances product company Haier, its CEO also served as the secretary of the company’s Communist Party committee. The party made it clear that it wanted both information and the ability to intervene in every organisation that might be a possible threat to its political monopoly. The private sector complied.

Such strong political control over business, without a vocal public com- munity that can enforce separation between the state and business, raises concerns about inefficient crony capitalism and possible authoritarianism... Has China been special in avoiding these ills? In a sense it has...thus far...

As political scientist Daniel Bell argues, the Chinese Communist Party is in many ways a meritocracy, which trains and tests its members in the practice of governance. Each of the nine members of the Standing Committee of the Politburo, the apex body of the party, has come up the hierarchy after proving themselves in regional or city governments.

With an important element of their performance appraisal being how much they grew the local economy, local party bosses were ferocious in attracting potential investors to their locality, facilitating the set-up and growth of local firms, and protecting them against authorities elsewhere including at the centre. Chang-Tai Hsieh points out that many of the big cities in China have taxis of only one make – the make produced by the automobile joint venture of the city government. By forcing local taxi owners to buy the favoured brand, the local authorities support their local champion.

So there is extensive cronyism within a locality. Moreover, the subsidies to firms in a locality can keep them alive even if they destroy economic value. Also, the party has favourites at the national level, including some very large state-owned firms that monopolise the national market. Therefore, it is hard to call China a fully competitive market.

Ferocious business competition is, however, sustained between the champions of the myriad localities. Competitive cronyism is probably a more appropriate term for Chinese practice. It has worked thus far. Does China have the right system for continued growth, though? To answer that, we have to understand the post–financial crisis change in China’s model of growth.

Elizabeth Warren was on CNN the other day, and did a crackerjack job expressing how her faith and politics fit together. Meanwhile, South Bend Indiana mayor, first openly gay candidate running in a major party’s primary, and general whiz-kid Pete Buttigieg was on The View, doing…not so well.

Pete Buttigieg explains why he says America needs an emergence of a “religious left”: “Living your faith might also have to do with paying more attention to those most in need and not celebrating those who already have the most wealth and the most power.” https://t.co/f8u2wc159S pic.twitter.com/0fV980Fn7w — The View (@TheView) March 22, 2019

Let’s get a couple of quick points out of the way before we get down to the central issue. First, towards the end of the clip, you hear Buttigieg talk about “Pharisees.” I think he means it in the narrow sense of Jesus’ named opponents in the New Testament, rather than the broader sense of a synonym for “hypocrites.” You could reasonably argue it either way. It’s still problematic. Unfortunately, not enough Christians understand that Pharisees went on to become the dominant tradition in modern Judaism. Nor do many Christians get that the New Testament sees Pharisees through a partisan lens, as it were. They were rivals to the nascent Jesus movement, and often their rhetorical targets.

Second and more positively, Buttigieg speaks of the need to represent all comers, religious or not. Good on him for that. Much of the discussion around faith and politics brackets non-believers and the religiously unaffiliated out of the conversation, intentionally or not, and it’s refreshing to hear this reminder.

Now to the bulk of it. Buttigieg blows the question put to him—What do you mean when you call for the emergence of a religious left?—mostly by omission, rather than commission. It’s still pretty bad. For example: I don’t know how or why someone running for national office doesn’t understand (or at the very least can’t be bothered to explain) that there already is a religious left in the US. I might disagree with other writers about the contours of that movement, or how effective it is, but it is certainly there. If you have to go back to Jimmy Carter for your model of a religious left, you have not been paying attention. I wish Joy Behar understood that, but it’s not surprising that she doesn’t.

Buttigieg could and should have reminded her of people like William Barber, Jim Wallis, or many of the other well-known lights of the movement. The anti-racism activist Rob Lee was even on The View last year. Obviously, the conversation with Buttigieg was around presidents or presidential candidates. But then why not mention Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton, both of whom are well-known Democrats with strong Christian commitments? I’m honestly confused here. Buttigieg’s silence leaves the impression that liberals don’t “get” faith, an unforced error and serious problem.

Likewise, Buttigieg’s decision to confront the Religious Right from the perspective of “they’re hypocrites because Trump is a slut” is just dumb. Mike Pence doesn’t give a shit. Conservative evangelicals do not give a shit. The religious right is not about personal morality—never has been. Despite anything they might say, it’s about preserving social order, specifically a social order that puts straight white men at the top of the food chain.

It’s fine to say, as Buttigieg or Warren do, something like “my faith instructs me to care for the marginalized.” But if you don’t understand that the religious right’s conservatism does not stem from honest differences in faith, if you don’t get that it’s about particular structures of power, you badly misunderstand the situation, and you are not ready for prime time. Mayor Pete’s going to get eaten alive in a debate with that framework, or pilloried in a thousand op-eds by people he thought you could reach, all while ignoring the work of his real allies. This seems to fit an emerging pattern with Buttigieg of pillorying his left flank as too hostile to Trump supporters and/or rural voters. A Democrat positioning him- or herself as a centrist transpartisan begins from a very weak position in a polarized society. Have we learned nothing from the Obama presidency? It’s bad politics, and it threatens to undermine more capable candidates.

Look, it’s not wrong to say, “On a personal level, I know some conservative Christians who are pretty okay, even if they read their faith differently than I do mine.” So do I! But presidential candidates in particular have to understand that they represent—and are responsible to—the dynamics of social power and how it is used. When Buttigieg forgets (or ignores) that the religious left exists, and explains away the religious right’s use of power on a personal level, he diminishes how they’ve actually used that power, against people like him, among many others. That’s actually selling out his own team.

I sincerely wish that I could get Buttigieg (and all the other candidates) to read Niebuhr’s Moral Man and Immoral Society, and internalize its lessons. Social leaders who want to effect meaningful change are condemned to represent the interests of their group, even though doing so might contradict their personal moral code. The short version of Niebuhr is that you can lead or you can have clean hands, not both. In 2019 America, that means you can embrace the people who are actually going to vote for you, or you can try, foolishly, to hold yourself above the stench of partisanship. Only one of those choices will help a Trump-ridden nation, and it’s not the second.",Democratic Hopeful Pete Buttigieg Makes Faith 101 Misstep,Rewire,https://rewire.news/religion-dispatches/2019/03/25/democratic-hopeful-pete-buttigieg-makes-faith-101-misstep/

Moody’s is scheduled to make a decision on South Africa’s credit rating on 29 March. A downgrade is looking increasingly likely.

South Africa has been on a downward spiral for more than 10 years. This is demonstrated by the country’s dismal economic growth rate, rising unemployment, increasing inequality, constant downgrades of the country’s credit rating and now again, the risk of the national power grid collapsing. What is becoming clearer by the day is that the African National Congress and President Cyril Ramaphosa have put us in this situation.

Moody’s is scheduled to review South Africa’s credit rating on 29 March 2019. Initially the sentiment was that South Africa might be given yet another chance. However, the probability is looking less positive, as it becomes clearer that Ramaphosa’s ANC has no intention to bring about real change, including fixing Eskom.

The country has once again been plunged into darkness as a result of ANC mismanagement and corruption at Eskom. This is not a new issue as the country has experienced this in the past, Ramaphosa was also tasked to oversee a turnaround strategy at Eskom in 2014, with no success. The issue then becomes that if Ramaphosa oversaw the turnaround strategy as far back as 2014 and has been the Leader of Government Business in his role as former President Zuma’s deputy for five years, how can anyone trust him to resolve this now? South Africa and the rest of the world have been watching “this space” for more than six years.

At the most recent update (19 March 2019) on Eskom and the rolling blackouts, the Minister of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan basically told South Africans to prepare for worst and that they did not have a plan to resolve a crisis of their own making. When Gordhan was appointed, some had hope that he would bring drastic changes to state-owned enterprises. However, what we have seen is his old and overplayed “new boards and bailouts” strategy, which is no more than a façade of action being taken. In fact, Gordhan has already worsened the situation by stopping some of the processes that would have made a positive impact in order to keep the ANC, SACP and Cosatu alliance intact.

In response to the 2019 Budget, Moody’s took a “wait and see” approach based on their scepticism of whether Eskom would really be unbundled. At this stage, it seems that they were right to wait and observe as a U-turn on this announcement seems imminent, given Ramaphosa and the ANC’s track record. On top of this, it is becoming clearer that the 2019 Budget was not credible as various expenditures were kept off the books; a Steinhoff move if you will.

This situation, created by the ANC, and very much continued by Ramaphosa at the helm, increases the probability of Moody’s downgrading South Africa to junk status. A downgrade by Moody’s will mean that South Africa is ranked as “junk status” by all three of the major credit rating agencies. Due to legal requirements, institutional investors such as pension funds will not be eligible to invest in South Africa, as the risk would be too high.

Put differently, would you invest your pension in VBS? It is estimated that about R100-billion in investment would flow out of South Africa in the case of a Moody’s downgrade. This will weaken the economy further and unemployment will inevitably increase as well.

South Africa deserves better than this. In October 2018 the Democratic Alliance had already proposed a plausible solution in the form of our ISMO Bill, or known by some as the “Cheaper Electricity Bill”. The bill sets out that Eskom as the biggest monopoly in the country should be broken up in two parts: A generation part and a distribution and transmission part.

The transmission and distribution sections will continue to fall under the control of the state-owned entity; however, it would be illogical to have the same approach to generation. The bill will introduce competition into generation by bringing the private sector on board. This will decrease energy prices, increase the efficiency of public money being spent and make energy supply more reliable.

Before Ramaphosa projected strong U-turn signs, he said that Eskom would be unbundled. However, this plan was an inferior spin-off of the DA’s ISMO bill. The proposal would simply have broken Eskom up into three SOEs as opposed to one. This means that this plan would have increased overheads and created more inefficient boards.

Up until this point, the DA is the only party that has shown that it is capable of efficient risk and crisis management with a viable solution to solving the mess created by the ANC at Eskom. DM

At one of the most important junctures for the country in at least a generation, British politics was at fever pitch and, nearly three years after the 2016 EU membership referendum, it was still unclear how, when or if Brexit will take place.

With May weakened, ministers lined up to insist she was still in charge and to deny any part in, or knowledge of, a reported plot to demand that she name a date to leave office.

Amid the chaos, it was unclear if or when May would bring the divorce deal she agreed with the EU back to parliament. The deal was defeated in parliament by 149 votes on March 12 and by 230 votes on Jan. 15.

“It is with great regret that I have had to conclude that as things stand there is still not sufficient support in the House (of Commons) to bring back the deal for a third meaningful vote,” May told members of parliament (MPs).

Last week, the EU agreed to delay Britain’s original March 29 departure date because of the deadlock in London. Now, it will leave the EU on May 22 if May’s deal is approved by parliament this week. If not, it will have until April 12 to outline its plans.

May refused to give up on her deal passing eventually, noting that the alternatives were unpalatable to her and that there was no evidence of a majority in parliament for anything except the principle of avoiding an abrupt ‘no-deal’ exit.

“‘NO BREXIT’ MUST NOT HAPPEN”

“Unless this House agrees to it, ‘no deal’ will not happen. ‘No Brexit’ must not happen,” May said.

She said another referendum, a new agreement, or not leaving the EU were among the alternatives that had no majority.

The bottom line remained that if her deal and ‘no deal’ were rejected, Britain would have to seek a longer delay to Brexit.

“And a ‘slow Brexit’, which extends Article 50 beyond May 22 May, forces the British people to take part in European Elections and gives up control of any of our borders, laws, money or trade, is not a Brexit that will bring the British people together,” May said.

With speculation swirling around her future, parliament prepared to try to seize control of the Brexit process from the government in a series of votes due from 10 p.m. (2200 GMT).

May said such a move would set an unwelcome precedent and the government would oppose it.

However, a government source said a majority of MPs were likely to back Conservative lawmaker Oliver Letwin’s amendment, which seeks to change the rules of parliament on March 27 to provide time for lawmakers to debate and vote on different Brexit options.

Parliament Speaker John Bercow will announce at about 1700 GMT whether he has selected any amendments to be voted on.

The EU believes a ‘no-deal’ Brexit is increasingly likely.

“We don’t want a no-deal Brexit, we’d much rather have the Withdrawal Agreement, but if it is to be a no deal, let’s do it quickly,” an EU official said.

“NATIONAL EMBARRASSMENT”

Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said May’s approach to Brexit had become “a national embarrassment” that risked causing a no-deal Brexit.

Earlier, May’s divided cabinet of senior ministers met to discuss a way forward. Some reports said ministers had “war-gamed” a parliamentary election.

One way to counter parliament would be for May to try to offer her own version of so-called indicative votes. The prospect of a softer Brexit would also increase pressure on the Brexit-supporting lawmakers in her party to get behind her deal.

To get her deal passed, she must win over at least 75 MPs who voted against her on March 12 - dozens of rebels in her Conservative Party, some opposition Labour Party MPs and the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which props up her minority government but has voted against the deal so far.

May had a call with DUP leader Arlene Foster after the cabinet meeting on Monday morning, but a DUP spokesman said he did not see the party supporting the deal in a third vote.

The DUP’s deputy leader Nigel Dodds said May should have been prepared for a ‘no-deal’ departure.

“The prime minister has known for some considerable time ... that March 29 was the target date,” he said. “Why do we need another two weeks? What’s going to happen in another two weeks that couldn’t have happened up to now?”

Billed as a “new national, social, industrial, and economic mobilization on a scale not seen since World War II”, it is perhaps unsurprising that critics have focused on the price tag.

In response, many Green New Deal proponents cite the ideas of Modern Monetary Theory (‘MMT’). Although MMT has been quietly growing in prominence for many years, the school of thought’s association with the Green New Deal has propelled it into the limelight.

MMT holds that ‘money is a creature of the state’, and that a sovereign government with its own currency and central bank faces no financial constraints on spending. Other limits do exist – most notably inflation, but also political and administrative constraints – but money itself is no object.

MMT scholars contend that the Green New Deal is a perfect opportunity to mobilise underused resources through deficit spending, simultaneously transforming the economy and improving living standards. They pour scorn on those who argue that ‘we can’t afford’ a green transition. As Robert Hockett, a professor at Cornell University, has argued: “where were the ‘pay-fors’ for Bush’s $5 trillion wars and tax cuts, or for last year’s $2 trillion tax giveaway to billionaires?”

MMT also recognises the links between climate change and inequality, and suggests that a smarter approach to public spending can combat both. In particular, a ‘job guarantee’, whereby the public sector will employ anyone willing and able to work at a fixed wage, alleviating unemployment and insecure work, is associated with several prominent MMT thinkers.

In Britain, the Labour Party is developing its own plan for a green transition. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the Shadow Minister for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy, recently announced an “unprecedented call for evidence” on how a surge in green investment could help local communities and economies. In recent months Labour has come under increasing pressure to embrace MMT thinking.

But while MMT offers an empowering narrative, its insights must be accompanied by some pragmatism. A successful green transition will require much more than increased government spending, and there is no escaping hard choices.

Towards a new political economy

In order to succeed, any Green New Deal must be rooted in good governance. But there is currently a gap, in political economy terms, between the idea that the state can centrally fund the green transition, and an emerging consensus that viable, sustainable societies of the future will be characterised by a broad distribution of power and resources. The task of commandeering the fiscal power of the nation-state while also responding to local needs gives rise to a number of practical challenges.

One of these relates to taxation. From an MMT perspective, tax ‘destroys’ money by taking it out of the economy. Changes to taxation levels are thus the preferred policy lever with which to manage demand and control inflation. However, taxation also serves many other purposes, which it would be naïve to think will always align neatly with controlling inflation. Richard Murphy, a member of the original British Green New Deal Group and one of the main UK-based proponents of MMT, describes several functions for tax, including penalising ‘bads’, redistributing income and wealth, and improving democratic representation.

In practice, policymakers may find it difficult to harmonise these different functions of taxation while also funding a just and sustainable transition. For example, a high and consistent carbon price will likely be needed to disincentivize polluting activity, even while the state undertakes a vast public works programme to build alternative energy systems. Taxation of dirty vehicles will be required to incentivise people to switch to electric. Consumption taxes will need to be carefully calibrated to reduce our over-use of resources without popping the consumer credit bubble our economy currently relies on.

Careful institutional design will be required to ensure that these trade-offs are managed, while inflation is controlled. This is just as important as MMT’s central observation that the state can always pay its debts, but thinking around these institutional questions is far less developed.

Secondly, there is the issue of how MMT might work with theories of democracy and ownership, an area of particular interest to the Labour leadership. Several different concepts of the role of the state have been discussed in the context of the sustainable transition. Writing in the New Statesman, the journalist Paul Mason has argued that “for a post-capitalist economy to take off, it has to work as spontaneously as the market does.” This requires the state to be an “enabler and rule-setter for a diverse ecosystem”. But for the transition itself – especially if driven by MMT-style fiscal policy – the state will need to take on a more commanding role, which Mason forebodingly terms ‘capitalist Stalinism’. These are radically different modes of governance, and striking a balance or transitioning between them will pose major challenges for our democratic system. Those advocating an activist role for central government must be candid about its limitations, and could seek lessons from distributed energy and participatory budgeting.

Thirdly, a Green New Deal is often presented as an exercise in coalition building, with the state sitting at the centre. The Ocasio-Cortez resolution calls for “transparent and inclusive consultation, collaboration, and partnership with frontline and vulnerable communities, labor unions, worker cooperatives, civil society groups, academia, and businesses.” Careful thought must be given as to how these seemingly diverse priorities and interests can be balanced. Building a coalition involves compromises, and the experience of other European countries is instructive. In France the gilets jaunes, are a recent example of what can happen when climate policy is badly designed, having first mobilised in order to protest new fuel duties. It is at least conceivable that a similar backlash could make it politically difficult for a government trying to implement a Green New Deal to raise taxes to control inflation.

Germany has had greater success with its renewable policies, for instance by allowing households to profit by selling excess energy back to the grid. Nevertheless, it has unfortunately struggled to uproot the last vestiges of coal power from its energy network. Today German coal jobs are relatively few, but their existence is inconsistent with achieving Paris-consistent decarbonisation. Crucially, however, they are well unionised – a fact that highlights how the interests of trade unions and the sustainable transition are not perfectly aligned.

It also remains unclear how exactly a federal job guarantee can be reconciled with empowering local communities. If central government guarantees a job for a newly unemployed coal plant worker, might that worker be forced to move to a region or locality where there is spare capacity in, say, retrofitting other people’s homes? Does the final say over how real resources are allocated (as opposed to financial resources) rest with Washington (or Whitehall), with local authorities, or with worker-owned local businesses? And how might the scheme as a whole respond to a reduced working week?

Finally, the rediscovery of the state’s spending power does not mean green campaigners can forget about private investment. Hyman Minsky, whom many MMT scholars cite as a key influence, went to great lengths to emphasise the importance of private finance. Writers like Robert Hockett uphold that legacy today, but this is often lost in tit for tat debates about public debt. Although many activists highlight the role that private finance plays in carbon capitalism, often the contribution it must make to turbo-charging a green transition is overlooked.

Globally, the task of greening private finance lies with the Taskforce for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. Central banks and financial regulators are currently mulling proposals to ask firms to release information about the risks they face from climate change. More and better information should help markets allocate investment more efficiently. A Green New Deal platform would be more credible, and more likely to succeed, with a plan to map and leverage the power of private investment flows. In the UK, the Labour Party could state its intention to make disclosure of climate-related risk mandatory for all reasonably sized firms at a particular date in the near future.

However, central banks are rightly cautious over the financial risks posed by both sides of the climate investment dilemma. While carbon-intensive ‘stranded assets’ could result in large financial and economic shocks, rapidly increasing green investment produces risk in the form of unproven technologies and business models. An MMT-inspired plan to bring the Federal Reserve or Bank of England under direct government control will merely shift responsibility for this delicate balancing act.

Overall, current plans for a Green New Deal leave many questions unanswered, even when we acknowledge that financing is no barrier. Critics are queuing up to dismiss the Deal as a ‘utopian’ idea that doesn't address real world trade-offs.

It’s up to us to prove them wrong.","Of course we can pay for a Green New Deal, but we can’t escape hard choices",openDemocracy,https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/of-course-we-can-pay-for-a-green-new-deal-but-we-cant-escape-hard-choices/

In Ottawa, that question dominates the conversation, from cocktail parties to cab rides. It started after Philpott’s extraordinary sortie in Maclean’s, where she said that “there’s much more to the story that needs to be told.”

WATCH: Philpott says there’s “much more” to the SNC-Lavalin affair

It reached a boiling point when Wilson-Raybould promised to provide “copies of text messages and emails” to the justice committee that would “further clarify statements I made and elucidate the accuracy and nature of statements by witnesses in testimony that came after my committee appearance.”

What’s next, people are asking, a tell-all on The National?

READ MORE: Opposition wants Wilson-Raybould, Philpott to speak out on SNC-Lavalin in House of Commons

It’s almost as though the two women are daring Trudeau to expel them, daring him to repudiate his status as a champion of feminism, Indigenous rights and doing politics differently. It’s as if they’re daring him to act like any other leader — Stephen Harper, Jean Chretien or his own father, the late Pierre Trudeau — would have done and assert his authority over wayward MPs.

It’s not like Trudeau hasn’t done that before. In 2014, he took a number of decisive actions. In November of that year, when Liberal MPs Massimo Pacetti and Scott Andrews were accused of sexual misconduct by two NDP MPs, Trudeau expelled them from caucus without hesitation — or any semblance of due process.

In May, Trudeau issued a fatwa against any MP or aspiring candidate who didn’t support abortion rights by denying them the opportunity to run for the party.

And in January, Trudeau expelled 32 members of the Senate from the Liberal caucus — for no other reason than that they were Liberals, and he wanted to take a stand in light of the Senate expenses scandal. Taken together, these acts burnished his feminist credentials, bolstered his “doing things differently” mantra and cast him as decisive to boot.

READ MORE: Trudeau insists he was trying to protect SNC-Lavalin jobs — even as its CEO says he didn’t raise them

So why hesitate now? What is it that Trudeau fears? What do Wilson-Raybould and Philpott know — or could they say — if he cast them out of caucus? Speculation runs rampant, but some scenarios appear more plausible than others. The main one is that SNC-Lavalin wasn’t the starting point for the women’s discontent but only a convenient tipping point. The theory is that other issues — the government’s failure to settle Indigenous land claims, the lack of material advancement on First Nations issues — are really what made them mad. They may have concluded that Trudeau’s embrace of these causes was a fraud, mere virtue-signalling for votes, and they weren’t going to take it anymore.

(It is interesting to note that a spokesperson for new Attorney General David Lametti just confirmed that Wilson-Raybould’s directives on First Nations litigation will be respected — 20 guidelines that profoundly change the way the Crown will prosecute indigenous lawsuits, and which encourage settlement out of court).

Whatever their rationale, it now appears that Wilson-Raybould and Philpott are mounting a full-blown coup. The longer Trudeau waits to crush it, the weaker he appears. The flurry of MPs and ministers rushing to his defence only further diminishes his stature; what kind of PM needs to be saved by his own people? Shouldn’t it be the other way around?

But not everyone is on Team Trudeau. In the Tyee, Martyn Brown, former aide to B.C. Liberal premier Gordon Campbell, opined that the “fear of losing Trudeau needs to be flipped on its head if left-leaning progressives want to minimize the chances of a Scheer victory this fall. The Liberals can now only hope to regain the moral high ground that is so vital for securing the values they purport to represent by replacing their leader.”

The only other option to avoid tossing Wilson-Raybould and Philpott would be for Trudeau to call a snap election. But with the federal Tories high in the polls and having just called a byelection for Nanaimo for May 6, it appears Trudeau has taken that option off the table. An early election in late June or July might still be possible, but that would still require Trudeau to act now to staunch the bleeding.

Everything else the Liberals have tried — replacing the clerk of the Privy Council, appointing Anne MacLellan to recommend changes to party governance, putting a big-spending budget in the window — has failed to change the channel, because the PM’s own MPs keep stabbing him in the back. Unless he wants this election to become a referendum on his leadership or his own party to turn against him, Trudeau needs to cut the Gordian knot — and kick them out.

Trudeau told reporters on Monday that he last spoke with her the Monday prior and that it was ""a very cordial conversation,"" but did not elaborate further on the details of that interaction.

Wilson-Raybould has made serious allegations that have continued to rock Parliament Hill and damage the Liberal government of which she is still a member. During an hours-long appearance before the House Justice Committee on Feb. 27, she claimed that when she was attorney general, she faced a months-long ""sustained effort"" from senior officials to politically interfere in the criminal prosecution of Quebec construction firm SNC-Lavalin. Trudeau's government has been hit by a series of high-profile resignations and a steady stream of new information coming to light through committee testimony, and in the press.

Within last Monday alone:

Trudeau shuffled his cabinet for the third time in as many weeks to fill a sole vacancy created by Jane Philpott, who resigned citing a loss of confidence in the government’s handling of the affair;

Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, who was named by Wilson-Raybould in her testimony, announced his intention to retire before the federal election; and

Trudeau appointed former Liberal minister Anne McLellan to examine some of the machinery of government issues that have been brought into the spotlight through the SNC-Lavalin controversy.

Wilson-Raybould kept a low profile last week, before writing a letter that became public on Friday, saying that she'd soon be providing additional evidence like text messages and emails, as well as a written statement to the House Justice Committee, despite it having shut down its examination. After hearing a contradicting story from a former top Trudeau adviser, and repeat appearances from senior bureaucrats, the Liberal MPs on the House Justice Committee put an end to the probe on federal budget day, saying that they’d studied it long enough and heard all they needed to on the matter.

Both Wilson-Raybould and Philpott have indicated their intent to remain Liberal members of Parliament. Trudeau said Monday he looks forward to ""continuing to engage"" with both of them, ""as they make their way forward.""

""I look forward to continuing to have their strong and thoughtful voices as part of our team,"" Trudeau said.

Ethics study 'must' go ahead: Scheer

Meanwhile in Ottawa, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer restated his calls for Trudeau to allow further study of the controversy to occur, and to allow its key players to testify without restrictions.

Scheer — speaking from the foyer of the Commons despite the House not sitting this week — said now is the time for Trudeau to ""once and for all to end the cover up, and it's an opportunity he must seize.""

He wants Trudeau to fully waive any cabinet confidences for Wilson-Raybould and Philpott to be able to speak to ""all events"" related to the controversy and to allow a secondary House committee study to proceed.

On Tuesday, the House Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics Committee is scheduled to meet to discuss the prospect of launching a new study into the scandal. There, the opposition will be advancing a motion seeking approval to study the matter, and to call Wilson-Raybould and Philpott to testify. The government routinely insists that House committees are independent masters of their own destiny, in response to any allegations of the contrary. The previous Conservative government also faced accusations that the PMO had its hands in the goings-on at House committees.

The meeting was set to happen last week but was cancelled after the Conservative-prompted overnight voting marathon that completely consumed parliamentary business during the 30 hours it lasted.

Philpott was added to the opposition’s requested list of witnesses came after she told Maclean’s magazine that that there is ""much more to the story that needs to be told,"" but stopped short of saying what exactly that ""more"" is, citing fear over breaching cabinet confidence.

Scheer said this second study needs to be given the green-light by the Liberal MPs who hold the majority on the committee, especially since so many of their colleagues have come out in the last few days to argue that the pair should, and can air any outstanding information they want to share in the SNC-Lavalin controversy. Though, these call from Liberal MPs and ministers have specifically pointed to the House of Commons as they place to do this, because they’d have the protection of parliamentary privilege.

In February, Trudeau issued an unprecedented waiver in which he relinquished solicitor-client privileges and cabinet confidences so that Wilson-Raybould and anyone who participated in discussions with her could ""address relevant matters,"" in relation to the SNC-Lavalin file. He continues to insist this waiver is satisfactory to allow Wilson-Raybould and others to speak “entirely and completely,” despite her and Philpott stating otherwise.

""Trudeau has said publicly that he wants them to speak and that there's nothing stopping them from speaking, so we’re calling on him to make it official,"" Scheer said. ""If they really want us to believe that they want the truth to come out, if Justin Trudeau truly nothing to hide, then he'll make it official. He will send a letter to Ms.Wilson-Raybould and now Ms. Philpott allowing them to complete their testimony, to speak freely and openly,"" Scheer said.","Trudeau says he spoke with Wilson-Raybould last week, amid ongoing SNC-Lavalin furor",CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/trudeau-says-he-spoke-with-wilson-raybould-last-week-amid-ongoing-snc-lavalin-furor-1.4350820

A year before cabinet discussions about plea deal for Quebec engineering company SNC-Lavalin, Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould disagreed about her recommendation of Manitoba Justice Glenn D. Joyal, sources familiar with the matter tell CTV News.

Trudeau was concerned that Joyal wasn’t committed to protecting rights that have flown out of interpretation of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, particularly LGBTQ2 rights and even abortion access, neither of which are specifically enshrined in the Charter.

Wilson-Raybould not only wanted Joyal named to the court to fill the vacancy left by Justice Beverley McLachlin’s resignation, she believed Joyal should replace McLachlin as the top court’s chief justice, a position that caused Trudeau to question his justice minister’s judgment, the sources said.

Trudeau ultimately quashed Wilson-Raybould’s recommendation. Alberta judge Sheilah Martin was named to court in November 2017 and Justice Richard Wagner became chief justice.

The disagreement over the appointment casts new light on the erosion of the relationship between Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould that culminated her move out of the Justice portfolio and appointment as Veterans Affairs minister earlier this year.

Wilson-Raybould, who later resigned from cabinet, has claimed she was subject to inappropriate political pressure from senior members of the government to grant SNC-Lavalin a remediation agreement to avoid criminal prosecution on corruption charges.

Wilson-Raybould denied to CTV News that there was any conflict over the Supreme Court appointment and said that the selection of a new Supreme Court judge is ultimately a decision for the prime minister.

“In this process there are typically CONFIDENTIAL conversations and communications -- back and forths between the PM and the AG on potential candidates for appointment,” she said in a email.

“I do however find it extremely worrisome why you are even asking such questions and where you received any such information. Commentary / reporting in this regard with respect to a SCC appointment(s) could compromise the integrity of the appointments process and potentially sitting Justices.”

Joyal is a former provincial Crown attorney who in 2011 was appointed to the position of Chief Justice of the Manitoba Court of the Queen’s Bench by Stephen Harper’s Conservative government.

The Prime Minister’s Office was concerned about views Joyal expressed in a speech to the Canadian Constitution Foundation’s Law and Freedom Conference in the January 2017, in which he discussed about the way courts were interpreting the Charter, ushered in by Trudeau’s father.

“It may be one of the bitter ironies of Pierre Elliott Trudeau’s Nation Building strategy of the 1980s, that despite the celebration and promotion of the Charter, it has led to an institutional imbalance that dilutes a source of Canadian distinctiveness,” he said in the speech.

Joyal argued for a rebalancing the relationship between the courts and legislative branch.

“I would hope and have every reason to believe, that this would signal the beginning of a true dialogue with the courts, where the resulting policies would, I suspect, reflect a traditionally pragmatic and uniquely Canadian mix of liberal and non-liberal values.”

His speech raised concerns that Joyal, if appointed, would be less willing to protect rights that are based on a broader interpretation of the Charter.

Joyal’s elevation to the chief justice of the Supreme Court would have been unusual, as the position is typically filled from current members of the court.

Joyal did not respond to a request for comment.

In its budget last week, the government introduced measures that would allow Ottawa to pick up a portion of new homebuyers’ mortgage costs and it increased the amount they can borrow from their retirement savings for a down payment.

Housing has emerged as a major issue for many Canadians, especially young people who are trying to get into the real-estate market at a time when prices are soaring in some major cities.

During a visit today to Maple Ridge, B.C., Trudeau said the budget contains measures to help first-time buyers by allowing them to withdraw $35,000 from their RRSPs, up from $25,000, to help lower their borrowing costs.

It also brings in a means-tested incentive that would see the government pick up part of the costs of the mortgages of those eligible for the program to lower their monthly payments.

Trudeau said housing is also a concern for parents who are worried their adult children won’t be able to live in the neighbourhoods where they grew up.

“Owning a house is a big achievement. It’s where you raise a family and set down roots. But far too many young people are worried that they won’t be able to reach that dream. Housing prices in the Lower Mainland are some of the highest in the country and rising.”

Trudeau said the government has also tried to spur new building and keep prices from rising through its national housing strategy to help increase supply.

“We just can’t treat the symptoms of sky-high housing prices,” he added. “We have to deal with the causes as well. When there aren’t enough properties on the market, more people are competing for the same places, which forces the costs up for buyers and renters.”

Last Tuesday’s budget also included $10 billion more for a program to fund the construction of new rental units _ the third time the Liberals have expanded the program, which aims to create 14,000 units over 10 years and now carries a $50-billion price tag.

As well, Trudeau said Ottawa is helping the Canada Revenue Agency go after tax fraud and money laundering, which have also been blamed for driving up housing prices in British Columbia.",Trudeau sells housing plan in visit to hot real estate market in B.C.,CHEK News,https://www.cheknews.ca/trudeau-sells-housing-plan-in-visit-to-hot-real-estate-market-in-b-c-3-546319/

The compromise was intended to maintain a balance between the judiciary and the legislative branch of government, with provisions allowing governments to limit or override rights altogether in some circumstances.Since then, judicial interpretation of the charter has ignored the intentions of the drafters and ""led without question to a level of judicial potency that was not anticipated back in 1982,"" Joyal said in the speech, a video of which is available on the foundation's website. That, in turn, has resulted in a ""less potent and less influential legislative branch that seldom has the final word.""

Trudeau is fending off what appears to be a coup attempt from a couple of members of his own caucus. We have several examples of leadership crisis to draw from B.C. political history and they are scattered over the past 30 years or so.

article continues below

And the prime minister can take heart in the fact that various B.C. leadership “crises” show that if a leader doesn’t want to step down it can be difficult and take a long time for a caucus to force a change at the top.

Take former premier Bill Vander Zalm, who endured almost three years of internal turmoil as calls for his resignation mounted almost daily. Some caucus members were actively scheming to dump him, but it took a formal finding of a conflict-of-interest against him to force him to step down.

Then there is an example of a leader who probably could have stuck things out but instead threw in the towel early on. That would be former NDP premier Mike Harcourt, whose government was engulfed by the so-called Bingogate scandal.

Harcourt knew someone in the party had to pay the ultimate price for the scandal, and when no party officials stepped forward, he decided to fall on his own sword. He could have survived the scandal, but he opted to avoid what was going to be a bruising recovery.

His successor, Glen Clark, knew he was politically dead the minute RCMP officers showed up at his house (with a television news crew in tow) but instead of resigning immediately, he opted to stick it out almost six months before quitting.

Early in his first term B.C. Liberal leader Gordon Campbell was hit with an impaired driving charge, and to many it looked like his career was over. But he persevered in the face of massive criticism and won two more elections (he finally resigned when it looked like his caucus was going to revolt over the HST debacle).

Leadership duels can befall Opposition parties as well. That is what happened to NDP leader Carole James in 2011, when 13 of her caucus members announced they could not support her leadership. James wanted to hang on and boot the dissidents from caucus, but realized she was now captaining a sinking ship and reluctantly quit as leader.

Campbell’s successor, Christy Clark, had a full-blown caucus rebellion on her hands in the run-up to the 2013 election. Some MLAs were openly mocking her and agitating for her departure. But she stared her detractors down, and unexpectedly won the election.

Trudeau has six months before he enters the election campaign. So far, two ministers have quit on him and effectively challenged his honor.

One of them – Jane Philpott – dropped a lengthy resignation letter that questioned the integrity of the government. Bizarrely, both her and former justice minister and attorney-general Jody Wilson-Reybould continue to sit in the government caucus.

Every day the Opposition parties are using the SNC-Lavalin affair to batter the Liberal government. Trudeau has not helped matters much through his fairly inept and inconsistent communications strategy (assuming there is an actual “strategy” in play).

At some point, more damaging information may surface, which will give this story the proverbial “legs” to keep the issue front and center. On the other hand, perhaps the air is seeping out the balloon, and the dial will eventually turn to a different channel.

However, history show unless a lot more caucus members join those two ex-ministers (or the police get involved in the SNC-Lavalin affair) in their apparent challenge of his leadership, Trudeau will lead his party into the October election.

With the federal election drawing so close, there is not enough time to change leaders and there is no apparent successor. Even slumping poll numbers will not be enough to push Trudeau out, or convince him to step aside.

He need only look to B.C.’s rich trove of leadership controversies to provide him with examples of when to hang on, and when to walk away.

At a press conference this morning, Scheer demanded that the standing committee on access to information, privacy and ethics agree to hold a study of the SNC-Lavalin affair. The standing committee on justice and human rights ended a study of the matter last week, prompting accusations by opposition members of a Liberal coverup.

Conservative members will put forward a motion at tomorrow’s committee meeting, which will ask Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to waive all constraints currently preventing Wilson-Raybould from speaking fully.

In recent days, there has been public debate over whether Wilson-Raybould can speak freely without penalty in the House of Commons under parliamentary privilege or if another waiver from Trudeau is needed.

Scheer said the concern about parliamentary immunity is it doesn’t “absolve” the former ministers from the oaths they had taken, referring to the cabinet pledge to the Privy Council Office to “keep secret all matters committed and revealed to me in this capacity, or that shall be secretly treated of in Council.”

“That is what Justin Trudeau waived for Ms. Wilson-Raybould but only for a narrow period of time,” Scheer said, adding that Wilson-Raybould and Philpott should be allowed to speak about events occurring after the former justice minister resigned from cabinet on Feb. 12.

“Clearly there were events that happened after her time as attorney general.”

Last month, Trudeau waived solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidences about the SNC-Lavalin affair, but the order-in-council only applies to Wilson-Raybould’s time as attorney general and excludes discussions between her and the director of public prosecutions.

Asked about the potential repercussions of Wilson-Raybould speaking in the House, Scheer said there are “clearly consequences to people’s reputations when they’ve taken oaths.”

“We’re saying don’t put them in that position if you’ve really got nothing to hide,” he said.

Scheer added that after a number of Liberal MPs recently said Wilson-Raybould and Philpott should speak their mind in order to settle the affair, there is now “consensus” on both sides of the House that both former ministers should be able to speak freely.

The committee motion will also ask Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board President Jane Philpott to testify before April 5 and to allow the committee to table its findings in Parliament. Philpott resigned from cabinet on March 4 over the Liberal government’s handling of the SNC-Lavalin controversy.

There are nine voting members of the ethics committee, including six Liberals, two Conservatives, and one NDP. The chair, Conservative MP Bob Zimmer, does not have a vote.

The SNC-Lavalin controversy began on Feb. 7 when the Globe and Mail reported allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office inappropriately pressured Wilson-Raybould to reverse a decision made by the director of public prosecutions to move forward with a criminal case involving the Montreal-based engineering giant.

Since then, Trudeau’s principal secretary Gerry Butts, Wilson-Raybould, and Philpott have resigned from their jobs. Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick has also announced his retirement.

Heckling from Conservatives over the SNC-Lavalin affair during budget day has not done Opposition leader Andrew Scheer any favours, according to a former Liberal strategist.

""Part of the Opposition's job is to oppose, of course, but the other job is to present themselves as a government-in-waiting — that was not a government-in-waiting,"" said John Duffy, who was an adviser to former prime minister Paul Martin, and is the founder of StrategyCorp.

As Finance Minister Bill Morneau delivered his budget speech Tuesday, the beginning of his speech was drowned out by noise from the benches opposite, in protest at the Liberal-majority justice committee shutting down an investigation into the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Duffy told The Current's Anna Maria Tremonti that the Liberals ""were pretty realistic about what the Opposition was likely to do yesterday.""

""What we didn't expect was the spectacle. The pounding, the stamping, the hooting and hollering … really looking like a tantrum from a daycare centre.""

""I don't think Mr. Scheer did himself any favours in that.""

Speaking after the budget was delivered, Scheer said that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was using the budget to distract from the SNC-Lavalin affair, and accusations that former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould faced pressure to intervene in the criminal case against the company.

""Mr. Trudeau's plan is obvious. Massive deficits to distract Canadians from his corruption before the election. Massive tax hikes to pay for them after the election,"" he said.

He added that Canadians ""demand answers on the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal and Conservatives will do everything we can to get them.""

Angela Wright, a freelance political writer and Conservative strategist, said she understands ""where the frustration comes from"" for the Conservatives.

""Of course the government wants to talk about the budget, but they have to know that the Conservatives still want to talk about SNC-Lavalin,"" she told Tremonti.

However, despite their frustrations, they should recognize the importance of the budget, she said.

""If the government wants to deliver the budget, then Canadians should at least be able to hear what the finance minister has to say.""

""Then they can come out and continue to remind Canadians about SNC-Lavalin and the fact they're not going to let the issue go away.""

In his remarks to the Manning Centre networking conference on Saturday, Scheer said he ""unequivocally"" condemns hateful ideologies.

""The criticisms are completely baseless.""

Those criticisms have been plentiful in the past few weeks.

Says he misheard conspiracy question

Scheer has come under fire for speaking at the recent United We Roll rally on Parliament Hill, which had picked up participants who were making racist and anti-immigrant comments. The Prime Minister's Office also condemned Scheer for ""sharing a stage"" with Faith Goldy, a commentator who was let go from her job at Rebel Media after appearing on a podcast affiliated with the neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer.

Scheer was also chastised for not shutting down a question at a recent town hall about a widely debunked conspiracy theory connecting former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to a child sex ring.

In that particular instance, Scheer insisted he hadn't heard the question properly.

Whether racism or disinformation, Scheer says he and the Conservatives oppose such rhetoric.

""People know that the Conservative Party is open and welcoming,"" he said.

""We denounce any elements of society that would promote hate speech.""

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer says he didn't hear a portion of a question about the Clinton Foundation mentioning ""pizzagate."" 1:05

'Cheap political points'

His comments at the Manning Conference were the first time he's fully addressed the accusations against him, though he's taken questions on the matters at news events in the past few weeks.

Scheer was also heavily criticized for tweeting out his condolences to the victims of the New Zealand mosque attacks without mentioning the words 'Muslim' or 'mosque'.

In another statement later that day, Scheer did use both.

On Saturday, he accused the Liberals of targeting his post to ""score cheap political points in a disgusting manner,"" adding that Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale and Gov. Gen. Julie Payette released statements omitting both terms as well.

The Tory leader said it's important to speak out against those who put one group of people over another.

SNC-Lavalin still top of mind for the Tories

Scheer turned to the SNC-Lavalin affair as well, calling on Canadians to put pressure on Trudeau to allow all sides of the story to be heard.

The Liberal majority on the justice committee shut down an investigation into the matter, and now the ethics committee will begin its own.

Former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott are free to speak, the prime minister has said, but so far neither of them have taken that full opportunity.

Scheer said the crux of his issue with the conduct of top government officials is that politicians should not involve themselves in deciding what legal tools are available in prosecutions.

In what was clearly a speech with an eye toward the upcoming election, Scheer told the audience that being an Opposition leader isn't always easy, because you're not as high-profile as the prime minister.

However, now that the SNC-Lavalin affair is casting doubt onto Trudeau's character, it's easier for people to see ""the real Andrew Scheer,"" he said.

Scheer also shredded the new federal Liberal budget, calling it a multi-billion dollar attempt to distract from the ethical questions about the government.","'The criticisms are completely baseless,' Scheer says of claims he's too soft on hate groups",CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/scheer-pizzagate-united-we-roll-new-zealand-extremism-1.5069197

The Associated Press

Andrew Scheer says criticism over his initial failure to mention that Muslims were targeted in the recent mass murder in New Zealand is “completely baseless” and driven by “disgusting” Liberal efforts to score political points from the tragedy.

But in answering a question Saturday about how he deals with that criticism, the federal Conservative leader once again initially made no reference to Muslims.

“I deal with it by pointing out that the criticisms are completely baseless,” Scheer told the Manning Networking Conference, an annual gathering of this country’s conservative thinkers, strategists and politicians.

“When you look at statements I’ve made condemning hateful ideologies, those who would promote any type of superiority of one race or religion over the others, I condemn that unequivocally.”

Scheer noted that the second statement he issued on the day of the New Zealand shootings “absolutely did include the reference to the faith community that was attacked,” although he did not at first identify that faith community.

On March 15, an avowed white supremacist shot and killed 50 Muslim worshippers at two New Zealand mosques. In a statement posted that day on Twitter, Scheer condemned the attacks as “a despicable act of evil” against “peaceful worshippers,” without specifically mentioning where they occurred or who was targeted.

A few hours later – after the initial statement drew criticism even from top aides of former prime minister Stephen Harper – Scheer issued a second statement, which he referred to Saturday as his “official statement.” It specifically referred to the horrific “terror attack on two New Zealand mosques” and voiced his “profound condemnation of this cowardly and hateful attack on the Muslim community.”

On Saturday, Scheer blamed the Liberals for stirring up the controversy, accusing them of attempting “to score cheap political points in a very disgusting manner.” Moreover, he argued that initial tweets by Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale and Governor General Julie Payette also didn’t specifically mention mosques or Muslims.

Later, as he took questions from members of the audience, Scheer was asked why he’s never said the word “Islamophobia.”

“I don’t believe that’s true,” he responded, noting that all parties supported a motion last week in the House of Commons. That motion, which he didn’t describe, condemned the mosque attacks and affirmed the need to “confront hatred, Islamophobia, and white supremacy, in all their forms.”

“I reject anyone who would speak out based on Islamophobic principles, whether or not that’s somebody who is trying to lump all people of the Muslim faith in together or whether it’s people who are trying to antagonize elements of society to have a more negative reaction to those who practice that faith,” Scheer added.

“To me the important thing is to speak out against those who in any way give oxygen or space to those who are trying to promote one group of people over the other.”

Scheer also used his appearance at the Manning conference to promise that a Conservative government would balance the federal budget — but he didn’t say when.

He said the Liberals have made such increases to government spending that a Conservative government could get most of the way to balance simply by holding annual spending increases to the rate of inflation and population growth. As well, he said billions could be saved by scrapping “some big-ticket items” introduced by the Liberals such as the federal infrastructure bank.

The longer Prime Minister Justin Trudeau goes racking up large annual deficits, the harder it will be return to balance, Scheer suggested. But he said Canadians have “a window” in this fall’s federal election to “limit the damage and get back to balanced budgets over a shorter period of time.”

Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s latest budget forecasts deficits of almost $20 billion in each of the next two years, declining to just under $10 billion in five years.

Scheer, in conversation with Global News’ Mercedes’ Stephenson, was seemingly referring to comments made by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau several years ago, suggesting that China’s authoritarian political system had contributed to their economic success.

“There’s a level of admiration I actually have for China, because their basic dictatorship is allowing them to actually turn their economy around on a dime and say, ‘We need to go green … we need to start investing in solar,” Trudeau said at a women’s event in 2013.

Trudeau received criticism for his comments at the time and later took to Twitter to offer clarification.

“I pointed out that globally, Canada is up against big countries (China, for one) that can address some major issues quickly,” he wrote on Twitter at the time. “It’s ridiculous for anyone to suggest that I of all people would trade our rights and freedoms for any other system of [government].”

Scheer went on to comment on the recent decision by the Chinese government to stop accepting shipments of Canadian canola oil. Earlier this month, China started blocking canola imports from Canada, citing the detection of “hazardous organisms.” International Trade Minister Jim Carr, however, denied this claim, as Global News previously reported.

The canola dispute comes shortly after comes Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Vancouver on behalf of the U.S.

WATCH: Deferred prosecution is ‘not the issue’ with SNC-Lavalin controversy: Scheer

Tensions between Canada and China have increased since she was arrested, as two Canadians in China were arrested and remain detained on espionage charges. The international community has called for their release.

Scheer blames the emerging trade obstacles on Trudeau’s handling of Chinese relations.

“Farmers in this situation are paying for the mistakes that Justin Trudeau has made,” he said.

READ MORE: China has stopped all canola imports from Canada, industry group says

Trudeau pledged near the end of 2018 that Canada was looking to broaden trade opportunities with China, potentially leading to an eventual free trade agreement between the two countries.

Scheer, however, suggested during his conversation with Stephenson that a free trade deal may be premature, given the robustness of China’s economy when compared to Canada’s.

The opposition leader also touched on several top-of-mind topics for Canadians.

Scheer also suggested that the SNC-Lavalin scandal currently plaguing the Liberals is only contributing to tensions with China.

“We have a very tense situation with the CFO of Huawei being with the extradition process, and our responsibility as a government, as a Canadian government, has been [that] we don’t interfere in the rule of law, we don’t interfere in criminal court cases, we respect the independence of our judiciary. That was the message to China,” he said.

“A couple weeks later, there’s Justin Trudeau interfering in a criminal court case, putting pressure on the attorney general to get a better outcome for his well-connected friends. That, I believe, is a big part of why this situation with China is further deteriorating,” he continued.

WATCH: Andrew Scheer says SNC-Lavalin impacting relations with China

He encouraged Canadians to “put pressure” on Justin Trudeau to cooperate with the ethics’ committee investigation into the SNC-Lavalin affair, which gets underway next week.

“What we know for sure is that there is more to be said,” Scheer told the crowd. “Right now, [Trudeau] is engaged in a cover-up the likes of which we’ve never seen. He’s used a CAD$40 billion budget to distract us from it, making it the most expensive cover up in the history of cover ups.”

Since the story broke in early February, Trudeau and several close advisers have been facing accusations of pressuring the then-attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, to grant a remediation agreement to the embattled engineering firm SNC-Lavalin amid charges of fraud and corruption.

Trudeau countered Wilson-Raybould’s account of their conversations, saying that he and his advisers simply hoped to confer with her about her decision rather than apply pressure. Opposition members, including Scheer, have been consistent in calling for the prime minister to resign.

Both Scheer and Trudeau are ramping up their public appearances as they kick off an election year. Recent polls suggest that amid the SNC-Lavalin affair, Scheer’s Conservatives are beginning to gain headway on the Liberal leader’s largely bruised popularity.

""To me the important thing is to speak out against those who would in any way give oxygen or space to those who are trying to promote one group of people over the other,"" he said.

Scheer was criticized this week for failing to do just that.



The president of the Canadian Labour Congress, Hassan Yussuff, told reporters Thursday that Scheer should be held responsible for failing to condemn yellow-vest protesters who showed up in Ottawa in February to demonstrate against pipeline delays while spewing anti-immigrant rhetoric.

""For the leader of the Opposition not able to condemn them ... and stand on a stage with someone who is associated with hate and racism and somehow to not acknowledge that? ... That is a fundamental, I think, failing on his part, and I condemn his behaviour,"" Yussuff said at an event outlining efforts by the union movement to combat Islamophobia and the steady rise in hate crimes targeting Muslims.

""I don't think he should be excused for it, because he should know better, and if he doesn't, something is fundamentally wrong with his leadership, in my view,"" Hassan said.

Scheer spoke to the crowd of protesters, many of whom had lost their jobs in the energy sector and driven from Alberta and Scheer's home province of Saskatchewan to make their point to the government. The protesters also heard from Faith Goldy, the social media personality with white nationalist ties.

Ihsaan Gardee, the executive director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims, said he was concerned that not calling out behaviour against Muslims would give licence to others to act on their hatred and their ideologies.

""We are looking to our leaders for leadership, and being naively ignorant or wilfully blind, neither is acceptable and Canadians should demand better,"" he said.

Earlier during Scheer's chat with Global television's Mercedes Stephenson, the Tory leader was asked how he deals with accusations that he is ""not being tough enough"" with groups advocating violence.

""I deal with [it] by pointing out that the criticisms are completely baseless,"" Scheer responded.

Last week, the Conservative leader was criticized for issuing a statement in response to the massacre in New Zealand without mentioning that the attacks had taken place in mosques, against Muslims gathered for Friday prayers.

He said his statement condemned hateful ideology by anyone who promotes any type of superiority of one race or religion over others. ""I condemn that unequivocally.""

The Liberals, Scheer said, had tried to ""score cheap political points in a very disgusting manner"" by politicizing his original statement and the attacks. The Liberals, he noted, did not levy the same criticism against Governor General Julie Payette's comments, which also did not mention the victims were Muslims.

The Tories, he said, are an open, inclusive and welcoming party for people of all faiths and backgrounds.

In a speech in the House of Commons on Monday, the prime minister said events such as the carnage in Christchurch were precisely the right time to talk about politics.

""The best way to support people is to acknowledge that there is a problem and take concrete steps to fix it,"" he said. ""As a global community, we have a choice to make. Will we denounce our leaders who turn a blind eye to those who incite violence?

On Friday, during a town hall meeting in Thunder Bay, a foreign student from Pakistan took the opportunity to thank the prime minister for his words.

""When I heard your speech, being a Muslim and a resident of Canada, it was the most proud moment for me. That prime minister of Canada, Mr. Justin Trudeau, has addressed Muslims. Undoubtedly, your words matter. They affect and they impact. Mr. Prime Minister, I thank you very much,"" she said. ""Undoubtedly, I feel more secure, among all the countries, in Canada right now,"" she said as Trudeau smiled, his head bowed. She received a standing ovation from the crowd.

The Liberals have sought to differentiate themselves from the Tories vis-à-vis their relationship with Muslim Canadians.

Scheer, in some ways, has helped them. He voted, for example, against a motion two years ago condemning Islamophobia and all forms of systemic racism and religious discrimination. The motion called for a study on Islamophobia, data collection on hate crimes and a government strategy to deal with religious discrimination.

Scheer argued that the motion, by singling out one faith, was not inclusive.

“(Prime Minister Justin Trudeau) thinks today’s budget will distract Canadians from all of this. He is using the budget — a critical element of any government’s agenda — as nothing more than a political prop in an unprecedented cover-up,” Andrew Scheer said Tuesday.

The committee’s decision came on the same day as the federal budget was being tabled. So Scheer wove that into his broader criticism of the government, describing the budget as a “political prop” by a prime minister determined to divert the public’s attention from the scandal engulfing his government.

That raises a question that cuts to the core of this week’s two big national political stories, the budget and the everlasting SNC-Lavalin saga: can the regularly scheduled tabling of a federal budget be described as a political prop?

Spoiler alert: The Canadian Press Baloney Meter is a dispassionate examination of political statements culminating in a ranking of accuracy on a scale of “no baloney” to “full of baloney” (complete methodology below).

Scheer’s remark earns a rating of “a lot of baloney” — the statement is mostly inaccurate but contains elements of truth.

The facts

The SNC-Lavalin controversy slammed like a runaway train into Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s delivery of Tuesday’s budget, the government’s final spending blueprint before a federal election scheduled for this fall.

While the budget lockup was underway several blocks east of Parliament Hill, the Liberal majority on the House of Commons justice committee voted to end its five-week inquiry into the controversy, enraging Conservatives and New Democrats alike.

By the time Morneau reached the Commons to deliver his 4 p.m. budget speech, he faced some serious Conservative roadblocks. The Conservatives forced a vote on a motion to allow MPs on the fisheries committee to travel. Several Tory MPs voted both for and against.

They then stood — one at a time — to apologize for voting twice. But they each also managed to also denounce the Liberals’ earlier decision, which prevented former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould from reappearing before the justice committee. Chants of “Let her speak” filled the chamber, while more points of privilege and points of order ate up the clock.

Morneau’s speech was delayed an hour, and when he finally rose to speak, he was drowned out by opposition MPs. Eventually, the Conservatives walked out of the Commons, with Scheer calling the committee’s decision “an assault on democracy.”

Morneau’s budget aimed billions in new spending at a variety of areas ç from pharmacare to retraining workers to helping first-time homebuyers. It was a deficit-friendly, pre-election platform that contrasted with the Conservative mantra of balanced books. Morneau decided the government would use up a big windfall, and run near-term deficits of almost $20 billion. He offered no timeline for bringing the budget back to balance, and made no apologies.

READ MORE: Justin Trudeau’s Liberals have 3 budgets under their belts. Are they keeping their promises?

The budget document credited a stronger economy for an extra $27.8 billion in revenue over the next six years, compared with the numbers in the government’s fall update. The new budget will spend about $22.8 billion of that additional cash, and the government said it has earmarked another $4 billion in spending since the fall update.

Morneau called this “investments to grow our economy for the long term – while we bring the books back towards balance.”

Trudeau, meanwhile, accused the Conservatives of using the SNC-Lavalin affair to avoid talking about their own “failed” approach to the economy. “The Conservatives still don’t want to talk about jobs, about growth, about investing in Canadians because they’re realizing they have no plan,” he said.

What the experts say

Financial experts say that while budgets can certainly be used by governments to make political gains, they are an annual ritual of government that are scheduled to take place on dates that are set weeks in advance.

“The content of the budget is the real issue, and here the claim the budget was used as a prop is weak,” said Brett House, the deputy chief economist at Scotiabank. “Though the revenue windfall was spent, and we would have preferred to see it saved, the amount was not large and wasn’t devoted to a big signature project or program.”

Kevin Page, the former parliamentary budget officer, agrees there is no single big initiative in the budget to draw attention away from other issues such as SNC-Lavalin.

READ MORE: No pharmacare in federal budget, but funding for a national drug agency

“Budgets are not mandatory but it is a long-standing tradition and a best practice to table a fiscal plan before the start of the fiscal year,” said Page, the president of the Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy at the University of Ottawa.

“This budget does not look like a prop.”

Doug Porter, the chief economist of BMO Financial Group, says there is little doubt the government would like to shift the focus to other matters, including the economy and fiscal policy.

“But, it’s also fair to say that, as the quote suggests, a budget is ‘a critical element of any government’s agenda,”‘ he said.

Porter said the convention has generally become to unveil a new budget in February or March before the start of the new fiscal year on April 1.

“It’s a convention that is followed by all 10 provinces as well.”

The verdict

The government usually releases a budget at this time of year. Though a lot is riding on the pre-election blueprint the Liberals tabled Tuesday, and Trudeau wasted no time in using it to attack the Conservative record, it didn’t feature a showcase signature initiative aimed at changing the political channel.

For those reasons, Scheer’s assertion that the Liberals were using the budget as a political prop contains “a lot of baloney.”

“More and more Canadians are saying we’d like to hear your plan for the economy, we’d like to hear your plan for the energy sector … there’s more reception for what we’re offering Canadians,” Scheer said in a casual interview with Global’s Mercedes Stephenson. It was a curiously subdued gathering of the annual Manning conference. With conservative governments in place in five provinces, and the Conservative Party polling ahead of Trudeau’s Liberals federally, only a few hundred attended Scheer’s speech. But those attendees got an advance look at the Conservatives’ election platform, which includes balancing the books — at some as-yet undefined point — and a focus on pocketbook issues.

“There’s a real sense, in this generation at this period of time in Canada, that people are working hard but not getting ahead,” Scheer said. “There’s a real sense of frustration around that and that’s something I’m going to be mentioning in the campaign.” Earlier in the day, Ford suggested his party will keep its commitment to balance the provincial books in the upcoming budget. “On April 11, well deliver a budget. And I’ll give you a little spoiler: it’s going to be a budget that consists of promises made, promises kept,” Ford said to applause. Conservative activists at the conference, an annual fixture in the Ottawa political calendar, seemed optimistic compared to before the SNC-Lavalin affair hit front pages. The election is now in play, in many activists’ opinion, even if they believe Scheer has an uphill battle to defeat the incumbent Liberal government.

The Star requested an interview with Preston Manning, the former leader of the Reform party, but he walked away. Both Conservatives and Liberals expect that the GTA — particularly its suburban areas — will be the deciding factor in the upcoming federal election, scheduled for October.

The leaders of Canada’s largest labour organization and a prominent national Muslim group say Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is emboldening far-right extremists by failing to call out Islamophobia following the New Zealand mosque shootings and attending events with people who promote hate speech.

Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) president Hassan Yussuff criticized Mr. Scheer’s response to the shootings at two mosques in Christchurch last week that left 50 people dead and dozens more injured. Mr. Scheer issued a lengthy statement about the terrorism attacks Friday after his initial Twitter message on the shootings were criticized for failing to mention that the victims were Muslims.

“Unfortunately the opposition leader had to be shamed to do a 180-degree turn to actually acknowledge what happened. Had he not been shamed, I’m not sure he would have changed his position,” Mr. Yussuf said Thursday.

Ihsaan Gardee, the executive director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM), said Mr. Scheer’s initial decision to avoid saying that the victims were Muslims and the attacks took place at mosques “felt very deliberate.”

“There is a real danger that this kind of association helps to embolden others to feel like they now have licence to act out on their hatred and on their ideologies,” Mr. Gardee said.

Mr. Yussuf also condemned Mr. Scheer for sharing a stage with “racists and bigots” at a protest led by a convoy of pro-pipeline, anti-carbon-tax demonstrators in February. Former Rebel Media personality Faith Goldy also attended the rally on Parliament Hill, where she told Indigenous counterprotesters to leave Canada if they didn’t like it.

Mr. Yussuf said Mr. Scheer should know better than to attend events with right-wing figures such as Ms. Goldy.

A spokesman for Mr. Scheer said the Tory leader was “very clear and emphatic” in his condemnation of the anti-Muslim hatred that motivated the New Zealand mosque attacks.

“Further, in his speech to the House of Commons earlier this week, he called for action to defend a concept of Canada rooted in shared civic values, respect for the principle of universal human dignity and freedom of religion for all,” said Brock Harrison, Mr. Scheer’s spokesman.

The CLC and the NCCM shared their concerns at a media conference about the rise of Islamophobia in Canadian workplaces, where they released a new report on the matter.

The report cites a steady rise in hate crimes targeting Muslim communities in Canada over the past several years, fuelled by far-right politics at home and abroad. It makes several recommendations aimed at reinforcing the responsibility of employers to educate management and staff about legal obligations around human rights and religious accommodations for Muslims. It also calls on governments to do more to support anti-racism awareness campaigns and develop strategies to combat online hate speech.

“What we’re talking about here is the everyday micro-aggressions that inform this fearful environment that many Canadian Muslims exist in and infiltrates every aspect of their daily life,” said Leila Nasr, NCCM communications co-ordinator.

Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer told a crowd at the Manning Centre Conference on Saturday that a Conservative government would balance the federal budget, but wouldn’t say by when.

“Yes, we will balance the budget,” Scheer said to applause at the conservative networking event, during a Q&A with Global News’ Mercedes Stephenson.

Scheer said balancing the budget would be done through “a combination of big ticket items with controlling the rate of growth.”

“There’s been such rapid increases in the rate of growth of government spending that we can get a lot of the way there just by restricting the growth of government spending back to closer to inflation and population growth,” Scheer said.

Scheer said a Conservative government would cut funding of the Canada Infrastructure Bank, which was established under the current Liberal government, as well as to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.

Scheer offered little specifics about when a Conservative government would deliver a balanced budget however, only saying it would be “over a shorter period of time,” if elected in the October general election.

The Trudeau government presented their final budget of this mandate, which projects a $19.7 billion deficit for 2019-20. In 2015, the Liberals ran on a campaign promise of returning to a balanced budget by the upcoming year. They have yet to post a surplus or an annual deficit less than $14 billion since assuming office that year. In this year’s budget, the Liberals are projecting the deficit to fall slightly next year, before declining to $9.8 billion in 2023-24.

At a press conference this morning, Scheer demanded that the standing committee on access to information, privacy and ethics agree to hold a study of the SNC-Lavalin affair. The standing committee on justice and human rights ended a study of the matter last week, prompting accusations by opposition members of a Liberal coverup.

Conservative members will put forward a motion at tomorrow’s committee meeting, which will ask Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to waive all constraints currently preventing Wilson-Raybould from speaking fully.

In recent days, there has been public debate over whether Wilson-Raybould can speak freely without penalty in the House of Commons under parliamentary privilege or if another waiver from Trudeau is needed.

Scheer said the concern about parliamentary immunity is it doesn’t “absolve” the former ministers from the oaths they had taken, referring to the cabinet pledge to the Privy Council Office to “keep secret all matters committed and revealed to me in this capacity, or that shall be secretly treated of in Council.”

“That is what Justin Trudeau waived for Ms. Wilson-Raybould but only for a narrow period of time,” Scheer said, adding that Wilson-Raybould and Philpott should be allowed to speak about events occurring after the former justice minister resigned from cabinet on Feb. 12.

“Clearly there were events that happened after her time as attorney general.”

Last month, Trudeau waived solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidences about the SNC-Lavalin affair, but the order-in-council only applies to Wilson-Raybould’s time as attorney general and excludes discussions between her and the director of public prosecutions.

Asked about the potential repercussions of Wilson-Raybould speaking in the House, Scheer said there are “clearly consequences to people’s reputations when they’ve taken oaths.”

“We’re saying don’t put them in that position if you’ve really got nothing to hide,” he said.

Scheer added that after a number of Liberal MPs recently said Wilson-Raybould and Philpott should speak their mind in order to settle the affair, there is now “consensus” on both sides of the House that both former ministers should be able to speak freely.

The committee motion will also ask Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board President Jane Philpott to testify before April 5 and to allow the committee to table its findings in Parliament. Philpott resigned from cabinet on March 4 over the Liberal government’s handling of the SNC-Lavalin controversy.

There are nine voting members of the ethics committee, including six Liberals, two Conservatives, and one NDP. The chair, Conservative MP Bob Zimmer, does not have a vote.

The SNC-Lavalin controversy began on Feb. 7 when the Globe and Mail reported allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office inappropriately pressured Wilson-Raybould to reverse a decision made by the director of public prosecutions to move forward with a criminal case involving the Montreal-based engineering giant.

Since then, Trudeau’s principal secretary Gerry Butts, Wilson-Raybould, and Philpott have resigned from their jobs. Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick has also announced his retirement.

Responding to the horrific massacre of Muslims at prayer in New Zealand, the Conservative leader issued a statement ...","Hours later, Andrew Scheer said the things he should have said the first time.

Responding to the horrific massacre of Muslims at prayer in New Zealand, the Conservative leader issued a statement Friday afternoon expressing his “profound condemnation of this cowardly and hateful attack on the Muslim community” along with “the type of extreme and vile hatred that motivated this despicable act of evil.” He added: “To the Muslim community around the world and here at home in Canada, we stand with you.”

It was spot on: straightforward, fitting and right. It was also about 15 hours too late, coming as it did only after Scheer had come under intense criticism for the inadequacy of his first response, which spoke vaguely of an attack on “freedom” and unspecified “worshippers.” The appositeness of the second only highlighted the strange, withholding coldness of the first.

Freedom has come under attack in New Zealand as peaceful worshippers are targeted in a despicable act of evil. All people must be able to practice their faith freely and without fear. 1/2 — Andrew Scheer (@AndrewScheer) March 15, 2019

We cannot know exactly what explains that initial, catastrophic choice of words. But neither is Scheer automatically entitled to the benefit of the doubt. Politicians are in the business of being politic, of saying the right thing at the right time, and nothing goes out over their name without a great deal of thought, not to say calculation.

Other party leaders managed to name the victims — Muslims — and the beliefs — white supremacism, Islamophobia, the familiar, toxic mix of racism, xenophobia and hatred that so often finds Muslims as its target — involved in what was self-evidently an act of terrorism. Why on earth couldn’t Scheer?

The suspicion that this was no accident is not unreasonable, given Scheer’s past statements and actions. Perhaps he truly did not hear the questioner at a recent town hall who invoked “pizzagate,” the lunatic conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton was connected to a child sex ring supposedly operating out of a Washington, D.C., pizzeria.

But nothing required him to speak at last month’s “United We Roll” rally on Parliament Hill, whose stated purpose — to protest federal environmental policies on behalf of unemployed workers in the oil industry — may have been legitimate, but which had clearly been infiltrated by anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant elements. At the very least, he might have taken the opportunity of his appearance to denounce these views. He did not.

Just as disturbing was Scheer’s recent endorsement of conspiracy-minded interpretations of a United Nations document called the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, an unenforceable statement of good intentions with regard to the handling of immigrants and refugees to which most of the world’s nations agreed last year.

This, on top of his party’s unceasing alarmism on the subject of the asylum seekers entering Canada illegally via our southern border — a legitimate issue, to be sure, and one on which the government may deserve criticism, but nothing like the existential “crisis” of so much Conservative rhetoric.

And before that there was the hysteria over M-103, a non-binding motion — not a bill — condemning Islamophobia that was somehow elevated, via the panic mills of the populist right, into an assault on freedom of speech worthy of a police state. The motion passed two years ago. Not one person has since been carted off for criticizing Islam or faced sanctions of any kind because of M-103.

And before that there was the gratuitous ban on face-coverings at citizenship ceremonies. And the “barbaric practices” snitch line. The federal Conservatives are not by any means the only party to pander to racial and religious intolerance — Dalton McGuinty’s Liberals won an election in Ontario in 2007 on a coded anti-Muslim fear campaign, while the government of Quebec’s baiting of the province’s religious minorities enjoys near all-party support — but they are surely the most consistent. Or were, until Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party came along.

And it seems to be growing worse: as xenophobic and anti-Muslim rhetoric is normalized by repetition on social media and other online sites — most notoriously The Rebel — so a certain section of the public has been radicalized, persuaded that only “globalists” and other elites could oppose such disgraceful sentiments. Exploiting public fears of immigrants and minorities has a long and dishonourable tradition in this country. But exactly what kind of voter did Scheer worry would be put off by explicitly naming the sole victims and declared targets of a mass murderer?

That all of this is happening in the wake of the 2017 murders at a Quebec City mosque — the New Zealand attacker cited it as a model — makes this winking indulgence of the worst elements of the populist right particularly reprehensible.

Obviously neither Scheer nor The Rebel is responsible, in themselves, for the actions of terrorists. But they can be held to account for their part in creating the climate of opinion in which extremists flourish and madmen find inspiration. After Christchurch, after Quebec City, after Brevik and other atrocities, this is hardly a theoretical concern.

None of this is to justify further limits on free speech: we lack the kind of certainty about cause and effect that would even begin to make a case for legal restrictions, and we know from long experience how such laws can be abused. But all of us are morally responsible for the things we say, or do not say. Each of us is part of a moral order it is our duty to sustain — political leaders most of all.

This isn’t about censorship, or political correctness. It’s about judgment, and choices.

There was money for millennials trying to buy a first home, money for retraining, money for seniors struggling to keep their heads above water, money for laying the groundwork for a much-needed national pharmacare program, money to protect quality journalism and more.

David Kawai/Bloomberg via Getty Images Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, right, and Finance Minister Bill Morneau, left, before tabling the federal budget in Ottawa on Tuesday, March 19, 2019.

While much of what Canadians heard are first-step types of announcements, this budget and the reactions of the Opposition parties give us a good roadmap of the kind of election we can expect.

Take pharmacare.

As far as I'm concerned, we can't move fast enough on bringing pharmacare to Canada. No one living in this country should be denied medical treatment just because they can't afford their medications, and our health-care system could certainly use the cost savings that come with a national drug program. This budget gave us a new Canadian Drug Agency at a cost of $35 million over four years to assess drug effectiveness and negotiate prices — an important first step in setting up a full pharmacare program.

But only a first step. In a few months, we will be in full election mode in Canada, and expect it to be defined by what next steps the parties will be prepared to make on this program and others.

There comes a time when you need to sit down, listen, debate and actually articulate what you stand for.

The same could be said for the preliminary steps taken on funding for quality journalism in Canada. News organizations are in crisis as Facebook and Google claim the ad dollars that once paid to put reporters on the street and delivered Canadians the news they need. Tuesday's budget set out the criteria for handing out that money, but lacked the urgency some of those in the industry would have liked to see. Again, fodder for the coming election.

All elections are a time for political parties to set out their visions for the country — that much goes without saying.

This week's budget, too, challenged the Opposition parties to say what steps they would take to build on ideas like pharmacare, journalism support, job training, housing and more — or to have the guts to say they would reverse such much-needed moves.

The NDP, with their leader Jagmeet Singh making his debut in the House of Commons, responded by calling for more to be done, and for it to be done faster. Good. Progressive voices need to keep pushing for more to be done, and to constantly underline the urgency for action.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick Conservative leader Andrew Scheer leads members of his party out of the House of Commons during the delivery of the federal budget on Tuesday, March 19, 2019 in Ottawa.

Andrew Scheer's Conservatives, however, responded with a temper tantrum.

As soon as the finance minister stood in the House to table his budget, Scheer and his party's MPs stood up and walked out en masse in an apparent protest of the handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Don't get me wrong. I like a good protest as much as anyone. I've been to more than I can count, and spoken at more protests than you can possibly imagine.

There comes a time, however, when you need to sit down, listen, debate and actually articulate what you stand for and the kind of country you want to build. Scheer missed his chance to do just that this week, to the disservice of all Canadians.

To me, Scheer's temper tantrum shows that his party is all too willing to put petty party politics ahead of rolling up their sleeves and putting forward a credible idea or two about the direction they would take this country.

Canadians deserve better, and if that's the best the Conservatives have to offer, I'll choose progressive policies that help Canadians get back on their feet — every time.

In the wake of the massacre in Christchurch, New Zealand, what has to be stated loudly and clearly is that Islamophobia has become the last acceptable prejudice in allegedly polite society. And that those who may even reject racism, anti-Semitism and homophobia often still hold on to anti-Muslim views.

In Canada, this is even more evident on the political right, where on social media the reaction of some people to the slaughter of 50 Muslim worshippers (children among them and 40 more in hospital with gunshot wounds) was to blame Muslims for the violence and declare the notion that Islamophobia even exists as an attack on free speech.

There were also those that refused to ask the right questions about why this all happened in the first place. The Christchurch killer was at least in part motivated by the politics of Trump, much like Quebec City mosque shooter Alexandre Bissonnette. Both were consumed by right-wing groups online and Muslim immigration.

Then there were the responses from our political leaders. The Prime Minister’s was swift, referring directly to the context of the attack as part of a growing problem of white nationalist inspired terrorism. Not so Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, who issued a banal tweet, declaring the Christchurch rampage was an attack on “freedom” rather than Muslim worshippers.

It took several hours of outrage and criticism – some privately from other Conservative MPs – for Scheer to issue a second statement the next day on Facebook, one that dared to refer specifically to what had happened and to acknowledge that Muslims had been murdered because of their faith. That was followed by a visit to a mosque in Regina in what looked like a hastily scheduled photo opportunity.

Many of Scheer’s defenders rushed to justify his characterization of the attack, claiming that his critics were too harsh, and that while their leader may not have been specific in his language there was really nothing that should be read into this. That, however, is terribly misleading and disingenuous or even dishonest.

Scheer is not a stupid man, and is fully capable of properly expressing himself. He also knows that a great number of his supporters have at best an ambivalent attitude towards Muslims and often view Islam as a downright threat to what they like to describe as Judeo-Christian values.

Scheer and his senior advisors, such as former Rebel Media executive Hamish Marshall, who will head the Conservative party's 2019 campaign, certainly understand this and don't want to alienate those in their base.

Those among Scheer's supporters in media who condemned the atrocity, argued that far worse things are done to Christians by Muslims in Africa and the Middle East on a regular basis. It’s a classic digression technique.

As someone who has written and broadcast for 20 years about the persecution of Christians by Muslim extremists I know the reality of all this, but it should not be allowed in any way to obscure the horror and danger of the rampant Islamophobia that exists in Western society.

If Scheer tried to be relatively subtle in his response, People's Party of Canada leader Maxime Bernier went further, at first saying nothing at all about Christchurch.

When journalist Stephen Maher quite rightly noted his silence, Bernier responded bizarrely via Twitter. “Some journalists have no decency. Did this one harass me or anybody else when dozens of Christians were massacred in Nigeria and the Philippines weeks ago? Why not? As a rule I don’t comment on these horrible tragedies in other countries. Period.”

Bernier may now be a fringe player in charge of a ragtag party of extremists, but it should be remembered that he was widely viewed at one time as the likely successor to Stephen Harper, and the man who was assumed to be the next leader of the Conservative Party before he lost the leadership race to Scheer on the 13th ballot, with more than 49 per cent of the vote.

He was eventually kicked out of the party and is still viewed as a threat to Scheer's political fortunes. But if Scheer has an Islamophobia problem in his party, Bernier is virtually dependent on the damned thing.

As well as being unethical and irresponsible, the reactions of both Scheer and Bernier are profoundly dangerous. Silence or ambiguity about evil emboldens those who are likely to commit grievous acts and blurs an issue that should be black and white.

Scheer did eventually say the right thing, but his reluctance to do so is what speaks the loudest. As for Bernier, his pandering to bigotry positively roars.

Of all the reasons to give Justin Trudeau a pass on the SNC-Lavalin affair, the one the Liberals and their supporters seem most confident of is the existence of Andrew Scheer.

It’s pretty clear, at this point, that Justin Trudeau and his staff put pressure on the top law enforcement officer in the country to try to affect her decision about publicly prosecuting a large engineering company.

The Liberals are trying to suggest that it’s all a big misunderstanding and that the attorney general misinterpreted some everyday talk about this big issue. We’re all friends here, they say. Nothing to see here, they say.

And certain portions of the public have been more than ready to lap up whatever excuse the Liberals come up with because they are terrified of the thought of Andrew Scheer as prime minister.

Of course, Andrew Scheer’s existence is as relevant as my kid’s conjunctivitis to whether Trudeau acted wrongly or rightly.

If he was wrong, he was wrong even if you don’t want to vote for Scheer (or Singh or Bernier).

But what do you do, when everybody is due a thrashing? Holding your nose at the ballot box is a cliché because we accept that sometimes there is no great option.

If we should electorally punish those who do the wrong thing for political reasons, should we not also punish those who choose not to do the right things for political reasons?

One of the reasons people are so uncomfortable with Scheer is because of his and his party’s rhetoric over the past couple years on the topic of immigration, the border and other Trumpy topics.

Among all the many topics they can choose from, the Conservatives have been loudest about issues that, perhaps unsurprisingly, roil up the relatively tiny portion of Canadians who love to bash out angry caps-locked comments on Facebook.

To keep those folks from fleeing to whatever Maxime Bernier is doing, the Conservatives have railed against a tepid condemnation of Islamophobia and given voice to those fearmongering about a similarly bland United Nations migration agreement that will have not a whit of impact on Canadian policy.

There is little in Scheer’s background to suggest he is not a typical middle-of-the-road Canadian Conservative likely to continue with typically unoffensive Conservative immigration policy. He says the right things when pushed, and needs the votes of the huge number of Canadians who prize this country’s reputation for tolerance.

But recently, Scheer seems to have decided that the best political move is to avoid confronting those people who say Muslim immigrants are to be feared, not welcomed.

As a conservative, Scheer has credibility with those who detest Trudeau and are irrationally afraid of Muslims. At a town hall, John McCain famously defended Barack Obama as a good man, even as he strove to defeat him at the ballot box.

Scheer, similarly, has a chance – one that isn’t open to others – to try to de-radicalize a fearful segment of voters, while making it clear that a change in government won’t alter how welcoming Canada is to Muslims. He could forcefully and repeatedly try to reach that segment of the population and convince them that while he thinks policies should be changed, immigration does not pose a safety risk to Canadians.

He has not yet done so, but it’s still not too late.

Making decisions for political reasons is often, and thankfully, the worst political move of all.

Sometimes it’s best to just do the right thing and sleep well at night.

Scheer threw down the gauntlet immediately after a three-hour Commons' justice committee meeting in which Wilson-Raybould said she felt pressure from Trudeau and others to head off a criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

""Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this country now that Canadians know what he has done,"" Scheer said. ""And that is why I am calling on Mr. Trudeau to do the right thing and to resign.""

But Trudeau quickly rebuffed Scheer's demand as he touted his government's record defending jobs and ""the independence of our judiciary,"" adding Canadians will decide later this year whether to re-elect the Liberals or hand power to the Conservatives.

The back-and-forth marked the latest escalation in what has already been the most explosive political challenge facing the Trudeau government during its more than three years in power. The Official Opposition very rarely calls on a prime minister to resign.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Wilson-Raybould's testimony underscored his party's calls for an independent inquiry to find out the truth of what happened between the former attorney general and members of Trudeau's inner circle.

During her testimony, Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she withstood four months of relentless pressure to reverse a decision not to make a plea-bargain-type deal with SNC-Lavalin. She said the pressure came from Trudeau and other senior Liberal officials.

Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she believed the pressure, which also included ""veiled threats"" from the country's top civil servant, Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick, was inappropriate. But she added she did not think it was illegal.

Scheer nonetheless demanded Trudeau's resignation and called for the RCMP to launch a criminal investigation into what the Liberal government did to help SNC-Lavalin, which is facing criminal charges related to allegedly corrupt dealings in Libya.

""Jody Wilson-Raybould tells the story of a prime minister who has lost the moral authority to govern,"" Scheer said.

""A prime minister who allows his partisan, political motivations to overrule his duty to uphold the rule of law. A prime minister who doesn't know where the Liberal Party ends and where the government of Canada begins.""

The Conservative leader also called for Wernick to resign and encouraged the Liberal cabinet, which is scheduled to present a federal budget next month, to find a way to govern the country in a non-partisan way without the prime minister.

Scheer did not say what he would do if Trudeau refused to resign, such as calling a non-confidence vote.

For his part, Singh said Wilson-Raybould's testimony painted a picture of a prime minister and other members of government who were willing to disregard the rule of law and were more interested in helping powerful friends than average Canadians.

While the NDP leader said Trudeau and others may eventually have to step down, he said that determination should come after a public inquiry is held to get the bottom of what really happened.

Trudeau, however, indicated during a Liberal party event in Montreal a short time later that he had no intention of resigning. He rejected Wilson-Raybould's version of events, saying he and his staff ""always acted appropriately and professionally.""

He said Canadians will have ""a very clear choice in a few months"" in the October election about who they want to form government.

""There will be a clear choice to be made between the Liberal Party, this government that ... has consistently stood up for Canadian jobs, consistently defended Canadian jobs while defending our institutions and the independence of our judiciary,"" he said.

""And on the other hand there is a choice of the party that is still very much the party of Stephen Harper. That continues to attack, to divide, to play politics with big issues and (thinks) the best way to create economic growth is still to give advantages to the wealthiest.""

The motion this morning came after a letter late Monday to chair Anthony Housefather in which five Liberal MPs on the committee indicated that they were keen to leave remaining investigation into the SNC-Lavalin affair to the ethics commissioner and to block any further testimony from Wilson-Raybould, the former minister of justice and the attorney general.

“We’ve heard 13 hours of comprehensive testimony from over 10 witnesses,” states the letter from the five Liberals. “No witness was prevented from providing evidence on any relevant information during the period covered by the waiver, which was the focus of the Committee’s review.”

“Canadians can judge for themselves the facts, the perspectives and relevant legal principles.”

But Wilson-Raybould, who has already given nearly four hours of testimony, has indicated that she has more to say, particularly about the period between her mid-January move from Justice to Veteran Affairs and her resignation from cabinet a month later.

Opposition MPs had also asked for her return to the committee, after noting inconsistencies between Wilson-Raybould’s testimony and subsequent version of events from former principal secretary Gerald Butts and Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick.

Conservative and New Democrat MPs say Canadians need to hear more about the affair. “What happened today is absolutely outrageous,” said Conservative committee member Michael Cooper.

“If there was ever evidence needed that Liberal MPs on the justice committee are agents of the prime minister, doing the work of the prime minister to cover-up the prime minister’s misdeeds, then one need only look at what happened at this meeting today where the Liberals have shut down the process.”

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of “thumbing his nose” at Canadians, and said the official Opposition would use “every tool available to us” to hold the government accountable in Parliament.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau is to deliver his budget speech at 4 p.m. in the House of Commons, but Scheer repeatedly sidestepped questions about what, if anything, the Opposition could or would do to delay the presentation.

However, the Conservatives have forced a vote on a motion to allow MPs studying fisheries to travel, which could delay Morneau’s speech at least 35 minutes.

Scheer called the government’s budget “a political prop” in its “unprecedented cover-up” of the affair that has rocked the Liberal cabinet and prompted Trudeau’s top adviser and the country’s most senior public servant to resign.

The letter, signed by Randy Boissonnault, Iqra Khalid, Ali Ehsassi, Ron McKinnon and Colin Fraser, stated that the committee approached the investigation with an “open mind” and afforded testimonial opportunities for all those involved.

“Traditionally Cabinet confidence and Solicitor-Client privilege would have prevented several of these witnesses from disclosing much of what they did divulge to the Committee,” the letter read. “We appreciate that the Government took the extraordinary step of waiving these confidences.”

The letter also accused the opposition of rushing ‘to judgement even before hearing all the relevant information.”

The actions stated in the letter have been criticized by NDP and Conservative leaders alike. Conservative leader Andrew Scheer called the move “a massive coverup” and condemned Trudeau on social media.

“Justin Trudeau has lawyered up. His Liberal MPs will shut down the Justice committee. The only possible conclusion Canadians can reach is that Trudeau is engaged in a massive coverup,” he said.

NDP leader Jagmeet Singh agreed with Scheer. “That means no more testimony and no more answers that you deserve,” he said on Twitter.

This isn’t the first time the Liberals have been accused of silencing the debate around the SNC-Lavalin scandal. Opposition MPs on the committee erupted with the words ‘coverup’ and ‘shame’ on March 13, after Liberal MP Francis Drouin “expressed” the committee’s wishes to delay the debate around Wilson-Raybould’s second testimony.

Finance Minister Bill ...","OTTAWA — The Liberal-dominated justice committee has pulled the plug on its probe of the SNC-Lavalin affair, prompting fresh howls of outrage from the Conservatives and NDP.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of ""thumbing his nose"" at Canadians, and said the official Opposition would use ""every tool available to us"" to hold the government accountable in Parliament.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau is slated to deliver his budget speech at 4 p.m. in the House of Commons, but Scheer repeatedly sidestepped questions about what, if anything, the Opposition could or would do to delay the presentation.

Scheer called the government's budget ""a political prop"" in its ""unprecedented cover-up"" of the affair that has rocked the Liberal cabinet and prompted Trudeau's top adviser and the country's most senior public servant to resign.

Conservative and New Democrat MPs unsuccessfully pressed the House of Commons justice committee Tuesday to recall former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould so she could shed more light on the simmering controversy.

Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin finds itself at the centre of a national political storm over allegations prime ministerial aides crossed a line in leaning on Wilson-Raybould to help the company avoid criminal prosecution on corruption charges.

Conservative and New Democrat MPs say Canadians need to hear more about the affair.

""What happened today is absolutely outrageous,"" said Conservative committee member Michael Cooper.

""If there was ever evidence needed that Liberal MPs on the justice committee are agents of the prime minister, doing the work of the prime minister to cover-up the prime minister's misdeeds, then one need only look at what happened at this meeting today where the Liberals have shut down the process.""

Liberals on the justice committee wrote to the chairman, fellow Liberal Anthony Housefather, this week to say the committee had done its job and should move on to other business.

""As committee members, we have achieved our objectives with respect to these meetings,"" says the letter. ""Following the testimony of all witnesses, we believe that all rules and laws were followed. Canadians now have the necessary information to arrive at a conclusion.""

Liberal committee member Randy Boissonault reiterated the contents of the letter following the meeting, saying Tuesday's session was the 10th in five weeks, amounting to 13 hours of testimony given by 10 witnesses.

""We have heard from many of the key players in this matter,"" he said.

The Liberal members tabled a motion Tuesday calling for the committee to begin a study of the rise of hate crimes in Canada.

They say the federal ethics commissioner, who has launched a probe of the SNC-Lavalin matter, is best suited to investigate the political controversy.

They also note former justice minister Anne McLellan has been appointed to explore the relationship between the government and the minister of justice, who plays a second role as attorney general. While the justice minister is a political player, the attorney general is supposed to make independent, impartial decisions about prosecutions.

But the opposition would have none of it.

Conservative MP Lisa Raitt said the committee should hold town-hall meetings on SNC-Lavalin and hear from Canadians about the affair.

Wilson-Raybould has a right to reply to other witnesses including Gerald Butts, the former top adviser to Trudeau, Raitt said in objecting to the Liberal effort to move on.

""They're controlling what is being said, they're controlling who is being heard from, they're controlling whether or not we study a topic. This is really egregious and absolutely shameful.""

New Democrat MP Murray Rankin called it ""yet another effort to change the channel"" by the government.

SNC-Lavalin faces legal trouble over allegations it paid millions of dollars in bribes to obtain government business in Libya. The company unsuccessfully pressed the director of public prosecutions to negotiate a ""remediation agreement,"" a legal means of holding an organization to account for wrongdoing without a formal finding of guilt.

The director told SNC-Lavalin in October that negotiating a remediation agreement would be inappropriate in this particular case.

Wilson-Raybould has told the justice committee she was relentlessly pressured to ensure the Montreal engineering giant was invited to negotiate an agreement. She was shuffled from the justice portfolio in January, becoming veterans affairs minister.

Trudeau has denied that any undue pressure was placed on Wilson-Raybould.

She has testified at the justice committee for nearly four hours, but has indicated there is more to say, particularly about the period between her move to Veterans Affairs and her resignation from cabinet a month later.

Butts, once considered Trudeau's right-hand man, quit his job as principal secretary, saying he did not want to be a distraction from the government's agenda. In addition, Jane Philpott left cabinet over the government's handling of the controversy.

The SNC-Lavalin affair claimed its fourth resignation Monday as Michael Wernick announced he will step down as the country's top public servant, having concluded he's lost the trust of opposition parties.

Mooring has been a Vice President of the BCTF for the last six years. As well, she is currently serving as one of the federation’s lead negotiators in this round of provincial collective bargaining. Prior to moving to Vancouver in 2013, when she first became a BCTF Vice President, Teri served for five years as president of her local union, the Quesnel District Teachers’ Association.

As a teenager and young adult, she worked at Cariboo Pulp and Paper in Quesnel where her father was the local union president. Her two adult children now live in Dawson Creek, and she has two granddaughters.

Teri first got involved in the union movement at home and in the pulp mill. Family discussions around the kitchen table were often about politics. In 1988, when she was just starting her teaching career, teachers in Quesnel and across BC first unionized.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer issued two statements on the terrorist attacks in New Zealand on Friday — the second after being criticized for not mentioning in the first that the attack was against Muslims at mosques during their Friday prayers.

Two Conservative MPs have also cancelled an event on Monday with a British parliamentarian who has been accused of promoting anti-Islamic sentiments “out of respect” for Muslims reeling from the attacks that killed 49 people.

Scheer posted to Twitter and Facebook late Thursday evening in Canada as news of the attacks was reported, saying “freedom has come under attack” and mentioning “peaceful worshippers” and a “despicable act of evil.”

“All people must be able to practice their faith freely and without fear,” he wrote.

But the statement was condemned quickly online for failing to specify that the attack was on Muslims, during prayers at mosques. Some pointed to the fact he did name Coptic Christians and call out anti-Semitism in previous tweets when killers attacked Egyptian churches in 2017 and a synagogue in Pittsburgh last fall.

The National Council of Canadian Muslims criticized the omission in a statement Friday afternoon.

READ MORE: Quebec City Muslim worshippers condemn fatal New Zealand mosque attacks

“While some of our elected leaders sadly choose not to mention ‘Muslim’ or ‘mosque’ while denouncing the Christchurch attacks, the reality is that these horrific shootings and the Quebec City mosque attack on Jan. 29, 2017, have left Canadian Muslim communities – and indeed, Muslims around the world – feeling very vulnerable and unsafe,” wrote the Council’s executive director Ihsaan Gardee. “It is therefore essential that our elected leaders speak out clearly and unequivocally against such attacks and name them for the Islamophobic terrorist attacks that they are.”

The statement does not mention Scheer by name but at that point, he was the only Canadian political leader whose public response to the attacks did not mention either Muslims or mosques.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s statement condemned the attacks as terrorism and said everyone must work to “confront Islamophobia.”

Attacking people during prayers is absolutely appalling, and Canada strongly condemns today’s shootings in New Zealand. Our thoughts and hearts go out to the victims and their families, and we join New Zealanders and Muslim communities around the world in grieving. — Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) March 15, 2019

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh tweeted that “Islamophobia kills.”

Heartbroken by the devastating news of deadly shootings at two mosques in New Zealand. My heart goes out to the families of the murdered and all those impacted by this act of terror. Islamophobia kills – and has no place anywhere in the world. — Jagmeet Singh (@theJagmeetSingh) March 15, 2019

Green Leader Elizabeth May did not mention Muslims in her first Tweet but retweeted several others who did.

Greens everywhere condemn the horrific attack in #Christchurch . Deepest condolences to those whose loved ones were murdered and to the nation of #NewZealand . #GPC — Elizabeth May (@ElizabethMay) March 15, 2019

Former Conservative Maxime Bernier, now the leader of the People’s Party of Canada, hadn’t posted anything about the attacks at all by late Friday.

Scheer’s office did not respond to an initial query about the statement’s not mentioning Muslims but after being asked about the statement from the National Council of Canadian Muslims, his spokesman responded with a link to a new statement on Scheer’s Facebook page.

“As Canadians are learning the horrific details of last night’s terror attack at two New Zealand mosques, I wish to express both my deep sadness at the tragic loss of innocent life and my profound condemnation of this cowardly and hateful attack on the Muslim community,” it said.

It said Conservatives stand with Muslims around the world to “reaffirm our commitment to building a world where every people, of every faith, can live in freedom and peace together.”

A month ago, Scheer was criticized for sharing a stage on Parliament Hill with a cross-Canada truck convoy mostly protesting Liberal inaction on the energy industry but which included some people promoting hatred. Scheer said he was only there to support the energy workers, not the “other elements that tried to associate themselves with the event.”

Those “elements” were people affiliated with the Canadian Yellow Vest movement, whose Facebook page included some comments celebrating the New Zealand attacks Friday.

Meanwhile, Conservative MP Garnett Genuis tweeted Friday that Monday’s reception with Baroness Caroline Cox, a member of the British House of Lords, has been cancelled.

Genuis, an Edmonton-area MP, and fellow Conservative MP Kelly Block of Saskatchewan were to co-host the reception with Cox, who has shown support for Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad and has said she believes Muslims are trying to destroy Western democracies with Shariah law.

Toronto Liberal MP Judy Sgro pulled out of the event after she found out about Cox’s participation. Genuis initially rejected calls to follow suit, calling it a talk on human rights, and accused Sgro on social media of retreating only after she remembered this is an election year.

He said in a statement Friday that Cox’s views are subject of “some debate, and perhaps some confusion.”

“With that said, our friends in the Muslim community are now reeling from one of the most horrific and appalling terrorist attacks to ever target their community,” he wrote. “Out of respect for them, now is not the time for a conversation that could been (sic) misconstrued to take place on Parliament Hill. As such, the event will not be proceeding as planned.”

""Any time you achieve anything, there are so many people that made it possible. You never do it alone.""

Singh said, as a young boy he could have never imagined he would run for prime minister one day, but he wants all children now to have a more diverse image of what a prime minister can be.

""That image is now going to be more and more clear for young people in this country,"" he said.

""I'm only here today because other people broke barriers for me.""

Singh won a byelection in Burnaby South at the end of February.

He will enter the Commons on a busy week that includes a federal budget and continuing drama around the SNC-Lavalin affair.

He also spoke about the mosque attacks in New Zealand that left 50 people dead, saying it's time to tear down the root causes of hate, not just denounce the actions. He called for an end to policies and language that treat people as less than human.

Being a leader means serving: Singh

Singh says his strategy in the House is to push for more affordable housing, an environmentally responsible economy, reconciliation with Indigenous peoples and better healthcare.

He says he'll treat his role as rooted in the Punjabi translation of the word 'leader,' which translates roughly into English as ""the one who serves.""

""We're going to have a tough road ahead of us,"" he said, acknowledging the party only has a few months to convince Canadians that the NDP is a viable option.

TORONTO -- NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is set to release a memoir, ""Love & Courage,"" in the lead-up to the federal election.

OTTAWA -- Nearly 18 months after taking over the leadership of the federal New Democrats, Jagmeet Singh made his long-awaited parliamentary debut Monday as he became the first visible minority to lead a federal political party in the House of Commons.

Escorted into the chamber by his NDP lieutenants, Singh waved to supporters in the public gallery before claiming the seat he won in last month's byelection in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South.

That byelection -- made possible by the departure of former Burnaby MP Kennedy Stewart -- ended a 17-month exile of sorts for Singh, whose lack of a seat in the Commons made doing his job as leader that much more difficult.

Singh used his first question as leader to press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the issue of housing, citing a mother from his riding who bought a home she can no longer afford and whose children are losing hope about their futures.

""The prime minister is telling families like theirs to wait for help,"" Singh said. ""I believe better is possible. Will the government commit to building half a million affordable homes?""

Trudeau did no such thing, instead congratulating the NDP leader, welcoming him to the House and urging his party to support Liberal government efforts to reduce child poverty.

By winning a seat in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South, Jagmeet Singh becomes the first visible minority leader of a federal political party in this country’s history. He did so in the face of withering critiques, notably from former NDP leader Thomas Mulcair, as to his prospects and abilities, as well as a dominant narrative that suggested the Liberal Party of Canada was quickly usurping the NDP as Canada’s leading progressive voice. We are better as a country with Jagmeet Singh in Parliament.

Now the bad news. Though he is now leader of a political party with significant representation in Quebec, Singh soon wouldn’t be allowed to guard prisoners, police the streets, serve as a judge — or even teach schoolchildren in the province. That’s because the provincial government plans on banning religious symbols from the bodies of certain civil servants, teachers included, in the name of secularism.

And were Singh to show up at the National Assembly to protest the forthcoming legislation, he wouldn’t be allowed in. Unlike Canadian Parliament, the National Assembly still considers the kirpan, the ceremonial dagger worn by many practising Sikh men, to be a dangerous weapon. He wouldn’t make it past the X-ray machines.

I bring all of this up not to relive the long and often tiresome debate about the place and space allowed religious minorities in Quebec, but rather to illustrate the uniquely challenging political context Singh now finds himself in the very province that helped launch the NDP’s rebirth eight years ago.

In a few months’ time, Singh will be tasked with campaigning in a province that overwhelmingly supports the above-mentioned legislation. It has the potential to be a jarring spectacle. Policy-wise, the NDP under Singh, an unabashedly progressive counterpoint to Thomas Mulcair’s Liberalesque leadership, is the stuff of dreams to the province’s centre-left electorate. Yet it is tough not to see the party’s sudden and inherent disadvantage: its leader happens to be a brown guy in a turban.

Quebec’s political class is obsessed with identity issues like immigration, which took up an outsized proportion of the oxygen during the last provincial election, according to Influence Communication, a Quebec-based media analysis firm. For this you can at once point to history (francophone Quebecers’ collective and existential worry about the survival of their language and culture) and blame politicians for exploiting this worry for political gain.

This tinder is regularly turned to flame by way of certain columnists — almost all of whom are from the Journal de Montréal — who tend to portray Quebec’s religious minorities as an invading horde bent on undermining Quebec’s proudly secular society.

The end result is a zealous rejection of conspicuous religiosity. Consider how some 61 per cent of Quebecers, far and away the largest percentage of respondents in the country, say the wearing of the turban or other religious symbol by teachers is “unacceptable,” according to a national Léger Marketing poll published last December. Never mind that at least three teachers’ unions have said the government’s proposed ban is patently unworkable. The decade-long politicization of the issue has ensured gut feeling, not cold logic, rules the day.

Singh is about to step into this politically perilous breach, his religion conspicuously displayed. To be fair, he has a lot going for him. He’s good on TV and great on the stage — a necessity in the Trudeau age of campaigning. Most important, his French is excellent. And on the island of Montreal, at least, he has a multicultural beachhead where his appearance is an advantage, or at least less of a disadvantage.

Singh entered the chamber to applause from fellow New Democrats after being officially sworn in the day before.

He won a byelection in Burnaby South on Feb. 25 to replace former MP and current mayor of Vancouver Kennedy Stewart.

Singh also made history as the first racialized person to lead a federal party in Parliament.

Singh used his first speaking opportunity during question period to press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on housing.

He repeated a story he told many times during the byelection campaign, saying he met a teacher forced to live in her parents’ basement due to Burnaby’s unaffordable housing market.

Singh asked Trudeau whether the Liberal government would commit to building 500,000 new homes, alluding to the NDP’s proposal to do so over the next 10 years.

Trudeau welcomed Singh to Ottawa and said he hopes New Democrats back the Liberal government’s ongoing efforts to create affordable housing.

Singh also joined many Conservative MPs in calling on Trudeau to allow former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to testify in front of the justice committee for a second time to address the the SNC-Lavalin affair. He also repeated his call for the Liberals to launch a public inquiry into the case.

“For Canadians watching at home, this doesn't look any different than when the Conservatives were in power – special access for powerful corporations, a closed door for everyone else,” he said. “Why is this prime minister so afraid to launch a public inquiry?”

Liberal house leader Bardish Chagger deflected the calls from the opposition parties, saying Wilson-Raybould already had her chance to speak.

Singh also addressed the mosque shooting that killed 50 and injured dozens more in New Zealand last week. An avowed white supremacist has been charged in the massacre.

“That attack reverberated across the world. Though it happened in Christchurch, New Zealand, the pain impacted all of us,” he said. “It hurts here in Canada, where Muslim brothers and sisters – our friends, our close ones, people who work with us – are thinking about their own loved ones when they go to masjid, when they go to prayer, and how much it hurts to know that you're being targeted for being who you are.”

Singh said the attack was borne of white supremacist and Islamophobic hatred.

“Hate knows no bounds. Once hate is allowed to grow, it consumes all in its path. Hate is like a fire – once it's allowed to grow, it spreads, consuming everything,” he said.

Singh joined Trudeau and Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer in condemning Islamophobia and other forms of bigotry, but said Canada must go further by addressing the root causes of such hatred.

When people refer to migrants as “illegal” or “barbaric,” they dehumanize them, he said.

“The purpose is to dehumanize and then, once you dehumanize, it leads to fear and hatred,” he said. “Let's be conscious of the words we use so we never create any ground for hate to grow.”

Singh made the comments after Trudeau and Scheer made their own statements condemning the attack and expressing solidarity with the people of New Zealand and Muslims around the world.

Trudeau addressed the various forms of prejudice and discrimination he said lead to terrorist attacks around the world.

“It's anti-Semitic, Islamophobic, anti-black, anti-Indigenous, misogynistic, homophobic – the list goes on and on,” he said. “This rhetoric is dangerous, hateful and vile; it lives and festers online, spilling out into the real world with deadly consequences.”

Scheer expressed similar sentiments.

He said the attack in New Zealand was reminiscent of the 2017 attack on a Quebec City mosque in which a white nationalist killed six men in their place of worship.

Scheer called for unity among political parties in condemning hateful ideologies.

“I say to my colleagues in all parties, we certainly have our differences on important policy matters that deserve rigorous and spirited debate, but on this – the very compassion and humanity of our Canadian society – there can be no debate,” he said.","Jagmeet Singh presses on housing, calls out dehumanizing language in Parliamentary debut",Burnaby Now,https://www.burnabynow.com/news/jagmeet-singh-presses-on-housing-calls-out-dehumanizing-language-in-parliamentary-debut-1.23667389

Check out Jagmeet’s first question and what Canadians are saying about this exciting and historic day!

Jagmeet Singh was sworn in to the House of Commons as Burnaby South’s newest MP on Sunday, March 17! Surrounded by family, friends, and our NDP Team, Jagmeet became the first racialized leader of a Canadian political party to be sworn in to the House.

People across the country watched as Jagmeet took his seat in the House and aksed his first question on Monday, March 18. He talked about the people he’s met who are struggling with the skyrocketing cost of housing – worried about how they’ll be able to make rent, pay their mortgage, or whether their kids and grandkids will ever be able to own a home.

He pressed Trudeau on refusing to address the housing crisis – and asked him to commit to half a million new units of affordable housing.

Jagmeet is in the House to fight for us. While Trudeau’s Liberal government keeps siding with their rich friends, Jagmeet and our NDP team are pushing for the solutions everyday people need now.

People across the country supported Jagmeet online, using #JagmeetintheHouse to share their excitement and hopes for the future. Here’s what people had to say:

On March 17, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh was officially sworn in as the MP for Burnaby South. The election of the first racialized federal party leader to Parliament is of great historic significance.

Wanting to do my part, I travelled to BC to campaign for Singh. I wanted to make a positive contribution to the effort in light of the gloomy press coverage (some predicting Singh’s demise) that was hanging over the campaign like a dark cloud.

I was eager to know what people on the ground were thinking and feeling about the by-election. It quickly became apparent that young people engineering Singh’s operation were enthusiastic, dedicated and curious.

There were also some of the more seasoned organizers. One who flew in from Brampton proudly told me that he just got accepted into law school at the University of Ottawa, my alma mater. I asked how it felt. He said it paled in comparison to the idea of Singh winning the riding. People were nervous as they confronted the weight of history.

This was no casual by-election. The media, taking the attitude of “do or die,” reminded us of that every day. This was an election that would either usher in a new era in Canadian politics or turn back the clock for under-represented communities.

So when the polls closed and the results finally poured in, the scene was electric at the Hilton Vancouver Hotel. We did it. The moment to shift the national discourse into an unapologetically progressive direction is here.

There is a real opportunity for an NDP breakthrough in this volatile political climate, but it must articulate a bold and truly transformative agenda on climate change, reconciliation with Indigenous peoples, electoral reform, criminal justice reform, pharmacare and the housing crisis. The plight of working-class people across this country demands aggressive no-nonsense representation.

In Burnaby, Singh was able to appeal to a multiracial working class constituency with a left-populist campaign that focused on the fundamental unfairness of the economy and issues of housing affordability. Throughout his political career, he has demonstrated an ability to appeal to marginalized communities that represent a growing share of the electorate.

Many activists on Singh’s campaign were inspired by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other left-wing women of colour recently elected to congress in the U.S. who are challenging conventional wisdom and calling for a Green New Deal, free tuition, medicare for all and immigration reform.

There are lessons to be learned here from this new group of political leaders south of the border. It’s time for a new generation of progressive activists in this country, ones who boldly stand for social and economic justice and reflect the diversity of modern Canada, to step forward.

He is the first leader of a major political party in Canada’s parliament who is not white, a distinction that Singh acknowledged after question period as something he never could have imagined when he was growing up.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is introduced by NDP MP Peter Julian and Ruth Ellen Brosseau as he takes his place in the House of Commons on March 18, 2019 in Ottawa. ( Adrian Wyld / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

“It’s an incredible honour. I’m humbled. I’m blown away by the immensity of the role I’ve been granted,” said Singh, a former criminal lawyer who was born in Scarborough and is the son of immigrants from India. “If I could have in some way broken down barriers for people, I would have done something good with my life,” he said. Singh’s debut in the Commons is a result of his Feb. 25 byelection victory in Burnaby South, the British Columbia riding he moved to last year in a bid to win his first federal seat. He used the occasion to press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the government’s affordable housing plan, demanded the Liberals increase carbon price charges on heavy polluters, and repeat his party’s call for a public inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin affair.

For Singh, the moment comes at a challenging time for the party he leads. Fundraising has sunk from $18 million in 2015 to around $5 million last year, while the party has taken out a $12 million mortgage on its national headquarters, the Jack Layton Building. Meanwhile, about a quarter of the party’s caucus has resigned their seats or announced they won’t run in the general election this fall, including veterans like B.C. MPs Nathan Cullen and Murray Rankin, Quebec MPs Hélène Laverdière and Romeo Saganash, and Ontario stalwarts David Christopherson and Irene Mathyssen.

Singh himself has received negative attention for communications stumbles, including occasions when he seemed unaware of his own party’s position on issues like the Liberal government gun legislation and the question of whether Canada was right to recognize Venezuela’s opposition leader as the country’s legitimate president. In the months leading up to his byelection run, as Singh toured the country in a series of “JagMeet and Greet” events, many NDP insiders argued he needed a seat in the Commons to change the narrative that had settled in over the first year of his leadership. On Monday, Singh finally appeared in the House, tapping the breast of his suit and waving to his family as he was escorted to take his seat at the head of the NDP benches. His younger brother, Ontario MPP Gurratan Singh, said afterwards that it was “an historic and momentous occasion for all Canadians.” He looked on from the public gallery with Singh’s wife and parents, and wore a yellow turban that matched his brother’s on the Commons floor below. “For people who don’t see themselves represented in politics, today was a milestone,” he said. Singh spent much of question period listening intently. During the opening exchange between Trudeau and Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, he pressed his earpiece against his head and took notes. Later, after he had asked his own questions, Singh got up and left for a few minutes. When he returned, he briefly walked down the wrong aisle and had to double back to get to his seat. He has seven months to learn where it is before he has to win it again. Alex Ballingall is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics. Follow him on Twitter: @aballinga

This is an issue the NDP leader pursued throughout his recent byelection campaign in Burnaby South and it is close to the heart of many urban voters, in particular in Vancouver and Toronto.

Those two electoral markets are central to New Democrat prospects in next fall’s federal campaign.

Justin Trudeau responded with a boilerplate statement about helping the middle class. He was probably happy to get a brief respite from the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Singh waited more than a year for his opportunity to question Trudeau face-to-face about Canada’s current housing situation.

But he may have to wait a few more months – until the leaders debates of the upcoming election campaign – for a more serious policy conversation with his Liberal rival.

The NDP leader’s belated entry in the Commons comes at a time when the current Parliament is on its last legs - with its most productive days behind it.

Tuesday’s budget – the last of Trudeau’s ongoing term in office – marks the non-official start of the election campaign. Tuesday may also be the last semi-normal day in the Commons for the foreseeable future.

In an effort to keep the SNC-Lavalin affair in the forefront and force the Liberal majority on the justice committee to agree to invite former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould for a second appearance, the Conservatives are gearing up for a procedural trench war with the government.

Even absent opposition obstruction, the SNC-Lavalin affair has already taken a toll on the government’s agenda.

One of the reasons why omnibus budget bills have become such a central part of the federal governance apparatus is because they allow policy initiatives to clear legislative hurdles over a matter of months rather than over a year or more.

But the SNC-Lavalin affair – and the news that a budget bill was used to introduce in the Criminal Code remediation agreements of the kind sought by the engineering giant to eliminate the risk of a criminal conviction – has made the practice of squeezing a host of non-budgetary stuff in bloated finance bills politically toxic.

As a result, some of the measures the government had hoped to showcase in its campaign list of delivered items will now likely end up in the Liberal post-election catalogue.

Trudeau and his team are not the only ones who are having to temper their hopes for a productive parliamentary spring.

So might Singh.

The SNC-Lavalin has solidified the notion that the next election will boil down to a duel for government between the Liberals and the Conservatives.

It is a perception that the NDP’s role as the second opposition party tends to reinforce. Jack Layton in 2011 and Trudeau in the last election both had to wait to be on the campaign trail to level the playing field to their advantage.

Until Monday, Joe Clark had been the last opposition leader to make his entry in the Commons in the dying days of a parliament. The next-to-last leader of the Progressive Conservative party waited almost four years before securing a federal seat in the summer of 2000.

On the day Clark finally took his seat, three Quebec MPs initially elected as Progressive Conservatives crossed the floor to the Liberals.

Jean Chrétien called a general election a little more than a month after that show of strength. It was the last campaign the Tories fought under their banner.

Trudeau did not have as unpleasant a surprise in store for Singh’s first full day as an MP. But the NDP does face an existential threat next fall as the Tories did at the time of Clark’s second coming to the House of Commons almost two decades ago.

Like Clark, who had to fend off the Liberals and the Canadian Alliance, Singh is threatened on two fronts. As the result of a string of provincial breakthroughs, the Green party is poised to enter the federal campaign with the momentum the NDP so lacks.

In last month’s Outremont byelection, Elizabeth May’s candidate finished ahead of the Bloc Québécois and the Conservatives. In the province that currently accounts for the largest number of New Democrat MPs, the most recent Léger Marketing poll pegged the Green party at nine per cent, two points ahead of the NDP.

The stars could be aligning for voters to rediscover May at the expense of her NDP rival next fall.

As if crossing swords with the Liberals across the aisle was not enough, Singh will have to spend the coming months looking over his shoulder.

The arrival of the turbaned leader into the house on Monday, cheered by all members, coincided with the induction of a senior woman member into Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's cabinet.

Singh, 40, the leader of the New Democratic Party, placed his hand over his heart as he walked into the House of Commons, the lower of house of Parliament, before the daily question period.

He was elected in federal by-elections held on February 25.

Singh's first words as an elected lawmaker were about last week's terrorist attack on two mosques in New Zealand.

""I want to begin by expressing our solidarity with the people of New Zealand who are mourning the attack on Muslim brothers and sisters... in Christchurch,"" he said.

About 50 people were killed last week in the Pacific country's worst-ever mass shooting.

He then launched his first question about housing in Burnaby-South.

""I met a mom in Burnaby. She bought a home, but cannot afford to live there anymore. Her daughter has a good job, but only gets by because she lives in the basement. Her son does not see a future. Like too many Canadians, he has lost all hope,"" Singh said.

""However, the prime minister is telling families like theirs to wait for help. I believe that better is possible. Will the government commit to building half a million new affordable homes?"" he said.

Prime Minister Trudeau responded by congratulating Singh for his entry into the Commons, before touting the government's record on fighting poverty.

Singh's remarks echoed the mood of the House on a crucial day when the prime minister beleaguered by the resignations of his two key cabinet colleagues.

Speculations are rife that the last budget of the Trudeau government with an eye on the general elections in October is expected to have several attractions for the middle class.","Indian-origin Jagmeet Singh creates history, becomes first non-white leader of Canada Parliament",Business Today,https://www.businesstoday.in/current/world/indian-origin-jagmeet-singh-creates-history--becomes-first-non-white-leader-of-canada-parliament/story/329428.html

Raising questions about affordable housing, climate change and the SNC-Lavalin affair, Singh became the first racialized leader in Canada to take a seat in the Commons.

""I think about growing up as a kid I would never imagine someone that looked like me running to become prime minister,"" said @TheJagmeetSingh after taking his seat as an MP and becoming the first racialized party leader in Canada's House of Commons.

Singh placed his hand over his heart and was greeted with a warm ovation from all sides as he walked into the Commons before the daily question period.

Singh took his seat, along with two other candidates elected in federal byelections held on Feb. 25, Liberal Rachel Bendayan and Conservative Scot Davidson.

Singh's first words as an elected MP were about last week's terrorist attack in New Zealand.

""I want to begin by expressing our solidarity with the people of New Zealand who are mourning the attack on Muslim brothers and sisters... in Christ Church,"" Singh said.

He then launched into his first question about housing in his new riding of Burnaby-South.

""I met a mom in Burnaby. She bought a home, but cannot afford to live there anymore. Her daughter has a good job, but only gets by because she lives in the basement. Her son does not see a future. Like too many Canadians, he has lost all hope,"" Singh said.

""However, the prime minister is telling families like theirs to wait for help. I believe that better is possible. Will the government commit to building half a million new affordable homes?""

Trudeau responded by congratulating Singh for his entry into the Commons, before touting the government's record on fighting poverty.

""I hope (Singh) and his party will support the work our government has done to lift hundreds of thousands of children across this country out of poverty,"" Trudeau told the Commons. ""We lowered taxes on the middle class and raised them on the wealthiest one per cent and indeed to end boil water advisories in so many communities across the country with more to do. These are the things we will continue to work on and we look forward to his support in creating a better and fairer Canada for everyone.""

Singh asked three other questions in French and English about climate change, and the recent controversy over the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, which has plunged Trudeau's government into a political crisis.

On climate change, Trudeau said that his government was taking action after previous Liberal and Tory governments had not done so.

""We have put a price on pollution. We have proceeded with a historic plan to protect the ocean, to protect the land,"" Trudeau said in French ""We have made record investments in renewable energy, in greener solutions for our businesses and entrepreneurs.""

The prime minister added that the government would continue its efforts, saying that the only way to protect the environment is to create economic growth at the same time, prompting a rebuke from Singh.

""Environmental leaders don't buy pipelines,"" Singh said.

In his last two questions, Singh pressed Trudeau to launch a public inquiry into allegations that the prime minister had pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin so that the Quebec engineering firm could get a plea deal instead of going through a criminal trial on corruption and fraud charges.

Trudeau, who has suggested that jobs would be at risk at SNC-Lavalin if it is forced to undergo a trial, responded by saying the issue was about the economy. The prime minister said that Canadians have created over 950,000 jobs since his government was first elected in 2015.

""We are of course going to make sure that we continue to maintain the trust and confidence that Canadians have in their institutions and why we are happy to answer all the various questions going on,"" Trudeau said. ""We will continue to stand up for jobs.""

Speaking to reporters outside the Commons, Singh said he felt ""humbled"" and ""blown away"" by the role he has been granted.

""I take that responsibility really seriously and I’m going to use every opportunity I get to make sure that Canadians know I’m on their side,"" he said. ""I’m going to fight for housing, for fighting climate change, make sure Canadians have access to medication. I’m going to make sure I use this role with the weight and responsibility that I feel...

""I think about growing up as a kid I would never imagine someone that looked like me running to become prime minister. That would never be in the world of my imagination. Standing in the chamber today asking a question directly to the prime minister, I think a lot of maybe young people out there who didn’t see themselves reflected might believe that if I could run the country maybe I can do anything. If I could have in some way broken down some barriers for people I would have done something good in my life.""

So keep this in mind while reading the results of a Nanos Research poll posted today that has the federal NDP – led by new Burnaby South MP Jagmeet Singh getting a pretty big bump in support.

The latest Nanos federal ballot tracking has the Conservatives at 35.5 per cent, followed by the Liberals at 32.6 per cent, the NDP at 19.9 percent, the BQ at 3.2 per cent, the Greens at 7.7 per cent and the People’s Party of Canada (PPC) at 0.5 per cent.

The NDP for the longest time has been mired at 13 to 14 per cent, with the party also struggling to raise money.

So to have a showing at nearly 20 per cent is to be considered positive news. The CBC’s poll tracker – which aggregates all publicly available polling data – has the NDP at 15.9 per cent.

The bad news for Singh is the other number Nanos had.

Nanos tracking has Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as the preferred choice as PM at 30.3 per cent of Canadians followed by Scheer (27.3%), Singh (8.9%), May (7.2%) and Bernier (2.8%). Twenty-two per cent of Canadians were unsure whom they preferred.

So Singh is way down the list and has a lot of work to do. Things could get better now that he is an MP and gets to speak in the House of Commons. He needs to build his profile and fast because October is getting closer and closer.

Singh is getting huge assists from Trudeau with SNC-Lavalin and Scheer with his blunder after the New Zealand massacre.

Let’s see what he can do with these missteps.

For theNanos poll, the data is based on a dual frame (land + cell-lines) random telephone interviews using live agents of 1,000 Canadians using a four week rolling average of 250 respondents each week, 18 years of age and over. The random sample of 1,000 respondents may be weighted by age and gender using the latest census information for Canada. The interviews are compiled into a four week rolling average of 1,000 interviews, where each week the oldest group of 250 interviews is dropped and a new group of 250 interviews is added.

A random telephone survey of 1,000 Canadians is accurate ±3.1 percentage points, plus or minus, 19 times out of 20.","NDP surges in poll, but Jagmeet Singh's own rating stays in single digits",Burnaby Now,https://www.burnabynow.com/opinion/blogs/ndp-surges-in-poll-but-jagmeet-singh-s-own-rating-stays-in-single-digits-1.23668370

This is not a political memoir. It's a story of family, love, and courage, and how strengthening the connection between us all is the way to build a better world.

Jagmeet Singh was elected leader of the federal NDP in 2017 and, more recently, the Member of Parliament (MP) for the riding of Burnaby South. At a campaign event in September 2017, a disruptive heckler hurled accusations his way. He responded by calmly calling for all Canadians to act with ""love and courage"" in the face of hate. His response drew widespread attention and praise.

""This book is the story of my family and my personal experiences growing up—sometimes difficult ones. I often felt alone, unworthy, ashamed. I hope this book helps some people feel less alone and know that they deserve love and happiness, no matter what they've gone through,"" says Jagmeet Singh.

Jagmeet Singh is the leader of the New Democratic Party and Member of Parliament for the riding of Burnaby South. Born in Scarborough, Ontario, he lived briefly with his grandparents in his family's native Panjab, India, as a child before moving with his parents to St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, and later to Windsor, Ontario. He studied law at Osgoode Hall in Toronto, Ontario, and practiced as a criminal defence lawyer in Brampton. He was elected to the Ontario legislature as an MPP in 2011 and became the Ontario NDP deputy leader in 2015. He was elected the leader of the federal NDP in 2017.

Sporting a bright yellow turban, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh entered the House of Commons for the first time as an MP Monday to loud cheers.

Singh is the first minority leader in the Commons in Canadian history.

The leader of the New Democrats had been left out of the political theatre of question period and he wasn't able to have an office on Parliament Hill.

Singh won his new Burnaby South seat in a February byelection sparked by the departure of former NDP MP Kennedy Stewart, who ran for mayor of Vancouver.

New Democrats are hoping Singh's presence in the House of Commons will help the party turn the page on a difficult period, marked by challenges with morale and fundraising.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Wilson-Raybould's testimony underscored his party's calls for an independent inquiry to find out the truth of what happened between the former attorney ...,"OTTAWA — Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called on Justin Trudeau to resign Wednesday, saying former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould's troubling testimony about SNC-Lavalin proved the prime minister has lost the moral authority to govern.

Scheer threw down the gauntlet immediately after a three-hour Commons' justice committee meeting in which Wilson-Raybould said she felt pressure from Trudeau and others to head off a criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

""Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this country now that Canadians know what he has done,"" Scheer said. ""And that is why I am calling on Mr. Trudeau to do the right thing and to resign.""

But Trudeau quickly rebuffed Scheer's demand as he touted his government's record defending jobs and ""the independence of our judiciary,"" adding Canadians will decide later this year whether to re-elect the Liberals or hand power to the Conservatives.

The back-and-forth marked the latest escalation in what has already been the most explosive political challenge facing the Trudeau government during its more than three years in power. The Official Opposition very rarely calls on a prime minister to resign.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Wilson-Raybould's testimony underscored his party's calls for an independent inquiry to find out the truth of what happened between the former attorney general and members of Trudeau's inner circle.

During her testimony, Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she withstood four months of relentless pressure to reverse a decision not to make a plea-bargain-type deal with SNC-Lavalin. She said the pressure came from Trudeau and other senior Liberal officials.

Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she believed the pressure, which also included ""veiled threats"" from the country's top civil servant, Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick, was inappropriate. But she added she did not think it was illegal.

Scheer nonetheless demanded Trudeau's resignation and called for the RCMP to launch a criminal investigation into what the Liberal government did to help SNC-Lavalin, which is facing criminal charges related to allegedly corrupt dealings in Libya.

""Jody Wilson-Raybould tells the story of a prime minister who has lost the moral authority to govern,"" Scheer said.

""A prime minister who allows his partisan, political motivations to overrule his duty to uphold the rule of law. A prime minister who doesn't know where the Liberal Party ends and where the government of Canada begins.""

The Conservative leader also called for Wernick to resign and encouraged the Liberal cabinet, which is scheduled to present a federal budget next month, to find a way to govern the country in a non-partisan way without the prime minister.

Scheer did not say what he would do if Trudeau refused to resign, such as calling a non-confidence vote.

For his part, Singh said Wilson-Raybould's testimony painted a picture of a prime minister and other members of government who were willing to disregard the rule of law and were more interested in helping powerful friends than average Canadians.

While the NDP leader said Trudeau and others may eventually have to step down, he said that determination should come after a public inquiry is held to get the bottom of what really happened.

Trudeau, however, indicated during a Liberal party event in Montreal a short time later that he had no intention of resigning. He rejected Wilson-Raybould's version of events, saying he and his staff ""always acted appropriately and professionally.""

He said Canadians will have ""a very clear choice in a few months"" in the October election about who they want to form government.

""There will be a clear choice to be made between the Liberal Party, this government that ... has consistently stood up for Canadian jobs, consistently defended Canadian jobs while defending our institutions and the independence of our judiciary,"" he said.

""And on the other hand there is a choice of the party that is still very much the party of Stephen Harper. That continues to attack, to divide, to play politics with big issues and (thinks) the best way to create economic growth is still to give advantages to the wealthiest.""

Following Wednesday's budget, NDP Leader Ryan Meili took aim at the province's growing debt. It will rise by $1.8 billion and is projected to reach $21.7 billion in total by next year.

Former Premier Brad Wall told CBC in Dec. 2008, ""whenever I leave here from this wonderful office or the people ask me to leave from this wonderful office, I would like to walk away from a debt-free Saskatchewan.""

That did not happen. Later in Wall's tenure, his government ran deficit budgets, peaking at a $1.2 billion deficit in 2016.

Jim Farney, head of politics and international studies at the University of Regina, said debt may not be the issue it once was, as when Wall's Saskatchewan Party government started to pay it down early in its mandate.

""People, as individuals, borrow more debt than ever so they're really comfortable with it. When governments are in a fairly solid place it's not as scary as it was 20 years ago,"" Farney said.

Stakeholders like union representatives, big city mayors and advocates for mental health did not criticize the government In the immediate aftermath of the budget as they have in some past years. Many used the 2017-18 budget as a barometer, with this year's budget looking boring by comparison.

Farney said the lack of criticism was noticable.

""Meili had a harder row to hoe this budget, one that everybody is sort of okay with,"" Farney said.

""I think the NDP is in a hard spot. It has to make a decision. Does it worry about debt? They were also referencing, 'we don't like the PST being higher that's $800 a household a year but we also want more services.' It's really hard to have all three of those at the same time.""

Sask. Finance Minister Donna Harpauer laughs while taking questions from reporters during the budget briefing. She has said she likes a ""boring budget"". (Bryan Eneas/CBC News)

Budget addresses some NDP issues

Whether intentionally or not, the 2019-20 budget hit on several issues the NDP has asked the government to address.

So far during this spring sitting of the legislature, the NDP has raised changing the potash royalty structure and making a temporary mental health assessment unit in Saskatoon permanent.

While the province is still pressing pause on a royalty review, it made changes to the Potash Production Tax which will generate an extra $117 million in government revenue.

It also boasts its ""largest commitment"" to mental health and addictions — $402 million, an increase of $30 million — which includes making that temporary assessment unit permanent.

Farney said that while the NDP has raised the potash tax review and mental health issues, they are not new.

""If you look back think back to the Sask. Party leadership race [mental health] was an issue they talked about then are they probably happy to take an issue away from the opposition,"" he said.

""I think these are conversations we've been having for a while. It's not simply stealing ideas.""

The NDP has also asked about a new hospital in Prince Albert. Lo and behold, the government announced $2.5 million for an initial design of the Victoria Hospital in Wednesday's budget.

No 'thunderbolt' in 2020-21 budget

Looking ahead into the political crystal ball, Farney said to expect a larger surplus than projected and modest promises with an October 2020 election looming.

""They will continue to do what they've done, which is to under-promise and over-deliver. I'd expect to see a bit more money than they thought they would have come next spring, which conveniently, is right in the lead up to that election eason.""

Mackenzie Thomason is a resident of Fredericton, and takes over from Jennifer McKenzie, who stepped down from her position as party leader last month,

McKenzie, who was acclaimed as party leader in August 2017, resigned after party members voted to have a leadership convention to replace her.

Thomason was selected by the party’s riding representatives and executive over the weekend at a party meeting in Miramichi, N.B. He will now take the reins of the party until a leadership convention is held, which is slated sometime before the end of August.

The 21-year-old ran in the riding of New Maryland-Sunbury during the 2018 election. He placed fifth, earning 143 votes behind a packed field of candidates from the Progressive Conservatives, People’s Alliance, Liberal Party, and Green Party.

The NDP did not win any seats during the 2018 election, despite running candidates in all of the 49 ridings.

A bio provided by the NDP party during the election describes Thomason as passionate about health care and education.

Ganley, who later became Alberta's justice minister, rode a big orange wave that swept her and other New Democrats to power in a massive, historic upset.

In Calgary-Buffalo, her Progressive Conservative opponent Terry Rock spent $92,000 on the race. Ganley shelled out just $3,000 — and won. That works out to roughly 67 cents per vote.

The NDP won in the traditionally conservative fortress of Calgary on a shoestring budget in 2015, clinching 15 of 25 seats, despite being outspent in every riding. Rachel Notley's popularity soared as voters soured on the PC dynasty that was besieged by claims of arrogance and entitlement.

'A different feeling'

This time around, New Democrats say they're better organized with a deeper war chest to wage a more meaningful contest on the ground in Calgary. Ganley now has a campaign manager, headquarters, funding and a small army of volunteers.

""There's a different feeling as well,"" she says. ""There's a lot of momentum. People are coming through the doors volunteering their money, their time to take signs, whereas last time, we didn't have that going on.""

But Jason Luan, a former Progressive Conservative who lost his seat to the orange wave in Calgary-Hawkwood in 2015, says he's seeing no evidence things have changed as he campaigns for the UCP in the redrawn riding of Calgary-Foothills.

It's déjà vu , says UCP candidate

Luan says he hasn't seen much of a presence from the local NDP candidate, while campaign materials emphasize Notley as the brand, rather than the party.

""It's like they're wanting to redo what they did last round, betting everything on this one person, Rachel Notley,"" he says.

Luan's defeat in 2015 was a striking upset in Calgary. He was an incumbent MLA who spent $73,600 defending his seat, but he was toppled by the NDP's then-21-year-old Michael Connolly, who spent $840 in cash and in-kind donations. Connolly is not running this time.

Brandy Payne, another New Democrat who is not running again, had a $740 budget when she defeated one-time Tory cabinet minister Jonathan Denis, who marshalled a war chest of more than $85,000.

Like many other PCs in 2015, Denis had fundraised on his own, having amassed $30,000 from individuals and corporations who contributed more than $250 each.

Not a single NDP candidate in Calgary had raised any money. All of their financing came from the party.

Dirks outspent all Calgary NDP candidates combined

According to campaign filings, NDP candidates in Calgary spent a total of $135,800 in 2015, which is less than what the PCs spent on a single riding — Gordon Dirks shelled out $157,000 on his unsuccessful bid for Calgary-Elbow.

In total, PC candidates in Calgary spent a stunning $1.8 million.

David Stewart, a political science professor at the University of Calgary, says the NDP became better at fundraising in government, while also making it more difficult for opponents to raise and spend money. The Notley government banned corporate donations, which the PCs traditionally relied upon, and limited candidate spending in each riding to $50,000, a cap many PCs exceeded in 2015.

The New Democrats say things have also changed on the ground. They say that across the province, not just in Calgary, they've already quadrupled the number of volunteers they had at the end of the 2015 race and expect to keep growing.

Political analysts say the April 16 vote will be fought largely on the leadership and policies of UCP Leader Jason Kenney and NDP Leader Rachel Notley, which makes local riding contests less important. (Canadian Press)

Similarly, they say they had 21,000 campaign signs in place across Alberta as of Wednesday, compared with 21,200 signs that were up at the end of the 2015 contest.

""In terms of organization, it's night and day,"" says NDP incumbent Craig Coolahan, who clinched the Calgary-Klein seat in 2015 after spending less than $3,800, compared with PC Kyle Fawcett's nearly $68,000.

'Didn't matter last time'

Stewart says so-called ground game — door-to-door canvassing, identifying supporters and getting them to the polls — can make a difference in close races, not in lopsided ones.

But he predicts the April 16 vote will be based largely on the differences in policy and leadership between the NDP and UCP, which means ""the local candidate races are going to rank a very distant third.""

Barry Cooper, who also teaches political science at the University of Calgary, says he doubts the New Democrats will be able to harness a stronger organization on the ground to secure the same level of voter support they received in 2015.

Cooper says the NDP is defending a record in government while facing very different conservative opponents. He says it means each candidate's level of spending may not be enough to sway the vote.

EDMONTON—A progressive and a conservative walk into a bar.

With Alberta's election set for April 16, The Star met with NDP and UCP student groups at the University of Alberta to talk politics and policy over pool.

There’s no punchline. It’s just a Thursday afternoon and University of Alberta political science students Jeffrey Swanson and Nick Kalynchuk are cued up to talk politics over pool at Dewey’s, a student lounge on campus, a few days before Rachel Notley dropped the writ, kicking off province’s 30th general election. More than just scholars, both are members of political student groups — one with the New Democratic Party and the other with the United Conservative Party. Swanson and Kalynchuk each promote their parties, teach students about their policies, and try to raise awareness about political processes among their peers — both with their respective groups, and lately, together. But none of this is to say they don’t have a sense of humour about it.

Kalynchuk has been collaborating with Swanson, a member of the University of Alberta NDP, on a project that would see political forums hosted at schools across Edmonton, hoping to teach young people about the parties and how to get involved in government right out of high school. Despite standing with parties on opposite sides of the floor, both admit that they’re generally on the same page when it comes to social issues. But as students, there is at least one polarizing point that divides them — optional membership in student associations.

Article Continued Below

According to the UCP’s 2018 Policy Declaration, post-secondary students should be able to opt out of student associations like the University of Alberta Students’ Union, which advocates for and provides programming and services for its members. Recalling the Ontario Progressive Conservatives’ recent decision to cut tuition costs by 10 per cent, which included shifting several mandatory “ancillary” fees to optional ones (including students’ union dues), Swanson was concerned the policy would decimate the ability of student associations to operate. “Think about it this way: We have a gym membership fee, right? It funds the operation of the gym on campus. So if a bunch of students start pulling out of that, what happens to the quality that’s going to go down to the students who are using it?” Swanson said. “It’s almost pitting students against each other, fighting to get the certain services that the students’ union offers.” But on Kalynchuk’s ears, the NDP supporter’s appeal might as well have hit felt. “No,” the conservative student responded. “It gives students’ unions incentives to try to provide better services or more wide-reaching services that everybody would find a use for. “If students aren’t using the services that students’ unions provide, then why should they be paying for it?” Recognizing that leaving the membership option open to students could create an existential problem for students’ associations, Kalynchuk said it could also save cash-strapped students an added expense. According to the university’s office of the registrar, student union-dedicated and membership fees for a full-time student add up to about $96 per term for the 2018-19 year. While Swanson agreed that the students’ union could do more to encourage use of its programs and services, and make them more appealing to a wider range of students, he was quick to highlight the organization’s role as a representative body for members. “It’ll also affect the students’ union’s ability to advocate to government officials, or to the board of governors, or to whomever they need to advocate for our rights,” he added. Recently, lobbying efforts of students’ associations across the province culminated in the Alberta government’s introduction of the bill to regulate tuition increases, which took effect in February. Halfway through the pool game, the students agreed that there was no room for a middle ground on the issue. How the proposed policy will play out depends on who Albertans, including students, vote in on April 16. For Kalynchuk, the issue is black and white, and one of the reasons for the political divide between parties. But that doesn’t bother Swanson, who recognizes that disagreement is part of the political process. “Everybody who gets involved in politics believes that they are trying to actively help their community,” Swanson explained, before turning to his opponent. “I know that’s probably why you support the UCP — you want a better Alberta. All of us here want a better Alberta. “There’s just different ways of doing that.” with files from Canadian Press Hamdi Issawi is an Edmonton-based reporter covering the environment and energy.

As the Alberta provincial election campaign kicks off, Rachel Notley's New Democrats are in a tough spot. They trail the United Conservatives by a significant margin and the polls suggest the NDP would be booted from office if the election were held today.

But the election is still more than three weeks away and there is reason for Notley to believe her fortunes could improve. The trend line is inching in her direction and she's more popular than her party; UCP Leader Jason Kenney, her chief rival, is less popular than his.

Nevertheless, the New Democrats have a serious challenge ahead of them. That trend line has a long way to go before the election looks competitive, let alone one the NDP is in a position to win.

The CBC's Alberta Poll Tracker, an aggregation of all publicly available polling data, puts the United Conservatives ahead with 50 per cent support among decided voters, followed by the New Democrats at 35.3 per cent.

The Alberta Party trails at a distance with 7.4 per cent, while the Liberals are polling at 4.8 per cent of the vote.

This is not significantly different than where things stood on election night four years ago. The Progressive Conservative and Wildrose parties, which merged to form the UCP in 2017, combined for 52 per cent of the vote in 2015, only two percentage points higher than where the UCP stands today. The NDP, which captured 40.6 per cent of the vote, is down only about five points — still putting it on track for the second best performance in the party's history.

But the lack of a divided right changes the electoral math dramatically. With current levels of support, the Alberta Poll Tracker estimates the UCP would win between 61 and 76 seats — far more than the 44 needed to secure a majority government. The NDP would win between 11 and 25 seats, with the Alberta Party and Liberals in the running for no more than one apiece.

A polling error of the same magnitude as the one that occurred in the 2012 election — when Wildrose was given a wide lead in the last polls of the campaign, only for the PCs to hold onto to power — if repeated in Alberta next month, would still only put the UCP and NDP roughly tied. Even that scenario would be unlikely to re-elect the New Democrats due to their concentration of support in Edmonton.

NDP's strength in Edmonton, UCP everywhere else

That is where Notley's party still has its greatest strength. The Alberta Poll Tracker puts the NDP at 44.6 per cent in the city, with the UCP a few points back at 40 per cent. That level of support would likely divide Edmonton between the two parties in terms of seats.

But in the rest of the province, the UCP holds sway. In Calgary, Kenney's party is ahead by about 22 points in the Poll Tracker, with 54 per cent support compared to 32 per cent. That puts every seat in range of the UCP, while the New Democrats are in contention to hold just a handful of theirs.

Outside of the two cities, the United Conservatives are ahead by about 27 points. With between 28 and 31 seats, the rural areas of the province alone could put the UCP three-quarters of the way to a majority government.

Thin silver linings for the NDP

However, there are some silver linings for Notley in the numbers.

The most important one is that she is a plus for her party while Kenney is a minus. A Leger survey conducted between March 7 and 12 found the two party leaders virtually tied on the question of who Albertans think would make the best premier, with Notley at 33 per cent and Kenney at 32 per cent.

Taking into account the undecideds in the Leger poll on both the voting intentions and best premier questions, this suggests that Notley is about four percentage points more popular than the NDP. Kenney is two points less popular than the UCP.

The difference was even starker in an Ipsos/Global News poll conducted between Mar. 15 and 17. It found Kenney at 33 per cent on the best premier question and Notley not far behind at 30 per cent, but again this suggests that Notley scores two points higher than the NDP among all voters. Kenney scores nine points worse than the UCP.

The hope for the NDP is that Notley is able to pull her party's support up while Kenney drags the UCP's down. This is clearly the party's strategy in the campaign so far, as the NDP leader's name takes prominence in the party's branding and her political attacks target Kenney personally.

The trend lines are also heading in a positive direction for the NDP, if marginally so. Leger puts the party up two points since last year, while ThinkHQ shows it up eight points since the end of 2017.

The inevitability of the UCP?

But the margin the NDP has to overcome remains enormous. While Kenney's personal popularity doesn't help the United Conservatives, the unpopularity of the NDP government might prove too much of an anchor weighing Notley down. In the Ipsos survey, just 31 per cent of Albertans said the NDP deserved re-election — losing numbers in a two-horse race.

The impact of the latest controversies surrounding Kenney's successful bid for the UCP leadership have yet to be fully recorded in the polls. They could sap UCP support further. But the 2018 Ontario election campaign, which ended with Doug Ford's Progressive Conservatives defeating Kathleen Wynne's Liberals, showed that unpopular opposition leaders hobbled by controversy can still win big when voters want to see the incumbent government ousted.

The UCP has led in voting intentions since it was created and not once since coming to power have the New Democrats matched their 2015 election score in the polls. Even that probably wouldn't be enough to secure a victory when the right is no longer divided.

The potential for Notley to turn this into a competitive race exists. But she has a long way to go to cast doubt on the inevitability of a victory by Jason Kenney and the United Conservatives.",Rachel Notley's NDP starts Alberta campaign with big hill to climb,cbc.ca on MSN.ca,https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/politics/rachel-notleys-ndp-starts-alberta-campaign-with-big-hill-to-climb/ar-BBV2YEb

In a news release issued Saturday, the NDP said Jeremy Wong “praised and promoted a conversion therapy program called Living Waters.” Conversion therapy is a controversial practice that seeks to change an individual’s sexual orientation to heterosexual.

Sarah Hoffman, who is running for re-election with the NDP in Edmonton-Glenora, said there are “a number of very clear ties between work he’s done and work that they’ve done indeed that is conversion therapy and is harmful.”

”These views are harmful and hurtful, and could have really lasting negative impacts on Albertans,” Hoffman said in an interview.

But Wong says he is not affiliated with the group formerly called Living Waters Canada, now known as Journey Canada, and that he does not support conversion therapy in any form. The UCP also pointed to a statement from Journey Canada, which says the organization does not seek to change the sexual orientation of the people who participate in its programs.

“I am not formally affiliated with the group in question, although I have attended some events in the past,” Wong said in a prepared statement. “In particular, I attended some spiritual support groups for adults that provide a safe and accepting place for people to share together.”

The NDP also drew criticism from Alberta Liberal Leader and Calgary-Mountain View candidate David Khan, who said the government has not acted to ban conversion therapy, whereas his party has been calling for an immediate ban.

A Living Waters Canada annual report from 2013 lists programs including a course for young adults “on healing in relationships and sexuality,” support groups offering “spiritual support to individuals and family members dealing with sexual addiction, spousal infidelity and same-sex attraction,” and one-day seminars “for ministering to those facing sexual addiction, unwanted same-sex attraction, and relationship struggles.”

In the same report, Wong is quoted describing Living Waters as a program “that provides just what we need, a place of safety and love, a place to heal, a place where we can welcome Jesus into the wounds of the heart.”

”I myself participated in the Living Waters program and have benefited deeply in my soul,” the quote reads. “Since then, I have encouraged many church members to attend and I also continue to draw upon the teaching and experience I received in Living Waters into my own ministry context.”

Wong said he does not support and would not participate in any conversion therapy activity.

”I believe that all must be respected and treated with dignity, and that coercion has no place in our society,” Wong said in the statement provided by the UCP.

A June 2018 statement on conversion therapy on Journey Canada’s website states that: ”As a discipleship ministry, we do not seek to change the sexual orientation of the people who participate in our programs.”

”Journey Canada understands the painful legacy of conversion or reparative therapy for sexual minorities. This means that while we are firmly committed to a traditional Christian understanding of sexuality, we reject any program that promises change in sexual orientation or makes orientation change a goal.”

Journey Canada’s website states the group “follows an orthodox Christian understanding of sexuality, including God’s plan for sexual relations between a man and a woman within marriage.”

Hoffman said Alberta created a working group to develop recommendations on how government can end conversion therapy in the province.

“Right now, I believe that no health professional is able to do any type of conversion therapy in accordance with their college and their professional practices, but there certainly are some questions about how we can make sure that the harmful practice is ended in Alberta, because we know that people in positions of trust have encouraged people to participate in these types of programs,” Hoffman said.

Khan said he’s disturbed by the NDP’s allegations against Wong.

“If this is true, it’s really disturbing, because conversion therapy is a highly damaging, abhorrent practice that any LGBTQ individual should not have imposed on them, and especially no vulnerable LGBTQ youth should be submitted to this kind of fake theory that your sexuality can be changed from gay to straight,” he said in an interview.

But Khan also criticized the NDP and said his party has been calling for a ban on conversion therapy since 2016. He said instead of banning conversion therapy, the NDP government “decided to kick it down the road five months for so-called study until after the election.”

Hoffman said in February that Albertans “deserve to trust” that any measures to end conversion therapy are “as strong as possible” and will withstand legal challenges.

In September, UCP Leader Jason Kenney said he would consider supporting a bill banning conversion therapy if it was brought forward.

Wong has been a pastor at the Calgary Chinese Alliance Church since 2011, according to information previously available on the church’s website, and holds a number of bachelor’s degrees and a master of public administration from the University of Calgary.

Notley announced Albertans will go to the polls April 16 just days after leaked emails outlined what’s been called a “kamikaze campaign” to ensure Kenney won the UCP leadership race.

Even with plenty of scandalous ammunition readily available, political analyst David Taras said the attacks by Notley and the NDP have begun to sound like “background music” instead of “the big orchestra” the party had hoped for.

“On Tuesday we were in the middle of this big scandal that it looked like this might be the thing that took Kenney out . . . but it seems to be slowly disappearing in the minds of voters,” Taras said.

The political centre in Alberta has “collapsed,” Taras said, pointing to polling data and the Notley vs. Kenney narrative playing out on the campaign trail.

Taras said those factors point to how the Liberals and Alberta Party “are stalled,” which doesn’t bode well for two parties in the shadow of an incumbent premier and a former MP, adding “unless there’s something I’m missing, they’re going nowhere fast.”

With the NDP trailing in the polls, Taras said running a negative campaign against Kenney will be “really counterproductive” for the NDP in the long run, adding Notley “should be talking about her accomplishments” and focus the messaging on a record of health-care improvements and reducing child poverty.

When looking back “at the week that was,” Marc Henry with political research firm ThinkHQ said pointing fingers may have been the right call for the NDP, whose pipeline progress he describes as “modestly positive.”

But the party will need to “pivot off of Kenney” if it hopes to hang on to the legislature, he said.

Henry believes the NDP’s negative ads and anti-Kenney messaging might succeed in sidelining voter skepticism about the NDP’s economic platform in the short term, but “they’re going to have to start talking about issues” to resonate with voters.

“If all you do in 28 days is say ‘Jason Kenney bad, Jason Kenney bad,’ eventually there’s a big segment of voters who are going to say, ‘wait a minute, you’re not talking about the issues that matter to me, so I’m going to stop listening to you,’ ” Henry said.

Taras called Calgary a key battleground in the campaign, and Mayor Naheed Nenshi said “this is not the first week that Mr. Kenney would have hoped for” and not a great start to “his campaign.”

“So let’s just see what happens over the next three weeks. We’ll see what Albertans are paying attention to,” Nenshi said. “I’m just encouraging Calgarians to pay attention, and particularly pay attention to policies that (are) important for Calgary.”

But they don’t truly mean it. It is clear at least ...,"Rachel Notley and the NDP keep talking about how they intend to remain positive during the current provincial election campaign. Nice goal. But they don’t truly mean it.

It is clear at least half of the New Democrats’ campaign (and perhaps more) involves smearing Jason Kenney and the UCP and trying to make voters afraid a vote for the UCP is a vote to return to some unspecified Dark Age.

How is that positive?

On Thursday, provincial NDP party president Peggy Wright sent a message to supporters insisting, “we can choose the politics of love, hope, and optimism.” (Okay, “love” seems a bit of a flaky platform for a political party, but it’s non-offensive.)

The flipside for Wright, though, was the UCP, who she claimed represents “anger, division and fear.”

A week earlier, another NDP executive in another message to party faithful, said supporters could be NDP “superheroes” by standing up to the “hatred, fear and division” being peddled (in the NDP’s minds) by the United Conservatives.

How is that kind of name-calling positive?

The minute you start insisting your opponents are angry hate- and fear-mongers preaching the politics of division, you have descended into negativity.

Of course, our all-positive, all-the-time NDP campaigners have also launched not one, but three anti-Kenney websites that are full of nothing but slurs against the UCP leader’s character.

And this week, the NDP also premiered a 10-minute video of decades-old Kenney remarks about same-sex marriage (remarks Kenney has on many occasions insisted he no longer agrees with) followed by interviews with people from San Francisco (where Kenney made the remarks) urging Albertans not to vote UCP.

You might agree with the NDP that bringing up remarks from Kenney’s distant past is necessary, that voters need to know some of the socially conservative positions the former federal cabinet minister held when he was a university student. Fair enough.

But you cannot claim such personal attacks are positive.

For his part, Kenney thinks the “U.S.-style attack politics” being employed by the NDP, shows how desperate that party truly is. Kenney says the NDP is not running on fumes, rather “it has run out of fumes.”

We agree.

Occasionally, NDP Leader Rachel Notley or one of her candidates tries to insist Alberta’s economy is improving despite all the evidence to the contrary (like a rising unemployment rate, stagnant private-sector wages, slumping housing and vehicles sales and massive flight of investment capital to business-friendlier jurisdictions.)

This week, Notley even tried to convince voters – again – that “we are closer than ever to getting the [Trans Mountain] pipeline built.”

All the negative attacks by the NDP are likely to backfire on them as the campaign unfolds and voters see Kenney is not the demon the New Dems claim. When voters see the UCP leaders is capable and intelligent, NDP credibility will take a big hit.

You may remember that ill-advised nugget of condescension then-Progressive Conservative leader Jim Prentice threw at the NDP’s Rachel Notley during the 2015 election debate.

It was a turning point in the campaign, cementing the transformation of Notley’s crew from upstart underdogs to legitimate election force.

Prentice never recovered from his gaffe. Math is difficult became a rallying point for the NDP, which went on to win its first majority government in Alberta.

Fast forward four years, and the phrase has taken on a different meaning.

In 2019, it turns out math really is difficult for the NDP.

Election math. As in, it’s difficult to calculate many realistic scenarios that add up to Notley winning a second term.

The race has barely begun and there’s a good chance it’s already over.

I don’t say this lightly or with any kind of merriment. No matter what party you might support, I believe it’s in Alberta’s best interests to have a real contest rather than a cakewalk.

But poll numbers released at the start of the campaign suggest the province is marching toward exactly that type of UCP coronation, and the only question left is how many jewels will be encrusted in Jason Kenney’s crown.

With some variance, the poll results essentially say the same thing. The NDP and UCP are waging a competitive battle in Edmonton, and almost nowhere else.

Battleground Calgary is more like Bloodbath Calgary at this point, where polls indicate the UCP has an edge of well over 20 points among decided and leaning voters.

(An Angus Reid Institute poll released Thursday showed a UCP lead of about half that size in the Calgary region.)

In the rest of Alberta, which includes rural areas and mid-size communities, the projected gaps are even more enormous. Other than Lethbridge, Red Deer and a couple of other areas that may still be in play, the UCP has this part of the province sewn up.

That gives Kenney a huge advantage to start the election.

Think of it this way.

Alberta has 87 ridings, about 35 of which can be characterized as distinctly rural. A total of 44 seats are needed to form a majority government.

In that sense, the election can be thought of like a hockey playoff series — a really long playoff series — in which the first team to secure 44 wins gets the trophy.

Because of their dominance in the rural ridings, the UCP is essentially starting off the series with something like a 35-0 lead. They need only nine more wins in the rest of the province to capture a majority.

This is why the math currently doesn’t work for the NDP.

All that said, its important to remember polls are snapshots of a particular moment in time, and have far from a perfect track record in predicting outcomes. Some methodologies are better than others, and it isn’t always easy to tell the difference.

As well, Notley suggested her party’s internal polling shows much more favorable movement toward the NDP, which is partly why she felt good about calling the election on Tuesday. (Trailing parties often say this, mind you.)

There’s also more than three weeks left in the race for stuff to happen, and the NDP leader has often been heard to say that campaigns matter.

The campaign in 2012 certainly did, when blunders by the Wildrose party allowed the PCs to stage a late comeback.

And so did the one in 2015, when Albertans finally realized they were sick of the PCs and saw a credible alternative in the NDP.

But Mount Royal University political scientist Duane Bratt suggests those two cases may have been exceptions in Alberta. Voters tend to forget the preceding decades, in which the province ploughed through a series of dull, conservative-dominated elections that were mere formalities, he said.

Of the current race, Bratt said the NDP may now have a sliver of hope from the “kamikaze” controversy that has put Kenney’s character and credibility under a cloud.

The polling published this week was largely conducted before emails surfaced Sunday indicating Kenney’s UCP leadership campaign in 2017 did — despite his repeated denials — collaborate with fellow candidate Jeff Callaway’s efforts to smear rival Brian Jean.

The polling was also conducted before Kenney’s cringe-worthy suggestion on Monday that such collaboration was “normal” campaign business.

Based on those developments, voting intentions may have already shifted, while further revelations about the scandal could come out.

Still, while the controversy is significant enough to put momentum on the NDP’s side, the hill Notley has to climb is likely too steep, Bratt said.

Trying to make up that ground with a campaign focused on Kenney’s credibility and anti-LGBTQ history is risky, since it can turn off as many voters as it attracts.

Negative campaigning has been shown to work if it contains a grain of truth, Bratt said, but is a tough sell right now for a province that has endured such long-term economic distress.

The election math is not yet impossible for the NDP.

But the equation that leads to an orange victory party on April 16 is becoming increasingly difficult to solve.

The NDP say they want “lower cellular fees and better coverage for all Canadians”, explaining “high speed internet and cellular services are a necessity for Canadians – and despite this, broadband access and wireless services are far from being affordable or reliable in Canada.”

The federal party says it wants wireless and internet access to be “declared essential” for everyone, regardless of income.

All companies “should be required to have a basic plan for internet and cell service that meets the essential needs of Canadians,” while adding “The government shouldn’t make big money auctioning off the right to transmit signals, while you pay the highest price.”

The website says Canadians “deserve leaders who will stand up to big cell and internet companies,” and of course the one you should know about is NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, as he “will fight to make your monthly bills more affordable.”

Singh and the NDP criticize the Liberal and Conservative parties for not doing anything about telecoms for decades, saying:

For decades, Liberal and Conservative governments have left cell phone and internet companies with very little regulation. The result is that 3 big companies – Bell, Rogers, and Telus – serve 90% of Canadians – and those companies are free to hike rates without competition. Despite receiving $50 million in subsidies, and $700 million in contracts from our government, these companies charge Canadians 30% more on average than people in France, Germany, and the UK.

The NDP wants Canadians to ‘share your story’ as a form on their website seeks you to vent about the following:

Massive roaming fees? Data overages bringing you down? Family plan still too much for your family? We all have nightmare stories when it comes to our cell phone and internet bills – what’s yours?







Those who decide to share the NDP message on Twitter or Facebook will see the following message pre-written for them:

Canadians shouldn’t have to pay some of the highest prices in the world for cell and internet service. @thejagmeetsingh & the NDP are fighting to make my monthly bills more affordable #cdnpoli

The current Liberal government also recently took aim at Canada’s ‘Big 3’, directing the CRTC to launch a ‘comprehensive review’ of wireless services and to also discuss MNVOs as another option to lower wireless prices.

Now, it looks like the NDP are following suit in trying to get your vote with the promise of lower wireless prices.

The next Canadian federal election is on October 21, 2019.

Trash Jason Kenney and trash him good.

Make the United Conservative leader into such a horrible person you could not possibly vote for him.

The Notley NDP doesn’t just think Kenney has bad ideas they think he is bad.

The NDP say he is not fit to be premier. They say he doesn’t have the character. They say he is cruel.

One day, Notley & Co. roll out 30 seconds of old video.

It’s Kenney from about 20 years ago talking about something from 30 years ago.

On the video Kenney says he was part of a campaign leading to a vote where the majority in San Francisco said No to a gay spousal law.

A voice in the video says he was stopping dying AIDS patients from seeing their same-sex partners in hospital.

The next day, Thursday, the Notley NDP release a 10-minute documentary where they put in a slightly longer video of Kenney followed by heart-wrenching interviews of people who lived through the AIDS crisis of 30 years ago.

The people interviewed are then shown the Kenney video. They don’t like it and say so.

The 10 minutes ends with those interviewed in San Francisco more or less saying don’t vote for Kenney. Then there’s a final quotation from Notley.

Now Kenney points out he volunteered at an AIDS hospice 30 years ago. He and others saw the vote campaign as being about the definition of marriage not about limiting partners from visiting loved ones in hospital.

Back then, says Kenney, almost every leader in the democratic world backed the traditional man-woman definition of marriage.

Kenney says he does not stand by his comments from long ago and he is against any discrimination. As the federal immigration minister he set up a program where gay men facing execution in Iran could come to Canada.

Well, this is where the election campaign has come and Kenney has clearly had enough.

The UCP leader speaks of what he believes the NDP is up to this week.

He speaks of the “overheated politics of personal destruction” and “U.S.-style attack politics” and an NDP government that’s “run out of fumes” and is desperate because “they know they have only four weeks left.”

“I think it’s sad that, in what may well be the dying days of this government, they’re embarrassing themselves,” says Kenney.

“I would ask them to think about the dignity of the offices they hold.”

Kenney says he’s not perfect. He’s made mistakes. He has said things he regrets.

But he says the Notley NDP are trying to change the channel from what Albertans think of as the big issues — jobs, the economy and pipelines.

Kenney expects the “fear and smear” to ramp up, telling us to wait until the last week of this ballot battle when it will get real hot.

In Calgary in the present, a long way from San Francisco, with the tall towers and the empty offices of downtown in the background, Kenney rolls out ugly economic statistics.

Kenney says Notley sold Alberta out to Justin Trudeau, with us paying a carbon tax and still no pipeline to the coast.

“If the premier wants to be judged on her effectiveness on pipelines I think she’d better watch out for the verdict of Albertans in four weeks.”

Kenney pledges if he’s premier and Trudeau’s No More Pipelines law goes through, Alberta will take the feds to court.

And if the B.C. government doesn’t play nice on the Trans Mountain pipeline Alberta will turn off the taps.

He will demand a fair deal for Alberta and, if push comes to shove, put equalization on the table.

Kenney advises Albertans not to be bamboozled by the Notley NDP.

“They thought the folks working in the office towers were a problem. They were the enemy,” says the UCP leader.

“They demonized the people who used to work in those office towers and that is one of the reasons they’re one-third empty today. The industry took the hint.”

All of this does not stop us from hearing the Stupid Question of the campaign.

Does Kenney condemn white supremacy?

Guess what. Kenney condemns white supremacists.

There wasn’t one question for those, including Notley, who claim Kenney allegedly cheated to win his party’s leadership.

It is obvious Kenney wants to clear the air, once and for all.

“Albertans deserve better than a premier and her ministers basically channelling the angry voices of Twitter.”

The announcement comes after United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney expressed direct support for the Springbank dam this week, saying that if elected, as long as the necessary approvals are given for the Springbank dam, the UCP would “expedite construction of this project without delay.”

Onlookers watch as the Bow River floods into the downtown core on June 22, 2013, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. NDP Leader Rachel Notley said money for flood infrastructure on the Bow would come from the NDP’s Climate Leadership Plan — which includes the provincial carbon tax — and would be spent over 10 years. ( DAVE BUSTON / AFP/GETTY IMAGES )

The statement sees the party change course after Kenney danced around questions about the project a week earlier, when he said only that the UCP is in favour of “the fastest path to flood mitigation.” The Springbank dam is intended to divert water from the Elbow River to an off-stream reservoir 15 kilometres west of Calgary near Springbank Rd. It’s run into several roadblocks that have pushed construction timelines back, pending a Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency review and completing consultations with Indigenous peoples. Calgary-Elbow UCP candidate Doug Schweitzer has been vocal about his support for the Springbank dam in recent days. He’s running for election in neighbourhoods hit hard by Calgary’s 2013 flood, and on Wednesday, he posted a video to Twitter saying he’s “so glad that we got clarity from our party that we support the Springbank dam. Let’s go get that built.”

But there has also been some confusion about the project among the UCP. Before the party’s latest statement, UCP Banff-Kananaskis candidate Miranda Rosin wrote on her Facebook page that she is a “vocal opponent” of the Springbank dam. The project has been controversial because it requires access to land that’s currently privately owned. Farmers and ranchers who live and work in the area have been fighting against government efforts to buy the land, saying other flood mitigation options should be considered instead. NDP Leader Rachel Notley said money for flood infrastructure on the Bow would come from the NDP’s Climate Leadership Plan — which includes the provincial carbon tax — and would be spent over 10 years. She said three options are being considered, including a new Glenbow Reservoir, a new Morley reservoir, and expanded storage at the Ghost Reservoir. Kenney has also attacked the NDP for taking too long to build infrastructure to prevent devastating floods in southern Alberta, like the one Calgary saw in 2013. He has said he wants to appoint an independent expert “on Day 1” of the UCP forming government to find out why construction of the Springbank dry dam has been delayed.

On Friday, Notley said the NDP has been moving forward with Indigenous consultation and land deals for the project. “We think that we’re pretty much back on track,” she said. “I know (Tsuut’ina) Chief Crowchild is not happy yet with the accommodations and the ultimate agreements we’ve made. We haven’t gotten there yet, but we’ve been working with him and meeting with officials from the Tsuut’ina band extensively.

Yesterday the party put out a press release headlined “Jason Kenney needs to come clean on his deal with big banks.” The star of this document was Alberta’s finance minister, Joe Ceci, who is running for re-election as an MLA in a new riding, Calgary-Buffalo. Ceci complains of UCP leader Kenney’s promise to reverse the corporate tax hike he introduced as treasurer, and speculates on the possibility of a conspiracy.

“What might surprise Albertans,” Ceci is quoted as saying, “is that Scotiabank is sitting on a detailed proposal to privatize ATB. I know this because I was asked to execute this proposal in the early days of our government. I said no. In many Alberta communities, ATB is the only game in town for financial services. Selling it off would mean branch closures and that will not happen on our watch.”

What surprises me is that we are just receiving this information from a minister in the first week of an election campaign

ATB, whose name began life as an acronym for the Alberta Treasury Branches, is the provincially-owned financial institution left over from Social Credit times that eludes constitutional niceties by carefully not calling itself a bank. What surprises this Albertan about Ceci’s press release is not that some bank has made an offer to buy ATB. The possibility of selling ATB is a constant point of discussion in Alberta, and probably every big Canadian bank has thought about bidding for it.

What surprises me is that we are just receiving this information from a minister in the first week of an election campaign. Right now the departments of the Alberta government are in what the Old Country calls “purdah.” Civil servants are not allowed to make any announcements or disclosures that would influence the election or jar financial markets. The NDP government, to its credit, just toughened the purdah rules — so much so that there has been some nervousness about allowing routine business to continue.

But the finance minister himself turns out not to feel bound by either the letter or the spirit of these rules. He has not only chosen to make a pretty major disclosure about the prior business of his department — a disclosure to which Albertans were not made privy before — but this disclosure has been set like a jewel within a slightly deranged partisan attack document. This would be a pretty obnoxious tactic even if it weren’t being used to sow manufactured rural terror, with help from the NDP’s social-media surrogates, about the fate of ATB.

Kenney was quick to offer reassurance that the ATB (you can tell I’m old because I use “the”) will remain a Crown corporation under a UCP government. This probably means that nobody will talk about privatizing ATB again for a while. But I would have been surprised, anyway, if it had come up. The Ralph Klein Conservatives got in some trouble for letting ATB make hair-raisingly dangerous but politically convenient loans, notably to the builders of West Edmonton Mall. They were eventually persuaded to put ATB on the path to independent day-to-day management and grown-up lending procedures. ATB now acts like a regular profit-making bank that just happens to support a lot of marginal rural branches, along with plenty of small-biz and ag lending, as a sort of professional specialty. That’s why there is political advantage to be found in churning up fear about it.

But nobody was ever willing to take the last step into privatization. Instead, a pattern emerged whereby successive Alberta governments, including the New Democratic one now beating the bushes for votes, would raise ATB’s legal lending limit from time to time in exchange for a little bit of timely Keynesian stimulus. An economist might call it a series of helicopter drops on the countryside.

Since the Alberta government owns ATB, the risk of this expanded lending falls ultimately on the Alberta taxpayer, but it appears nowhere in the ordinary Alberta budget. When financial rating agencies are going over Alberta’s public finances they have to devote special attention to ATB. But as long as the quasi-bank seems to be behaving sanely, they leave it off to one side.

Economists don’t like this much because if the ATB’s lending portfolio caught a cold, it would probably happen at a time when the rest of the Alberta treasury was in bed with flu. But it is a pretty sweet deal for Alberta finance ministers. Especially ones like Joe Ceci who are already juggling large explicit deficits.

But Day Two of the election campaign, Premier Notley told us to stay tuned to what Sarah Hoffman had to say.

Enter Hoffman, the NDP deputy premier, whose job in this good cop/bad cop movie is to be the bad cop.

You know the NDP strategy. Trash Jason Kenney and trash him good. Make the United Conservative leader into a scary, shadowy character voters won’t go anywhere near.

You know, the kind of guy you might see on a Most Wanted poster in the old movies.

So the Notley NDP go back to the archives and dust off some material we already saw when it made the political rounds a few months ago.

It is a few seconds of video from about 20 years ago. The subject is something from 30 years ago.

Yes, 30 years ago. No statute of limitations here.

In the video clip going on social media and TV, the young Kenney talks about his days on campus in San Francisco and how he “helped to lead an ultimately successful initiative which led to a referendum which overturned the first gay spousal law in North America.”

Yes, back in those days, the majority in San Francisco were on the same side as Kenney.

The video plays on, ominous music in the background.

A voice says Kenney bragged about stopping dying AIDS patients from seeing their same-sex spouses in the hospital.

More from the voice, telling us Kenney has been campaigning against people’s rights his whole life.

The voice asks the NDP question in this election campaign. Is this a premier?

By the way, the United Conservative question in this campaign is: Are you better off than you were four years ago?

Anyway, we all know Kenney’s views have changed. Newshound mention this fact. Hoffman says he’s not showing remorse.

She says Kenney on the video is bragging and boasting in making his statement of 20 years ago. Hoffman adds same-sex couples were denied hospital visitation rights.

“I believe Jason Kenney is unfit to be premier,” says Hoffman. “That video speaks volumes to his character.”

She uses words like cruel and hateful and talks about his smile.

Hoffman says she’s not sure why Notley is not doing this hit.

“I know why it’s me, I don’t know why it’s not her,” says Hoffman, when pushed by the press for not answering the question.

The deputy premier says the NDP will be sharing more information about the United Conservative leader.

Meanwhile, yours truly became a teeny tiny part of this mud wrestling scene when NDP bigshot Jeremy Nolais takes to Twitter and says your humble scribbler has an election strategy.

Me? A strategy?

Nolais, a supposed heavy hitter in the NDP braintrust, says little old me is trying to suppress “an ever-growing scandal that calls into question our open elections and Jason Kenney’s willingness to calmly lie to the people of Alberta.”

Is this so-called scandal an ever-growing one? Pray tell, what is the smoking gun? That Kenney’s people and supporters of a guy named Jeff Callaway sometimes worked together in the United Conservative leadership race.

That won’t be the decider at the ballot box for most folks. Unless more stuff comes out, this dog won’t hunt.

Ah, it’s only Day Two.

This is a day where a ThinkHQ nosecount shows the NDP way behind in Calgary and everywhere else in the province but Edmonton.

This is a day where Kenney once again takes aim at the carbon tax the Notley NDP didn’t tell us about in the last ballot battle, four years ago.

Imagine that.

The UCP leader once again vows to fight Trudeau and goes after Notley for lecturing Albertans about taking the bus and walking.

“This from a premier driven around in a gas-guzzling SUV.”

This is a day where Notley has an event at a fabricating plant and when the president of the company is asked if he supports the NDP he says “a lot of Albertans are questioning who to vote for next.”

Not exactly a ringing endorsement.

And this is a day where the NDP criticize Kenney and then quote former Wildrose leader Brian Jean.

The NDP and Jean. Strange bedfellows, indeed.

Notley once again speaks of Kenney lying and cheating to become his party’s leader.

“You can rest assured we will be taking a good, long, hard look at Mr. Kenney’s record.”

Fill yer boots.

Money Kaler, a Matsqui blueberry farmer, attended the meeting with his dad and brother who also work at the business. The family recently bought an additional 35 acres.

""Our goals are still, pending these changes, to basically farm that land and expand our farming operation,” said Kaler.

The issue the Kalers have relates to Bill 52, which has already been passed and restricts the size of new homes on properties within the Agricultural Land Reserve to less than 5400 sq. ft.

Kaler and his brother both plan on having children and want to continue living with their parents and working on the blueberry farm.

""Today we live in about a 4,000 sq.ft. house and it works for us, given the dynamic of our family,” he said. “But as generations start getting added on to our family, what do we do at that point? Where do we all go?""

BC Liberal leader Andrew Wilkinson and several of his MLAs held a town hall with farmers in Surrey to talk about another bill in the works. Bill 15 stipulates only governments can make requests to have land removed from the ALR to be used for other purposes.

""It is so unfair to people who've invested their lives to build up a farm and be successful and have the NDP come along and say forget it,” Wilkinson said.

He also encouraged the farmers to organize a protest in Victoria and further suggested they could dump several tons of manure on the lawn of the Legislature to make their point.

""We'll see if these farmers form the same opinion about what they're going to have to do to get any attention from the NDP at all,” he said after the town hall.

In a statement, Agriculture Minister Lana Popham accuses the BC Liberals of spreading misinformation.

“Exclusion applications already go through local government – that's not new,"" she said. ""All we're saying is that if you want to permanently pull land out of the protections of the Agricultural Land Reserve, it should be done as part of thoughtful community planning at the local level.”

Kaler agrees that steps need to be taken to protect agricultural land from being used for non-farming purposes, such as mega-mansion estates, but he disagrees with the government’s method.

""The intent was right but they've just targeted everyone and that was wrong,” he said.

“With more Albertans unemployed and the unemployment rate climbing higher yet again, it’s clear that the NDP plan simply isn’t working,” UCP MLA Ric McIver said in a March 8 news release. “High-tax, high-debt, anti-growth NDP policies are failing Albertans by hurting job creation.”

UCP Leader Jason Kenney shared a message on Twitter on March 9, saying: “The premier keeps telling Albertans that things are getting better but nearly 50,000 full-time jobs have been lost in the last four months alone.”

Is this true? Have that many jobs been lost in Alberta in the last four months? And are NDP policies at fault?

We desperately need to reignite our economy and get Alberta working. That's what the coming election is about. pic.twitter.com/IGtbhLyqdl — Jason Kenney (@jkenney) March 9, 2019

What is the allegation?

The UCP used Statistics Canada’s Labour Force Survey, which shows the number of full-time jobs in Alberta fell from 1,954,000 in November 2018 to 1,906,300 in February 2019, a net loss of 47,700.

A UCP spokesperson adds: “There are now 182,500 unemployed Albertans — 43,000 more than when the NDP took office… Alberta’s unemployment rate climbed to 7.3 per cent, the highest of any province outside of Atlantic Canada, and now even higher than Nova Scotia.”

What are the facts?

The UCP’s numbers are correct, but there are some important things to note:

While the province’s unemployment rate is high, Alberta also has the highest employment rate in Canada, sitting at 66.5 per cent in February 2019. To compare, Nova Scotia’s employment rate for the same month was 58.1 per cent.

“The unemployment rate measures how many people are looking for work as a share of a province or a city’s labour force,” said Trevor Tombe, an associate professor of economics and research fellow at the school of public policy at the University of Calgary. “So if people withdraw from the labour force — give up searching, for example — then they aren’t counted as unemployed.”

READ MORE: Alberta added 24,000 jobs in November, provincial unemployment drops to 6.3%

“Alberta has a high unemployment rate — certainly higher than it was prior to the recession and higher than many other provinces — but as a share of the population, more Albertans are employed than any other province by a pretty wide margin.

“Our employment rate is higher than anywhere else,” Tombe said. “But our unemployment rate is elevated despite that because so many more Albertans participate in the labour market than elsewhere.”

2. The four-month period the UCP is using (November 2018 to February 2019) also saw part-time employment increase by 21,000 jobs.

3. The margin of error for Statistics Canada’s Labour Force Survey is huge.

“Just to give you a sense of scale, in any given month, you should think of the estimate for full-time employment as +/- 28,000,” Tombe said. “Just like we look at a poll and we see that a certain party has a given amount of support +/- 3 or 4 points 19 times out of 20, that margin of error for full-time employment is +/- 28,000.”

WATCH BELOW (Jan. 8, 2019): When it comes to jobs in Alberta, what is really going on? Several headlines over the past few weeks have sent mixed messages. But they’re all true, using Statistics Canada numbers. Global News at Noon speaks to economist Trevor Tombe for some important context on the situation.

What do the experts say?

So, while the 48,000 number is accurate, Tombe says it doesn’t tell the whole story.

“It does show that full-time employment between November and February fell by 48,000, roughly,” he said. “Where that kind of misses the mark is that it’s kind of cherry-picking some of the dates.

“If you had instead looked at October to February, or December to February, you’d have got a number more around 15,000.”

READ MORE: Alberta unemployment steady at 6.7 % in August; Calgary has second highest unemployment rate in Canada

It’s more meaningful to look at longer-term trends in this kind of data, Tombe said.

“Recovery was fairly strong in 2017, with improvements across the board and large drops in the unemployment rate… But it’s fair to say the recovery has stalled at the end of 2018 as we go into 2019.”

READ MORE: Low oil prices to have negative effect on Canadian economy – but not as bad as 2015: BOC

And can changes in employment or unemployment rates be credited to or blamed on specific government? While parties of all stripes tend to make the correlation, Tombe says it’s a difficult jump.

“It’s not uncommon for opposition parties everywhere to blame governments every time bad economic news comes up and it is equally common for governments to claim credit for good news,” he said.

“I think both arguments are exaggerating the effect of policy on short-run movements in the economy.”

“For Alberta, the recession was not due to government policy; it was due to the big drop in the price of oil. And the recovery during 2017 was also not due to government policy. And the slowdown in the pace of recovery, I’d say has a lot more to do with market access concerns, and rising oil price differentials than any particular action taken by the Alberta government.”

WATCH BELOW (March 1): The United Conservative Party’s jobs creation plan would create a tax cut to encourage employers to hire, but its raising questions for some. Adam MacVicar reports.

What else should I know?

“When the price of oil collapsed from $100/bbl to $25/bbl, we made the decision to invest in the services that Albertans relied on and build the much-needed schools and hospitals to put Albertans back to work,” an NDP spokesperson told Global News.

“As a result, since the depths of the recessions, Alberta has created over 80,000 new full-time jobs, mostly in the private sector.

“Oil prices have been staying lower for longer and market access issues persists. That’s why our government is taking action by investing in upgrading our natural resources and diversifying our economy.”

“Liberal leader Andrew Wilkinson pans speculation tax at West Vancouver yacht club chat,” reported the North Shore News Thursday atop a report on his speech to the local chamber of commerce.

An Opposition leader who the populist-led New Democrats have framed as an elitist. Who played into the stereotype with a comment on the “wacky fun” of renting, which he later had to repudiate.

Now he chooses to deliver a speech on the admittedly half-baked speculation tax at the yacht club in West Vancouver of all places?

“Surprisingly, this isn’t satire written by me,” wrote Jeffrey Ferrier, a self-styled “progressive” and one of several who posted the story on Twitter.

“Wow,” returned Global TV correspondent Keith Baldrey, himself a columnist in the North Shore News. “Does no one do advance work for the Libs any more? A yacht club — especially the West Van one — is the last place a politician with an elitist image problem should go anywhere near.”

Stung, members of the Opposition caucus rode to Wilkinson’s defence.

“But this was a local chamber of commerce event,” protested former cabinet minister Rich Coleman. “When my chamber invites me I don’t tell them where to hold it. It is important to respect local volunteer groups, it is their decision.”

“Come on, Keith,” tweeted Michelle Stilwell, another former cabinet minister. “Why not focus on the issue of a half-baked speculation tax that doesn’t actually target speculators but makes 1.4 million British Columbians prove themselves otherwise?”

Picking up on the what-about-ism theme was former minister Shirley Bond: “How about when John Horgan calls (Liberal MLA) Jackie Tegart a ‘whiner’ for representing constituents and a bill introduced by (Liberal) Stephanie Cadieux is a ‘political stunt’? No comment???”

LISTEN: This week on In The House, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw discuss the latest in the SNC-Lavalin affair, as well as challenges facing Education Minister Rob Fleming on Surrey school portables and Vancouver school closures, as well as the future of the NDP minority government now that it has survived confidence votes on the throne speech and budget.

But as experienced politicians know — or should know — telling a reporter that he/she should be writing about something other than what he/she is writing about is not a proven media management strategy.

“The physical location/backdrop of a political leader’s appearance during an election campaign is chosen with deliberate, strategic care,” wrote Baldrey by way of reply to several Liberals. “That’s because they matter when it comes to shaping messages and image.”

Yet from this case and others, it would appear the Liberals can’t be bothered with optics, making it easier for opponents to define Wilkinson.

Before long, the exchange veered into ridicule.

When I wrote of the Liberals that “they do protest too much,” someone tweeted back: “I believe in West Vancouver it’s pronounced ‘doth.’”

Also riffing on the Liberal gaffe was one who posted a video of Thurston Howell III, the parody billionaire played by Jim Backus on the old Gilligan’s Island TV show.

The New Democrats played it for laughs as well.

“B.C. Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson sailed into the West Vancouver Yacht Club yesterday to say ahoy to about two-dozen members of the exclusive group,” read the press release from a government caucus that is still more quick-witted at the job of opposing than the official Opposition.

And so on, through Wilkinson “tying himself into knots” and “his priority is to buoy the richest two per cent and leave everyone else lost at sea,” and “instead of throwing people a lifeline, Wilkinson is making them walk the plank.”

Great fun unless you happen to be on the Wilkinson defence team.

Reaching, someone in Liberal ranks noticed that attorney general David Eby had spoken at the “ritzy” Vancouver Club, and wasn’t that the same thing?

Plus there was this, from Opposition house leader Mary Polak: “Someone should advise Horgan not to speak at the B.C. Fed convention.”

Both missed the point.

Getting cozy with the Vancouver Club is not one of the unfortunate stereotypes associated with Eby. That appearance by the wealth-taxing, lawyer-bashing attorney general was more of a case of a politician venturing into the lion’s den.

And the annual convention of the 500,000-member B.C. Federation of Labour is a somewhat more broadly based venue than the West Van yacht club, whomever is hosting.

A more apt comparison would be to Environment Minister George Heyman’s attendance at a celebratory dinner with anti-pipeline activists last January, just after he announced B.C. would restrict shipments of heavy oil from Alberta.

Not only did his government have to pull back the threat, but reporting on the appearance helped put Heyman in the activist camp himself.

Or consider how the story was played when Adrian Dix, who’d admitted forging a memo in the casino scandal, was caught without a ticket on SkyTrain.

As for Horgan, one of his vulnerabilities is a quick temper. Though he’s kept it in check lately, he made the news more than once when he lost it during his days in Opposition.

Every leader has weaknesses, some more unfortunate than others. A key political art is to turn one’s weaknesses into strengths, or failing that, to avoid reinforcing the stereotype.

Wilkinson knows very well that the NDP will indulge the class warfare theme every chance it gets.

“It’s a good way to generate stories about people who are deemed to be well off and how they are going to be kicked around a bit,” he told the chamber crowd. “That’s good politics for the NDP.”

Kicking Wilkinson around is even better politics for the New Democrats. Once more this week, he played right into their hands.

OTTAWA – High-speed internet and cellular services are a necessity for Canadians, despite this, broadband access and wireless services are far from being affordable or reliable in Canada. Today, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh introduced the NDP’s new website www.ndp.ca/lower-my-bill as a place for Canadians to share their story about internet and cellular fees.

“Canadians pay some of the highest prices for mobile wireless and broadband subscriptions in the world. This is wrong,” said Singh. “We believe that not only is broadband access essential, wireless services are too. They need to be affordable for all.”

For decades, Liberal and Conservative governments have relied on market forces and competitiveness to determine what Canadians pay for their cell phone and internet every month. Bell, Rogers, and Telus received close to 50 million in subsidies, had more than 500 meetings with the Liberal government and received more than 700 million in contracts from the federal government. In 2017, the profits of the ""Big Five"" totalled $7.49 billion, and their profit margins have reached an astonishing 46.2 percent.

“Canadians are paying skyrocketing prices while telecoms companies make billions in profits. Once again, Justin Trudeau is showing who’s side he’s on, and it’s not yours,” added Singh. “Canadians deserve a government who has the courage to stand up to the rich telecommunication companies and to use every tool available to make life more affordable for people.”

The NDP produced an ad and a 10 minute video posted on its social media about Kenney’s anti-gay marriage activism during his time as a student in San Francisco.

Both leaders responded to the tactic on Friday.

“We have two different visions for the future of this province and this is probably an historic election and the most important choice that Albertans will make in a generation,” says Alberta NDP Leader Rachel Notley.

“We haven’t and we have no intention to,” says UCP Leader Jason Kenney.

One political strategist says the ad is designed to plant doubt.

“When you look at what drives voters during elections there's issue, party identification and there's leadership and they're really going after Jason Kenney on leadership issue. It’s going to be particularly effective in Edmonton where his approval numbers are quite bad,” says Marc Henry with ThinkHQ

However, Henry says there’s always a risk of going too far.

“If the attacks are unwarranted, or if they can’t back them up with fact or if they just become too personal,” says Henry. “If you attack to the exclusion of things voters actually care about you run the risk of them dismissing.”

Voters find attack ads distracting from the overall message.

“I don’t care for the attack ads; just make points for what they are and leave it at that,” says Robert Rudolph. ""I think it just lowers the standard. I don’t think you need to bring anyone down.”

“I guess they’re part of politics now but I don’t particularly like them. I’d rather hear about issues then what other people have done. I’d rather hear aa good platform than an attack on character,” says Evan Goldstrom.

Whether or not the ads are effective will ultimately be determined on April 16th.

The B.C. Liberal Leader added: “They have driven up taxes. I mean people have less money in their pocket at the end of the day. People tell us they have trouble saving and they are concerned about their future because without the chance to save and invest, people see a lifetime of struggling and that’s not acceptable.”

Wilkinson said: “And the other thing that John Horgan promised was 114,000 new housing units in British Columbia. So far we have seen stacks of trailers for homeless people and that`s it. So their housing policy is a complete shambles. Housing is not more affordable. They have piled on some taxes and we hear today in Surrey that framers, drywallers, plumbers, pipefitters, all looking for work because the amount of housing being built is shrinking.”

He then noted: “The whole emphasis that I am trying to bring to this organization is a renewed face based on opportunity for everyone in British Columbian and we cannot have a world in which some people feel left out because, sadly, the NDP are picking friends and enemies, winners and losers. We believe that is wrong because government should serve everybody in the province. Everyone is a citizen; everybody deserves to have a chance at success.”

In an extensive interview at The VOICE, Wilkinson answered a raft of questions

Here is the rest of the interview:

VOICE: You said you were going to rejuvenate the party. It became a big issue. The older people sent back messages saying that there was no way they were going to quit. So how are you going to deal with this?

WILKINSON: Well, we have at least three retirements coming up amongst our MLAs. We have an almost entirely new party executive and we have me as the new leader. And so I expect there’ll be a significantly new group of candidates for the next election including a good number of people who are currently serving as MLAs.

VOICE: How would this really make a difference? Just having different faces of young people is not good enough for anybody. Do you have a strategy in place?

WILKINSON: Yes, it’s a combination of the people that you bring to the party, and we’re seeing an excellent recruitment of candidates. We put out a candidate call about six weeks ago that had 200 fully qualified candidates come in. They are being reviewed for their resume and their social media history and so forth and it’s an excellent collection of people from all walks of life from all over BC. So I’m very pleased with that. The other thing, of course, is the different policy framework. So I am now talking very actively about big changes at ICBC, about focusing on opportunity, higher education, a strong private sector – so it’s a different emphasis; it’s a renewed approach to how British Columbia could be governed and that’s what we will be taking to the next election.

VOICE: There was a lot of resentment against Gordon Campbell and later against Christy Clark during her last years as Premier. How are you going to overcome this negativity? Right now people, at least in the South Asian community, are very excited about some of the things that the NDP has done. Campbell, for example, had promised he would honour union agreements but ended up doing away with contracts which basically affected South Asian workers. How are you going to overcome all this distrust?

WILKINSON: Well, any government collects some issues over time and the BC Liberals were in office for 16 years, during which time there was a massive increase in prosperity in British Columbia, taxes were reduced and an awful lot of infrastructure got built which is good for British Columbia. Now what we have to do is point out that the NDP are building almost nothing. It’s very difficult to point to anything they’ve actually done and they are spending a lot of time on union politics and not so much time on opportunity for regular British Columbians. That’s a big concern because the No. 1 issue that we run into anywhere in Greater Vancouver is the cost of living. And they are putting up taxes. We’ve seen no increase in affordability for housing. There housing strategy is basically stuck in the water. So we have to talk about a positive agenda for British Columbia and to make sure that opportunity is as strong in Surrey as it ever has been and the whole of the Metro Vancouver is a place that people will come to and be successful.

VOICE: But during Campbell’s time, the only people who really benefitted from a cut in taxes was the upper income group.

WILKINSON: Hmm, that’s not so true. Gordon Campbell reduced the taxes for people earning under $15,000 to zero. That’s a first in Canada.

VOICE: But what about the middle section?

WILKINSON: Well, what you have to do, of course, is to make sure that it’s affordable for everybody. So what happened is that there was a 25 per cent income tax reduction for everybody in 2001. And what we are going to have to look at is restoring the neutrality of the carbon tax so that people can get an income tax cut when their carbon tax goes up because the NDP have basically turned the carbon tax into a cash grab.

VOICE: But Campbell increased fees on a raft of things, which was okay for the people who were in the upper income bracket because they had the money to pay them.

WILKINSON: Well, I think the challenge in any government is to find the right distribution of scarce resources. Things happen like the autism support program where families got $9,000 to spend on their autistic child at their discretion. That was something that Gordon Campbell did. And so we have to continue that pathway of making sure that life gets easier for British Columbians and that they can afford to live here, because what we hear all of the time now is that the cost of living is out of control in British Columbia and people are having a very tough time making ends meet. What that means is that they take on more personal debt and people are very, very concerned in Metro Vancouver especially between the age of 25 and 40 that they cannot make it work here.

VOICE: So what new policies would you like to introduce to really make a difference? What specifically would you do?

WILKINSON: We’ve talked a lot about insurance in the last few days. Auto insurance needs to be opened up to competition so that British Columbians have a choice in their auto insurance and don’t get these enormous ICBC bills. [Showing an owner’s certificate of insurance …] And I have here for you an invoice for 2019 and their bill has gone up to $8,040 on a Volkswagen. That’s almost a third of the cost of the vehicle spent on auto insurance. So this is a big problem. And British Columbians have been denied any kind of choice because the NDP insist on keeping ICBC [as a monopoly].

VOICE: What about other policies?

WILKINSON: We have to make sure that we have a very strong and affordable higher education which is something that I am very loyal to because that’s my family’s pathway to success in Canada … was good, strong, affordable higher education. And in Surrey there’s an increasing demand for that because there’s so many young people in Surrey and SFU Surrey expanded when I was the minister involved. KPU expanded when I was the minister involved. We need to keep doing that to make sure that people have access to the skills they need. Once they graduate, they need to have access to good, strong private sector employment because not everybody can work for the government – and that seems to be what the NDP are growing. They’ve just nationalized the home care sector with 4,000 people going on to the government payroll and that’s the path which you can’t go down forever; government can’t employ everyone.

VOICE: How are you going to make higher education affordable?

WILKINSON: Higher education is a very important thing and the provincial government spends a little over $2 billion a year on higher education to keep the tuition fees affordable. We will be coming out with a package of things that will make it even more affordable when the time comes closer to an election.

VOICE: How will you deal with this situation where people in BC and Canada are griping because institutions are getting more and more foreign students because they pay higher fees to keep the universities running?

WILKINSON: Well, the interesting thing about international students is they were a huge source of revenue and success … in Australia 10 years ago. British Columbia made an effort in that regard to make sure we are getting the revenue from students so that institutions like Selkirk College in Castlegar, which would be shrinking dramatically if it weren’t for international students, now has significant numbers of students from India which have revitalized the town because they can work up to 20 hours a week and they have revitalized the institution; it’s now thriving largely because of international students. Other institutions around the province have intake of a certain amount of international students who do not displace local students. They are not allowed into the faculties of medicine and the like in the professional schools. They come in as arts and science [students] for the most part, some in commerce, and they provide revenue which provides for further spaces for local students. And it also makes the institutions much richer and more interesting, adds a cultural mix that otherwise wouldn’t be there. Generally, the international students are very good for our higher education system.

VOICE: Do you have a strategy to reach out to the ethnic communities?

WILKINSON: Oh, yes. We are making a strong effort to recruit candidates from the full spectrum of ethnic communities in British Columbia. I am an immigrant myself. We all know that immigration is a major factor in the well-being of British Columbia; makes an exciting, interesting place because we have people from all over the world settled here. They settle here because they see opportunity for themselves and their children. We must make sure that opportunity is fully available to their children.

VOICE: What about the controversy over the George Massey Tunnel?

WILKINSON: The problem is that about $200 million was spent on the Massey Tunnel replacement and it was well underway – and the biggest traffic bottleneck in Western Canada – and the NDP cancelled it. They cancelled it because it connected two [B.C.] Liberal ridings and they took the money and they put it into the Pattullo Bridge which connects two NDP ridings and rather than getting increased capacity to seven or 10 lanes on the Massey Bridge, we are going to get another four-lane bridge on the Pattullo to replace the existing four-lane bridge which means no extra capacity.

VOICE: What about the controversy about the bridge tolls?

Yes, I think it’s pretty obvious to anybody in BC politics that the tolls are off the Port Mann Bridge for the foreseeable future. I don’t think anybody is planning to replace those tolls. So the issue is how you pay for further infrastructure. It has to be done with a joint federal-provincial input and for some reason the NDP decided not to bother asking the federal government to put money on the Pattullo Bridge.

Jagmeet Singh, Leader of Canada’s NDP, issued the following statement:

Today I join all New Democrats to mark the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.

Every day, too many of our neighbours and community members – people of colour, Indigenous peoples, refugees and immigrants – are harmed, harassed, and denied their rights and access to services just for the way they look or where they are from.

Recent anti-immigrant and anti-refugee sentiments are fueling the sparks of intolerance. Harmful political rhetoric is justifying violent acts against racialized people in Canada and around the world.

This isn't right, and we cannot stand by as it happens. We have an obligation to stand up and speak out with conviction to counter racism, hatred and intolerance.

The International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination is an opportunity to recognize that the Canadian reality doesn’t always match the image of tolerance that we project onto the world.

Hate and discrimination spread like a fire, once they are allowed to grow. We need to come together as people who refuse to allow these sentiments to propagate in our homes.

The NDP stands in solidarity against racism, xenophobia, Islamophobia, and hate in all its forms. We call racism and discrimination by their names, not explain them away with excuses. We believe that reconciliation with Indigenous peoples is an action policy, and that eliminating systemic discrimination means creating inclusive workplaces, communities, policies and laws.

On this day, and throughout the year, we must be tireless in working to put an end to all discriminatory practices.",NDP Statement on International Day For The Elimination Of Racial Discrimination,New Democratic Party,https://www.ndp.ca/news/ndp-statement-international-day-elimination-racial-discrimination-2

TORONTO -- NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is set to release a memoir, ""Love & Courage,"" in the lead-up to the federal election.

Publisher Simon & Schuster says the book follows Singh, who is Sikh, from childhood as he learns lessons about overcoming adversity and the impact of not belonging.

Rather than a political memoir, it's being billed as a story about ""how strengthening the connection between us all is the way to build a better world.""

The title alludes to Singh's oft-invoked call for ""love and courage,"" which he deployed in a viral response to a heckler at a 2017 NDP leadership campaign event.

After taking the reins of the federal party, Singh earned a seat in the House of Commons in a byelection last month.

His sights are now set on the post of prime minister as Canadians prepare to vote in this fall's federal election.

""This book is the story of my family and my personal experiences growing up -- sometimes difficult ones. I often felt alone, unworthy, ashamed,"" Singh said in a statement.

Re: Using government resources for political activities.

It must be election time. I just received my government sponsored “vote identifying cards” in the mail (the NDP’s taxpayer funded no-postage required postcard asking if you support 500 000 new affordable units — that is, do you support the NDP).

For those who are unaware of political strategy, parties spend vast amounts of time (and money) identifying those people who are likely to vote for them. They then hound those people to get out to vote on voter day (called “get out the vote”). Technically, it’s illegal for third parties to do this work on behalf of political parties and it’s certainly illegal to use government resources to do so. That said, it is virtually impossible for Elections Canada to prove parties are using this information.

That said, I do not disagree with the need for more affordable housing (my above comment is just expressing my annoyance at the use of taxpayer funds to run partisan political activity), but there needs to be a robust reality based debate on the topic. So far governments have spent increasing sums of taxpayer money to only make the matter worse. There is no voice given to besieged landlords and no relief given to those who construct free market rentals.

On Friday, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh introduced a new website as a way for people to vent — and so the party can collect stories about how much money people in the country are paying for services.

Singh says even though high-speed internet and cellular services “are a necessity,” they are still far from affordable or reliable. He would like to see them being more affordable.

The NDP blame the skyrocketing prices on the Liberal and Conservative governments relying on market forces and competitiveness to determine what people pay each month, as well as the “Big Three” — Bell, Rogers and Telus — receiving large subsidies.

“Canadians are paying skyrocketing prices while telecoms companies make billions in profits. Once again, Justin Trudeau is showing who’s side he’s on, and it’s not yours,” said Singh, in a statement.

The party plans on pushing the Liberals to lower internet and cellular fees.

A 2018 report from Finnish-based mobile data consulting company, Rewheel, found that Canadians are paying an “astonishing” amount for cell phone data compared to European countries.

It found that for $46 CAD, Canadians are only getting an average of 2 GB of data for their wireless plans — when wireless customers in Croatia, Austria, Finland, Lithuania, Slovenia, Switzerland, Latvia, Estonia, and Poland, all receive unlimited data plans for the same amount.",The NDP wants to hear Canadian horror stories about phone and internet fees,Daily Hive,https://dailyhive.com/toronto/ndp-canadian-phone-internet-fees-2019

I put the number in quotation marks because that ginormous lead turned out to be wrong.

article continues below

Like, really wrong.

When the ballots were counted just days later, the BC NDP’s Sheila Malcolmson had smoked BC Liberal candidate Tony Harris by 10 points – garnering nearly 50 per cent of the popular vote.

I mention this because Mainstreet has shaken off that poll and waded back into provincial politics again with a new poll claiming the BC NDP have “extended their lead over the BC Liberals and would be close to winning a majority if an election were held today.”

I wanted to give things context before listing all of Mainstreet’s results because political polling can be, uh, unreliable.

Mainstreet might find this blog unfair, but I think people have a right to read it with more context. Media outlets, including ours, also need to be more cautious about reporting on these polls.

Mainstreet released today its latest UltraPoll, a “conglomeration of 10 provincial polls. The poll surveyed 923 British Columbians between March 20th and 21st 2019. The poll has a margin of error of +/- 3.23% and is accurate 19 times out of 20.”

Among decided and leaning voters, the BC NDP lead with 39% support (+2% from Mainstreet's January poll), while the opposition Liberals with Andrew Wilkinson at the helm have 32.4% (-2.5%). The BC Green Party with Andrew Weaver as leader have 13.3% (-1.3%), while the BC Conservatives with interim leader Scott Anderson have 12.1% (-0.9%).

It should be noted that Mainstreet technically got a different poll correct when it released results of polling about the Burnaby South byelection back in January. That poll had federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh leading by more than 10 per cent (albeit against then-Liberal candidate Karen Wang before her campaign imploded) and, of course, Singh won the byelection handily.

Personally, I wish pollsters wouldn't do this kind of polling. As we've seen, they can be unreliable - just ask Adrian Dix about that supposed huge lead he had in 2013. And I don't think they really serve any purpose. But that's my opinion.

And, ironically, the predicted slowdown is largely attributed to its new taxation measures.

article continues below

Two financial institutions released economic analyses that zeroed in on B.C.’s economy, with both projecting it will slow down significantly due to the cooling of the province’s real estate market.

Central 1 Credit Union concluded the province’s economy will have three years of weak economic growth after several years of robust annual growth of more than three-per-cent GDP.

Its deputy chief economist, Bryan Yu, said in a news release that “economic growth is being held hostage by the housing market slump, which is deeper than previously forecast.”

As a result, Central 1 is now forecasting the provincial economy will grow by just 2.2 per cent in the coming year, then 2.4 per cent in 2020 and 2.8 per cent in 2021.

TD Economics had a more pessimistic assessment, projecting B.C.’s economic growth to be just 1.4 per cent this year and two per cent next year. Again, the chief villain is the slumping real estate sector.

“B.C.’s deepening housing market slowdown is likely to put a larger damper on growth this year,” it said in its provincial economic forecast. “The province’s housing market has been the most hard-hit by the implementation of tighter rules, rising interest rates and B.C. government policy measures.”

To be sure, neither of these projected scenarios constitute being anything close to a recession, but this may spell bad news for the government’s three-year fiscal plan. The lower the economic growth, the fewer tax dollars are available. That plan projects an increase of almost $4.5 billion in tax revenue over that period.

What’s disappointing about this situation is that measures such as the speculation tax, the increase in the foreign buyers tax and the higher tax on high-end homes were supposed to make housing more affordable.

Instead, while house prices and some rents have dropped, they haven’t dropped to the point of making homes actually affordable.

So it now looks like the government’s housing policies (which do not place much emphasis on increasing the supply of housing) are not only not meeting the affordability targets, but are instead having the biggest impact at slowing down the provincial economy

Now, none of this may come back to haunt the NDP. Both financial institutions are predicting employment levels will remain high with the government’s infrastructure program considered to be providing a cushion to any slowdown.

As well, the BC Liberals continue to struggle to find their identity as an Opposition party and party leader Andrew Wilkinson has had a bad run of foot-in-mouth-itis in recent days.

But after experiencing relatively sunny days during their first 20 months in office, things may be about to get a little darker for the NDP government.

In less than two months, B.C. will have a new MP to fill the seat vacated by new NDP MLA Sheila Malcolmson.

Today, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that a by-election in Nanaimo-Ladysmith will be held on May 6.

Whoever is elected will only sit as an MP for just over five months before a general election will be held on October 21.

The NDP has not yet nominated a candidate.

There are two high-profile declared contestants:

* Lauren Semple, the event director for the last three Nanaimo Pride festivals, a former Nanaimo Pride president, and former riding assistant to Malcolmson;

* and Bob Chamberlin, vice president of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs and elected chief of the Kwikwasut'inuxw Haswa'mis First Nation.

Chief Bob Chamberlin is also trying to win the NDP nomination in Nanaimo-Ladysmith. Amanda Siebert

Four other parties already have nominated candidates:

* Financial-services worker Jennifer Clarke for the People's Party of Canada;

* Management consultant Michelle Cornfield for the Liberals;

* Sun Life Financial manager John Hirst for the Conservatives;

* Filmmaker Paul Manly of the Green Party of Canada.

Last year, Hirst soundly defeated Clarke to become the Conservative candidate.

Paul Manly ran for the Greens in 2015 after being rejected by the NDP.

The Green candidate, Manly, ran in 2015 and is the son of former NDP MP Jim Manly, who represented Cowichan-Malahat–The Islands from 1980 to 1988.

In 2014, Paul Manly said the NDP federal executive denied him the chance to seek a party nomination because of concerns over his position on Israeli-Palestinian issues.

Manly's father was arrested in Gaza in 2012 after being part of group of protesters aboard the MV Estelle that tried to break through an Israeli blockade.

“We had hoped that the New Democrats and other parties also would speak out. Not particularly for me but for the people of Gaza and of Palestine,” Jim Manly told the Straight in 2015. “And they didn’t and this has never been Paul’s central issue. It’s been a very important issue for Eva—my wife—and myself. But it’s never been Paul’s central issue.”

Katherine DeClerq, CTV News Toronto





The Ontario New Democratic Party is continuing to call for a public inquiry into the hiring of Toronto Police Supt. Ron Taverner as Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) Commissioner after an integrity commissioner report said the process was “flawed.”

Integrity Commissioner J. David Wake launched an investigation into the hiring of Taverner following numerous complaints and accusations of political interference. The report, which was issued on Wednesday, found that Premier Doug Ford’s conduct in the recruitment process was “not improper.”

“He could not have had any improper purpose in the approval of the selection committee's recommendation on the basis of what he knew at the time,” Wake wrote.

The report did, however, raise concerns regarding communications between top civil servants about the hiring process.

The report found that Steve Orsini, the secretary of the cabinet, was in constant conversation with Ford’s Chief of Staff Dean French about where Taverner stood in the hiring process. The commissioner said that Orsini felt pressured to recommend a Ford family friend for the position.

Both Orsini and French admitted that the appointment of Taverner did not involve an independent hiring process, the report found.

""There seemed to be a tacit acknowledgment by the secretary that Mr. French was rooting for Mr. Taverner's success,” Wake wrote. “Anyone examining these messages would have serious doubts as to the fairness of the process to the other candidates.""

“This report is damning in every way and that is why it is necessary that we have a public inquiry,” Opposition Leader Andrea Horwath told reporters on Thursday. “The government took advantage of a weak process to have Mr. Ford’s best friend become the OPP commissioner and that stinks all the way around.”

Former OPP deputy commissioner Brad Blair, who was fired by the provincial government nearly three weeks ago, said that he feels the entire process was “rigged” in favour of Taverner.

Blair’s lawyer said that he is pursuing a wrongful termination proceeding against the provincial government.

“This saga is not over,” said Julian Falconer over the phone.

Taverner withdrew his name from consideration for the job earlier this month.

The province announced in it's annual budget Wednesday that $30 million more would go toward mental health and addictions for the 2019-20 year.

""I don't want to say too late because it is a positive measure — but it's too late for some people for sure. People have died. Make no mistake about that,"" Chartier said.

She said that if you don't including the $14 million for the mental health hospital in North Battleford or $6 million from the federal government, the province committed less than $10 million for new mental health initiatives in this budget.

Chartier said the province's ongoing additions and mental health crisis needs more than what the government has put forward.

""There are 22 new [inpatient addictions] treatment beds being added but we don't have any details yet on how that will better support crystal meth addiction,"" she said, noting the treatment of meth requires a different approach from alcohol or other drugs.

""This government has had its head buried deeply in the sand when it comes to crystal meth and opioid addiction.""

Chartier said crime statistics have indicated a growing meth problem for years. Furthermore, she noted not everyone needs inpatient treatment.

""They need support in-community,"" she said. ""They need access to addictions counselors.""

Chartier also criticized the one per cent increase for community-based organizations.

""These are people who are working directly with mental health patients and they got nothing really, and they haven't gotten anything in five years,"" she said.

""Those organizations that provide frontline mental health care like crisis intervention services only have seen a three per cent increase in five years.""

She said the province planned to cut ten per cent from its CBOs in 2017, but backtracked after public outcry.

""We're playing catch up with every other jurisdiction. Every other province is moving the bar and we are chasing after them.""

Mental health patients a 'token project': activist

Advocates like Jae Blakley are also skeptical about what will actually change.

""I think putting a token bit of money into mental health at this point is just an election strategy,"" the mental health activist said. He's spent 12 years in and out of the mental health system.

""Mental health patients are a token project. It's easy to throw money at us and say things are getting better.""

In one of numerous spending announcements yesterday, the province said its seven-bed temporary mental health assessment unit at Saskatoon's Royal University Hospital will be made permanent. It's using $1.5 million for this and renaming it the Mental Health Short Stay Unit.

Blakley criticized how it's historically operated and he worries problems will persist despite the name change.

""To keep the physical space open that's one thing, but to actually operate it correctly is a totally different matter,"" he said.

Blakley said the unit was supposed to help provide people in crisis quick access to treatment. However, he said his friends have waited hours in the emergency room because they couldn't get in.

New Democrat Opposition leader Ryan Meili needs to pick a lane ...","For an Opposition already driving rather erratically, Wednesday’s 2019-20 Saskatchewan budget won’t make their trip any easier.

New Democrat Opposition leader Ryan Meili needs to pick a lane — preferably, one not on the left-hand side of the road where he risks slamming into on-coming traffic. In Saskatchewan, we don’t normally drive on the left side. Meili, who has a natural tendency to drift left, needs to present a better argument why we should. Wednesday’s budget won’t help him make that case.

This is not to suggest Finance Minister Donna Harpauer’s budget was especially left wing, nor is it that there isn’t anything to criticize. No budget is bullet-proof.

A great starting point for an Opposition that vowed to make this spring sitting all about kids might have been to observe advanced education spending went nowhere, and whether K-12 truly got anything more than commitments to replace a few schools.

Education was one of the last things Meili noted in his embargoed press conference Wednesday. Instead, he questioned whether the budget was really balanced and whether the public debt was too high.

To be clear, public debt increasing to $21.7 billion by the end of the 2019-20 budget year and to as much as $26 billion by March 2023 is an issue.

But budgets for both governments and oppositions quickly become all about making your case as to whether the financial plan does or does not work. For the Opposition, that means focusing on a consistent theme and sticking to it.

Ryan Meili is not leading the budget criticism because he’s swerving all over the place. Pick a lane, sir.

In Thursday morning’s question period, Meili opened up by chastising the government for it’s “mission accomplished” and “strange sort of self-congratulations”. “This was a budget with a huge deficit … (although) maybe not by an accounting deficit.” Huh?

Sure, governments are always far too self-congratulatory, but this was a budget that had the Saskatchewan Association for Applied Behaviour Analysis (Sask-ABA) offering congratulations “for increasing the amount of funding available to families of autistic children under the age of 6”. It had the Saskatchewan representative of the Canadian Mental Health Association calling the additional $30 million for mental health funding a good first step.

These stakeholders aren’t Saskatchewan Party government cheerleaders. Many of them have come to the legislature — often, accompanied by the NDP — with specific spending requests. Many such requests were met Wednesday.

(Interestingly, one of the NDP’s traditional allies — the Saskatchewan Government and General Employees Union — was talking Wednesday about government getting a bigger share of cannabis profits. Why? Well, maybe because the list of 2019-20 government employees released Wednesday show only six less full-time jobs.)

One of Meili’s more telling comments was his suggestion the Sask. Party stole NDP ideas. Indeed they did: Mental health, focusing on highway intersection safety as opposed to more visible and popular paving, and a royalty rate review so that potash companies paid a fairer share through royalties.

So unbeknownst to potash companies like Nutrien, which seemed rather unhappy, the Sask. Party government changed outdated incentive programs, enabling it collect an additional $117 million for provincial coffers. New Democrat finance critic Trent Wotherspoon in his budget reply Thursday morning described this as a shoddy way to treat world-class companies. Again; huh?

Finally, you need a ballpark explanation of what you would do differently if you are going to clamour for balanced budgets and lower debt. Meili’s response Wednesday was it’s too early to have that conversation. A third time: Huh?

The Dominion Bond Rating Service credit rating agency issued a statement Thursday morning suggesting the Sask. Party government “has fulfilled its three-year commitment to balance the provincial budget” — this despite DBRS’s own misgivings about whether it’s a balanced budget in 2019-20 when you properly account for capital spending.

So where does Meili’s “off-balance” criticism go? What would he do differently from a government that stole his ideas? How would his ambitious spending agenda lower the debt?

What is Meili driving at?

B.C. Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson really believes the NDP is at fault for 46 years of overpriced vehicle insurance in B.C.?

article continues below

I suggest that between the Social Credit and Liberal governments, of which his was the last 16 years, there was far more manipulation of the books than by the current government. ICBC, B.C. Ferries and B.C. Hydro have been treated like an overdraft account by his party during the 16 years of Liberal rule before the current NDP/Green alliance.

During the reign of the previous Liberal government, money was stripped from these profitable corporate entities to create the illusion of a balanced budget. User fees were put in place to cover the shortfall of funds, all under the guise of “we have reduced your income tax level.”

I am not a staunch NDP supporter, but at present I am standing in the middle of a cattle field and Wilkinson’s story smells about the same.

As leader of the Wildrose Party, which despite her efforts was never quite successful at portraying itself as a party of the centre right, she came close, tantalizingly close.","Danielle Smith nearly became the first woman to be elected premier of Alberta.

As leader of the Wildrose Party, which despite her efforts was never quite successful at portraying itself as a party of the centre right, she came close, tantalizingly close.

Alas for Ms. Smith, the Wildrose Party’s opportunity to form government foundered in a Lake of Fire in 2012, and Alison Redford, who had already been chosen as the Progressive Conservative Party’s leader and appointed premier, became the politician whom history will record as the first woman to be elected to the province’s top political job by voters.

After that came Ms. Smith’s 2014 effort to reunite her party with the PCs, by then led by Jim Prentice – a partial tactical success but a catastrophic strategic failure – and the election of Rachel Notley as Alberta’s first NDP Premier five and a half months later.

Ms. Smith was rejected by PC party members as their candidate in her own Highwood riding in March 2015, ending her political career, and today works as a broadcaster hosting a popular right-wing talk radio show in Calgary.

Now, the question must be asked: Has Ms. Smith become a secret admirer of Premier Notley – or perhaps a not-so-secret admirer?

At least, one wonders, does she think Ms. Notley is a preferable premier to Jason Kenney, the leader of the Opposition United Conservative Party, which is the product of the merger of the two conservative parties Ms. Smith represented during her three years as an Alberta MLA?

This might not be quite as astonishing as it would seem had we gone by political labels alone. As many have noted, Premier Notley’s government, despite the surprise of its election in 2015, has turned out to be quite fiscally conservative, surprisingly open to “free market” neoliberal economics, administratively capable, vigorously supportive of the petroleum industry, and at times aggressive in its relationships with other Canadian governments.

At the same time, unlike the UCP and Mr. Kenney himself, the NDP and Ms. Notley are untainted by the extreme social conservatism of the very sort that led Ms. Smith to try to reunite her party with the Progressive Conservative mothership in December 2014.

In other words, notwithstanding the noisy rhetoric emitting from the UCP, there’s not actually all that much light between Ms. Notley, the former labour lawyer, and Ms. Smith, the former Fraser Institute apparatchik.

While Ms. Smith is a doctrinaire utopian market fundamentalist, she is socially quite liberal, as Ms. Notley is and as Mr. Kenney emphatically is not.

Ms. Notley, as has been frequently observed by supporters and detractors alike, is the best progressive conservative premier Alberta has had since Peter Lougheed – or perhaps even the best including Mr. Lougheed, who founded Alberta’s 44-year Tory dynasty in 1971 and died in 2012.

Which may explain Ms. Smith’s remarkable essay in the Calgary Herald on Friday, in which she came quite close to endorsing Ms. Notley, and apparently had to struggle to find anything nice to say about Mr. Kenney.

Ms. Smith framed the difference between Premier Notley and Opposition Leader Kenney as essentially the same as the difference between Mr. Lougheed and Ralph Klein. If you think Mr. Lougheed was Alberta’s best premier, she wrote, “I bet you are voting for Notley.” If it’s Mr. Klein you place atop our pantheon of premiers, “my guess is you are voting for Kenney.”

As Ms. Smith is surely aware, history remembers Mr. Lougheed as a competent, prudent and visionary manager, and Mr. Klein as someone who sacrificed the province’s infrastructure and savings in the name of tax giveaways, irresponsible Ralph Bucks payments, and phoney balanced books.

Ms. Smith devoted the largest part of her 700-word op-ed to describing Mr. Lougheed’s successes – and the Lougheed-like qualities of Ms. Notley’s management.

“Notley is, without question, the inheritor of the Lougheed tradition,” wrote Ms. Smith. “That’s not to say he was a full on socialist, but Notley isn’t either. I think most Albertans have been shocked to see how pragmatic (sic) she has governed, particularly as it concerns natural resources.”

Almost as an afterthought, Ms. Smith devoted a short paragraph to half-heartedly criticizing Mr. Lougheed, and another to describing Mr. Klein’s good points, one of which she noted was that he had a nice smile, which is true.

While she reached no strong conclusion about the better course for Alberta, this is certainly not the ringing endorsement of the UCP one would have expected from Alberta’s former conservative Opposition leader at this moment in history. Nor is it the stinging critique of the NDP she might have written during her previous career as a Calgary Herald political columnist.

Ms. Smith remains a respected figure on the socially progressive right in Alberta, despite the abuse she suffered from social conservatives in the years since 2014.

You’d almost think she’s done the math and realizes what a disaster Mr. Kenney would be if he won power, but as a former guiding star of the Alberta right can’t quite make herself unequivocally state the obvious.",Has former Wildrose leader Danielle Smith become a (not so) secret admirer of NDP Premier Rachel Notley?,Alberta Politics,https://albertapolitics.ca/2019/03/has-former-wildrose-leader-danielle-smith-become-a-not-so-secret-admirer-of-ndp-premier-rachel-notley/

In the U.S., the long-awaited Mueller investigation came to an end. U.S. Attorney General William Barr on Sunday afternoon released a summary of Special Counsel Robert Mueller‘s report, which concluded that there was no collusion between Rusia and U.S. President Donald Trump and his campaign, while at the same time, the report “does not exonerate him.” Mr. Trump used that mixed assessment to claim that he has been fully exonerated, tweeting, “No Collusion, No Obstruction, Complete and Total EXONERATION. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!” In a symbolic move, congressional Democrats and Republicans last week unanimously voted for the report to be publicly released. Republicans have reversed their stance in the wake of the report’s findings, while Democrats are pushing for more details to be released on Mr. Mueller’s investigation into the obstruction-of-justice allegations.

Agriculture Minister Lana Popham has launched the second phase of her remake of an NDP icon, the Agricultural Land Commission.

B.C. Agriculture Minister Lana Popham has launched the second phase of her remake of an NDP icon, the Agricultural Land Commission.

In a determined push to plow under changes made since the Dave Barrett government hastily imposed the Agricultural Land Reserve in the early 1970s, Popham has introduced a new batch of legislative amendments. It’s an effort to stop what she claims is pressure from speculators, buying farmland and trying to get it sprung from the ALR so they can grow houses on it.

The latest amendments dissolve the regional ALC panels set up to bring local knowledge to the table. The whole show will again be run from Burnaby, with token regional appointees on a central politburo, sorry, commission.

When Popham proudly unveiled the amendments a couple of weeks ago, there was an awkward moment. The bill includes a new definition of “person,” changing it to a provincial or local government or their agencies. People, specifically farmers, will not be persons once the NDP-Green coalition pushes this nanny-state vision through.

It’s awkward because Bill 15 was presented the day before International Women’s Day, celebrating the 90th anniversary of the “persons case” where five pioneering women won the right to vote in Canada. In B.C., women remain persons, unless they’re farmers.

Horrible optics aside, it’s a minor change. Property owners applying to exclude land from the ALR have long had to obtain the view of their local government, to see if an exclusion fits with community plans for roads and utilities. Soon only state entities will be able to apply to remove land, if and when they see fit to judge the property owner’s wishes.

After I reported this, Popham sent me a lengthy statement, including the following:

“Over the last few years, we’ve seen people buying land in the ALR, only to turn around and immediately apply to get it pulled out of the ALR so they can develop it. This volume of applications to review has become burdensome to both local governments and the ALC, since in many cases exclusion applications are not approved as they are for development purposes.”

In other words, local governments and the ALC continue to protect farmland, as required by the “old government” legislation. I asked the ALC for its latest data on this crushing volume of speculator applications since it stopped posting archived decisions after Popham took charge.

In 2018, there was a grand total of 39 applications to remove land province-wide. One of two in the Interior region was approved. On Vancouver Island, four applications flooded in and all were refused. Same in the Kootenay region.

In the Okanagan, the commission grappled with 11 applications, turning away six. On the South Coast, there were 14, with nine refused. The numbers are even lower for 2017. The ALC annual report shows a steep decline in applications since the 1990s.

Here is current ALC staffing: A Popham-appointed chair and 18 commissioners oversee staff consisting of a CEO, director of policy and planning and director of operations. Kim Grout, the current CEO, made $185,096 plus benefits last year.

Under them are three senior policy planners, a policy planner, policy analyst and six planning officers. On the operations side, there are two co-ordinators, four compliance and enforcement officers, an office manager and six technical and support staff.

Popham intends to hire more enforcement “boots on the ground” to cope with the speculator crisis she wants you to think is happening.

More than 2,100 long-term care spaces have been opened for seniors over the last four years. But on Thursday, Premier Rachel Notley announced her government would add 2,000 more over the next five years.

That pledge came during a campaign appearance in Lethbridge, weeks after a new westside facility was announced by the Covenant Health organization. A number of nurses and seniors’ care providers joined her for the event.

“Building 2,000 new long-term care beds will improve seniors’ care, help families and give our health-care providers the support they deserve,” she said.

It will also free up beds in Alberta hospitals, she said. The cost was pegged at $170 million.

When their working years are done, Notley said Albertans deserve “a dignified and well-cared-for future.”

“That’s on the minds of many, many Albertans.”

By caring for aging people in long-term facilities, Notley said they would receive the specialized care they need – while doctors, nurses, paramedics and others at acute-care facilities would have more time to help the sick.

“My plan will ensure that the nurses, doctors and all health-care professionals that provide these critical services are well supported,” she said.

But those would not be priorities for a Jason Kenney government, she pointed out.

That would put “all these things at risk.”

“Albertans can count on me to defend and protect patient care,” she pledged.

Kenney favours American-style health care, Notley said. That would mean good care – for those who could afford it.

For Albertans who aren’t well off, “it would be devastating.”

That’s how veteran city councillor Bruce McDonald sums up the provincial government’s consultation on replacing the George Massey Tunnel, which has keeping the current tunnel as well as adding a new one as options on the table.

article continues below

“I just find it so frustrating and the government is talking about a consultation. There’s 14,000 pages of reports, like them or not, so studies were done. They came up with the concept of building a bridge. It’s a complex design but it kept the bridge out of the river with the supports on land, so you didn’t have to get into a three- or four- or five-year environmental study, and you don’t lose any farmland at all,” said McDonald.

Last week Delta council had a workshop with Lina Halwani, the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure’s corridor project director, who heard the civic politicians’ concerns as part of the government’s new round of consultations. Her presentation included telling council a new crossing needs to be better aligned with regional plans and that a business case for a preferred option would be ready by 2020.

During the workshop McDonald raised concern about another tunnel even being considered.

He told the Optimist this week that he was told back in the mid-1980s, while chair of a residents’ committee on the new Alex Fraser Bridge, that there would be too much displacement putting a new underwater crossing right next to the current tunnel, which turns 60 this year, so the only alternative would be to move a new tunnel further up river.

That means hundreds of acres of farmland lost, but McDonald also has other concerns as well.

“I don’t believe in the next 10 years there would be a catastrophic earthquake for the tunnel where people would drown but I do believe that sometime in the next 10 years, or so, for one reason or the other, that tunnel is going to be rendered non-usable. Even if we had a minor shake, it will likely render that tunnel useless. What are we going to do with 80,000 vehicles a day that we can’t even get across now?”

As far as the possibility of a bridge with fewer lanes than the 10-lane span approved by the previous Liberal government, McDonald pointed to the major project now underway at the Alex Fraser Bridge to create a rush hour counter flow.

He said the same would likely have to happen within a few years if a smaller bridge connected South Delta and Richmond.

Meanwhile, the province is planning a series of interim tunnel and roadwork improvements for the current crossing starting this summer. The province indicated the upgrades to the tunnel and road system would cost approximately $40 million.",Veteran Delta councillor frustrated by NDP approach on new river crossing,Delta Optimist,https://www.delta-optimist.com/news/veteran-delta-councillor-frustrated-by-ndp-approach-on-new-river-crossing-1.23768220

In Budget 2017, the BC Liberals predicted a steep decline in housing starts from 41,843 in 2016 to an average of 27,000 in 2019, 2020, and 2021. Budget 2019 predicts a far less severe reduction, projecting an average of 32,000 starts in those same years – above historic levels.

In fact, in the five year period between 2017 and 2021, BC is projected to build 42,446 more homes than the BC Liberals predicted before the speculation tax was introduced.

“As we finally see signs of relief for the people struggling with out of control housing prices, Andrew Wilkinson is working harder than ever to undo our progress. Skyrocketing housing prices might be good for Andrew Wilkinson’s friends in the top 2%, but most British Columbians support the action we’re taking,” said BC NDP MLA Spencer Chandra Herbert

“Meanwhile, BC’s strong economy is expected to build more homes than the BC Liberals predicted before the speculation tax was introduced. Andrew Wilkinson’s plan to cancel these measures would hand hundreds of millions in giveaways to the top 2% and speculators while causing housing costs to skyrocket out of reach for people.”",New Poll Says 68Percent Of British Columbians Agree With NDP’s Speculation Tax,The Link,http://thelinkpaper.ca/?p=72532

It’s unlikely to pass — but according to these Indigenous experts, the bill serves as an important test for Doug Ford’s government","Ontario’s legislative assembly will consider a familiar question this month: How can we best respect Indigenous rights? On March 6, NDP Indigenous relations and reconciliation critic Sol Mamakwa introduced a private member’s bill — Bill 76 — which calls for laws in Ontario to be in line with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. On Thursday, the bill will go to second reading. If it passes, it will then head to committee. (Like the vast majority of private member’s bills, however, Bill 76 is very unlikely to pass.)



“There are numerous, needless deaths and unnecessary suffering happening in our communities that would not be acceptable anywhere in Ontario — or in Canada, for that matter,” Mamakwa says. “In the house, I always ask why they treat our people differently. That’s what this is; it’s a test for the government.” (The government did not provide comment on Bill 76 when asked by TVO.org.)



UNDRIP outlines the “minimum standards for the survival, dignity, and well-being of the Indigenous peoples,” focusing on such issues as the right to self-determination and prior and informed consent on matters related to Indigenous and treaty rights.

When UNDRIP was first adopted by the UN in 2007, Stephen Harper’s federal government praised it as an “aspirational document” but nonetheless voted against it. Justin Trudeau campaigned in support of it, and his government removed Canada’s objector status in 2016. But, two months later, then-justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould called it “unworkable” and a “political distraction to undertaking the hard work actually required to implement it back home in communities.”



Without guidance from the federal government, provinces have been left to determine their own course. British Columbia recently committed to formally legislating UNDRIP. In Ontario, many Indigenous people are skeptical of the government’s commitment to Indigenous issues. Since the June election, the Progressive Conservative government has slashed the Indigenous Culture Fund, reneged on a previous commitment to introduce Indigenous-focused curriculum updates, and merged the formerly independent Indigenous affairs cabinet portfolio with energy, northern development, and mines.



TVO.org spoke with three Indigenous experts about the importance of the bill, its chances of becoming law, and the impact its success or failure in the house would have on the relationship between Indigenous people and the province.



Scott Robertson



Scott Robertson, a lawyer and the president of the Indigenous Bar Association, hopes that the government will pass Bill 76, but he isn’t confident that will happen.



“The government of Ontario would have to take all measures necessary to ensure that the laws of Ontario are consistent with UNDRIP,” says Robertson. “I’m not getting the cozy feeling from Premier Ford that he would be interested in taking on that initiative or the responsibility.”



For one thing, there’s the issue of feasibility. Section 91(24) of the Constitution Act says that the federal government has authority over “Indians, and Lands reserved for the Indians.” Robertson says that, while the province may indicate that it would be able to satisfy many of these requirements, they ultimately could fall under the federal government’s jurisdiction.



Specific sections, such as Article 19, could also prove problematic, he notes. Article 19 states that the Crown must “obtain [Indigenous peoples] free, prior and informed consent” on anything that affects Indigenous and treaty rights — and that could transfer a huge amount of power from the province to Indigenous people.



In situations involving resource extraction, for example, “You’d actually have to get the Indigenous group to say, ‘Yes, we approve,’” says Robertson. “Not just the consultation of showing up to a board meeting, giving some notes, some papers, and saying, ‘This is what our project will be like — hope you like it.’”



Robertson notes that, if Bill 76 fails to pass, Indigenous and treaty rights will remain protected by Section 35 of the Constitution Act (1982). “Indigenous rights are enshrined in Section 35, which is a lot more comforting than an UNDRIP document,” he says.



But, Robertson says, if the government rejects this bill, it will be signalling that it doesn’t want to help Indigenous people: “They want to create a system whereby it becomes so intolerable, [Indigenous people have to] leave the reserve and give up the rights to their land.”



Lindsay (Swooping Hawk) Kretchmer



Lindsay (Swooping Hawk) Kretchmer says that Ontario should support UNDRIP in part because of the size of the province’s Indigenous population. “Stats Canada data from 2016 put Ontario as number one in the country for overall Indigenous population,” she says. “The time to take stock of these realities is now — the bill may have implications, but doing nothing has far greater consequences.”



Kretchmer, the executive director of the Toronto Aboriginal Support Services Council and a former Indigenous affairs consultant with the city, says that if Bill 76 were to pass, it would transform current policymaking, creating a legal framework for Indigenous self-determination.



“UNDRIP would be used as the underpinnings of new laws to redress historical injustices in a manner that eradicates our contemporary challenges, allowing us to build our own path forward parallel to that of our Canadian friends,” says Kretchmer.



But she’s not optimistic about the bill’s chances, believing that it will fail “due to a longstanding, uninformed opinion on Indigenous people that evokes fear among decision-makers that we just might get one step too close to actually regaining more than a Section 35 mention.”



She is glad, though, that, at the very least, the bill will force the government to take a firm position. “It puts the current leadership in a position to make a clear choice on where they stand with Indigenous rights-based issues.”



Aylan Couchie



On February 23, artist and writer Aylan Couchie published an open letter to Doug Ford, addressing cuts to the Indigenous Culture Fund (ICF), which was created by the Liberals in 2017 to support Indigenous communities, culture, and ways of life through community-based work. “We are concerned the Ontario PC government does not realize what it is they have cut and, we fear, are looking to completely dismantle,” she wrote.



Couchie sees programs such as those funded by the ICF as critical to reconciliation because of the community work they support — language revitalization, traditional harvesting, food security — and points to Bill 76 as one way to protect them.



She believes that cuts to the ICF are counter to the spirit of UNDRIP. “ICF can be seen as Ontario’s commitment to upholding the declaration,” says Couchie. “It covers 14 different Articles, like Article 8 — how we have the right to not be ‘subjected to forced assimilation or destruction of culture.’”

If Bill 76 isn’t passed, she fears that the government will continue to roll back Indigenous funding.



“[Bill 76] is going to impact too many ministries, and Doug Ford won’t be able to make the cuts that he’s making right now,” says Couchie. “It’s not conducive to [the PCs’] end goal.”



She does, however, think that Mamakwa’s move to present Bill 76 was a smart one, regardless of the outcome. “I think the bill is mostly just to show exactly where Ford lies,” Couchie says. “I don’t think it ever had a hope in hell, and I don’t think Sol thought it had a hope in hell. I think it’s just to highlight that the government is not going to be working with Indigenous people or for Indigenous people.”

Kenney reminded supporters last night that the NEP brought in by former prime minister Pierre Trudeau in 1980 ravaged Alberta’s energy industry and economy.

And he says the policies of Alberta’s NDP government and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have been doing the same thing.

Kenney says Premier Rachel Notley has sold Alberta out to the federal Liberals and it is time for a bright new day under his leadership.

Notley was also in the key election battleground city, firing up her supporters at her own rally by promising to protect education and health care and promoting her plan to diversify the economy.

Notley says there is no place for right-wing extremism, racism or hate in Alberta, especially in the legislature.

She says she doesn’t believe Kenney is racist but says his party has a problem with racism.","Leaders of NDP, United Conservatives rally troops in key Calgary battleground",energeticcity.ca,https://www.energeticcity.ca/2019/03/leaders-of-ndp-united-conservatives-rally-troops-in-key-calgary-battleground/

The Institute conducted an online survey between March 11 to 18 with a sample of 812 adult Albertans to see what issued they care the most about and who they would vote for if the election was to be held the following day.

The answers showed a large lead for Jason Kenney and his United Conservative Party among the respondents, with 56% in favour of the UCP and only 31% stating that they would vote for Rachel Notley and the New Democratic Party.

Of the sample size, the only demographic that appeared to lean more towards Notley was Albertan respondents aged 18 to 34.

The poll also showed that male respondents were much more likely to throw their hat in with Kenney, as well as those aged 35 and up.

Unsurprisingly, the main concerns heading into this April’s election included the oil and gas industry, jobs, and the economy, while respondents considered education and the environment to be much lower on their list of concerns.

When asked whether or not they were satisfied with the state of Alberta under its current government, 43% of those polled stated that they were very dissatisfied, while another 17% were somewhat dissatisfied.

In total, only 40% of respondents were satisfied while 60% were not.

The approval rating of the leaders in particular somewhat echoed the percentages of would-be voters for each party, with 42% approving of Premier Notley and 56% approving of Kenney.

Only 1% stated that they were “not sure” when asked if they approved or disapproved of Notley and only a slight increase of 3% for those who were undecided when it came to Kenney — showing that, for at least the 812 Albertans polled, the line in the oil sand has been drawn and crossed on both sides.

CALGARY – Alberta Premier Rachel Notley has called an election for April 16.

Notley asked cheering supporters standing behind her in Calgary this morning if they are ready to fight for an Alberta that benefits everyone.

She began her attack on the leader of the Opposition United Conservatives immediately.

“The question is this: do Albertans stick together or do we turn on each other?” she said.

“Jason Kenney wants two Albertas – one for the wealthy and one for the rest of us. He wants two Albertas divided over people’s rights.

“I want to continue to build one Alberta.”

The start of a 28-day campaign comes a day after a new session of the legislature began with a throne speech that focused on the NDP government’s accomplishments in the last four years – from building schools, roads and hospitals to providing more supports for seniors, students and those in need.

It also criticized the former Progressive Conservative government, and said the New Democrats have been working to overcome the failures of the past.

The spring election will be the first for the United Conservative Party and its leader Kenney, a federal cabinet minister under former prime minister Stephen Harper.

The United Conservatives were Kenney’s answer to unite the right, and were born out of a merger of the Alberta Tories and what was the Opposition Wildrose Party.

By law, the election had to be held by May 31.

Chef and restauranteur Todd Perrin hopes to be the one to turn St. John’s East-Quidi Vidi from orange to blue.

The Mallard Cottage and Inn by Mallard co-owner announced his intention to seek the nomination for the Progressive Conversatives in the district that’s been an NDP stronghold since 1990.

“Looking forward to the challenge and seeing the promise of our province more fully realized,” Perrin posted on his Twitter account.

If Perrin is successful in obtaining the nomination, he’ll be going up against new NDP leader Alison Coffin. The Liberals have yet to announced any candidates or nominees for the district.

In a letter to committee chair Anthony Housefather, Wilson-Raybould says she will provide a written statement to the committee that will include more information supporting her testimony, including texts and emails.

The letter, dated March 21, notes that because the committee has concluded its study, she understands she will “not be re-called as a witness to complete my testimony or to respond orally to statements that were made by witnesses after I testified.”

Wilson-Raybould testified at the committee on Feb. 27, after the Globe and Mail reported allegations that while attorney general she had been inappropriately pressured to intervene in the criminal prosecution of Montreal-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin. Other key witnesses testified after her, however, including Gerald Butts, who recently resigned as principal secretary to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and Michael Wernick, who recently announced his early retirement as Privy Council Clerk. Wernick had first testified before Wilson-Raybould’s appearance, but was asked to appear a second time.

“In the course of my testimony there was a request for me to provide further information,” says Wilson-Raybould’s letter. It specifically cites the request for “copies of text messages and emails” related to her testimony.

“Related to these requests, I also have relevant facts and evidence in my possession that further clarify statements I made and elucidate the accuracy and nature of statements by witnesses in testimony that came after my Committee appearance.”

However, the letter also says her submission to the committee will stay “within the confines” of the waiver of privilege Trudeau provided in February. That means it will not address any events that happened after she was informed in January she was being removed as justice minister and attorney general as part of a cabinet shuffle. Wilson-Raybould has said she will not discuss those events unless she gets a further waiver of privilege from Trudeau.

Housefather, the Liberal MP who chairs the justice committee, indicated the committee would publicly post any such material received from Wilson-Raybould on the committee website.

“The standard practice is what I will strongly recommend we follow,” he posted on his Twitter account after Wilson-Raybould’s letter became public. “This means submissions are translated into both official languages, redacted for personal information (cell phone number etc.), circulated to members to review and then soon after posted on Committee site.”

Taking questions in Thunder Bay, Ont., on Friday, Trudeau insisted the existing waiver he’s granted to Wilson-Raybould is sufficient, and said the existing testimony has adequately addressed the controversy.

“She testified for four hours on her experiences as justice minister in regards to Lavalin,” he said. “There has been a full airing at the justice committee of the matters involving the former justice minister and the attorney general and the SNC-Lavalin file.”

On Thursday, Maclean’s published an interview with former Treasury Board President Jane Philpott, who resigned from cabinet over the government’s handling of the affair, in which she said there is still “much more to the story that should be told.”

“I believe the former attorney general has further points to make,” Philpott said in the interview. “I believe that I have further issues of concern that I’m not free to share … I believe we actually owe it to Canadians as politicians to ensure that they have the truth. They need to have confidence in the very basic constitutional principle of the independence of the justice system.”

There are still multiple options beyond the justice committee for how Wilson-Raybould or Philpott could discuss the matter. The Conservatives and NDP are pushing for the ethics committee — which is chaired by a Conservative MP — to invite Wilson-Raybould to testify, though the Liberals still hold a voting majority on the committee and will likely vote down such an invitation.

The Senate is also considering a motion to study the issue, but the motion has been bogged down in debate. Peter Harder, the government representative in the Senate, has moved an amendment that would effectively kill the study in favour of leaving the matter for Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion to study. Dion, however, has recently announced a prolonged absence for medical reasons, which may cause delays in how quickly his office can release a report.

There have also been suggestions that Wilson-Raybould and Philpott simply use parliamentary privilege to discuss the matter in the House of Commons. Parliamentary privilege allows MPs to discuss any topic during parliamentary proceedings, free from sanctions from cabinet or the courts.

But in her interview, Philpott explained why this course of action is more difficult than it might seem, pointing out that members statements in the chamber are typically kept to only a minute or two. “We got four hours of testimony from the former AG, and I think there’s still a substantial amount of her story that’s not out there,” she said. “I doubt that I would get four hours of time, or she would, or others would, to be able to explain the story in the House of Commons.”

Meanwhile, SNC-Lavalin found a new way to make headlines in Ottawa on Friday — this time over its contract to build a $1.6 billion extension of the city’s light-rail project.

City council approved the contract on March 6, but CBC is now reporting that SNC-Lavalin was granted the contract despite not meeting the minimum technical score to qualify for the project, unlike two competing bids. The CBC report was based on three confidential sources.

SNC-Lavalin is already building the first phase of Ottawa’s LRT, the opening of which has been delayed by nearly a year. Such public infrastructure projects are a major source of SNC-Lavalin’s business, and a reason why the stakes are high over the corruption prosecution at the core of the Wilson-Raybould controversy. Wilson-Raybould has alleged she was pressured to defer the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin in part because a corruption conviction could see the company barred from bidding on federal procurement contracts, and imperil its future in Canada.

The latest data compiled by Toronto’s Forum Research firm on the ongoing “federal horse race” between the governing Liberals, the Conservatives and the NDP shows voter intentions remain tilted in favour of the Tories.

Of the 1,490 random Canadians asked over March 19 and 20 who they would mostly likely vote for — or would “lean toward” voting for — “if a federal election were held today,” 41 per cent said they would vote Conservative versus 35 per cent for the Liberals, with the NDP coming in third place with 14 per cent. Given the polling methodology’s projected margin of error of “plus or minus three per cent, 19 times out of 20,” those rankings have essentially been locked in the same positions since a Forum Research survey in January 2018 that placed the Conservatives at 43 per cent, the Liberals at 38 per cent and the NDP at 12 per cent. A second Forum poll conducted during the same period found favourable sentiments across the country toward most of the big proposals in the budget.

More than half of its respondents support the planned introduction of a national pharmacare program (55 per cent), while a solid majority was behind offering financial aid to upgrade worker skills and training (57 per cent) and a plan that would allow senior citizens to work part-time while still collecting the guaranteed income supplement (57 per cent). About half of those polled also support financial incentives for first-time home buyers (47 per cent) and people looking to purchase zero-emission vehicles (47 per cent). Less popular is a proposal to allocate more federal money to speed up asylum claims, with 38 per cent opposed and 32 per cent in favour. The introduction of a federal carbon tax, meanwhile, was rejected by 46 per cent of respondents, with 39 per cent saying they oppose it “strongly.” “A lot of the individual measures in the budget are actually fairly popular,” said Forum’s Gary Milakovic. “That’s the thing that’s most interesting: on the individual planks, people are saying ‘Yes, these things are good. We like the idea of national pharmacare, the homebuyers’ incentive is a great idea.’ But when you actually look at the ‘political horse race,’ as we’ve been seeing it for some time now, it’s not shifting the needle in favour of the Liberals. “The one thing that I will say is that there’s been a lot of negative press related to SNC-Lavalin and the government right now, but we haven’t seen that significantly affect our results. They’ve more or less been stable for the last little while … We did a poll slightly after Jody Wilson-Raybould testified and we saw similar numbers from what we’ve seen in the past.” But despite support for most of the proposals put forth by Finance Minister Bill Morneau in Ottawa last Tuesday, the overwhelming opinion among those polled by Forum was that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Liberals are “bad economic managers.” An even 50 per cent of respondents replied “bad” when asked “In general, are the Liberals good economic managers, bad economic managers or neither?” — with 32 per cent saying they were “very bad” — while 30 per cent said “neither.” Just 20 per cent felt the Liberals fell in the “good” category, and only one in 20 respondents felt the job they’re doing qualifies as “very good.”

The current data projects 173 seats for the Tories in the House of Commons if an election were held immediately, with the Liberals nipping at their heels with 143 and the NDP and the Green Party far behind with 21 and one seats, respectively. The new polls show the Conservatives most popular in Alberta, where 70 per cent of respondents would vote for them, and least popular in Quebec, where only 22 per cent would do the same. The Liberals were most popular in Quebec, with 54 per cent support, and least popular in Alberta, at 17 per cent. Ontario, for its part, mirrored the national averages, with 41 per cent of respondents opting for the Conservatives, 37 per cent for the Liberals and 15 per cent for the NDP.

Who could have guessed?

For years now, people have been walking across sections of the U.S.-Canadian frontier to claim asylum or refugee status in Canada. In some cases, these people have arrived in the U.S. simply to make the crossing; in others, they have been in the U.S. for years but decided (likely due to fears of further immigration crackdowns by U.S. President Donald Trump) to take their chances in Canada. Under the Safe Third Country Agreement, Canada and the United States have agreed (with limited exceptions) that they will not accept refugee or asylum claimants from each other’s territory. As both the U.S. and Canada are stable and safe democracies, the logic goes, someone on U.S. soil has no further need of flight into Canada, and vice versa.

The problem is this: the agreement only covers claimants who cross the border at an official crossing point. Someone who just moseys over the border isn’t covered by it, and can claim refugee status or asylum as if they’d swum across the Atlantic to wade ashore on the red sands of P.E.I.

This is an absolutely absurd loophole, but it has been effectively exploited. Roxham Road in Quebec has became the official unofficial crossing point, where RCMP officers and U.S. border patrol officers watch passively as entire families walk into Canada, to be immediately (politely) arrested and driven to an office, where they can make their claim. At of the end of February, more than 1,600 people had entered Canada there in 2019. Those figures are way down from recent years. It was 18,500 in 2018, and just over that in 2017.

Compared to what our European allies have seen in recent years, the number of arrivals is relatively small. But by historical Canadian standards, they are gargantuan, and they have completely overwhelmed the systems we had in place to cope. The Army had to build tent cities to hold the newcomers as they arrived. Montreal’s Olympic Stadium also did duty as a refugee camp. The backlog of cases waiting for a status determination rose to more than 60,000, with wait times approaching two years. Worst of all, polling suggested that the situation on the border was hardening Canada’s generally permissive attitude on even normal, legal immigration.

The federal Liberals have been relatively passive throughout the process. Not for the first time, they were caught between the rock of reality and the hard place of their oh-so-precious political branding. It was Prime Minister Justin Trudeau himself, after all, who’d responded to immigration crackdowns in the U.S. by tweeting to the world that “Canadians will welcome you.” Even as homeless shelters in Montreal and Toronto filled up with thousands of people waiting for a status determination, the Liberals continued to treat questions about the situation on the border as fear-mongering at best and xenophobia at worst. “This process is working to keep us safe,” Trudeau told the Canadian Press at Christmas, before taking a swipe at the opposition Conservatives, saying, “It’s always easier to try and scare people than to allay fears in a time of anxiety.”

It was apparently easier than the prime minister knew — he seems to have fallen for it himself. As columnist Chris Selley noted in the Post this week, this week’s federal budget quietly acknowledges that the border is a problem after all. “In recent years, elevated numbers of asylum seekers, including those that have crossed into Canada irregularly, have challenged the fairness and effectiveness of Canada’s asylum system,” the budget document notes, before pledging that the “Canada Border Services Agency and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police … will be better positioned to detect and intercept individuals who cross Canadian borders irregularly and who try to exploit Canada’s immigration system. Failed asylum claimants who entered into Canada at irregular crossings or between official ports of entry will also be removed on a priority basis.” To this end, hundreds of millions of additional dollars will be pledged over each of the next five years, and Bill Blair, whose cabinet portfolio includes oversight of the border, says that Canadian officials are negotiating with Washington to close the border crossing loophole.

This is good news. It is also years too late. Nothing that is being proposed here is unjust or inhumane. It should have been implemented long ago, before our homeless shelters and asylum claims tribunals were hopelessly overcrowded and public opinion inflamed. Canadians will support these measures, and if effective, will continue to support the traditional, legal forms of immigration that have allowed this country to thrive.

The keen reader will note the “if effective” provision above. There is little reason to believe that the U.S. has any real interest in helping Canada close the loophole — why would they? It is in Washington’s brutal self-interest to turn a blind eye while these tens of thousands of people become Canada’s problem. So while negotiating with the U.S. is still worthwhile, the likely solution to the situation is the same as it’s always been: streamline and enhance the hearing process for refugee and asylum claims so that arrivals from the U.S. know that they will be deported humanely but swiftly. That will take money and effort, but it will also produce results.

And not just for Canadians generally, but for the Liberals in particular. Dealing with this issue ahead of the coming election is entirely in their political interest. Perhaps they’ve now realized that, hence their recent actions. Hopefully they’ll be a little quicker off the mark the next time a matter of genuine national interest collides head-on with their carefully crafted social media branding, and a little less eager to slam anyone who can see a problem for what it plainly is as a fear-mongering bigot.",NP View: The Liberals have suddenly realized the border's a problem after all,National Post,https://nationalpost.com/opinion/national-post-view-liberals-suddenly-realize-the-borders-a-problem-after-all

289,,2019-03-25T16:47:00.0000000Z,"The Progressive Conservative government is introducing legislation that will put an end to the previous Liberal administration's hydro plan while maintaining a 25 per cent rate cut. The Progressive Conservative government says its plan to fix the ""hydro ...","The Progressive Conservative government says its plan to fix the ""hydro mess"" left behind by the Liberals would save taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars while maintaining a 25 per cent rate cut.

The so called Fixing the Hydro Mess Act — introduced Thursday — brings an end to the previous administration's hydro plan, uploads local electricity conservation programs to the corporation that manages the system and overhauls the energy sector watchdog.

Energy Minister Greg Rickford said hydro rate increases will be held to inflation, and noted that the government remains committed to its election campaign promise of lowering rates a further 12 per cent, although he did not have a timeline for that goal.

""The objective is to move as quickly as possible,"" he said.

The Liberals brought in their Fair Hydro Plan in 2017 to address a public outcry over soaring hydro rates, particularly in rural areas. The policy lowered time-of-use rates by 25 per cent by removing from bills a portion of the global adjustment — a charge consumers paid for above-market rates to power producers.

Over the next decade, a new entity overseen by Ontario Power Generation was to pay that difference and take on debt to do so. Then, the cost of paying back that debt, which would have been up to $28 billion under the Liberal plan, was to go back onto ratepayers' bills for the next 20 years. The structure meant the costs of the plan were kept off government books.

Plan will still mean billions in debt: NDP

The auditor general criticized the plan, saying it would cost the province an extra $4 billion.

Under the new Tory plan, borrowing costs to achieve the rate cut would move onto the government's books.

Rickford said that decision would allow the government to save on interest payments, though he did not say by what amount.

NDP energy critic Peter Tabuns ssays the Tory plan will still require the province to take on billions in debt. (Ontario Legislative Assembly )

NDP energy critic Peter Tabuns said the Tory plan will still require the province to take on billions in debt to lower hydro rates.

""This is effectively the Liberals' Fair Hydro Plan,"" he said. ""It's got a new name. But it's still subsidizing hydro bills in a way that people are not going to be able to afford in the long run.""

Green party Leader Mike Schreiner said the Tories are effectively doing the same thing they criticized the Liberals for when they were in opposition, kicking the problem down the road by borrowing to lower rates.

""Tweaking the existing electricity structure will not fix the hydro mess,"" he said. ""They're going to borrow over $4 billion to subsidize electricity bills that disproportionately benefits the wealthy. They should be saving that $4 billion, investing some of it support for low income, rural, and remote communities and using the rest to balance the budget.""

Schreiner said this change will not move the government any closer to its promised 12 per cent hydro rate reduction.

Plan would end rebates for energy upgrades

The Tory legislation would also upload electricity conservation programs to the province's Independent Electricity System Operator, a move the government said will result in savings of up to $442 million.

The government would also discontinue programs that include rebates for energy-efficient heating and cooling equipment, and discounts for buying energy-efficient products such as LED light bulbs. It would also eliminate incentives for builders to improve energy performance in new residences.

The Tories also plan to overhaul the province's energy sector watchdog — the Ontario Energy Board — by streamlining its rate approval process and changing its governance.

While the government has promised to cut costs out of the hydro system, they have also been criticized for intervening too heavily in the sector. Regulators in the north-west United States rejected a proposed merger between the partially privatized Hydro One — which is 47 per cent owned by the Ontario government -- and energy utility Avista.

That came after Premier Doug Ford made good on a campaign promise to fire Hydro One's CEO shortly after taking office. The $6.7-billion deal's collapse triggered $133 million in penalties to be paid to Avista.",Ontario PCs introduce legislation to end Liberal hydro plan,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-hydro-rates-1.5066634

Overall, 31 per cent of respondents polled after the federal budget was released Tuesday said they would vote for Justin Trudeau's Liberals if an election were held now, a decline of about three percentage points from February.

That compared with 37 per cent who said they would back the Conservatives under leader Andrew Scheer, a one-point increase from February, while 14 per cent said they would vote NDP and 10 per cent the Greens.

Scheer also jumped ahead of Trudeau on the question of who would make a better prime minister as the Tory leader got the backing of 25 per cent of respondents compared with 24 per cent for Trudeau, who has been struggling to contain damage from the SNC-Lavalin affair.

As for the budget, which the Liberals are hoping will help turn the page on SNC-Lavalin, 12 per cent of respondents said it was good and 19 per cent that it was bad, but 39 per cent said they didn't really know about it.

Leger's internet-based survey, which cannot be assigned a margin of error because online polls are not considered random samples, was conducted March 19 and 20 using computer-assisted web-interviewing technology and heard from 1,529 Canadians who are eligible to vote and were recruited from the firm's online panel.

And Justin Trudeau came to power on the promise of building a sufficient amount of new affordable and social housing so that every Canadian would have high-quality shelter. Trudeau also ...,"It has not entirely failed in that promise. But with each successive annual budget since it came to power in 2015, the Trudeau government’s progressive instincts have weakened.

The current federal government came to power promising one of the most progressive eras in our history.

And yet, in each of these initiatives, the Grits propose to tackle the country’s challenges with timidity rather than conviction.

In their budget this week, the Liberals proposed advances in skills upgrading, housing affordability, pension protection, relief from high prescription drug costs and financial support for buyers of electric vehicles.

The continuation of that trend in this week’s budget should have Grits worried that their party is losing its soul.

The budget is silent on daycare, whose steep cost helps account for Canada’s pitifully low birth rate, on the gender-pay gap and on retrofitting the country’s inventory of buildings to make them energy efficient in the fight on global warming.

But with this week’s budget, Canadians remain deprived of the universal pharmacare and daycare that have long been mainstays of Europe’s social safety net.

Trudeau also pledged to significantly increase spending on infrastructure, to replace several thousand “structurally deficient” or functionally obsolete highway bridges and decrepit schoolhouses almost a century old.

And Justin Trudeau came to power on the promise of building a sufficient amount of new affordable and social housing so that every Canadian would have high-quality shelter.

As a matter of official party policy, the Liberals have long supported universal pharmacare and daycare.

To be sure, the federal Liberals first came by their reputation for caution about a century ago – of doing by halves what they could not do by quarters.

That last priority enjoys such widespread acceptance that this week’s budget is one of the few places where it doesn’t get meaningful consideration.

That tradition lives on in this budget’s approach to prescription drug costs.

An estimated 20 per cent of Canadians are uninsured or underinsured for prescription drugs. About one in 10 Canadians does without prescribed medications for reasons of cost.

The government said this week that it will spend the next four years figuring out which prescription-drug costs it will cover, a continuation of the current unsatisfactory patchwork approach.

An all-party committee of the House of Commons has called for universal pharmacare. So has the Canadian Medical Association. A dilemma for every doctor is how to help patients be healthy when they can’t afford to fill their costly prescriptions or self-medicate with smaller-than-recommended doses.

The Parliamentary Budget Officer calculates that Canada would save more than $4 billion a year with universal pharmacare, due to the purchasing power of a sole, government buyer.

Unaffordable prescription drugs is a public-health crisis. But we see in this budget the government’s casual approach to crises.

Our affordable housing crisis is caused by a shortage of housing, with unaffordability the result. The solution is to vastly increase the amount of housing stock, as candidate Justin Trudeau promised to do.

We need to revisit the state-sponsored postwar building of affordable housing to accommodate the Baby Boom and subsequent waves of immigrants. That can be achieved now, on a more modest but still significant scale, with federal and municipal financial and zoning incentives to developers to profitably build affordable housing instead of more luxury condos.

Instead, this week’s budget tinkers with measures by which a limited number of qualified buyers can finance the purchase of a home, when the homes simply don’t exist in sufficient number.

And in ignoring altogether the shortage in social housing, the budget’s focus on market housing is downright regressive.

This budget’s signature achievement, its vaunted skills-training measures, are a poke in the eye.

The government will offer a tiny annual $250 tax credit toward skills training, whose actual cost runs into the tens of thousands of dollars. Adults who take time off work to retrain themselves for the jobs of the 21st-century will be eligible for a mere four weeks off the job at just 55 per cent of full pay, and only once every four years. The scheme is a marvel of near-uselessness.

On infrastructure, as my colleague Tom Walkom recently detailed, this government has not partnered forcefully enough with provinces to fund the rebuilding of Canada.

That risks Canada losing competitive advantage to rivals such as China with world-class infrastructure built from scratch.

After this week’s budget, Canada remains a G7 economy without a national industrial strategy for incubating future Apples, Mercks and Teslas. And Canada is still one of the world’s biggest energy producers without a national energy strategy.

That helps explain why oil-rich Canada continues to import most of its refined petroleum products rather than producing them in, say, Alberta. And why our disconnected national electric grids prevents hydro-rich Manitoba from supplying Ontario during epic blackouts like that of 2003.

You will have noticed a pattern here.

Most of these continued deficiencies contribute to income inequality.

As a result, Canadians have the dubious distinction of having accumulated more household debt than almost any country.

We are in fact a thrifty people.

But if daycare for just one child can cost as much as $12,000 a year, if your rent or mortgage is only barely manageable and if you are a victim of long-term wage stagnation, as most North American workers are, then you are likely to be unfairly burdened with debt.

It doesn’t have to be that way, and this government knows it.

The oddity here is that Justin Trudeau’s government is a progressive one. Its landmark Canada Child Benefit – one of this government’s earliest initiatives – has succeeded in cutting the child poverty rate, and quickly, to 9.0 per cent from 13.3 per cent between 2015 and 2017.

This government leads the world in its commitment to free trade, having surpassed its predecessors in opening new markets to job-creating Canadian exporters. Among the budget’s laudable measures is financial assistance to dairy farmers injured in the process of the government’s success in salvaging a renamed North American Free Trade Agreement that the current U.S. president was determined to destroy.

And that tens of thousands of Canadians have made a welcoming home for the more than 41,000 Syrian refugees that this government has so far brought to Canada speaks to a widespread Canadian willingness to embrace progress that this same government underestimates.

And so, the federal Liberals have opted to head into election season with a forgettable budget – an exercise in gesture politics.

There is a line in Proverbs: “Where there is no vision, the people perish.”

Canada is too strong for that. But a people ready for bold, persistent action that a young, energetic Justin Trudeau promised in 2015 have been disappointed again.

The Leger poll was conducted for The Canadian Press this week shortly after the government released its latest federal budget, which promises billions in new spending on measures like job retraining, services for seniors and incentives for first-time homebuyers.

The budget also leaves government coffers with average annual deficit of around $18 billion over the last four years — a far cry from the modest deficits and balanced 2019 books that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised during the 2015 election campaign.

The Liberals argue the spending is necessary to make a real difference in the lives of Canadians, while Conservatives accuse the government of wasting money and saddling future generations with unnecessary debt.

Both messages, however, resonated with Canadians, the Leger poll suggests: while a substantial percentage of respondents agreed the Liberal deficits were bad, many also expressed support for the centrepiece spending measures featured in Tuesday’s spending blueprint.

Some 44 per cent of respondents said they believed the decision to run four years of deficits was the wrong call, while 20 per cent called it the right move and 35 per cent were not sure.

A large majority also voiced support for some big-ticket items in Tuesday’s budget, including a plan to expand high-speed internet to remote and underserved areas of Canada, which garnered the support of 76 per cent of respondents, and a suite of measures to help workers to learn new job skills, which got a thumbs-up from three quarters of those polled.

Measures in the budget designed to make it easier for more Canadian families to buy their first home got a 68 per cent approval rating, while 55 per cent cheered proposed financial incentives to foster electric-vehicle sales.

As for the budget itself, 12 per cent of respondents said they were satisfied, while 19 per cent felt the opposite. The remainder of respondents either said they didn’t know, or remained neutral — an amorphous body of swing votes the parties will no doubt be courting as the election clock ticks down to October.

“If you’re the Liberals, the clear story is to say: ‘Well, we needed to go into deficit to help the economy and do all of these great things that you agree with,”‘ said Leger executive vice-president Christian Bourque.

“The story for the Conservatives is to say: ‘It’s not right. We can’t do this, period.’ So I believe we’ll hear a lot about not necessarily the budget, but about public finances more generally in the weeks to come. And I think that will be a ballot-box question.”

Leger’s internet-based survey, which cannot be assigned a margin of error because online polls are not considered random samples, was conducted March 19 and 20 using computer-assisted web-interviewing technology.

It heard from 1,513 Canadians who are eligible to vote and were recruited from the firm’s online panel. The results were weighted to reflect age, gender, mother tongue, region and level of education to reflect the makeup of Canada’s population.

The poll also suggested the Liberals have been bleeding support over the past month as the government struggled to contain the damage caused by the ongoing SNC-Lavalin affair.

Overall, 31 per cent of respondents polled said they would vote for the Liberals if an election were held now, a decline of three percentage points from February and a total loss of eight percentage points since November.

Yet while 37 per cent said they would back the Conservatives — a one-point bump from February and four-point increase since November — Bourque said most of the gain has come from voters in the West and may not translate into a big gain of seats in Parliament.

The NDP and Greens, meanwhile, saw their support increase by two points from February to 14 and 10 per cent, respectively, which Bourque said could represent trouble for the Liberals.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer also jumped ahead of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the question of who would make a better prime minister, earning the support of 25 per cent of respondents, compared with 24 per cent for Trudeau.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, who made his debut in the House of Commons this week, stood at eight per cent while Green party Leader Elizabeth May was supported by seven per cent of respondents. People’s Party of Canada Leader Maxime Bernier came in at four per cent.

The results are surprising, said Bourque: none of the leaders are as popular as their parties, which suggests that while the shine may have come off Trudeau, that popularity has yet to migrate to anyone else.

“It’s as if right now there is a bit of a void in terms of leadership,” Bourque said.

“There’s not one clear person who’s driving support like Jack Layton did in 2011, like Justin Trudeau did in 2015; who is kind of pulling support up for their political party.”",Opposing deficit ideologies from Liberals and Conservatives both resonating with voters: poll,Calgary Herald,https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/new-leger-polls-suggests-federal-liberals-lagging-conservatives-2/wcm/dae60885-83d8-4eec-9e56-2f7c64cd84f9

OTTAWA -- ""(Prime Minister Justin Trudeau) thinks today's budget will distract Canadians from all of this. He is using the budget -- a critical element of any government's agenda -- as nothing more than a political prop in an unprecedented cover-up."" -- Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer, March 19

---

Andrew Scheer and his Conservative caucus members have been scathing in their attacks on this week's decision by the Liberal-dominated House of Commons justice committee to abruptly end its examination of the SNC-Lavalin affair.

In addition to calling it a cover-up and a snub to all Canadians, the leader of the official Opposition called it an attempt by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to undermine the role of Parliament.

The committee's decision came on the same day as the federal budget was being tabled. So Scheer wove that into his broader criticism of the government, describing the budget as a ""political prop"" by a prime minister determined to divert the public's attention from the scandal engulfing his government.

That raises a question that cuts to the core of this week's two big national political stories, the budget and the everlasting SNC-Lavalin saga: can the regularly scheduled tabling of a federal budget be described as a political prop?

Spoiler alert: The Canadian Press Baloney Meter is a dispassionate examination of political statements culminating in a ranking of accuracy on a scale of ""no baloney"" to ""full of baloney"" (complete methodology below).

Scheer's remark earns a rating of ""a lot of baloney"" -- the statement is mostly inaccurate but contains elements of truth.

THE FACTS

The SNC-Lavalin controversy slammed like a runaway train into Finance Minister Bill Morneau's delivery of Tuesday's budget, the government's final spending blueprint before a federal election scheduled for this fall.

While the budget lockup was underway several blocks east of Parliament Hill, the Liberal majority on the House of Commons justice committee voted to end its five-week inquiry into the controversy, enraging Conservatives and New Democrats alike.

By the time Morneau reached the Commons to deliver his 4 p.m. budget speech, he faced some serious Conservative roadblocks. The Conservatives forced a vote on a motion to allow MPs on the fisheries committee to travel. Several Tory MPs voted both for and against.

They then stood -- one at a time -- to apologize for voting twice. But they each also managed to also denounce the Liberals' earlier decision, which prevented former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould from reappearing before the justice committee. Chants of ""Let her speak"" filled the chamber, while more points of privilege and points of order ate up the clock.

Morneau's speech was delayed an hour, and when he finally rose to speak, he was drowned out by opposition MPs. Eventually, the Conservatives walked out of the Commons, with Scheer calling the committee's decision ""an assault on democracy.""

Morneau's budget aimed billions in new spending at a variety of areas -- from pharmacare to retraining workers to helping first-time homebuyers. It was a deficit-friendly, pre-election platform that contrasted with the Conservative mantra of balanced books. Morneau decided the government would use up a big windfall, and run near-term deficits of almost $20 billion. He offered no timeline for bringing the budget back to balance, and made no apologies.

The budget document credited a stronger economy for an extra $27.8 billion in revenue over the next six years, compared with the numbers in the government's fall update. The new budget will spend about $22.8 billion of that additional cash, and the government said it has earmarked another $4 billion in spending since the fall update.

Morneau called this ""investments to grow our economy for the long term -- while we bring the books back towards balance.""

Trudeau, meanwhile, accused the Conservatives of using the SNC-Lavalin affair to avoid talking about their own ""failed"" approach to the economy. ""The Conservatives still don't want to talk about jobs, about growth, about investing in Canadians because they're realizing they have no plan,"" he said.

WHAT THE EXPERTS SAY

Financial experts say that while budgets can certainly be used by governments to make political gains, they are an annual ritual of government that are scheduled to take place on dates that are set weeks in advance.

""The content of the budget is the real issue, and here the claim the budget was used as a prop is weak,"" said Brett House, the deputy chief economist at Scotiabank. ""Though the revenue windfall was spent, and we would have preferred to see it saved, the amount was not large and wasn't devoted to a big signature project or program.""

Kevin Page, the former parliamentary budget officer, agrees there is no single big initiative in the budget to draw attention away from other issues such as SNC-Lavalin.

""Budgets are not mandatory but it is a long-standing tradition and a best practice to table a fiscal plan before the start of the fiscal year,"" said Page, the president of the Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy at the University of Ottawa.

""This budget does not look like a prop.""

Doug Porter, the chief economist of BMO Financial Group, says there is little doubt the government would like to shift the focus to other matters, including the economy and fiscal policy.

""But, it's also fair to say that, as the quote suggests, a budget is 'a critical element of any government's agenda,""' he said.

Porter said the convention has generally become to unveil a new budget in February or March before the start of the new fiscal year on April 1.

""It's a convention that is followed by all 10 provinces as well.""

THE VERDICT

The government usually releases a budget at this time of year. Though a lot is riding on the pre-election blueprint the Liberals tabled Tuesday, and Trudeau wasted no time in using it to attack the Conservative record, it didn't feature a showcase signature initiative aimed at changing the political channel.

For those reasons, Scheer's assertion that the Liberals were using the budget as a political prop contains ""a lot of baloney.""

Farmers and processors urged the Liberals to commit to compensation comparable to what Stephen Harper's government announced when Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations concluded in the ...,"Faced with an anxious dairy industry poised to complicate the next federal election for the Liberals — particularly in rural ridings in Quebec and Ontario — the federal Liberals are reviving the previous Conservative government's compensation plan to ease the pain of recent trade agreements.

Between trade agreements already in effect — with the European Union and Pacific Rim trading partners — and the still-unratified rewrite of the North American free trade agreement, dairy farmers have said they believe at least ten per cent of Canada's dairy market has been given up to foreign suppliers going forward.

Poultry and egg farmers are also at risk of losing significant shares of their supply-managed markets to American producers if the new NAFTA proceeds.

Now, Finance Minister Bill Morneau's 2019 budget is pledging up to $3.9 billion for an income-protection program for those sectors, along with a measure to protect the value of farmers' quota investments.

""There's recognition that harm has been done. And that those revenue losses will be ongoing in the dairy industry,"" said David Wiens, who represents Manitoba on the board of the Dairy Farmers of Canada.

While this prospect of help is welcome, ""to be in a situation where we're having to receive compensation from the government would not have been the choice of any dairy farmer in the country.""

Dairy concessions were the price Canada had to pay to be part of all three of these trade deals. Wiens said farmers were asked to ""take one for the team"" for the sake of the country's overall economic growth.

The protected market they're losing is unlikely to return.

""We've taken a look at some of those things that are causing people to worry,"" Morneau told reporters earlier in the day, framing the overall approach of his final budget before October's election.

These sectors definitely were worried. Farmers and processors urged the Liberals to commit to compensation comparable to what Stephen Harper's government announced when Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations concluded in the middle of the 2015 federal election campaign.

The Conservatives said at the time that Harper's cabinet had approved a compensation package in advance — one worth up to $4.3 billion if necessary, depending on the real losses the industry sustained over the deal's first decade.

But when the Liberals took power, they claimed this spending was never finalized. Nothing close to a compensation package of that magnitude has been offered since.

Limited 'innovation' funds

One aspect of the Conservative plan — funding to help farmers and processors compete by upgrading their equipment and improving their efficiency — was replicated when the Liberals announced $350 million to offset the threat of competition from European cheese imports after the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) was signed in the fall of 2016.

That funding was completely distributed almost immediately after it became available.

When Canada's concessions in the new NAFTA deal were finalized late last year, the Liberals launched a consultation process with the dairy industry to work out what additional help would be needed to keep the industry sustainable over the longer term.

Officials said Tuesday that process isn't over. In the meantime, this federal budget shows what's being offered to counter the negative effects of both CETA and the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), both of which took effect at the end of the year:

Up to $2.15 billion in ""support to sustain the incomes of eligible dairy, poultry and egg farmers"" that will be ""available in the coming years to deal with income losses associated with these agreements.""

A $1.5 billion ""quota value guarantee program"" to protect the value of investments made by farmers if they are forced to sell their quota at reduced prices because new foreign competition has undermined the value of quota in what is now a less-protected market.

It's the same approach the Tories took to trade compensation: one pool of funds available for demonstrated income losses and to help rural communities with the transition, and a second pool to protect farmers and commercial lenders (who may have financed farm investments) from reduced quota values.

""The structure of it is very similar, almost identical,"" said Rachel Curran, who was Stephen Harper's director of policy at the time. ""It looks like the aid package for farmers was essentially lifted from the 2015 campaign announcement.""

Farmers wait 3 years for similar offer

Answering a reporter's question during a press briefing ahead of the budget's release, Morneau acknowledged in French that he was continuing the approach of the previous government. He said the exact details haven't been worked out.

Budget documents offer no timelines or criteria for these funds.The Finance Department also says work continues on addressing the needs of processors, who aren't covered by this funding for producers.

The government is also studying the ""potential future impacts"" of the new NAFTA.

The revised North American trade deal not only gives up a share of the Canadian dairy market, it also implements export caps and requires the dismantling of Canada's competitive price class for dairy ingredients — two concessions that may threaten the industry's future more than new competition from imported products.

Wiens said dairy farmers didn't know this budget measure was coming, and they haven't really seen enough details to comment fully.

The timeline for this assistance may be key: ""If this is paid out over many years it will have less of an impact than if it's paid out aggressively,"" he said.

Marie-Claude Bibeau, who represents a riding in Quebec's Eastern Townships that includes many dairy farmers, became Canada's first female agriculture minister in the March 1 cabinet shuffle. She said she's very ""close to the producers in Quebec"" and it's a ""huge privilege"" to represent their interests. (Justin Tang/Canadian Press)

Wiens said farmers will work with whatever the government of the day is, and don't need to get into whatever politics may be playing out. But ""if the government declares support for our industry and for supply management, then we expect that it should be followed up with the reality of their actions.""

Pre-empting election threats?

The Conservatives' $4.3 billion package from 2015 was criticized as overly-generous, Curran said. ""It was expected, at that point, that actual losses [from the TPP] would not be anywhere near those numbers.""

The concessions made in the new NAFTA are larger than those Canada made to get the former TPP, she noted.

But offering $3.9 billion without real details? ""This looks like almost a last-minute insertion,"" Curran said, calling it a ""defensive cover-off.""

""It's almost certainly a response to supply-managed farmers, who are well-organized, and well-funded, and they have no hesitation running advertising campaigns against the government or criticizing the government if they feel that they're not being properly supported,"" she said.

""This was almost certainly put in place to forestall that in advance of the 2019 election. Guaranteed.""",Liberals dust off Conservative playbook for a worried dairy sector,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/budget-2019-dairy-compensation-1.5063245

“(Prime Minister Justin Trudeau) thinks today’s budget will distract Canadians from all of this. He is using the budget — a critical element of any government’s agenda — as nothing more than a political prop in an unprecedented cover-up,” Andrew Scheer said Tuesday.

The committee’s decision came on the same day as the federal budget was being tabled. So Scheer wove that into his broader criticism of the government, describing the budget as a “political prop” by a prime minister determined to divert the public’s attention from the scandal engulfing his government.

That raises a question that cuts to the core of this week’s two big national political stories, the budget and the everlasting SNC-Lavalin saga: can the regularly scheduled tabling of a federal budget be described as a political prop?

Spoiler alert: The Canadian Press Baloney Meter is a dispassionate examination of political statements culminating in a ranking of accuracy on a scale of “no baloney” to “full of baloney” (complete methodology below).

Scheer’s remark earns a rating of “a lot of baloney” — the statement is mostly inaccurate but contains elements of truth.

The facts

The SNC-Lavalin controversy slammed like a runaway train into Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s delivery of Tuesday’s budget, the government’s final spending blueprint before a federal election scheduled for this fall.

While the budget lockup was underway several blocks east of Parliament Hill, the Liberal majority on the House of Commons justice committee voted to end its five-week inquiry into the controversy, enraging Conservatives and New Democrats alike.

By the time Morneau reached the Commons to deliver his 4 p.m. budget speech, he faced some serious Conservative roadblocks. The Conservatives forced a vote on a motion to allow MPs on the fisheries committee to travel. Several Tory MPs voted both for and against.

They then stood — one at a time — to apologize for voting twice. But they each also managed to also denounce the Liberals’ earlier decision, which prevented former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould from reappearing before the justice committee. Chants of “Let her speak” filled the chamber, while more points of privilege and points of order ate up the clock.

Morneau’s speech was delayed an hour, and when he finally rose to speak, he was drowned out by opposition MPs. Eventually, the Conservatives walked out of the Commons, with Scheer calling the committee’s decision “an assault on democracy.”

Morneau’s budget aimed billions in new spending at a variety of areas ç from pharmacare to retraining workers to helping first-time homebuyers. It was a deficit-friendly, pre-election platform that contrasted with the Conservative mantra of balanced books. Morneau decided the government would use up a big windfall, and run near-term deficits of almost $20 billion. He offered no timeline for bringing the budget back to balance, and made no apologies.

READ MORE: Justin Trudeau’s Liberals have 3 budgets under their belts. Are they keeping their promises?

The budget document credited a stronger economy for an extra $27.8 billion in revenue over the next six years, compared with the numbers in the government’s fall update. The new budget will spend about $22.8 billion of that additional cash, and the government said it has earmarked another $4 billion in spending since the fall update.

Morneau called this “investments to grow our economy for the long term – while we bring the books back towards balance.”

Trudeau, meanwhile, accused the Conservatives of using the SNC-Lavalin affair to avoid talking about their own “failed” approach to the economy. “The Conservatives still don’t want to talk about jobs, about growth, about investing in Canadians because they’re realizing they have no plan,” he said.

What the experts say

Financial experts say that while budgets can certainly be used by governments to make political gains, they are an annual ritual of government that are scheduled to take place on dates that are set weeks in advance.

“The content of the budget is the real issue, and here the claim the budget was used as a prop is weak,” said Brett House, the deputy chief economist at Scotiabank. “Though the revenue windfall was spent, and we would have preferred to see it saved, the amount was not large and wasn’t devoted to a big signature project or program.”

Kevin Page, the former parliamentary budget officer, agrees there is no single big initiative in the budget to draw attention away from other issues such as SNC-Lavalin.

“Budgets are not mandatory but it is a long-standing tradition and a best practice to table a fiscal plan before the start of the fiscal year,” said Page, the president of the Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy at the University of Ottawa.

“This budget does not look like a prop.”

Doug Porter, the chief economist of BMO Financial Group, says there is little doubt the government would like to shift the focus to other matters, including the economy and fiscal policy.

“But, it’s also fair to say that, as the quote suggests, a budget is ‘a critical element of any government’s agenda,”‘ he said.

Porter said the convention has generally become to unveil a new budget in February or March before the start of the new fiscal year on April 1.

“It’s a convention that is followed by all 10 provinces as well.”

The verdict

The government usually releases a budget at this time of year. Though a lot is riding on the pre-election blueprint the Liberals tabled Tuesday, and Trudeau wasted no time in using it to attack the Conservative record, it didn’t feature a showcase signature initiative aimed at changing the political channel.

For those reasons, Scheer’s assertion that the Liberals were using the budget as a political prop contains “a lot of baloney.”

Aaron Wudrick is federal director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation.","Friends, we are gathered here today to celebrate the short, but eventful, life of the Liberal balanced budget promise. Tragically, the promise passed away peacefully last Tuesday surrounded by the national press gallery, following a prolonged battle with deficit spending, at the tender age of just three years and six months.

It’s difficult to come to terms with the fact the promise is no longer with us. Born in August 2015 to Justin Pierre James Trudeau, it began its life just as a promise should: surrounded by a loving political family and with every hope of fulfilling its potential. In its early days, its destiny seemed very cast in stone. On the campaign trail, proud papa Justin never missed an opportunity to showcase the promise, bragging about it prominently in stump speeches and even including it in the Liberal campaign platform. Even in its infancy, its impact was undeniable, helping cement a majority government for the Trudeau Liberals in the federal election later that year.

Alas, the euphoria of the election win was not to last, and fiscal health issues soon followed. Some time around the spring 2016 federal budget, the promise contracted a case of severe deficit spending, which was later diagnosed as acute spendicitis, and which would ultimately plague it for the rest of its short life. By the 2017 budget, many of those closest to the promise feared that, without more aggressive treatment, its fiscal condition could become dire and by the 2018 budget, there were open whispers that it might not even survive to see the next election campaign.

As recently as last week, there had been reason for hope: an unexpected, last-minute transfusion of revenue had become available which could have potentially led to a full recovery. Sadly, complications with the procedure ended up aggravating the promise’s already frail fiscal condition and the promise could not cope with the weight of so much additional spending. The budget would not, ultimately, balance itself.

Mourned by millions of voters, the promise is predeceased by its promise siblings, electoral reform and ending omnibus legislation, and survived by its father Justin, guardian William Morneau of Toronto, and the promise to legalize cannabis.

The balanced budget promise might be gone but it is not forgotten. And if any good can come from the heartbreaking passing of such a young promise, it is knowing that there are actions we can take to prevent similar tragedies in the future. We can raise awareness about the dangers of deficit spending, and ensure that governments are screened regularly for spendicitis at election time. We can speak up when governments spend taxpayer dollars recklessly, and ensure that future balanced budget promises will have a chance to survive and flourish.

Document recycling has taken place. Friends of the promise would ask that in lieu of flowers, you consider making a contribution towards an organization committed to raising awareness about deficit spending. Notes of condolence (complaint) to the family can be sent to justin.trudeau@parl.gc.ca.

Called the “New Canadians Platform,” party leader David Khan said the Liberals would improve access to foreign credential upgrades.

“This will help new Canadians find work in their field of expertise and break down barriers to their success. It will also address skilled labour shortages in Alberta,” Khan said in a statement.

The party would also commit to boost settlement funding and invest in adult education and English as a second language training to “help new Canadians integrate more easily into Canadian society.”

Khan made the announcement Sunday after unveiling the Liberal party’s commitment to education reforms earlier in the week, offering a campaign promise to scrap class-size guidelines in favour of putting caps on the number of students in each classroom.

“Alberta Liberals are committed to new Canadians in Alberta,” Khan said. “We will provide them opportunities. We will make new Canadians’ lives better in Alberta.”

Khan is set to take on the NDP’s Kathleen Ganley in the riding of Calgary-Mountain View when Albertans go to the polls on April 16.

Ganley — NDP justice minister and MLA for Calgary Buffalo — and Khan also squared off during the 2015 election, with the NDP winning that seat.

But the biggest bombshell, in Brown ...","On Friday, Conservative House Leader Candice Bergen offered some advice to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that he is likely to ignore. Let Jody Wilson-Raybould have her (additional) say. Stop muzzling her with cabinet confidence and solicitor-client privilege. Waive it.

Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners Want Justice? Then Let the Youth Lead When The Tyee’s Katie Hyslop won a major honour, here’s how she used the platform it provided.

“The longer he continues this cover-up,” Bergen said of Trudeau, “the longer he moves heaven and earth to keep himself protected, the worse this gets for him.”

Does it get worse? Or will Canadians tire of the saga and move on, as the Liberals this week bet by moving to shut down the inquiry?

Martyn Brown, who as premier Gordon Campbell’s chief of staff handled scandals buffeting the B.C. government during the 2000s, thinks that this week Trudeau has moved closer to the brink of disaster. The heightened prospect of an RCMP investigation makes Trudeau an anchor sinking the party he once rescued with his leadership.

Now, says Brown, it’s time for Liberal insiders to convince Trudeau to step down.

More bad days for the PM

In one twist this week, Wilson-Raybould promised to dump a pile of more documents on the Justice Committee in order to prove her allegations of undue political interference are correct, even if she isn’t allowed to testify in person.

In another turn, Celina Caesar-Chavannes, who said she’d been bullied by a shouting Trudeau, left the Liberal caucus to sit as an independent MP.

Meanwhile, SNC-Lavalin’s CEO said Trudeau’s team is wrong to imply that his company asked to be spared a criminal trial or else it would move from Montreal with 9,000 Canadian jobs sacrificed.

But the biggest bombshell, in Brown’s view, was dropped by former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott, Trudeau’s other cabinet minister to resign in dismay over LavScam.

What Philpott had to say in her interview with Maclean’s magazine on March 21 proves she’d “gone rogue,” says Brown.

“I’m not accusing anybody of anything illegal or contrary to the Criminal Code,” emphasizes Brown. But Philpott raised enough questions to possibly prod the RCMP to launch an investigation, and that would mean a severe hit to Trudeau’s political fortunes.

On the phone with The Tyee March 21, Brown laid out his reasoning:

Philpott is “now basically saying in this interview with Maclean’s that Jody Wilson-Raybould was bullied, that there is much more to the story. And so she’s flatly contradicting [Trudeau’s] version of events.”

Philpott has given “new legs” to the demand by five previous attorneys general and the Tories for an RCMP investigation. In Maclean’s she makes it clear she could not remain in “solidarity with cabinet,” because she “felt that there was evidence of an attempt to politically interfere with the justice system in its work on the criminal trial that has been described by some as the most important and serious prosecution of corporate corruption in modern Canadian history.”

She also reveals that she raised deep concerns about the DPA file on SNC-Lavalin a full month before the affair became public.

She says this, Brown notes, as we find out the PMO’s claims about harm to the public interest if SNC-Lavalin were to be criminally prosecuted are baloney.

“What we need to know is, in this period, particularly after Jan. 14 when the shuffle took place, was cabinet misled by false threats or false information of the sort we’ve now learned about? That SNC was leaving Montreal, which [we know] now is patently untrue. Or that Canada was going to lose 9,000 jobs, which the present CEO now says was patently untrue. Was cabinet misled by that? Because if so, that would be a reason for the RCMP to investigate.”

The Mounties would be particularly interested in finding out, says Brown, “if false information was used to try to pressure Jody Wilson-Raybould to get her to politically intervene for something that anyone in government knew wasn’t true. Or if the government knew that it wasn’t true that jobs would be lost, that the company would move, as it was trying to suggest to her was the reason in the public interest, then the public interest argument goes out the window.

“That’s the only legal argument the government currently has. Even though by law they’re precluded in the Criminal Code from considering the national economic interest, they’re trying to couch it in this phrase, ‘the public interest,’ to say that because it was in the public interest, that’s why they could talk to her.

“But if the public interest argument is based on a lie, and they knew that, then all that you’re left with is a political motive, an electoral motive that would be self-serving. And that to me would raise questions of obstruction of justice, breach of trust, all sorts of things that the RCMP would suddenly be concerned with.

“I think that’s what’s really changed, the stakes have been elevated by both what the present CEO has said and what Philpott has said.”

Veteran of scandal management

Brown was chief of staff for premier Campbell on Dec. 28, 2003, the day RCMP officers arrived at the B.C. legislature and carted away boxes of evidence for what would become a years-long scandal involving the botched billion-dollar sell-off of the province’s public rail system.

Neither Campbell nor Brown was charged with any wrongdoing. But eight years later, Brown was the first witness called for the resulting trial, which ended with guilty pleas to fraud by two ministerial aides.

If Trudeau gets a knock on his door by the Mounties any time soon, he might want to give Brown a call for a bit of advice.

Then again, the PM likely won’t like what he hears. Brown, who writes a column for the Georgia Straight, declares in his latest that the Liberals’ best chance of winning the fall election is to “lance the boil” that is Trudeau.

As he told The Tyee in an email today, “The fear of losing Trudeau needs to be flipped on its head if left-leaning progressives want to minimize the chances of a Scheer victory this fall. The Liberals can now only hope to regain the moral high ground that is so vital for securing the values they purport to represent by replacing their leader. They can own the ethical hill they are now choosing to die upon by defending the indefensible by selecting a new leader who the heroines Wilson-Raybould and Philpott and Celina Caesar-Chavannes can all rally behind.”

Brown figures, “I am perhaps one of the first to suggest that Trudeau should be dumped by his caucus in their party’s political interest.”

As such, he joins a club that includes The Tyee’s Crawford Kilian who wrote a column published here March 5 headlined: “Trudeau’s Resignation Is the Party’s Only Hope.”

Its independence is enshrined in Canadian law and a minister can only intervene under rare circumstances, such as asking the competitions commissioner to revisit a case that has been dropped.","OTTAWA — At a time when the federal Liberals are under attack over alleged political interference in the SNC-Lavalin affair, a B.C. regional district appears to have asked two cabinet ministers to intervene in an Competition Bureau investigation because they share the same goals on climate policy.

Metro Vancouver, which provides services to 21 municipalities and a First Nation in the greater Vancouver region, wrote to Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains and Environment Minister Catherine McKenna last week complaining about the “significant resources” it has had to expend because of a Competition Bureau investigation that is underway without its “meaningful input.”

The federal Competition Bureau is investigating the Greater Vancouver Sewerage and Drainage District, a Metro Vancouver corporation, for anticompetitive behaviour, one private company’s CEO calls “medieval.” Metro Vancouver’s letter to the ministers argues that its policies, including the three bylaws under investigation, are aligned with the federal Liberals’ environment plan and asks for meetings with both ministers to discuss the probe, lamenting that the Competition Bureau “appears to be focused narrowly on competition related to the provision of garbage disposal services without regard to social objectives (including the protection of the environment).”

The letter notes the “natural leadership” governments can demonstrate on environmental issues and warns the consequences of the bureau’s investigation have “the potential to undermine the coordinated efforts of all orders of government to fight climate change, reduce greenhouse gases and pursue a clean environment.”

But others have warned Metro Vancouver has put itself into “conflict,” because it both regulates the waste management industry and acts as a player, drawing its own revenue from waste disposal.

The Competition Bureau is a law enforcement agency that investigates cases on an economic, not social, basis. Its independence is enshrined in Canadian law and a minister can only intervene under rare circumstances, such as asking the competitions commissioner to revisit a case that has been dropped. “The Bureau’s investigation is ongoing and no decision has been made as to whether to pursue any enforcement action, and if so, what that action might be,” said spokesman Jayme Albert, adding, “it would be inappropriate to comment further on Metro Vancouver’s suggestion that their input was not sufficiently sought by the Bureau.”

Don Bradley, a spokesman for Metro Vancouver, said the letter to ministers was only intended to communicate the purpose of its regulatory framework. “These are the ministers whose mandate concerns the protection of the environment and promotion of innovation — the very same topics addressed by the bylaws,” he said. “Metro Vancouver’s purpose in requesting meetings with the ministers is to further explain the purpose of the bylaws and to answer any questions related to the bylaws.”

Bradley did not address questions about why Metro Vancouver was dismayed by the Competition Bureau’s process and the potential consequences of its investigation. “Fighting climate change requires coordination among governments. The environment does not stop at Metro Vancouver’s borders,” he said, adding there is “nothing extraordinary” about the bylaws.

“We are aware that the Competition Bureau is looking into certain Metro Vancouver practices. As the Bureau is an independent law enforcement agency, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further,” said Bains’s press secretary Dani Keenan. “As part of fulfilling (his responsibilities), the Minister and his team members routinely meet with stakeholders on a variety of issues which fall under the Minister’s responsibility.”

It is medieval what these people are doing

Ralph McRae is the CEO of Revolution Infrastructure, one of the private competitors that is providing input in the Competition Bureau’s investigation. He expressed concern about the implications of the letter sent to Bains and McKenna.

“What about SNC-Lavalin? I mean, I don’t know a whole lot of the details about that Lavalin case, but isn’t that, what, somebody tried to get a minister to interfere with a protected independent investigation?” said McRae. “I mean, that’s what that letter smacked of to me, trying to get federal political ministers to step in and intercede in an independent investigation.”

The apparent appeal for political backing from Ottawa comes as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his federal Liberal government continue to be embroiled in a scandal over an alleged attempt to interfere in the criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould has accused Trudeau and senior officials of inappropriately pressuring her to overturn a decision by the Director of Public Prosecutions not to offer the company a remediation agreement. She and another federal minister, Jane Philpott, resigned over the affair. Although a Liberal-majority justice committee shut down an inquiry, Trudeau is facing pressure to allow further investigation.

A government official explained Bains’s department is still working on a response to the letter and no meeting request has been received yet. But if a meeting was held the ministers would not be at liberty to talk to Metro Vancouver about the investigation. “We would want to ensure that there’s not any political interference being seen, or actually happening, that we just let the process play out,” said the official.

That letter smacked of trying to get federal political ministers to step in and intercede in an independent investigation

The Competition Bureau is investigating three bylaws Metro Vancouver passed in 2017. One, already in effect, imposes new fees on waste brought to disposal facilities. The other two, still pending approval from the B.C. environment minister, change licensing requirements for private facilities and commercial waste haulers.

McRae runs an organics and paper recycling facility in South Vancouver. He explained that for one thing, the two pending bylaws would put time restraints on private licensees that could cripple their ability to secure long-term funding — restraints Metro Vancouver would not apply to its own properties. “It is medieval what these people are doing. And they write letters to government, they lobby, talk about all these wonderful things they do, and I read these things and it is so laughable I almost cry,” he said. “They say it’s to promote recycling. It’s got nothing to do with promoting recycling.”

The Waste Management Association of B.C. and the B.C. Chamber of Commerce have both publicly argued that Metro Vancouver’s plan is anticompetitive and would create barriers for small businesses and private investment into new technology.

In 2013, on the argument it would “stifle competition,” the then B.C. environment minister rejected a Metro Vancouver bylaw that the chamber of commerce argued would’ve positioned the regional district to “create a monopoly” on solid waste services. But the 2017 bylaws, which Metro Vancouver requested approval for in December of that year, are still under review.

Suzannah Kelly, a press officer for B.C. Environment Minister George Heyman, said the province is waiting for “further information” from Metro Vancouver before making a decision. Environmental impact is one in a list of factors the ministry considers in approving bylaws, but so is the impact on industry.

“The ministry is aware that the Competition Bureau of Canada is investigating the bylaws, and has been in contact with the Bureau,” Kelly said. “Any relevant information received from the Bureau in advance of a decision may be considered as part of the review process.”

Is that what happened? Canadians need to know.","I am not seeking re-election this fall. Representing Victoria has been exhilarating — constituents never hesitate to express their views. And they have been especially concerned about what appears to be political interference in the administration of our criminal justice system.

I have been the vice-chair of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. Until recently, our committee functioned well. A spirit of collegiality infused our deliberations. Our reports regularly contained unanimous recommendations. However, all that changed with our study into allegations of attempted interference with the former attorney-general’s exercise of prosecutorial discretion.

Jody Wilson-Raybould testified that she experienced “consistent and sustained pressure” to enter into a deferred prosecution agreement with SNC-Lavalin. And that pressure appears to have emanated from the Prime Minister’s Office, the Clerk of the Privy Council and from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau himself. Sadly, the Liberals on the committee confirmed on Tuesday that they are not interested in finding out what happened: they pushed through a motion to end our study. No other witnesses, including Wilson-Raybould, will be able to speak.

It is difficult to overstate how serious this is. The former attorney-general testified that veiled threats were made to browbeat her to take into account partisan political considerations in deciding whether a criminal prosecution should proceed. And when she refused to relent, she was removed from her position. This would be contrary to the rule-of-law principle, something that is enshrined in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Is that what happened? Canadians need to know.

Wilson-Raybould made clear that she still had crucial evidence to provide but was prohibited from speaking about why she resigned from cabinet. Three times I asked the committee to invite her to return and be permitted by the prime minister to speak to contradictory testimony given by Trudeau’s former principal secretary, Gerald Butts, and — until he resigned on Monday — the senior public servant in Canada, Michael Wernick. I also moved that all those implicated in her testimony appear. These motions were all defeated by the Liberal majority.

So now there can be doubt: The Liberals are not interested in finding out what happened. Instead, their only goal seems to be containing the political fallout. Although the prime minister always says that the committee is master of its own procedure, Canadians can now see that the Liberals are being controlled. The prime minister has repeatedly lauded our committee as the place where answers can be found — now we know this isn’t true.

I was truly disheartened to have a front-row seat at this political theatre. I watched the Liberals clumsily cherry-pick witnesses and adjourn an emergency meeting on a whim. All of this culminated in their feeble attempt to use budget day as a fig leaf to conceal the truth.

Words like “cover up” are no longer rhetorical.

The Liberals’ partisanship, the lack of transparency and the dismissive tone applied to the serious allegations should give all Canadians pause. After all, two highly respected cabinet ministers — Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott — have quit the cabinet over this issue.

I have tried to keep an open mind, to be nonpartisan and to seek the truth for Canadians. Yet I have been stonewalled by Liberal colleagues more concerned with damage control than determining whether there was inappropriate political interference. The NDP has called for a public inquiry. Now that the Justice Committee has failed utterly to do its job, that call is even more urgent.

The budget document notes that people with intellectual disabilities, and Austism Spectrum Disorders, encounter unique barrier in securing employment and funding to help overcome these barriers will be provided through the Opportunities Fund for Persons with Disabilities.

Ken Hardie, Liberal MP for Fleetwood-Port Kells told the Now-Leader he’s “pleased to see some action taken on autism, which is a big thing in our riding. We’re into a lot of discussions about more support for autism, so there’s a Ready, Willing and Able provision in there that’ll be intended on helping autistic people find work. If they’re capable of doing some work, we’re going to help them find it.”

Witt is one of many parents across Canada who have been lobbying various levels of government for “science-based” autism treatment and services.

“This is a neurological condition, a health condition that has been thrown into the realm of social services,” Witt said. “We’ve put a medical condition in the realm of social services and are not willing to accept the fact there is science-based treatment that’s well known, that’s demonstrated.”

The Liberal Party of Canada, she noted, had given “overwhelming support” at its biennial convention in Winnipeg in May 2016 to a non-binding health policy resolution that called for autism treatment – applied behaviour analysis – to be covered under Medicare.

The resolution called for the Canada Health Act “be amended to include Medicare coverage for Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or, alternatively, the Government of Canada work with all provincial and territorial governments to ensure inclusion of ABA for ASD within their respective Medical Services Plans.

But she, and many other Canadian parents, are still waiting for the Liberals to make good on that.

“It is just a drop in the ocean, really,” Witt said of the budget provisions. “I mean, what the resolution talks about is providing actual treatment right after a diagnosis. For higher-functioning individuals, they may have the hope for employment, steady employment, they’ve very under-employed and unemployed at huge rates, so Ready, Willing and Able is certainly a good idea, but that’s like putting a Band-Aid on a cancer, really. This is a much greater issue – this is the most pervasive developmental disorder for children across the country, one in 66.

In 2007 a Senate report entitled Pay now or pay later called for a national autism strategy.

“That was ignored,” Witt said. “The Liberals when they were in opposition with the Harper government, one of their MPs presented a private member’s bill calling exactly for Medicare covering autism treatment. So in opposition they’re prepared to do one thing, and in government a different one.”

She said she “absolutely” gives the Liberal budget a failing grade on autism because it leaves so much out.

“Maybe a year or two ago they gave $20 million for a website. While a website is not treatment, and the website doesn’t even exist yet – I believe it’s supposed to be sort of this one place you can go to get all this quality research on the condition, and how to treat it, well that’s great – it doesn’t actually mean treatment for an individual with a diagnosis.”

Witt recalled that Hardie staged a townhall meeting in October 2017 that was attended by “desperate and tearful” families.

“I mean, it was packed, people came out of the woodwork and people with autism, their families, people were in tears, they had to cut off the lineup of people at the microphone wanting to talk. It dangled a little bit of hope out there, and we’ve been through this over and over and over, for years and years and years and years, and we’ve got a massive crisis going on.”

“It’s clearly not politically expedient for them to pay attention,” she said. “I must ask, is the Trudeau government about to write off yet another generation of children with autism, just as the previous Harper government did?”

Khadr was 15 when he was captured in Afghanistan in 2002 and sent to Guantanamo Bay, charged with throwing a grenade that killed U.S. Army Sergeant Christopher Speer.

He was later transferred to Canada, where he was handed an eight-year sentence in 2010, before being released on bail in 2015. Khadr’s sentence would have expired last year had he remained in custody.

Court of Queen’s Bench Chief Justice Mary Moreau ruled that the nearly four years Khadr spent on conditional release counted toward his sentence.

Speaking outside the court in Edmonton, Alberta, the now 32-yaer-old Khadr said he was pleased with the decision.

“I think it’s been a while but I’m happy it’s here, and right now I’m going to just try to focus on recovering and not worrying about having to go back to prison, or, you know, just struggling,” Khadr said.

In 2010, the Canadian Supreme Court said Canada had breached Khadr’s rights by sending intelligence agents to interrogate him in Guantanamo and sharing the results with the United States. He pleaded guilty to Speer’s murder but later recanted, and his lawyers said he had been grossly mistreated.

Canada formally apologized to Khadr in 2017 and paid out C$10.5 million in compensation, acknowledging Canadian government officials had played a role in the abuse he suffered. It was a controversial decision that attracted fierce criticism from many Canadians.

“We are a country that respects the rule of law and very much respects the judicial process,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said when asked about the ruling on Khadr’s sentence.

In 2016, Trudeau’s Liberal government dropped a bid to return Khadr to jail that had been launched by the previous Conservative government.

Khadr’s lawyer, Nate Whitling, said the judge’s decision meant his client would not have to live under any further conditions and there was no longer the risk he might have to return to prison.

Khadr is also seeking dismissal of his U.S. conviction for war crimes.

303,Business,2019-03-24T19:02:00.0000000Z,Startups and “emerging Canadian businesses” will be exempt ... Five new ways to save on your taxes in the Federal Budget Liberals leave themselves little wiggle room in the event of a ...,"In a move that appears to target some of the country’s highest earners in the corporate sector, the Liberal government will introduce a new measure that will limit the tax-deductible amount on employee stock option plans to just $200,000 from the current uncapped amount.

The new rule, however, will apply only to “large, long-established, mature firms,” according to the budget document.

Startups and “emerging Canadian businesses” will be exempt from the rule, in order to help businesses that might not have the means to attract top talent due to profitability and cash flow issues.

Stock options that have been exercised are effectively taxed at half of an individual’s personal income tax rate. They are used by many companies to compensate top-level executives that are in a high tax bracket.

For instance, if an employee is granted 100,000 in options at a price of $50 and in two years, that share price has gone up to $70, the employee who exercises her options will reap a benefit of $2 million ($20 x 100,000). Under the current system, that employee is eligible to claim a tax deduction on $1 million of the benefit.

Now, regardless of how many shares an employee of an established firm is awarded, or how much the share price goes up, only $200,000 in employee stock option grants will receive tax-preferred treatment.

“The idea is to take away some of the advantages that high-income earners currently enjoy, and introduce more tax symmetry into the system,” said Carmela Pallotto, tax partner at auditing firm KPMG.

In 2017, 2,330 individuals earning over $1 million claimed approximately $1.3 billion in employee stock option deductions. By contrast, 20,140 individuals with an income of less than $200,000 claimed just $120 million in stock option deductions, or six per cent of the aggregate amount.

“When examining the evidence, it is clear that the employee stock option deduction is highly regressive,” the budget stated.

“The government does not believe that employee stock options should be used as a tax-preferred method of compensation of executives of large, mature companies.”

More details about the measure, including when it comes into effect, will be announced next summer.

Some tax experts have raised concerns about what is meant by “large, long-established and mature firms.”

“What is really unclear to me right now, is who is a mature company? Who is a start-up? The government has to clarify this differentiation and make sure it is done fairly,” Bruce Ball, vice-president of taxation at Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada, said.

Ball also questioned whether this new system would be competitive when compared to stock option deduction incentives in other countries. The government is claiming that this new stock option tax treatment is a move that is “aligned” with the United States.

One of the other caveats outlined by the Liberals in the imposition of the stock option deduction cap is that it would not apply retroactively, meaning that current employees of legacy companies with handsome stock option compensation packages will not be affected.

“To me, that raises the question that if a company grants options tomorrow, can they potentially grandfathered? Some companies may immediately start thinking about what they can do to accelerate granting options,” KPMG’s Pallotto said.

The stock option deduction cap is in fact, not a new proposal by the Liberals. In the fall of 2015, Finance Minister Bill Morneau floated the idea of a $100,000 stock option deduction cap, but decided against implementing it at the time.

The Liberals claim that their efforts to improve the “fairness of the tax system” over the last three years has enabled the government to recoup $3 billion in revenue, which they say has been reinvested in tax reductions and benefits geared towards the middle class.

The bill will require those who sell guns to contact the Canadian Firearms Program (CFP)—a part of the RCMP—to confirm that buyers have a valid firearms license, and thus are allowed to buy ...","The chair of the Liberal rural caucus says he trusts Border and Organized Crime Minister Bill Blair to take the “right approach” as he prepares to announce whether the government will ban handguns and assault-style weapons following a lengthy consultation.

Liberal MP Francis Drouin (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Ont.), who now chairs the Liberal rural caucus, said a handgun ban would be “an issue” in his riding, but that he trusted Mr. Blair to handle the file.

“Obviously a handgun ban is an issue in the riding. But I think Canadians understand the value of seeing how we address gun violence. I don’t know if a ban is the right question, but I trust minister blair, who is a former chief of police, who will have the right approach on this.”

Independent Senator Pierre Dalphond (De Lorimier, Que.) called on the government to ban all automatic and semi-automatic guns in a March 21 press release, pointing as an example to the New Zealand government’s move last week to ban assault-style weapons from the country in the wake of the shooting massacre of 50 Muslim people in that country by a white supremacist. Gun control advocacy group PolySeSouvient said in a March 22 press release that the action by New Zealand’s government highlighted “the appalling lack of political courage exhibited so far by the Liberal government in response to the 2017 [terrorist shooting] tragedy at the Quebec Mosque.”

Fully automatic guns are already prohibited in Canada, meaning they can only be possessed even by licensed gun owners in limited circumstances. The Quebec Mosque shooter used a semi-automatic rifle to kill six people. Both the Quebec Mosque shooter and the New Zealand shooter were white men, openly racist, who used semi-automatic rifles to murder Muslims.

Liberal MPs from rural ridings have expressed concern in the past about the government’s gun control initiatives, including Mr. Blair’s (Scarborough Southwest, Ont.) consultations on possibly banning handguns and assault weapons, and Bill C-71, which would also extensively reform existing gun control rules. A Liberal MP told The Hill Times a year ago on a not-for-attribution basis that Bill C-71—which has since advanced to committee stage in the Senate—was “scaring the hell out of” Liberal MPs, particularly those from rural ridings. Multiple sources told The Hill Times at the time that former Liberal rural caucus chair T.J. Harvey was rebuked by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Papineau, Que.) when he raised those concerns in a caucus meeting.

National Firearms Association president Sheldon Clare says his organization will try to rally members and supporters in 22 vulnerable Liberal ridings to defeat the incumbents in favour of Conservative MPs. The Conservative Party has strongly opposed any new gun control measures.

“We think that what’s going to end up solving this will be the election,” he said.

A spokesperson for Mr. Blair said his report would be made public “in early 2019.” Mr. Blair told the CBC in January that he had completed the consultations and hoped to bring the results before cabinet in the following two weeks.

Mr. Drouin, who won his seat in 2015 by more than 10,000 votes, said he wasn’t concerned by the NFA’s plans for the coming election campaign.

“It’s not going to change anything for me, no.”

The federal Conservatives have been highlighting Bill C-71 in Facebook ads designed to raise money from their base since the bill was introduced, and Conservative candidates in rural ridings will likely raise it with voters during the election campaign.

Mr. Clare said the NFA’s campaigning “will include organizing our representatives on the ground to encourage their members in local shooting clubs to look critically at the candidates who are presented to them.” He said the campaign would not likely include paid advertising. He declined to identify which ridings the NFA was planning to campaign in.

Mr. Clare said the NFA may urge voters to support NDP candidates in some ridings if it appears that is the best way to unseat a Liberal. He said the NFA will in no circumstances lend its support to a People’s Party of Canada candidate.

“We do not see them as viable candidates at all,” he said.

Gun bill amendments coming in early April

The government’s gun control bill, C-71, is currently before the Senate National Security Committee. Senators expect the committee will start its clause-by-clause examination of the bill during the second week of April.

Opponents of Bill C-71 concede that, like nearly all pieces of government legislation, it will ultimately pass. The Conservative Senate caucus is planning to put forward amendments to at least three parts of the bill, says the party’s critic for the bill in the Red Chamber, Conservative Senator Don Plett (Landmark, Man.): new rules around getting authorization to travel with a gun, the RCMP’s role classifying firearms, and the security of records kept under the legislation.

Bill C-71 will create a new RCMP database to hold information on who has bought and sold guns, and when they did so, though the government says it will not track information on the guns themselves. The bill will require those who sell guns to contact the Canadian Firearms Program (CFP)—a part of the RCMP—to confirm that buyers have a valid firearms license, and thus are allowed to buy and own a gun. The bill will expand background checks for those who apply for a firearms license, require gun retailers to keep records of gun sales and inventory, and restore some powers over gun travel authorizations and classification to the RCMP.

Sen. Plett said the Conservatives would prefer to see the bill scrapped, but will bring forward amendments nonetheless. He said one or more of the amendments would be related to C-71 restoring to the RCMP the power to decide how to classify firearms—as non-restricted, restricted, or prohibited, each of which is more rigorously controlled under law. The previous Conservative government under prime minister Stephen Harper changed the law to give the government the final say on those decisions.

“We believe that that’s something that should be left to Parliament, elected officials,” said Sen. Plett.

Independent Senator André Pratte (De Salaberry, Que.) the bill’s sponsor in the Senate and another member of the Senate National Security Committee, told The Hill Times that he would not be putting forward amendments to the bill.

“The bill is a result of a balancing exercise between the need to better protect public safety, and the concerns and the privileges of gun owners, who are concerned that any new measure on gun control will impose on them an excessive burden,” said Sen. Pratte.

“I think the government was very aware of that, so they tried to arrive at the right balance. They didn’t go as far as the gun control advocates would have liked them to do, and they went further than probably many gun owners would have wished they had done. So they decided to try to strike a balance, and I think the balance is there, frankly.”

Sen. Pratte said he has met with gun control advocates and opponents, and in December travelled with Conservative Senator Dennis Patterson (Nunavut) to Iqaluit to meet with a group of Indigenous hunters who had concerns with the bill.

C-71: what’s in the bill

Here are some of the legal changes that will be brought in under Bill C-71, An Act to amend certain Acts and Regulations in relation to firearms.

Gun retailers will be required to keep records of gun sales and inventory, something many already do. The records will belong to the gun retailers, but police will be able to access the records with a warrant if needed.

Gun retailers will be required to check with the RCMP, through a hotline, that gun buyers still have valid licenses, something some gun retailers already do.

Private individuals selling or giving guns to other private individuals must also check with the RCMP that the person receiving the gun has a valid gun license.

The RCMP will provide gun sellers, private and retail, with a reference number as proof that the buyer’s license was validated. The RCMP will keep the reference number, licence numbers for the buyer and seller, and the date, but no data on the guns sold.

Background checks for those applying for a gun license will look for signs of mental illness “associated with violence,” and for criminal activity, throughout the applicant’s entire life. Background checks currently can only look back five years.

The RCMP is given back control over which guns fall under the different classes established by the government, each of which has different rules and restrictions.

Canada’s chief firearms officer will regain discretion over giving owners of restricted or prohibited guns authorization to transport them. Automatic authorization will be given to transport the weapons home from the store where they were bought, and back and forth from a shooting range.

The government will end a long dispute with Quebec, and provide it with old records from the long-gun registry, something the province has requested. Quebec recently established its own gun registry.

On Friday, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh introduced a new website as a way for people to vent — and so the party can collect stories about how much money people in the country are paying for services.

Singh says even though high-speed internet and cellular services “are a necessity,” they are still far from affordable or reliable. He would like to see them being more affordable.

The NDP blame the skyrocketing prices on the Liberal and Conservative governments relying on market forces and competitiveness to determine what people pay each month, as well as the “Big Three” — Bell, Rogers and Telus — receiving large subsidies.

“Canadians are paying skyrocketing prices while telecoms companies make billions in profits. Once again, Justin Trudeau is showing who’s side he’s on, and it’s not yours,” said Singh, in a statement.

The party plans on pushing the Liberals to lower internet and cellular fees.

A 2018 report from Finnish-based mobile data consulting company, Rewheel, found that Canadians are paying an “astonishing” amount for cell phone data compared to European countries.

It found that for $46 CAD, Canadians are only getting an average of 2 GB of data for their wireless plans — when wireless customers in Croatia, Austria, Finland, Lithuania, Slovenia, Switzerland, Latvia, Estonia, and Poland, all receive unlimited data plans for the same amount.",The NDP wants to hear Canadian horror stories about phone and internet fees,Daily Hive,https://dailyhive.com/montreal/ndp-canadian-phone-internet-fees-2019

He was formerly Director of Communications to Stephen Harper.

As a rule of thumb, a “shut down” strategy only works if you’re actually in control of the things you need to shut down.

A House of Commons justice committee stacked with a majority of your party members? Eminently shut-downable. An office full of your loyal employees? Equally sealable. A wayward clerk of the Privy Council? With a gentle shove you can even send one of them on his way.

But Justin Trudeau isn’t in control of all of the things he needs to shut down in the SNC-Lavalin scandal. That’s his problem. You can’t shout “nothing to see here” when the chorus is free to pop up behind you and shout “look over here” at the top of their lungs.

That’s what the opposition has chosen to do, literally in this case, as they screamed their way through Bill Morneau’s budget speech. Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives are also using every trick in the Parliamentary procedure rule book to protest the justice committee’s decision to end its ‘investigation’ into SNC, including forcing a standing vote on each line item in the budget.

It might not be elegant, but it’s keeping people from talking about the thing (i.e. the budget) Trudeau hoped would change the channel from Jody Wilson-Raybould and her pesky insistence on the rule of law.

No, you can’t shut the opposition down, you can only hope that everybody gets tired of hearing from them. Which in Canadian politics, to be fair, usually happens. As a nation, we only have so much attention span for caterwauling.

But Canadians have an endless attention span when it comes to the exotic, like when the New York Times decides to weigh in on our politics. Or when the OECD gets a little snippy about our treatment of corruption. And then there’s the catnip of scandal: friendly fire.

Enter Jane Philpott.

Whatever hope Justin Trudeau had of using his last budget to lever SNC off the nation’s front pages died when Maclean’s hit publish on Paul Wells’ cannonball of an interview with Philpott, Trudeau’s former favourite minister (or, as lore has it, the only minister capable of filling Scott Brison’s apparently Olympic-sized shoes at the Treasury Board).

“There’s much more to the story that needs to be told,” Philpott told Wells with respect to SNC-Lavalin. Much more? Really? “We actually owe it to Canadians as politicians to ensure that they have the truth,” she added. That, my friends, is what we call “juicy”. And on and on she went.

It was so raunchy, the Conservatives had to smuggle it into the House in a brown paper bag. And about half of the Conservative caucus then took turns reading sections of this political Tropic of Cancer into the record. They were euphoric.

Because until Philpott’s interview, it was widely assumed the broad (and many of the finer) strokes were known re: SNC. But Philpott appeared to be hinting at something much grander. Something much more sinister.

Had it been a serial self-aggrandizer or self-promoter telling us these things that would be one thing. But when it’s the political equivalent of Mother Superior implying the Prime Minister has been naughty everyone moves to the edge of their pews.

Not that Philpott actually elaborated on her concerns. She went only as far as her Trudeau-delineated handcuffs would allow. No cabinet confidences were broken; instead, Philpott reiterated her concern for the rule of law, portraying Wilson-Raybould as a lonely minister with her finger in the dike of justice, holding back the flow from the PMO wanting SNC to receive its DPA.

“Whether there is one attempt to interfere or whether there are 20 attempts to interfere, that crosses ethical and constitutional lines,” Philpott said of the Prime Minister and his office’s repeated intrusions into Wilson-Raybould’s jurisdiction.

You could practically see the air go out of the Prime Minister’s Office with each question and answer. If the issue managers in Trudeau’s employ didn’t have Philpott voodoo dolls, they do now, where they sit next to those of Wilson-Raybould.

Over in Parliament, meanwhile, Liberal MPs were struggling to pick the righteous shrapnel out of their backs. “[Philpott] is well aware of how we all feel,” Liberal MP Judy Sgro told a reporter. “You know, we don’t want to damage the party, we’ve got a lot of work to do. This is hanging over our head with this innuendo with this, that and the rest of it.”

One can understand Sgro’s frustration. Politics is hard enough without having to worry about attacks from your own side. But it doesn’t appear to have dawned on Sgro that it could be her leader, and not Philpott or Wilson-Raybould, who are doing the damage to her party. Sgro just wants it all shut down, like she’s seen countless other scandals shut down using solidarity in her time.

Modern politics can make sense of anything, it seems, other than newcomers to politics refusing to behave like typical politicians. What Justin Trudeau needs to realize is that the SNC scandal isn’t going away until these two non-politician former ministers are allowed to have their full say.

That Trudeau isn’t letting them speak can only mean he fears that what they have to say will destroy him.

This new agency will buy drugs in bulk and result in drastically cutting the cost of medication.

In a sign of just how expensive pharmacare could be, the government is also promising to spend $500 million a year, starting in 2022, just on subsidizing drugs that treat rare diseases, which have few patients to split huge research and development costs.

The government said it intends to work with provinces, territories and other partners to develop the mandate for the national drug agency, with Health Canada to receive $35 million over four years starting in 2019-2020 to create an office to support the plan.

The budget also includes plans to create a national formulary, a list of drugs that have been evaluated for both efficacy and cost-effectiveness. Lower-tier governments now assess drugs on their own, duplicating much of the work.

The parliamentary budget office has estimated the cost of a pharmacare plan at about $20 billion a year, something many economists say won’t be possible without increasing taxes considerably and the economy performing a lot better on a consistent basis.

Canada’s spending on medication has gone from $2.6 billion in 1985 to $33.7 billion in 2018. People take more drugs to manage more conditions than they used to — living longer, and better, but at considerable cost.

The Canadian Institute for Health Information says drugs are the fastest-growing component in health spending but that most people’s medication needs aren’t covered by public health insurance, unlike care provided in hospitals and through visits to the doctor.

Canada’s current patchwork of drug coverage — including more than 100 public programs and 100,000 private insurance plans — is not well equipped to handle the increasingly expensive drugs now coming to market, the government said in its budget document.

The interim report said drug spending in Canada is expected to surpass $50 billion by 2028.

To maintain this level of health spending, taxes will be going up and Canadians will have even less disposable income leaving them even more dependent on government services and income supplement in old age. And given that these drugs are prolonging the lives of Canadians seems to be a prescription for an unhealthy economic situation down the line. -CINEWS",Liberals take first step toward national pharmacare plan,Canindia.com,http://www.canindia.com/liberals-take-first-step-toward-national-pharmacare-plan/

Since 2009, the number of ships sailing through federally monitored ...","Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s pre-election budget took steps to tackle the gaping infrastructure deficit in Canada’s north, but offered no timeline for when a highly anticipated long-term development strategy for the region will be complete.

In his last budget before the fall election, Morneau earmarked $700 million for Northern and Arctic initiatives, including $18 million for a hydroelectricity project in the Northwest Territories, $75 million for economic development programming and $400 million over eight years for infrastructure projects in the sparsely populated area.

Though Tuesday’s budget also reaffirmed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s 2016 commitment to co-develop an “Arctic and Northern Policy Framework” with local residents and stakeholders, it did not set a date for when it will be unveiled.

“There’s money sprinkled here and there but there’s no big strategy,” said Jessica Shadian, president of Arctic 360, an organization studying investment in the region. “Where does Canada want to see itself in 30 or 40 years and how does the Arctic fit into that?”

As Canada drags its feet, Russia, China and other nations are aggressively investing in the Arctic, making Ottawa’s need to decide on a plan and assert itself in the region more urgent, she added. The United States recently renewed its interest in the Arctic and is currently looking at strategies for how to regulate and draw revenue from maritime traffic, she noted.

“It’s obviously going to take far more than $700 million to build all the infrastructure needed in the North, from ports and roads to everything else,” she said. “If we’re going to pay for all of that, we likely need third party investment and that means participation from financial institutions. Those institutions need to make a business case and to do that, they want to see a long term strategy, a vision for the North.”

There is so much potential for the North to help Canada become globally competitive in a much greater way Jessica Shadian, president of Arctic 360

Also missing from the government’s budget spending is a commitment to boost search and rescue capability in the North, said Hugh Stephens, executive fellow at the University of Calgary School of Public Policy.

Cruise ships and pleasure yachts are increasingly venturing into Arctic waters, including the Northwest Passage, placing new pressure on Canadian operations, researchers have warned. Since 2009, the number of ships sailing through federally monitored Arctic waters increased roughly 45 per cent from 86 ships in 2009 to 125 last year. Meanwhile, the number of voyages taken by those ships — measured by how many times a ship entered the monitored area — increased by 88 per cent during that same period.

“This budget doesn’t strike me as much of a game changer for the North,” Stephens said. “But this government is already running a deficit and I suppose the question is where do you put your resources.”

Still, there was some good news for one industry.

Pierre Gratton, president of the Mining Association of Canada, said his expectations were set low, so a proposal in the 2019 budget to increase infrastructure spending in the north by expanding on a previous $400 million commitment to the region — announced as part of the National Trade Corridors Fund in 2017 – came as a “pleasant surprise” to the mining community.

“What’s been the problem for the North is that infrastructure allocation, historically, has been on a per capita basis, so the North gets peanuts,” Gratton said. ”And it’s been this perpetual problem.”

This budget doesn’t strike me as much of a game changer for the North Hugh Stephens, executive fellow at the University of Calgary School of Public Policy

Indeed, for the mining industry, Canada’s often unexplored territorial north — which includes not only the Arctic but also the roadless northern hinterlands in many provinces — holds great potential. The area is estimated to contain 30 per cent of the world’s undiscovered natural gas and 13 per cent of its undiscovered oil, according to a 2008 U.S. Geological Survey. Others believe a retreat of sea ice could open new opportunities for resource shipping in Canada’s Arctic.

Yet the cost of working in the region is high: Gratton estimated it is six times more expensive to explore in northern areas because of the lack of infrastructure. A shortage of roads means exploration geologists must raise enough money for air travel, often on private planes, he said; and for companies developing projects, there is an additional layer of expense because roads or airstrips need to be constructed.

Also hindering local development is a lack of connectivity, said Gratton, who identifies digitization as a key to reducing operational costs.

“We have members in the North who don’t have broadband,” he said.

The 2019 budget sets aside $1.7 billion for a Universal Broadband Fund, beginning later this year, to bring high-speed Internet to difficult to reach communities, including those in the North. Another $18 million is committed to the Taitson hydroelectricity expansion project in the Northwest Territories to reduce the region’s heavy reliance on diesel fuel. Only eight of the Northwest Territories’ 33 communities are served by a hydroelectric facility, with the rest dependent on costly standalone diesel generation, according to government estimates.

An additional $75 million over five years will go toward the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency to support initiatives including “foundational economic infrastructure” such as roads and visitor centres. Further funding is allocated to research and development, education and suicide prevention initiatives.

Given the size of the shortfall in the North, any long-term commitment to the region’s infrastructure is welcome, Shadian said. But to truly unlock the economic potential of the region, the federal government needs to set a long-term strategy, she said.

“When you look at other Arctic states and how they perceive and treat their north it just seems like we’re not getting it,” she said. “We look at the North as a welfare issue, it’s a cost and we don’t realize what a huge return on investment it could be. There is so much potential for the North to help Canada become globally competitive in a much greater way.”

Furuncles are painful things.

Those festering swollen sores we all know as boils are not easily remedied by covering them up with Band-Aids. Filled, as they are, with so much puss and dead tissue, they can lead to no end of horrid complications if left unattended.

Such infections can even be deadly if they get into the bloodstream and attack the heart or strike bone.

No one knows that better than Canada’s ultimate Good Doctor: Dr. Jane Philpott, whose well-meaning sage advice to all Liberals in Paul Wells’s Macleans scoop interview has been predictably not well received by her caucus colleagues.

Yet far from being offered with intent to hurt, her brave words should be heeded in the spirit intended, as urgently needed action to heal her party, which is now a very sick puppy.

Instead of being vilified by those who are still in denial about their political predicament, she should be thanked for her ongoing efforts.

A physician by trade, Philpott knows a thing or two about sickness and rot when she sees it—and also, about what needs to be done to treat it, no matter how agonizing.

In the context of the prime minister’s ongoing LavScam cover-up, that means not only ripping off the Band-Aid with a full airing of the facts. But also, lancing the metaphorical boil.

Which, as it now pertains to the Liberal body politic, is Canada’s prime minister—a real raging beauty who won’t be pricked or removed without tears of courage and uncommon toughness.

That uncomfortable fact will become screamingly urgent after Jody Wilson-Raybould delivers her forthcoming submission to the Commons justice committee.

When Puglaas and Philpott (P&P) have their say, as they inevitably will, it will become patently clear that it is Trudeau who is the root source of the Liberals’ misery—and he must be dealt with as such.

The pain that he invited and perpetuates will not easily subside by holding him harmless. Nor will it be aided by casting aspersions on the messengers sounding the alarm on all that marks his conduct in this matter as evil.

Listen to Dr. Philpott’s damning diagnosis:

“I resigned because I could not maintain solidarity with cabinet on the specific issue of the management of the SNC-Lavalin issue.""

“I felt that there was evidence of an attempt to politically interfere with the justice system in its work on the criminal trial that has been described by some as the most important and serious prosecution of corporate corruption in modern Canadian history.”

“I believe the former attorney general has further points to make. I believe that I have further issues of concern that I’m not free to share … There’s much more to the story that should be told.”

“I believe we actually owe it to Canadians as politicians to ensure that they have the truth. They need to have confidence in the very basic constitutional principle of the independence of the justice system.”

“If nothing wrong took place, then why don’t we waive privilege on the whole issue and let those who have something to say on it speak their minds and share their stories?”

That is what’s known as a rhetorical question.

Because Philpott and JWR both know that a whole world of wrong did take place.

And it points directly to the real boil on the Liberals’ backside—the carbuncle in the PMO.

Healing the hurt that he wished upon us all is two-step process; one that all Liberals should now see is indicated for their own political health and survival, to say nothing of the public interest.

Step One is explicitly urged by the Good Doctor.

It starts with exposing the whole truth that lies beneath their leader’s failed attempts to mask and sanitize his whole stinky affair, so that we can all see the full extent of his assault on the people, offices, and constitutional tenets that were sorely touched by his tortuous logic.

A new assault on that messy enterprise will be made with JWR’s pending submission to the justice committee, which she promised in the letter she sent on Friday to its obstructionist-in-chief, Anthony Housefather.

Yes, that would be the same Trudeau acolyte who suggested JWR might have been turfed as AG for not speaking French. Apparently, he has learned nothing from his own sad role in the fiasco that he and his committee members have done so much to exacerbate.

Puglaas will rip off yet another bandage with that pending submission, which surely won’t be her last word.

Jody Wilson-Raybould (seen on a recent Georgia Straight cover) is preparing to deliver more ""truth to power"" in a written submission to the Commons justice committee.

Whether it is the Liberals on that justice committee, or the ones on the ethics committee who will probably likewise try to shut down the opposition’s efforts to have that forum “let her speak”, from Trudeau on down, they are all suckers for punishment. And so, there will almost certainly be many more bandages to be ripped off after this next one is torn off with JWR’s missive.

“A request was made for ‘copies of text messages and emails’ that I referred to in my testimony … I will provide copies,” she wrote.

“I also have relevant facts and evidence in my possession that further clarify statements I made and elucidate the accuracy and nature of statements by witnesses in testimony that came after my committee appearance.”

She was careful to stress that her written submission would only be “in relation to matters within the confine of the waiver of cabinet confidence and solicitor-client privilege in Order in Council number 2019-0105”.

As such, the prime minister’s gag order preventing her from divulging the other pertinent information that she and Philpott both hope to submit for the period not covered by his limited waiver will still apply.

To all the retired law clerks, pundits, fellow caucus members, and assorted politicos who counsel her to just ignore her sworn oaths of cabinet confidentiality and solicitor-client privilege, and simply use her parliamentary privilege to say her piece, I say this:

Easy for you to say. And thank God, she has not readily accepted your poor counsel.

After all, it won’t be you who might be disbarred for such questionable conduct, as JWR could well be if she ever took your advice, as Warren Kinsella has pointedly argued.

It would also fly in the face of the advice rendered years ago by the Senate committee that explored that question during the Pearson Airport fiasco. Tread softly and very carefully it said, whenever relying upon parliamentary privilege to trump cabinet confidence or solicitor-client privilege. Preferably upon the considered requests of parliamentary committees.

Have those questionable legal beagles and frustrated columnists and caucus colleagues forgotten that JWR is actually being legally counselled by a former Supreme Court of Canada justice on what she can appropriately say?

As for Philpott, she hasn’t had her oath of cabinet confidentiality waived at all. Nor was she invited to speak to the justice committee before its Liberal-hack majority shut down that investigation, despite her significance in properly understanding this whole controversy.

She hasn’t been allowed to say anything about the “evidence” of “sustained and inappropriate political interference” that she was aware of, which may well help to explain JWR’s untimely demise as AG.

Why is it that only the prime minister’s close friend and former principal secretary, Gerald Butts, and Trudeau have been allowed to tell us their version of what Philpott supposedly told the prime minister on January 6?

Why has she not been afforded the chance to tell us what she really said and how it all went down?

Like JWR, Philpott is also not legally allowed to tell us anything about what caused her to resign from cabinet, or why she could not maintain “cabinet solidarity”.

That very specific doctrine of cabinet solidarity speaks to decisions that might have been made by cabinet, to positions that it is collectively bound to support, and to courses of action that it has resolved to take.

It's week six of the SNC-Lavalin story being in the news—and there's no sign that it's going to end soon for Justin Trudeau. Prime Minister's Office

Which leads me to ask, was Trudeau’s cabinet also misled by false threats or false information about SNC-Lavalin leaving Montreal and Canada standing to lose 9,000 jobs if it didn’t get a special deal to save it from a criminal trial?

And as we now know, the company’s president and CEO, Neil Bruce, has said those threatened risks and outcomes were never made by him or by his agents. Because they were simply never true.

He never threatened to move his company. He never suggested that 9,000 jobs were at stake. He never asked for a deferred prosecution agreement based on economic considerations, if only because that would in itself be illegal under the Criminal Code.

The prime minister’s central rationale for his political interference has now been exposed as pure fabrication—a flat-out lie or ill-informed b.s., believed by him and his minions or not.

Yet incredibly, Trudeau continues to spew his discredited argument for his abuse of justice. In fact, during a March 22 town-hall meeting in Thunder Bay, he doubled down on his specious rationale and actually claimed that 10,000 SNC-Lavalin jobs might be at risk if the company is forced to face its criminal charges for bribery and fraud in court.

Instead of conceding that he was dead-wrong to use that false proposition in pressuring his former AG to inappropriately intervene to save SNC’s bacon with a DPA that its CEO claims he never asked for on economic grounds, the PM continues to bullshit Canadians with job threats in defence of his indefensible actions that he hopes will save his own political ass.

Unbelievable. That is what ugly really looks like, Canada.

What, if anything, was cabinet told before or after the cabinet shuffle about how the government might intend to act, if the director of public prosecutions persisted in refusing to grant the company its de facto plea bargain in lieu of a trial?

Did anyone at any time indicate to cabinet that action would be taken to ensure SNC gets a DPA? Especially during that post-January 14 period that JWR is still legally precluded from talking about?

Was there more interference that Philpott and/or cabinet knows about, particularly in relation to the cabinet shuffle and the reasons for JWR’s firing as AG?

What decisions, positions, strategies, and tactics relating to cabinet’s agreed-to handling of this scandal have caused such consternation that Philpott and perhaps JWR could not abide by that direction taken under cover of cabinet solidarity?

JWR’s promised new evidence might shed new light of some of those questions.

But she still won’t be free to share her full truth of what really happened, from her appointment as veterans affairs minister, to her resignation from cabinet, to what transpired in cabinet after the scandal broke.

The prime minister’s palpable fear of that ever coming to light should alarm all Canadians.

It should also serve as a signal to all Liberals that he is trying very hard indeed to hide something that is very bad.

Something that he fears could cost him his job. Because it probably should.

His whole crew is now duly lawyered up. They all live in terror of the truth that they know is just waiting to be found. Why?

Because there is something criminal we don’t know about, perhaps?

Because they fear that ripping off that bandage once and for all might put their own careers, reputations, or lives in further jeopardy?

Surely not, if they have nothing to hide.

Fact is, they all desperately hope to somehow avoid the unspoken Step Two of the Good Doctor’s recommended prescription to save her own party from losing its soul as it also increasingly risks political oblivion.

And that Step Two is this: lancing the boil itself, not just exposing its ugly truth.

It demands pricking the prime minister’s self-entitled bubble and telling him in no uncertain terms that you, sir, are the problem.

And you must go. Drain away and take your poison with you.

Many in caucus might still believe that Trudeau remains their saving grace.

P&P have a different prescription. One that is far nobler, wiser and more instantly effective in addressing what ails all Liberals.

For whether they recognize it or not, their party’s political antibodies are in short supply. Their own recourse to retreat is a dead-end street.

It’s time for real affirmative action, from the other strong women in caucus especially.

There is plenty of time left on the political calendar to get rid of their source of misery. There is time enough to choose a new leader who is worthier of the mantle entrusted to Canada’s prime minister.

Andrew Scheer’s worst nightmare would be having to face a new Liberal leader. The last thing he wants is to face a morally renewed Liberal party that has the strong backing of the heroines Wilson-Raybould, Philpott, and the recently independent MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes.

The last thing he really wants Trudeau to do is the right thing for his own party and for our country.

Which, ironically, is the thing that Scheer first demanded: for the prime minister to resign or to be sent packing by his own morally challenged party.

A new Liberal leader would also be Jagmeet Singh and Elizabeth May’s worst-case scenario. Because their best argument right now to left-leaning progressives is that they are each so much more honourable, trustworthy, and deserving than Trudeau.

The minority government that they hope will come to pass, with their parties holding the balance of power, would probably evaporate if a new Liberal leader was elected.

Lance the boil, I say, if JWR’s new testimony is as bad and damning as I believe it will be.

It is also what P&P are both saying, if only implicitly, to like-minded Liberals of good conscience.

The company had very recently confirmed ...","Nearly everyone now knows the story of how Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould, has alleged that she was unduly pressured by Trudeau and other senior officials to offer a remediation agreement to SNC-Lavalin.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau continues to deny that any inappropriate pressure was put on former Attorney General Jody-Wilson Raybould to intervene in the case. He rather claims it was all a misunderstanding. Somehow, almost every top liberal politician in Trudeau’s government had just erroneously thought that former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould was open to granting SNC-Lavalin a remediation agreement even after she said the contrary on several occasions.

“I was not aware of this erosion of trust, and as prime minister and head of cabinet, I should have been aware of it,” said Trudeau. “Situations were experienced differently and I regret that.”

Later, the Prime Minister tried to justify having an interest in the SNC-Lavalin affair on the grounds that thousands of jobs were at stake. However, this excuse seems very far-fetched and he has been called out for it from several quarters.

A commentary on Global News, claims Trudeau’s interference was all about saving liberal seats in Quebec. “If Ottawa were seen to have let SNC-Lavalin get away by failing to give the company a remediation agreement, Trudeau would never hear the end of it, and Legault supporters may well throw their votes to other parties, including the Conservatives or Bloc, in the upcoming federal election.” writes Tasha Kheiriddin“Trudeau had enough trouble in Ontario with Doug Ford; he didn’t need another war with another premier on the eve of an election.”

The Financial Post, supports this viewpoint by insisting that Trudeau’s actions concerning the SNC-was to protect its political interests in Quebec. According to the article,“The willingness of the federal government to aggressively intercede on behalf of SNC-Lavalin is in stark contrast with its refusal to remove environmental and legal roadblocks to actually building the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. The prime minister’s willingness to intervene for SNC-Lavalin reflects a cynical political judgement that his government depends more on Quebec than on Alberta for votes, not an economic need to protect jobs that were never imperilled.”

SNC-Lavalin is said to employ only about 9,000 people across Canada. This number is only aninfinitesimal 0.05 percent of Canada’s total 18,930,000 jobs. Furthermore, a ban from Federal Government projects would not have affected the company at all. Even with a Federal Government ban, the company would still have been allowed to bid on provincial and municipal projects and these projects make up almost 90% of the Canadian government’s infrastructure spending.

The company had very recently confirmed that they were performing very well even after they were told by the Federal Justice Department, that they are likely to face persecution. SNC-Lavalin had recently filed a Management Discussion and Analysis (MDA) discussing its business conditions and outlook where they stated that the business had $10 billion of revenue earned in 50 countries and $15 billion of back orders. This is despite the company being banned from bidding on World Bank projects since 2013 due to allegations of bribery and corruption.

Trudeau knew all this yet still interfered so strongly with the SNC-Lavalin case, it makes a lot of sense to think that he was only doing so, to protect his political interests.",SNC-Lavalin Scam Was Never About Saving Canadian Jobs,Agora Cosmopolitan,http://www.agoracosmopolitan.com/news/headline_news/2019/03/20/13606-snc-lavalin-scam-was-never-about-saving-canadian-jobs.html

In an email to iPolitics early Friday morning, Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau’s office said the Canadian government had not received any formal notice from China stating the country had closed its doors to all Canadian canola seed imports.

[READ MORE: Industry says China has stopped buying Canadian canola seed]

Canadian officials were also trying to confirm whether Canadian pea exports were facing delays, Bibeau’s office said. Pulse Canada CEO Gordon Bacon said in an email Friday morning he was not aware of delays around Canadian pea exports to China.

The minister’s reaction comes after the Canola Council of Canada said Chinese importers had stopped buying Canadian canola seed.

“We’re disappointed that differing viewpoints cannot be resolved quickly,” President Jim Everson said in a release Thursday evening. “Under the circumstances, Canadian canola seed exporters who normally ship to China have no alternative but to supply customers in other countries who value high quality Canadian canola.”

The Canola Council said there has been no indication “an immediate resolution is possible” in ongoing discussions between the two countries.

The federal agriculture minister is scheduled to visit the Plessisville Fruit d’Or processing plant, about 95 kilometres away from Quebec City this afternoon, where she is expected to discuss skills training.

Speaking in Thunder Bay, Ont., Friday afternoon, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his government would work with Chinese officials to “demonstrate that canola should continue to flow safely from Canada to China.”

He said federal officials have been in touch with farmers and others affected and was “optimistic” that Canada would make progress on a solution, as it did when China similarly suspended canola purchases in 2016. Trudeau credited Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland for helping to end that trade impasse.

On Parliament Hill, reaction to the industry reports was swift.

Conservative MP Larry Maguire, a retired grain farmer who said his father was among the first 10 Prairie farmers to grow canola on his farm, called the situation “tragic.”

“This doesn’t just affect this year,” Maguire said, noting there is still lots of canola sitting in bins on Canadian farms. “This is a huge issue.”

Randy Hoback, another retired canola farmer turned Conservative MP, told reporters the situation with China “is escalating” and insisted Canadian politicians need to act fast. “The reality is quality is not the problem.

“It’s a political problem, so it requires a political solution,” he said. “But, we have a situation right now in China where we don’t have an ambassador, we have no ministers visiting China, we have no people on the ground except officials … if you’re going to solve a political problem, you need a political solution. You need politicians over there doing just that.”

Liberal MP Francis Drouin, who sits on the House agriculture committee, told reporters he had “full confidence” in Bibeau, International Trade Minister Jim Carr and Minister Freeland to handle the matter. “It is a serious situation and we have to work hard on this issue.”

He added he didn’t think it was “fair” for China to be impeding imports. “Our canola is safe in this country, we know that, farmers know that and consumers know that.”

Jean-Claude Poissant, the parliamentary secretary to the minster of agriculture, told MPs in the Commons during question period that discussions between Canada and Chinese officials are continuing.

Approximately 40 per cent of Canadian canola exports go to China. In 2018, Canadian canola exports were valued at some $2.7 billion. Until recently, demand in the market had been considered stable.

In September 2016, Trudeau and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on canola that stated China had agreed to accept Canada’s current regulations on the amount of foreign material — called dockage — in canola shipments until March 2020. The agreement was specific to Chinese concerns around a disease called blackleg after Beijing threatened in February to tighten its dockage thresholds — a move Canada’s canola industry had said would effectively shut down the market.

“The MOU is very clear in what the goals and the intentions were,” Hoback said, when asked. “So, they’re (China) just ignoring it.”

Canola was invented by researchers at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and the University of Manitoba in the 1970s. In the last 20 years, Canadian canola acreages have tripled, making it one of the most common crops grown by Canadian grain farmers, particularly in Western Canada.

The escalating trade dispute comes after China revoked the canola export licence of one of Canada’s biggest canola exporters, Richardson International Ltd., earlier this month, citing concerns about “hazardous organisms” in a shipment from the company. Two days later, Beijing issued a notice warning all Canadian canola imports to China would face heightened import inspections because of pest concerns.

Those actions have been vehemently refuted by Canadian officials who say China’s actions are not science based.

In a statement on March 18, Carr and Bibeau said the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) had conducted further investigations and had “not identified any of the pests detected by the Chinese notices of non-compliance.”

The agency had also requested additional technical information from Customs China, which had provided CFIA with preliminary information the week of March 11.

Two emergency international trade committee meetings are scheduled for the first week of April to discuss the trade dispute with China.

The federal agriculture minister and the international trade minister are scheduled to testify about the canola dispute in front of the House international trade committee on April 2. Meanwhile, officials from Agriculture Canada, Global Affairs Canada and, likely the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, are set to appear on April 4.

Aurora Cannabis (TSX:ACB)(NYSE:ACB) stock fell 1.92% on March 21. Shares have climbed 88.5% in 2019 so far. However, the stock is only up 26% from the prior year. Aurora stock reached an all-time high of $16.24 in the days before recreational cannabis was legalized. Like most of its peers, it was hit with major turbulence in the final third of 2018.

Back in March I’d discussed whether Aurora was an undervalued play in the cannabis sector. Compared to its competitors, Aurora’s gains had been modest to start the year. Despite this, there was a lot to like about a company that had positioned itself to be a monster producer going forward.

In February, the company released its fiscal 2019 second-quarter results. Aurora exceeded analyst estimates and reported $62 million in revenue for Q2 2019, which represented a 430% increase from the prior year. Kilograms produced rose 550% and kilograms sold increased 502%. Aurora expects revenue to experience significant growth as it aggressively ramps up its production.

Aurora announced that sales and operations had expanded to 23 countries at the end of Q2 2019. CEO Terry Booth has said that keeping up with overseas demand will be Aurora’s biggest challenge going forward; this is a great problem to have.

Aurora stock received its biggest boost when it announced that billionaire investor Nelson Peltz would be brought on as a strategic advisor. Peltz has experience with the fast food giant Wendys Co., having served as its non-executive chairman. He also served as director at Kraft Heinz Company. Aurora hopes that his experience with these large companies will help lure partners in large consumer packaged goods.

As of this writing, Aurora stock had an RSI of 69, putting it just outside of overbought territory. However, Aurora’s year-over-year performance has been a lot more muted than its competitors. A big splash or two will bring more legitimacy to Aurora, which has still suffered from skepticism because of its aggressive expansion to start out. If it can pair its elite production capacity with top-flight partners, it will be worthwhile to readjust its growth expectations.

Back in January, I’d recommended Aurora as one of my top stocks for a future-oriented TFSA. The company looks like it will be a mainstay in the international cannabis industry. Shareholders will be able to enjoy the ride, but they should temper their expectations rather than expect the kind of growth we have seen for cannabis stocks since the liberals announced plans to legalize.

Crowning Aurora as the top pot stock may be a stretch, but it looks like it still has a lot of room to run if we take other stocks in the sector as an example. After this hire, Aurora is now well positioned to strike up major strategic partnerships before the year ends. The stock has a great chance to blow past its all-time highs before 2019 concludes.",Is Aurora Cannabis Inc.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s so-called statement of contrition Thursday wasn’t about being contrite, but about doubling down on a grand gamble to reframe the conversation about the SNC-Lavalin scandal, and perhaps, the ultimate ballot question of the fall election campaign.

His credibility largely shot on the question of whose version of the truth Canadians believe — his, his operatives’ or that of former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould — it now appears Mr. Sunny Ways is no more and no less than your usual garden variety politician.

Such a revelation need not be fatal; Canadians are inured to at least some reprobate behaviour on the part of their elected officials.

But it is especially damaging to Trudeau, whose carefully cultivated image of ethics, integrity and authenticity has been stripped away in a naked display of power and pressure. This is no longer the heartfelt, sorrowful, gooey Trudeau who once made people swoon. His style points spent, Trudeau must now turn to substance.

Hence the “jobs, jobs, jobs” refrain emerging in full force. Did you miss the prime minister’s former principal secretary, Gerald Butts, telling us about the 9,000 jobs at stake should SNC-Lavalin fail? Don’t worry, he and Trudeau would love to tell you again, because the electorate’s employment prospects may well be a key issue in the coming months.

True, the Criminal Code prohibits economic considerations from playing a role in the decision to pursue a deferred prosecution deal versus a prosecution in court. But lost in the distraction of all things SNC recently has been important news: that economic growth in this country all but flatlined in the last quarter of last year, and that Canadians appear to be spending less on big-ticket items. The dollar has been slipping, and the Bank of Canada has hit pause on interest rate changes.

Add to this the economic anxiety Canadians were already expressing as recently as two months ago. In December, fully half believed the country’s economy would worsen this coming year. Most were identifying either jobs, economic performance and/or deficit spending as top issues facing the country.

Against this backdrop, Liberal strategists may realize that there is no turning the page on the SNC-Lavalin story. The ceaseless and conflicting accounts of who said what to whom, spreading like oil on water, are simply too hard to contain. Instead, they would persuade us to read another book altogether, one that focuses on the household wallet and kitchen table economic issues.

If it comes down to issues of “bread versus integrity” – that is, the preoccupations of families balancing their chequebooks versus the twists and turns of a judicial scandal – Liberal strategists are betting heavily that voters are going to care more about bread, and they may be right.

Trudeau has an opening in the upcoming budget to offer assurances and incentives to nervous families. But to be a successful protagonist in this new story, he’ll also have to apply his message evenly. He faces vulnerabilities on that front: resource sector workers from Western Canada, already feeling like their economic problems are less important to this government than those of Quebecers, were so exasperated they took their protest by convoy to Parliament Hill last month, where, incidentally, the prime minister did not address them.

And there is increasing unease in the agricultural sector. Richardson International, a major grain processor based in Winnipeg, has had its export permits to China revoked in what many believe is the latest salvo in the two countries’ diplomatic standoff.

Besides, Trudeau will likely have to wrestle Andrew Scheer for the high ground on this narrative. Beyond Scheer’s thus-far failed efforts to get the prime minister to resign, and while his Conservatives ride higher in the polls, the opposition leader has an opportunity to persuade voters it’s his party that cares the most about Canadian employment.

Scheer can make the case that unlike Trudeau — who can no longer offer the undisputed mantles of principle and candour — he offers both bread and integrity. Will he make the most of his moment, or squander his chance? Like the tale of SNC-Lavalin, the economic story’s ending is far from written.

By RUSHANTHI KESUNATHAN

A protesting First Nations woman who was pushed to the ground during Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Climate Action Rally at the Danforth Music Hall on March 4, says the prime minister “witnessed” her being assaulted, and “did nothing.”

The woman is 26-year-old Vanessa Gray, a community organizer from the Aamjiwnaang First Nation. In a press release written a few days after the incident, Gray said it is disturbing that many of the people who attended the event, including Trudeau himself, did nothing.

At the event, Trudeau was interrupted several times during his speech by hecklers and protestors in the crowd, who were immediately ushered out by security.

Gray said she went to ensure that the voices of Indigenous people were present and draw attention to the ongoing colonial and environmental violence that indigenous people experience in Canada.

Before arriving at the event, Gray hid a Canadian flag in her shirt that said, “No Justice on Stolen Native Land.”

She said it was to remind those at the event that ground zero of environmental violence is occurring right now on unceded land.

Videos and photographs of the incident have been making the rounds online.

During Trudeau’s speech, Gray threw her flag and shouted “No Justice on Stolen Native Land.” Seconds later, an older white man, in a blue shirt, pushed her down to the floor.

“Shocked, but not deterred I rose up and continued to speak, ‘No Justice on Stolen Native Land.’ I said this over and over until security pulled me from the rally,” she wrote in her statement.

While Gray was quickly escorted out, the man, who is yet to be identified, remained inside the event and continued to cheer Trudeau on.

In a video taken during the event, Trudeau can be seen witnessing the scuffle and uttering “Oh boy, oh boy,” moments after Gray is pushed to the ground.

Gray has been speaking up against environmental violence for eight years.

She and her lawyer Nick Cake, with Millars Law, are considering her legal options. Cake said they are in a preliminary stage and are reviewing all options and working to determine the best possible path.

“Our options include filing a police report because police didn’t take any action on that day. Another avenue will be civil remedies that may be available. Another would be to leverage a conversation between Vanessa and the prime minister’s office,” he said.

“Situations like this have a way of fizzling off and falling off into the background and essentially being forgotten about. It’s our intention to keep this fresh and to keep it going so it does not become outdated or a situation that lacks the public’s interest,” Cake said.

In an email statement, Liberal Party spokesperson Parker Lund said the safety of all Canadians attending such events is a top priority and that the incident has been brought to their attention. The party is taking steps to review the matter with the appropriate authorities and staff, Lund said.",Woman pushed at Liberal rally at Danforth Music Hall considering legal options,Beach Metro Community News,https://www.beachmetro.com/2019/03/21/woman-pushed-at-liberal-rally-at-danforth-music-hall-considering-legal-options/

The Guggenheim in New York is the latest major art institution to stop accepting ...","FREDERICTON, N.B. – Jocelyn Peterman and Brett Gallant are the first Canadian curling duo to capture the mixed doubles national championship twice.

The pair defeated Nancy Martin and Tyrel Griffith Sunday afternoon in the final game 9-6.

Peterman and Gallant also won the title three years ago in Saskatoon, when they defeated Geoff and Laura Walker.

But this will be the first time the two are putting on the Maple Leaf together to compete on the world mixed doubles stage – in 2016 they weren't able to travel to the world championship due to scheduling conflicts.

The game was tied 3-3 in the sixth end in a back and forth affair when Peterman made a double with her last rock to score five and take control of the game, 8-3.

""I knew there was a lot on the line with that shot. I took my time. We knew what to expect with the ice and made it,"" Peterman said.

Martin and Griffith wouldn't go away though, answering with three in the seventh.

That made it 8-6 heading to the final end – Peterman was forced to draw to the four foot to secure the 9-6 victory.

""This is incredible. Jocelyn made a huge shot for us,"" Gallant said.

WATCH | Highlights from the mixed doubles national championship final:

Both Peterman and Gallant were emotional after the victory. One year ago the two had high hopes of becoming Canada's first mixed doubles team at the Olympics. They lost in the semifinal – a crushing defeat for them both and something they were thinking about after Sunday's win in Fredericton.

""That was probably one the hardest losses I've ever had,"" Peterman said.

Gallant, fighting back tears, looked at Jocelyn as he expressed his joy over winning this one.

""I love our team""

""I love our team,"" he said. """"We really enjoy getting to play together and making the shots for each other. It's something really special.""

Now they'll take their curling talents and romance - the two are an item - across the ocean next month, wearing the Maple Leaf at the world mixed doubles championship in Norway at the end of April. Canada has never won a mixed doubles world championship.

Peterman, 25, is coming off her first full season as the second for Jennifer Jones. She won a Scotties title in 2016 as a member of Chelsea Carey's team.

""I've never been on the podium at worlds so I'd love to make that happen,"" Peterman said.

Gallant, 29, hadn't been able to play with Peterman at the past two mixed doubles nationals due to being a member of Brad Gushue's rink which had won the past two Briers and then went onto compete at men's worlds. The scheduling conflict didn't allow the two to play together.

But now they've played together twice at the mixed doubles nationals and have two national championship wins.

""To get this opportunity to represent Canada, we want to make the most of it,"" Gallant said.

Curling romance

Peterman and Gallant owe at least some of their mixed doubles success to their relationship as a couple. The two really didn't know one another before Gallant reached out to Peterman a few years ago.

Gallant needed a partner for that year's Canadian mixed doubles championship in Saskatoon.

""He just asked me to play over Facebook,"" Peterman says with a laugh. They've been dating ever since.

Gallant says (with a smirk) his only intention was to find a solid curling partner.

""It was strictly about curling ability,"" he says. In that first event together the two captured the championship.

""We've been together ever since and we like mixed doubles a lot,"" Peterman says.

When it comes to communicating on the ice, both Gallant and Peterman say it's an advantage to be dating because they can be blunt with one another and not fear hurting the other's feelings.

""Sometimes I request his feedback to be a little bit nicer,"" Peterman says.

""I think Jocelyn knows I'm just trying to get the information across as best I can,"" Gallant counters. ""I think she knows I might say things she might not hear normally, but knows it comes from a good place.""","Peterman, Gallant capture 2nd Canadian mixed doubles curling championship",Yahoo News Canada,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/peterman-gallant-capture-2nd-canadian-203703747.html

The chain, founded in 1990 and based in London, sells collectibles, toys, candles, jewelry and other unique items, primarily in malls in mid-sized urban centres.

""After considering a number of restructuring options we have determined that this is the best course based on an array of business challenges,"" Matthew McBride of Green Earth said in a press release this week.

First, the Nissan LEAF edged two Honda models, the Clarity and Insight, to win the Canadian Green Car of the Year award. With its new powertrain that combines a 214-horsepower electric motor with a 62-kWh battery, the LEAF PLUS model increases maximum range by 50 percent, allowing drivers to cover 363 kilometres. It’s also one of The Car Guide’s Best Buys for 2019.

As for the Canadian Green Utility Vehicle of the Year, the Jaguar I-PACE is the winner after defeating the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid and Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV. Last month in Toronto, it was also named the 2019 Canadian Utility Vehicle of the Year and the Best Premium EV in Canada for 2019. The I-PACE uses a 394-horsepower motor and a battery that provides 386 kilometres of range.

Fitting, as this year’s show, which runs at the downtown convention centre through Sunday, is awash in green vehicles as never before.

The Nissan Leaf was named 2019 Canadian Green Car of the Year, while the Jaguar I-Pace took the 2019 Canadian Green Utility Vehicle of the Year title. At the recent Toronto Auto Show, the I-Pace claimed 2019 utility vehicle of the year honours, marking the first time an all-electric claimed that honour.

“It’s important for many Canadian drivers to be environmentally aware, and AJAC’s Green Vehicle of the Year awards help them to make the responsible choice when it’s time to buy a new car or utility vehicle,“ AJAC president Mark Richardson said in a release. “If they can save money on fuel while also driving a vehicle with low emissions – or no emissions at all – then everybody wins.”

Entries to the awards must meet the standard requirements for initial entry into the Canadian Car of the Year awards program, and additional criteria for fuel efficiency based on the entry’s size, powertrain and purpose.

All entries are tested by AJAC journalists, and evaluation takes place over months on different road surfaces and road conditions throughout the year and during AJAC’s autumn Test Fest event. The journalists score all eligible entries on parameters including recharge time, driving range, vehicle dynamics, market significance, and overall value. Each of the scores is then weighted for relevance to the vehicle and category in question. The winning score also represents how the vehicle stacks up to its market segment competition, whether green or otherwise.",Leaf and I-Pace top AJAC Green Awards podium,blogs.driving.ca,https://driving.ca/jaguar/auto-shows/vancouver-auto-show/leaf-and-i-pace-top-ajac-green-awards-podium

Our review of the 2019 Nissan LEAF

See our Guide to all-electric vehicles in Canada in 2019

The Nissan LEAF has been just as popular here in Canada as it’s been in other markets, and continues to be a reference in the segment. But in 2019 the model faces some stiffer competition, notably from the new Kona Electric and of course the wee Chevrolet Bolt, which both benefit from a substantially longer range (415 km for the former, 383 km for the latter) on a full charge. The LEAF has a range of 241 km.

In response, Nissan has produced an extended-range version called the LEAF PLUS (363 km of range) that is just coming on the market now. It will be interesting to see if the boost in range is enough to keep consumers on board with this model, which does a have a ton of other qualities going for it – a fact confirmed by the AJAC jury.

Another factor the LEAF has going for it? Its starting price of $36,398 makes it eligible for the new EV rebate program just announced by the Canadian federal government as part of its new election-year budget. That program, yet to be implemented, will set a price limit of $45,000 CAD for eligibility for the EV rebate. That makes the much-talked new Kona Electric (starting price of $45,599) ineligible.

If and when the new EV rebate program is up and running, that should give the LEAF quite a leg up on the increasingly stiff competition it faces.

The Canadian Press





TORONTO -- A new report by a green energy think tank calls for increased investment in electric buses to both reduce emissions and boost Canada's growing manufacturing base of the vehicles.

The report by Clean Energy Canada says that while Canada is a leading manufacturer of electric buses, transit authorities are behind international peers.

China is by far the leader in electric buses with about 99 per cent the world's e-buses, including Shenzhen's more than 16,000-strong fleet. Other cities have also committed to moving in that direction, including Amsterdam that is aiming to transition to zero-emissions buses by 2025 and Los Angeles by 2030.

Several Canadian cities have also set fully-renewable fleet targets, but on less aggressive timelines. Montreal is aiming for 2040, Toronto by 2042 and Vancouver by 2050, the report notes.

The report's call for more buses comes the same week as a study by Bloomberg New Energy Finance Ltd. found the world's electric buses will displace about 270,000 barrels a day of diesel by the end of this year as the heavily used vehicles have an outsized impact on fuel demand.

Clean Energy's report notes Canada has several leading manufacturers of electric buses, including Winnipeg-based New Flyer, Vancouver-based GreenPower, and Quebec-based Lion Electric Co. and Nova Bus, that could be boosted by increased domestic demand.",Green think tank calls for Canada to boost electric buses,CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/autos/green-think-tank-calls-for-canada-to-boost-electric-buses-1.4345723

Just a month after winning the Automotive Journalists Association of Canada (AJAC) 2019 Canadian Utility of the Year award, the Jaguar I-PACE has added a second AJAC award to its trophy case. After becoming the first Jaguar Land Rover product to capture an overall AJAC award and being the first ever battery electric vehicle to win the honour , the I-PACE made history by becoming just the second vehicle to ever add an AJAC Green award to its overall title. The Mazda CX-3 also won both utility awards in 2016.

“We are thrilled that the I-PACE has been honoured once again by AJAC with the Canadian Green Utility of the Year Award,” Wolfgang R. Hoffmann, President, Jaguar Land Rover Canada said in a statement. “This is a great testament to the team of engineers and designers who envisioned and created this remarkable machine. Winning both the overall Canadian Utility of the Year and now the Green award puts us in elite company and is an achievement we will always be proud of.”

The Jaguar I-PACE has all-wheel drive performance from twin Jaguar-designed concentric motors offering a combined 394hp and 512 lb. ft. of torque to deliver 0-100km/h acceleration in 4.8 seconds with a range of 377 km.

The I-PACE’s handsome looks and dramatic lines combine a long wheelbase of 2,990mm with an overall vehicle length of 4,682mm, giving the vehicle a similar footprint to the Jaguar F-PACE, but with the interior space of a larger vehicle.

The cabin offers 1,040mm and 890mm of front and rear legroom respectively and includes storage areas for drinks, bottles and other miscellaneous items. Because it has no transmission tunnel, the I-PACE has a 12.5-litre compartment in the centre console for phones, keys and other small items. Trays built under the rear seats also provide storage for tablets and laptops. The rear luggage compartment capacity of 638 litres is also larger than most medium-sized SUVs and it increases to 1,445 litres with the seats folded flat.

Isle Royale National Park superintendent Phyllis Green says the wolves were moved over the weekend from Michipicoten Island, where the pack was at risk of starvation, to Isle Royale in Michigan.

The wolves first got over to Michipicoten Island in the winter of 2014 when ice allowed them to cross over from the Ontario mainland.

After gradually killing off the caribou they preyed on, the wolves on the island were in danger of dying of starvation without intervention.

Green says many of the wolves on the island were in poor condition when they were caught.

She says the six wolves will be reunited on Isle Royale with two other wolves that had been previously moved off the island a month earlier.",Canadian-U.S. team saves six wolves from starvation on Lake Superior island,O Canada,https://o.canada.com/news/six-wolves-saved-from-starvation-on-lake-superior-island-sent-to-michigan/wcm/b6dbc7ab-5346-4fa3-a3be-4e2fdac488be

This week, we're featuring one of our favourite greens: spinach!

Spring is trying very hard to get here but the weather is cooperating to varying degrees (literally) depending on which part of the country you're in! But we're gonna guess that you're probably over winter and you're dying for some green. Any kind of green!

Enter one of our favourite green veggies - spinach! This is one green that's packed with good stuff - vitamin C, vitamin A, beta-carotene and it's a great source of iron. No wonder Popeye's muscles popped whenever he ate his spinach.He knew what he was doing!

Spinach is great in the kitchen. It's crisp, with a mild flavour when it's raw - making it perfect for smoothies and salads. Cook it up and the flavour intensifies. It can also add some very vibrant colour to your plate, which is great when you're so done with winter. And, it's a very easy veggie to sneak into a wide array of dishes if you've got some picky eaters who struggle to get their veggies.

Spinach decreases in volume dramatically when it's cooked so don't panic if a dish calls for cups and cups of raw spinach. That's going to shrink tremendously once it starts to cook up. Spinach also release a lot of water when it's cooked (which is why it shrinks so much). So keep that in mind when you're experimenting on your own with adding spinach into a cooked dish.

We've got a great collection of recipes here for you today - there's some delicious dips and salads as you'd expect but there's also some great recipes to help you avoid food waste like a Savoury Croissant Casserole with Mushrooms, Spinach and Cheese and some Spinach and Cheese Potato Pancakes.

There's some hearty soups like White Kidney Bean and Spinach Soup, Creamy Spinach Tortellini Soup with Chicken and Velvety Spinach and Cauliflower Soup With Tahini.

If you want to sneak some spinach in to dishes kids will love try the Green Monster Muffins or the Spinach Brownies!

And spinach teams up perfectly with eggs for breakfast and brunch like Baked Feta, Dill and Spinach Frittata, or Bacon Egg and Spinach Muffin Cups. We also love the Spinach and Caramelized Onion Breakfast Brioche.

Michael Green is president and CEO of Canada Health Infoway ...","To adapt to our increasingly just-in-time lives, the Canadian health care system is moving increasingly toward digitization. This necessary modernization of health care means better patient outcomes as well as improved insight into future health-care decisions.

Despite the personal and system-wide benefits of a digital health-care system, what cannot be ignored is that your health information has value to people wishing to take advantage or use the information inappropriately.

The fact remains that Canadians may also be unwittingly sharing their health information. Whether it’s apps that are used, mailing lists that are joined, or online surveys, what is really being tracked is personal health information that tells unscrupulous users information you may not want them to know. If the fine print in the privacy agreement isn’t read and understood, it’s hard to know where your information goes and how it’s used.

Thieves collect personal data such as home addresses and contact information, but also details of physical or mental conditions and prescribed medications. Individuals can be threatened with public exposure of their data, especially those in high-profile positions, and future health benefit claims or even border crossings could be affected.

Compromised personal health data has a much greater and lasting impact. When a credit card is stolen, card numbers are changed and charges in question are typically reimbursed. Conversely, your health record stays with you for life, leaving you more vulnerable to future problems.

Just like Canadians have not shied away from online banking or commerce, the answer isn’t to fear a digital health system either. The benefits to patients, professionals and the overall system are far too great, but we also can’t bury our head in the sand when it comes to privacy or the selling of personal health-care data.

Instead, we must look at ways to protect Canadians while increasing the digital health options available to them. One such tool is Infoway’s PrescribeIT, a paperless e-prescription service that enables prescribers to securely transmit a prescription to a patient’s pharmacy of choice. As a not-for-profit service funded by the federal government, it ensures all personal health information is secure, confidential and only used for its intended purpose.

Finally, the protection of personal data, and especially health data, must be a priority for everyone. Data drives decisions, it allows us to react to new trends in care and system needs, but we can’t let data drive profit at the expense of the patient.

Physicians, pharmacists and all health-care professionals must continue to take an active role in protecting their patients’ data, while at the same time patients must ask questions about how their information is kept safe, secure and guarded against commercial misuse. During Fraud Prevention Month, we have an opportunity to look at where the data in our health system is now and map out a plan that keeps the system healthy and safe for all.

Michael Green is president and CEO of Canada Health Infoway, which helps to improve the health of Canadians by working with partners to accelerate the development, adoption and effective use of digital health solutions across Canada. Established in 2001, Infoway is an independent, not-for-profit organization funded by the federal government.

One of them is the return of a rebate granted for the purchase of a ""green"" vehicle, this for the first time in 11 years. This time around, the incentive will be offered on vehicles that are either electric or powered by hydrogen.

There is a catch, however; the suggested retail price of these must be less than $45,000. This is clearly a calculated choice being made by the government. Setting this price limit eliminates some of the most popular vehicles in this category, such as the Tesla Model 3 and the Hyundai Kona Electric. The two popular models are offered at $47,600 and $45,599, respectively.

A limit of $50,000 would have covered many more EV models, but it would also have cost the government more. In total, the government has allocated $300 million to Transport Canada for this new measure, which is relatively little considering the rapidly growing interest in EVs.

Residents of Quebec and British Columbia can forget about benefiting from up to $13,000 in discounts on purchase of a Kona Electric, after adding the provincial rebate currently in place there.

That ceiling does leave other choices, like the Nissan LEAF.

No date has yet been announced for the implementation of the incentive program, and we’re unlikely to see consumers stampeding to dealerships to make a purchase before learning more. We’ll have to wait and see how quickly the program is up and running, and whether that happens before the election in fall of this year.

It’s too early to tell whether this announcement amounts to more than election-year posturing. For one, the program could eventually encompass plug-in hybrid products as well. The government has not confirmed it, but reports are that this could happen.

One thing’s for sure, however; there will be lot of people watching what the government does in this dossier very, very closely.

It was the kind of rhetoric that eased the concerns of environmentalists, who were worried about Legault's party's thin environmental platform.

Last week, after a round of massive protests in Montreal, Environment Minister Benoit Charette even hinted more money was coming for green-friendly initiatives.

But Thursday's provincial budget renewed concerns that the Coalition Avenir Québec government is uninterested in taking decisive action on climate change.

""This morning, François Legault couldn't look his two sons in their eyes,"" said Dominic Champagne, a well-known Quebec director who launched a petition this fall calling for more robust climate policies.

The petition garnered 250,000 signatures, earning Champagne meetings with Legault and Charette.

""The politicians I met are not in line with what the science is telling us,"" Champagne said.

Armed with a hefty surplus, the CAQ chose to put billions more into the province's roads rather than public transit. In fact, public transit barely got any new money at all.

The CAQ has set aside $24.6 billion for Quebec's road network over the next 10 years, a jump of more than $4 billion over the plan presented by the previous Liberal government.

The 10-year plan for public transit, by comparison, went up by only $40 million, and remains at just over $9 billion.

Money for public transit now makes up 27 per cent of the transportation pie, compared to 30 per cent last year.

""The fact that we're going backwards is disappointing,"" said Sidney Ribaux, co-founder and executive director of Équiterre, an environmental lobby group.

Ribaux, joined by transit advocates, is hoping to see the needle move the other way, toward a 50/50 split.

Oil and gas 'the main culprit'

Emissions produced by gas-guzzling vehicles have become the province's biggest obstacle in reaching its Paris agreement targets.

Quebec's cap-and-trade system has helped curtail emissions produced by industry, but emissions generated from transportation — such as cars and trucks — have continued to rise.

They now account for nearly half of the province's total output.

""The main culprit of the climate crisis is oil and gas,"" said Champagne. ""So naturally massive investments in measures that will distance us from the use of oil and gas are the ones we are waiting for the most.""

Among the major road projects planned by the CAQ is a so-called third link for Quebec City. The CAQ set aside $325 million to carry out studies for the bridge or tunnel.

The project has been widely panned by environmentalists and urban planners, who argue the extra roadway is unnecessary and the money would be better spent on public transit in Quebec City.

""There's absolutely no expert in the world that says this is a good idea, and yet they are still going ahead with it,"" Ribaux said.

The CAQ government did raise the prospect of studying an extension of the Montreal Metro's Yellow line to Longueuil, a tramway in Montreal's east end, and a set of reserved bus lanes.

But unlike the controversial third-link, no dollar amount or timeline was attached to these projects. And the budget makes no mention of Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante's proposed Pink Metro line.

Toronto as example?

On CBC Montreal's Daybreak Friday, Plante lamented the lack of money put toward transit. She said more buses and Metros are needed to get people to stop commuting by car.

She pointed out that Toronto, long cited as Montreal's poor cousin when it comes to public transit, is in the middle of building a new subway line, while the Metro is increasingly jammed at rush hour.

""I'm really worried about that,"" Plante said.

Ribaux said the province's decision to extend the $8,000 rebate for electric cars is a positive step — but it will take years to result in a significant drop in emissions.

Electric vehicles currently account for around 10 per cent of new cars sold in Quebec.

""It's going to take a long time to completely change over the five million cars on Quebec's roads,"" he said.

Charette addressed the criticism Friday, saying more plans for public transit are the works — and that its share of the infrastructure budget could grow later in the CAQ's mandate.

Legault, as well, is expected to make a speech focused on climate change at the CAQ's annual party meeting, scheduled for the end of May.

The Yellowknife Co-op recently installed a hydroponic greenhouse on its property. Its general manager hopes to start selling homegrown leafy greens and fresh herbs in four to six weeks time.

""There was an opportunity to get involved in a hydroponic greenhouse, so we decided to do an investment in it. We just want to provide to our members some locally-grown produce.""

We've had requests for years and years and years here about selling local produce. - Justin Nelson, manager

Hydroponics are systems for growing plants in water— without soil. The co-op's food is growing in a greenhouse made out of an upgraded shipping container from Ottawa-based company The Growcer.

The Growcer's greenhouses use water enriched with nutrients, an artificial light source and carbon dioxide to grow plants ""as quickly as possible,"" said Corey Ellis, a company co-founder. He said the greenhouses can grow seeds into full plants in about six weeks.

The sea cans are outfitted to keep plants growing when outside temperatures drop as low as -52 C. Ellis said the greenhouses use about as much electricity as an air conditioner that's running 24/7.

He said the Yellowknife Co-op should be able to stock its vegetables the same day they are harvested, ""which is pretty unique and I think something [customers] will really appreciate.""

The Yellowknife Co-op's sea can greenhouse isn't the first in the North. Ellis said his company has installed them in Kugluktuk, Nunavut, and Kuujjuaq, Que., as well.

Right now, the Co-op is growing kale, spinach and bok choi, as well as a variety of lettuces and herbs.

Nelson said the plants are pesticide-free and when harvested, are expected to be fresher and last longer than their counterparts trucked up from the South.

If all goes well, he said, the store will harvest about 400 plants a week.

Curious Yellowknife Co-op shoppers will be able to watch the in-house farming live.

Cameras have been set up in the greenhouse and the plan is to broadcast a livestream onto a large-screen TV set up in the produce department, said Nelson.

Nelson said the idea is not to produce a cheaper vegetable.

""Power and heat up here isn't cheap, so this isn't something to subsidize produce here,"" he said. ""Produce is cheap, it's no different than other locations in the South.""

The hope is to make a profit off the home-grown greens, said Nelson, and then return those profits to co-op members.

Though he declined to talk about how much the greenhouse costs, Nelson did say he is ""feeling pretty cool"" and ""pretty happy"" about the operation.",Yellowknife Co-op to sell homegrown greens,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yellowknife-co-op-hydroponic-greenhouse-1.5053970

It reported that German industrial giant Siemens AG is teaming up with Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners to build an underground 560-kilometre transmission line that will carry power from Iowa to the Chicago area. It will be called the SOO Green Renewable Rail.

The prices of publicly traded wind and solar companies have been edging higher, but they are still undervalued compared to the broad market, according to some experts. ( MARTIN BERNETTI / AFP/GETTY IMAGES FILE PHOTO )

So, what’s so special about another power line, even if it’s underground? Just that the electricity it carries will be wind and solar generated. When it’s completed, hopefully by 2024, the line will be capable of transmitting 2,100 megawatts, which the Journal says is the equivalent of a large nuclear power plant. Although two European companies are undertaking the project, there’s a Canadian connection. Most of the route will run along a Canadian Pacific railroad corridor, which should make it easier to obtain the necessary permits. I found this story intriguing because I had no idea that solar and wind generation had reached such a substantial scale. I had been under the mistaken impression that green energy initiatives were still small-scale ventures that relied heavily on government subsidies to survive.

Not so, says John A. Cook, president of Greenchip Financial Corp., which specializes in this type of investing. “Last year there was $340 billion invested in wind and solar energy projects – more than for all other types of electrical generation,” he told me in a phone interview. He noted that in December, the Alberta Government signed three contracts to provide 600 megawatts of wind generation to the province for the next 20 years (enough to power 255,000 homes). “The remarkable part of this story is the unsubsidized auction price of 3.7 cents per kWh,” he says. “This is about half where wind generation was at only a year ago and is almost as cheap as solar. It is also half what a new natural gas or coal plant could produce these electrons at. The breakthrough can be attributed to technological advances, the good Alberta wind regime, and the low cost of capital large developers now bring. For several reasons, solar will continue to grow faster than wind, but 3.7 cents is a game changer.” Greenchip is a sub-advisor to the recently launched Mackenzie Global Environmental Equities Fund. It has only been around since October, so we don’t have much history to work with. However, the year-to-date gain of 13.25 per cent (to March 11) is impressive. The portfolio is basically the same as the 11-year-old Greenchip Global Equity Fund, which is only open to accredited investors ($250,000 and up).

That Greenchip portfolio consists of several familiar names such as Siemens, Panasonic, Hitachi and Johnson Controls, plus a lot of companies that few people have ever heard of. The largest position is in JinkoSolar, a small-cap producer of solar modules, based in Shanghai. Although the prices of publicly traded wind and solar companies have been edging higher, they are still undervalued compared to the broad market, says Cook. It may be hard to believe, but the market capitalization all the listed solar manufacturers in the Greenchip portfolio is just over $10 billion. A single cannabis company, Canopy Growth, has a market cap more than double that.

One reason for the depressed value of solar and wind stocks is that relatively few analysts cover them. Also, environmental sectors generally experience higher levels of technological and regulatory change, which is often missed by investors. Finally, due to the sector’s high growth potential and disruptive nature, individual companies or sub-sectors are susceptible to excessive hype and/or cynicism. The net result, Cook contends, are “incredibly attractive” valuations. So, how do you participate in this energy revolution? There are four Canadian mutual funds that focus on these companies. They include the Mackenzie fund already mentioned, the NEI Environmental Leaders Fund, the Desjardins Societerra Environment Fund (a fund that invests in bonds issued by “responsible” companies), and the AGF Global Sustainable Growth Equity Fund. It’s been around the longest and shows a 10-year average annual return of 9.9 per cent. The portfolio goes well beyond energy to include health care, basic materials, consumer cyclicals, etc. Surprisingly, I could not find a single Canadian-based ETF that focuses on this area. There are several in the U.S., however. One of the largest is the Invesco Solar ETF, which invests in a portfolio of U.S. and international companies that produce solar power or build components for the industry. Its 10-year record is in negative territory but for the first two months of this year it was ahead an amazing 34.85 per cent. Another strong performer this year is the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF, which was up 17 per cent for 2019 as of March 11. Here again, the 10-year return is negative. Investors have taken a long time to understand this business, but they finally are catching on. Amazingly, this is all happening in a world where the President of the United States is a climate change skeptic, whose policies seek to weaken the development of alternative power sources and, instead, revitalize the coal industry. Clearly, his plans are not working. Alternative energy momentum is building, and investors are increasingly looking to get in on the action.

Monday qualifier David Hearn of Brantford ...","This week’s Valspar Championship is playing right into Nick Taylor’s hands.

Taylor, from Abbotsford, B.C., is looking forward to taking on the difficult Copperhead Course at the Innisbrook Resort and Golf Club in Palm Harbor, Fla., this week at the Valspar because it is just that — a challenging par-71 7,340 yards.

“It’s typically a difficult golf course. You have to keep it in play. Par’s not going to hurt you,” said Taylor on Wednesday. “I just prefer courses where 2- or 3-under par is a great score instead of being a shootout like some tournaments where the winner is 20- to 25-under.

“Here, 10- to 14- under is where winners have been and it’s where I would prefer it if I were to pick a tournament.”

The timing is great for Taylor, too. He’s coming off his strongest performance of the season, tying for 16th at 10 under at the hyper-competitive Players Championship.

“My iron play was really solid all week, made a few mistakes the first day. I felt the greens were tough in the afternoon,” said Taylor, who shot a 73 in the first round but recovered with a 69-69-67 line the rest of the way. “I played really well the last three days and cashed in a lot of opportunities on the Sunday to have my best round of the week so that was pretty much the difference.”

Pleased with his overall performance, Taylor isn’t looking to tweak anything about his game, instead focusing on maintaining what brought him success at the Players to the Valspar.

Taylor will be joined by seven other Canadians at the Valspar Championship, matching the record for Canadians at a PGA Tour event outside of the RBC Canadian Open. Monday qualifier David Hearn of Brantford, Ont., Adam Hadwin of Abbotsford, dual citizen Austin Connelly, Mackenzie Hughes of Dundas, Ont., Roger Sloan of Merritt, B.C., Adam Svensson of Surrey, B.C., and Ben Silverman of Thornhill, Ont., will also play, with the latter being added to the field on Wednesday.

Already a tough course, Taylor played nine holes on Tuesday at Copperhead and another nine at the Pro-Am and said that the greens are firm.

“Early in the morning was a little chilly, but the course is in great shape,” said Taylor. “The greens are fast and pretty firm. If the weather holds up it might be tough.”

Overall, 31 per cent of respondents polled after the federal budget was released Tuesday said they would vote for Justin Trudeau's Liberals if an election were held now, a decline of about three percentage points from February.

That compared with 37 per cent who said they would back the Conservatives under leader Andrew Scheer, a one-point increase from February, while 14 per cent said they would vote NDP and 10 per cent the Greens.

Scheer also jumped ahead of Trudeau on the question of who would make a better prime minister as the Tory leader got the backing of 25 per cent of respondents compared with 24 per cent for Trudeau, who has been struggling to contain damage from the SNC-Lavalin affair.",New poll for Canadian Press indicates federal Conservatives ahead of the Liberals,The Hamilton Spectator,https://www.thespec.com/news-story/9234237-new-poll-for-canadian-press-indicates-federal-conservatives-ahead-of-the-liberals/
333,World,2019-03-17T16:00:00.0000000Z,"Like Clark who had to fend off the Liberals and the Canadian Alliance, Singh is threatened on two fronts. As the result of a string of provincial breakthroughs the Green party is poised to enter the federal campaign with the momentum the NDP so lacks.","OTTAWA—For his first question in the House of Commons, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh asked the prime minister whether he was going to make housing more affordable for Canadians. This is an issue the NDP leader pursued throughout his recent byelection campaign in Burnaby South and it is close to the heart of many urban voters, in particular in Vancouver and Toronto. Those two electoral markets are central to New Democrat prospects in next fall’s federal campaign.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is recognized in the House of Commons before taking his place before question period on March 18, 2019 in Ottawa. The prime minister and his team are not the only ones who are having to temper their hopes for a productive parliamentary spring. So might Singh, Chantal Hébert writes. ( Adrian Wyld / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

Justin Trudeau responded with a boilerplate statement about helping the middle class. He was probably happy to get a brief respite from the SNC-Lavalin affair. With the resignation of clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick — one of the main protagonists in the controversy — announced just minutes before question period, the focus promptly returned to the topic that has consumed Canadian politics for the past five weeks. Singh waited more than a year for his opportunity to question Trudeau face-to-face about Canada’s current housing situation. But he may have to wait a few more months — until the leaders debates of the upcoming election campaign — for a more serious policy conversation with his Liberal rival.

Tuesday’s budget — the last of Trudeau’s ongoing term in office — marks the non-official start of the election campaign. Tuesday may also be the last semi-normal day in the Commons for the foreseeable future. In an effort to keep the SNC-Lavalin affair in the forefront and force the Liberal majority on the justice committee to agree to invite former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould for a second appearance, the Conservatives are gearing up for a procedural trench war with the government.

Article Continued Below

Even absent opposition obstruction, the SNC-Lavalin affair has already taken a toll on the government’s agenda. One of the reasons why omnibus budget bills have become such a central part of the federal governance apparatus is because they allow policy initiatives to clear legislative hurdles over a matter of months rather than over a year or more. But the SNC-Lavalin affair — and the news that a budget bill was used to introduce in the Criminal Code remediation agreements of the kind sought by the engineering giant to eliminate the risk of a criminal conviction — has made the practice of squeezing a host of non-budgetary stuff in bloated finance bills politically toxic. As a result, some of the measures the government had hoped to showcase in its campaign list of delivered items will now likely end up in the Liberal post-election catalogue. Trudeau and his team are not the only ones who are having to temper their hopes for a productive parliamentary spring. So might Singh. The SNC-Lavalin has solidified the notion that the next election will boil down to a duel for government between the Liberals and the Conservatives. It is a perception that the NDP’s role as the second opposition party tends to reinforce. Jack Layton in 2011 and Trudeau in the last election both had to wait to be on the campaign trail to level the playing field to their advantage. Until Monday, Joe Clark had been the last opposition leader to make his entry in the Commons in the dying days of a parliament. The next-to-last leader of the Progressive Conservative party waited almost four years before securing a federal seat in the summer of 2000. On the day Clark finally took his seat, three Quebec MPs initially elected as Progressive Conservatives crossed the floor to the Liberals. Jean Chrétien called a general election a little more than a month after that show of strength. It was the last campaign the Tories fought under their banner. Trudeau did not have as unpleasant a surprise in store for Singh’s first full day as an MP. But the NDP does face an existential threat next fall as the Tories did at the time of Clark’s second coming to the House of Commons almost two decades ago. Like Clark who had to fend off the Liberals and the Canadian Alliance, Singh is threatened on two fronts. As the result of a string of provincial breakthroughs the Green party is poised to enter the federal campaign with the momentum the NDP so lacks. In last month’s Outremont byelection, Elizabeth May’s candidate finished ahead of the Bloc Québécois and the Conservatives. In the province that currently accounts for the largest number of NDP MPs, the most recent Léger Marketing poll pegged the Green party at 9 per cent, two points ahead of the NDP. The stars could be aligning for voters to rediscover May at the expense of her NDP rival next fall. As if crossing swords with the Liberals across the aisle was not enough, Singh will have to spend the coming months looking over his shoulder.

Ian knows how to build great teams and how to win in a highly regulated industry. This individual is an incredible strategist with a global perspective. We can’t wait to share the great initiatives that Ian and the team are currently working on with our shareholders. Having him in early in a consultancy role to assess if the opportunity was right for him and his incredible desire to deliver results has enabled him to hit the ground running from day one. Ian rounds out our creative hard-working talent in growing, extraction and retail and I look forward to working closely with Ian and the City View Green team as we expand our business.”

335,,2019-03-22T19:31:00.0000000Z,“The green jacket certainly is an iconic part of the Masters ... but to also be the FIRST ever Canadian Women to ever play Augusta National in the history of golf itself is something much bigger and that will stick with me forever,"It was the hardest secret Brigitte Thibault ever had to keep. But with an historic women’s event at golf’s most iconic venue now just around the corner, she’s ready to open up about it.

Thibault, a native of Rosemère, Que. (about 35 minutes north of Montreal) will be Canada’s lone participant at the first-ever Augusta National Women’s Amateur, set to take place April 3-6. The 20-year-old is a member of Golf Canada’s national team, and as Canada’s highest-ranked female amateur, she was received an invitation to take part in the prestigious event.

“I had that hope of maybe I would get in,” she says. “But it was all just hopes and dreams.”

The event — which was first announced during the 2018 Masters by Augusta National chairman Fred Ridley — will see the first two rounds of the 54-hole event take place at Champions Retreat Golf Club – about 30 minutes from Augusta National. The top 30 finishers after 36 holes will then move on to play the final 18 holes at Augusta National itself.

All competitors will get to play a practice round at Augusta National regardless of where they stand on the leaderboard.

And if you’re wondering, no, the winner won’t receive one of Augusta National’s green jackets.

“The green jacket certainly is an iconic part of the Masters,” Ridley told reporters at last year’s Masters. “We plan to have a very distinctive award for the winner of this event, and we think in time that will become iconic. I can assure you it will be very, very nice.”

Thibault says the morning of January 17 she was working out – she’s in her second year at Fresno State University – and didn’t check her phone for 90 minutes. After leaving the gym she got a call from an anonymous number, which, she says, she never usually answers.

“It was the chairman inviting me to Augusta National,” she says with a laugh. “It was pretty crazy. If missed the phone call, I didn’t have the number show so I couldn’t even call back. It was all about the timing.”

She admits she started crying right after she found out the news that she would be in the field, and, still in shock, she called her family. She spoke to her dad first – her parents got her into golf as a young teenager – and her family started a group text-message thread to send her good vibes, since she wasn’t able to tell anyone for another week.

“It was a moment I’ll remember forever,” she says.

At 15 she began competing and immediately began to attract the attention of coaches.

“You can definitely see that she’s an athlete with her own move, but you wouldn’t initially guess that she hasn’t played very much,” says Tristan Mullally, the women’s head coach for Golf Canada’s national team.

“I don’t think I’d ever doubt her ability. Just because you’re new to the game you don’t have the background of what to do, when. I see all those things as positive though, because you look at how good she is, in such a short period of time, and how much she’s moved the needle, it’s a great sign for her in terms of moving forward.”

This is Thibault’s first year as part of the national team, but she had been making big strides long before she rose to the top of the squad. Last summer she Monday Qualified for the CP Women’s Open in just her second year of playing competitively.

“From that, that’s when I knew I could get there and dominate at some point. It’s been the hardest thing I’ve ever worked on,” she says of golf. “I’m the kind of person that if I try something, I acquire things fast. The fact that the conditions always change with golf, it’s a nice challenge to go through.”

Augusta National may be the hardest golf-course challenge she’ll have faced.

Thibault says when she first started to play she didn’t watch much golf, except for the Masters. Playing the course has been on her bucket list, she says.

She’ll be using a local caddie for the week and has picked the brain of Canadian Alan Palmer, who was a former professional at Augusta and is now a professional at Champions Retreat.

Thibault will have the support of Canada’s top-ranked golfer in Brooke Henderson, who recently told Sportsnet that it’s great to see Augusta National open up their course to some of the best amateurs in the world, and how it’s a “pretty cool” opportunity for the girls to tee it up at such a unique event.

But between the Canadian support, the extra time in the gym and on the course to prepare, and the pinch-me moments to come at the hallowed grounds of Augusta National, Thibault says she’ll try to treat the week as normal as possible.

It’s a surreal opportunity, she concedes. But it’s one she’s going to take full advantage of.

“My status of being a woman at first, it was always a dream to go there,” she explains. “It wouldn’t have been possible in the past. The fact they took the first step as a platform for golf, and they took that first step to include women, it’s a pretty amazing step. I feel like it’s an honour to be the first Canadian woman, and the only one to be there to represent my country.”

336,Sports,2019-03-19T19:16:00.0000000Z,"Travis Green, by the way, likes Motte so take it ... blocking shots.” Good Canadian kid there.","Will dropping the number of homegrown starters in the CFL diminish the Canadiana of the league?

With just 21 sleeps until the NHL’s draft lottery, here’s something else that’s exciting to Vancouver Canucks fans, the musings and meditations on the world of sports.

• The news that the CFL and CFLPA are considering revisions to the player ratio has been floating around the league for a couple of months, but it surfaced violently last week as negotiations opened for a new CBA.

Traditionalists, predictably, had a conniption, claiming the league would sell out its birthright if the ratio was altered. The league, they argue, derives its character and identity from its Canadian content and if the number of Canadian starters is reduced from seven to five, the league will lose its soul.

You can understand their outrage to a point but, in this case the economic considerations of an adjustment outweigh those issues which concern the flag and back bacon. The CFL is a lot of things — not least of which is a uniquely Canadian institution — but it’s also a second-tier professional league trying to survive in a brutally competitive market.

The ratio, unfortunately, distorts the league’s business model. Once you get past the quarterbacks, the highest-paid players aren’t the league’s stars but tend to be veteran Canadians who can play at or near an all-star level. The proposal to reduce their number doesn’t eradicate the Canadiana aspect of the league. But it does reduce the inflationary pressure involved with those players.

The CFL will also argue that expansion will open more jobs to all players, irrespective of their passport, and when you come right down to it, it seems the millennial audience the league is trying to reach isn’t as concerned with the game’s history as their parents and grandparents.

The league is trying to rebrand itself as a global entity which can attract players from all over the world. This is a necessary step in that process.

Now, if they come after the rouge they’ll have a fight on their hands.

• If the Players Championship isn’t the fifth major, it easily qualifies as the fifth-most important tournament in world golf and you can make the case it’s as prestigious as the PGA. It served up another beauty this week, a 16-man battle royal from which Rory McIlroy emerged as the survivor. The new March start date also serves as a brilliant kickoff to the golf season for anyone who lives north of St. Louis.

It has its own history, its own setting and its own unique story to tell each year. Basically, it’s The Masters Lite. which is a pretty good thing to be.

• During Wednesday’s Canucks-Rangers tilt, I made the observation on Twitter that, while the bar isn’t exactly high, Tyler Motte qualifies as one of the more positive stories of this Canucks season.

Didn’t realize this was a hugely controversial position.

Motte, in fact, sets up as a test case in the ongoing debate over analytics. The eyeball test sees the 24-year-old winger as a fourth-liner who kills penalties, has scored nine goals this season and plays the game with speed and tenacity. Among other things, he leads the Canucks in hits by a huge margin.

Again, this is as much a commentary on the rest of the team as Motte.

As for his fancy stats, they are, well, terrible. I’d argue that’s a result of playing most of the season with Jay Beagle and Loui Eriksson in a matchup role, but the analytics folk believe his underlying data is a reflection of Motte as a player. At least that’s what they mentioned on Wednesday in the calm, reasoned language which makes Twitter such a fun place to inhabit.

We can revisit this one this time next year and if I’m wrong, it won’t be the first time.

Travis Green, by the way, likes Motte so take it up with him.

• Ran into an NHL scout in Dallas who spends a lot of time working the NCAA. Here’s his take on Canucks prospect Tyler Madden, who’s just finishing his freshman year at Northeastern.

“The kid’s a stud. I don’t care about his weight (Madden goes a buck fifty-five on a good day). He’ll play and he’s a winner.”

• And finally, it’s been an up-and-down season for Luke Schenn, and that’s putting it mildly. In his career, a larger stardom has eluded the fifth-overall pick in the 2008 draft but, until this season, he spent 10 years in the NHL as a reliable stay-at-home defencemen.

Then things changed, abruptly, and the speed of the game and Schenn’s own limitations made him an expendable commodity. He’s played for four teams this season — Anaheim and the Canucks in the NHL; San Diego and Utica in the AHL — and, as much as anyone, he understands his situation.

“You don’t ask questions,” said the 29-year-old. “When you get in the lineup, you just try to play to the best of your capability. Being in the position I have been this year, I don’t take anything for granted. I just want to enjoy it and have fun.

“When you’re a young guy, you can be naive to the way things can be. When you’re younger, you take certain situations and opportunities for granted. When you get older you learn to appreciate them a lot more, knowing they’re not going to be there forever.”

Schenn drew into the Canucks’ lineup on Sunday because of the injury to Chris Tanev. He also understands the hazards of playing the style he shares with Tanev.

“It would be nice to sit on the half-wall and run the power play but it’s just not in the cards for guys like myself and him,” he said with a laugh. “I did it a couple of times in the minors where you run the power play and you think, man, it would be nice to be doing this my whole career. You’d feel a lot less beaten down.

“But you have to play to your strengths and that’s part of it, taking hits, making hits, blocking shots.”

Good Canadian kid there.

What are the options to strike at Canadian identity? How could China most severely wound the country’s self-esteem?

It cannot likely put together a better Olympic hockey team. What else is iconically Canadian? The North Pole? Chinese influence in the Arctic is tempered by Russia’s. What could Beijing do, really, to disrupt Tim Hortons’ supply chain? Surely its agents have no compromising material on Celine Dion.

But there is another heel on the Canadian Achilles, a plant so distinctively and proudly Canadian that it represents a diplomatic, economic and symbolic nexus of vulnerabilities even greater than the sugar maple.

News this week of a Chinese ban on new orders of canola seed is not only so potentially damaging to the Western Canadian economy, but so insulting to canola’s origin story in Canadian wartime initiative and frontier agricultural science, that the Chinese could hardly have aimed the dagger closer to Canada’s cultural heart.

Fears of Chinese industrial espionage and controversy around telecom giant Huawei, including Canada’s detention of company executive (and daughter of its founder) Meng Wanzhou, have dented China’s self-image as an imperial technological powerhouse of the future economy.

China’s new claims of finding “hazardous organisms” in canola seed could have a similar reputational effect on this jewel of the Prairies, once nicknamed the Cinderella Crop for its rags to riches narrative arc — from rough unpalatable rapeseed oil used to lubricate wartime naval steam engines, to the delicate, sunlight-golden, low-fat cooking oil that derives its name from the country Canada.

And the Chinese love canola oil. The annual export market from Canada to China is nearly 5 million tonnes, representing 40 per cent of Canada’s market for the crop and worth $2.7 billion. When crushed, the meal is good for animal feed, and the oil is great in a wok. Revenge is literally delicious, for man and beast alike.

Canola is a Canadian “success story” that has created a “terrific number of jobs,” as close to 50 per cent of the Canadian harvest is processed domestically, Jim Everson, president of the Canola Council of Canada, told the National Post.

He said China has identified specific quality issues on the receiving end that were not detected by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency on the exporting end, so it is “critical” that they sort this out in the coming months, as farmers decide what to plant next year.

The fundamentals of bilateral trade in canola are strong, he said, with a rising Chinese middle class demanding more, and Canadian production increasing year over year.

It is almost as if another factor is in play, something deeper and metaphorical.

Like many Canadian heartstring tuggers, the history of canola is a tale of foreigners doing well on the prairies against all odds.

Canola is a kind of rapeseed, which itself is from the brassica family of sprouts, cabbages and broccolis. Rapeseed came to Canada, as the legend goes, in an envelope of seeds mailed in 1936 from a friend in Poland to Fred Solvoniuk in Shellbrook, Saskatchewan. He shared with his neighbours.

The descendants of these seeds became the first rapeseed low in unhealthy erucic acid, one of two key considerations in its engineered evolution toward a food crop.

Another line, known as “Argentine,” was introduced to Canada in 1940 on a freighter from South America, even though it probably came from Europe, according to a history of rapeseed by Ottawa author Brewster Kneen.

But at the time, Canadian production was small, only on experimental farms, in trials that showed it could grow in Ontario and the West.

Before the Second World War, Canada was primarily importing its edible oils, like palm, coconut or cottonseed. But the war closed those markets, and simultaneously drove up the market for rapeseed oil in naval steam engines.

Rapeseed was not the obvious solution for the former problem, or for diversifying Canada’s reliance on wheat. It was black, and the oil an unappetizing green. It looked like the kind of thing you put in a boat’s engine. Even worse, it’s meal was high in glucosinolate, sulphur compounds that inhibit growth, so it could not be fed to livestock.

It is a rare seed plant that inspires national pride

Nevertheless, with a guaranteed price from the government, massive amounts of rapeseed were planted for the war effort, and a fledgling science took root. Though Canada was better known during the Second World War as the Aerodrome of Democracy, it was also its lubricant.

By 1948, rapeseed production spiked to more than 30,000 hectares, falling off to nearly nothing two years later, as the demand for engine oil plummeted. The real spike happened in the 1950s and took off in the 60s. In 1967, federal industry ministry formalized its support in seeking an “expanding market.”

It was a national project, pushing rapeseed from Saskatchewan experimental farms to the tables of the world. It also needed a better name.

Reflecting on this time 25 years later, Mac Runciman, first president of the Rapeseed Association said: “There were a few growing pains because the group was bringing together people who had never worked together before. For the first time, crushers heard producers’ laments and producers learned how the product they grew was marketed.”

In 1974, the development by food scientists Baldur Stefansson and Keith Downey of a kind of canola that was both pleasant to eat as oil for humans and meal for animals was boosted by a coordinated marketing push for this new wonder-crop, named for Canada, the country that created it.

In 1978, the Canola Council of Canada registered the trademark “canola,” which it holds to this day.

Thus did a crop that was in limited use for thousands of years in Asia and Europe mainly as fuel, become first a key part of a global war effort as a mechanical lubricant, then an icon of a healthy modern low-fat diet, and an expression of Canada’s newfound self-sufficiency.

It is a rare seed plant that inspires national pride, and rarer still for foreign grain purchasing decisions to feel insulting. But already the affair is feeling like a comedy of manners, with Canada taking its stereotypically apologetic stance.

Responding to China’s ban Friday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said simply, “We’re going to roll up our sleeves and work with the Chinese officials to demonstrate that canola should continue to flow safely from Canada to China.”

Like many of the pot companies, TGOD has had a great start to 2019, in its case rising 85 per cent since January 1. Now trading in the mid-$4.00 range, the stock is well off its high of $10.24 set last September, but there are reasons to be bullish on the name.

Last month, the company got the nod from Wall Street investment bank Jefferies in its coverage launch of the cannabis space, where TGOD was one of five Buys listed. (They initiated coverage on nine companies.) Rather than trying to be all things to all pot consumers, concentrating on the organic market could be rewarding, according to Jefferies, who gave the stock a price target of $4.65 per share.

Nash agrees. “This is a really interesting cannabis company. It’s the only one that’s certified organic,” he says, in conversation with BNN Bloomberg last Thursday.

“What it comes down to is that the market is still so young on [cannabis], so for consumers that are buying online, I don’t see a huge amount of differentiation involved. What I’m curious to see is once those stores are available and people can go in and touch it and smell it, are they going to have a preference for an organic cannabis option? If the answer is yes, then this company is very, very well situated to capitalize on it,” Nash says.

Brett Bundale, The Canadian Press





It started with a chance encounter in a coffee shop. He was charming and attractive, and everything he said mirrored her life.

The relationship developed into a romance but the seduction ended months later in apparent deception, an elaborate scheme by an alleged serial con man to whom she lost thousands of dollars.

""Everything he said to me was a lie,"" says Andrea Speranza, an athletic 49-year-old with long brown hair. ""I couldn't understand how he could make love to me with the sole purpose of ripping me off.""

She has since found multiple alleged victims of Marcel Andre Vautour, a man with a criminal record, warrants for his arrest and several aliases.

His suspected victims say he targets busy career women between the ages of 45 and 50, leaving a trail of broken hearts and empty bank accounts across the country.

The Canadian Press has spoken with three women across the country who say they fell victim to his romantic schemes, and one man who was promised a job and ended up losing tens of thousands of dollars. Each alleged victim has positively identified photos of the same person.

Vautour did not respond to requests for comment by phone, email or social media. None of the new allegations against him have been proven in court.

Speranza says she's sharing her story to prevent more people from falling victim to his alleged scams.

""I want to stop him from hurting more people,"" Speranza says. ""I'm going to catch a criminal.""

Originally from Ontario, Speranza had a hardscrabble childhood.

Despite her hard upbringing, she graduated from university and moved to Nova Scotia, where she became a firefighter and one of the first female captains in Halifax.

Speranza has dedicated her life to helping others, running an award-winning camp that educates girls about emergency services careers.

When she met a man who called himself March Hebert last summer, they seemed like kindred spirits.

He told her a story about his difficult family life, saying his parents struggled with addictions. But he turned his life around, worked on offshore oil rigs, and purchased hundreds of acres in rural Nova Scotia to build a youth-at-risk facility.

""It was almost like everything about my life he was saying back to me,"" Speranza says.

She says she now realizes it wasn't a chance encounter. He targeted her, she says, using a well-honed script and asking pointed questions to develop a plan.

It started off very casually -- she wasn't looking for a relationship. But she was attracted to his desire to help youth and to give back to the community.

The five-foot-eight, 185-pound man with green eyes and a disarming smile eventually persuaded her to hang out. They went hiking and kayaking, and attended charity events.

He told her she was beautiful. She made him a better person. She was the best thing that ever happened to him. He was falling hard and wanted to spend the rest of his life with her.

""Everything was just perfect,"" she says. ""He was super accommodating and helpful and complimentary. Nothing I could say or do was wrong.""

Speranza now believes he targeted her to invest in his apparently fabricated youth-at-risk facility. When she instead offered to help him apply for grants, she believes he implemented an exit strategy.

He said he suffered from Crohn's disease and one day he called her to say he'd been hospitalized.

She recalls him saying he was OK, but his wallet had been stolen. He needed money to buy costly medication. Then he had to go to Toronto to get his dog from his ex, and borrowed money for a train ticket and hotel room. He promised to pay her back.

She gave him $5,000.

""He ghosted me after that,"" Speranza says, adding that he never repaid her. ""I pride myself on good decisions. But I had no inkling whatsoever.""

She filed a police report and encouraged another alleged victim she met, Jean-Baptiste Joachin, to do the same.

The French citizen had met Vautour at a hostel in Quebec City and had travelled with him to Halifax, where he was promised a job on an offshore rig.

Joachin allegedly paid Vautour thousands of dollars for training courses. He also opened up Canadian bank accounts and credit cards, which Vautour had access to.

By the time Vautour skipped town last fall, Joachin had lost $30,000.

""He completely blindsided me,"" Joachin said. ""Everything he told me was bullshit.""

Halifax police spokesman John MacLeod confirmed the force has received two complaints of fraud based on case file numbers provided to The Canadian Press by Speranza and Joachin. But he said one incident had been closed while the second was deemed a civil matter.

Meanwhile, Speranza has discovered more alleged victims in other provinces through social media. They exchanged photos of the fraudster to confirm his identity, and have shared information about their cases.

Together, they've pieced together a string of allegations against Vautour across the country.

The Canadian Press has contacted police forces, court houses and justice departments in several provinces and has confirmed he's a wanted man with a criminal past.

Documents obtained from Quebec's Justice Department show Vautour pleaded guilty in 2005 to unauthorized use of credit card data and received a suspended sentence of one year's probation.

In 2015, Quebec courts issued an arrest warrant for Vautour for fraud.

Victoria Law Courts confirmed a warrant for the arrest of Vautour was issued in 2001, and executed in 2009. He pleaded guilty in August 2009 to obtaining by false pretence and served a six-month conditional sentence in the community, followed by two and half years of probation.

Meanwhile, West Kelowna RCMP said they are aware of a recent incident and have a police file open on the matter. But spokesman Jesse O'Donaghey said specific details are not released until charges are laid by Crown counsel.

The Winnipeg Police Service confirmed Vautour is currently the subject of two arrest warrants. Const. Rob Carver said the charges pending from 1998 include possession of goods obtained by crime over $5,000 and personation.

Records from the Court of Queen's Bench of New Brunswick indicate Vautour was charged in 1996 with stealing a Volkswagen Jetta in Dieppe.

Despite efforts by law enforcement, some alleged victims have launched their own investigations -- even hiring a private investigator.

They've tracked down more than 20 phone numbers, 10 email addresses and multiple physical addresses used by Vautour in Canada and overseas.

The alleged victims have even narrowed down his method.

They say he told them all variations on a theme: He had a successful career either working on offshore rigs, as a remotely operated underwater vehicle operator, or running companies.

He claimed he made it big investing in precious metals, cryptocurrency and cannabis, the alleged victims say. He said he owned a white convertible Porsche, a Ford F-350 truck, a baby blue Aston Martin. He even had pictures to show off his upscale possessions.

""He had money and was well-travelled,"" says Jodi McMullin, a woman from the Okanagan area of B.C. who met him on a dating site in January 2018.

The whirlwind romance moved quickly, and they began planning a future together.

He told her he had been working in Vietnam and wanted to stay with her in Canada. But he had tax issues, and needed help cashing a business cheque.

The businesswoman offered to help him out. When she had doubts, he was always ready with an explanation.

""Every time I questioned him on something, he had a response right away,"" she says. ""There was never any hesitation.""

She provided him with her bank account number, and he deposited a cheque and then pressured her to transfer him the money, she says.

McMullin acquiesced and then left for a wedding in the U.S. When she returned, the cheque -- which she later learned was a fake purchased online -- bounced, she says.

""He ended up stealing just over $45,000 from me,"" she says. ""My trust is shot. There's not a day that goes by that I don't think about it.""

Speranza is determined to bring the man she knew as March to justice, launching www.stopthemarchmadness.com in the hopes of preventing romance fraud and encouraging more potential victims to come forward with anecdotes, stories and possible charges against Vautour.

""This man ruins people's lives and I am in the business of saving people's lives,"" the firefighter says. ""I have to stop him.""",Duped Canadian women go after charming alleged con man,Bell Media,https://london.ctvnews.ca/duped-canadian-women-go-after-charming-alleged-con-man-1.4342350

MedMen will use New York-based ...","The LA firm will use part of the money to open 30 stores in Florida

More green is pouring into the coffers of rapidly-growing cannabis operator MedMen Enterprises.

The Culver City-based company just got a $250 million investment from Gotham Green Partners, which MedMen intends to use to help fund its national retail expansion. The news was announced in a release, according to the Los Angeles Business Journal.

The big investment involves an initial $100 million loan secured by MedMen’s stock, which listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange in mid-2018.

MedMen will use New York-based Gotham’s investment to fund its 30-store expansion in Florida, a buildout of technology infrastructure, and to integrate operations the company has recently acquired, including the PharmaCann firm in Illinois.

MedMen raised another $100 million for its push in January, when it spun off its real estate assets into Treehouse Real Estate Investment Trust, an entity created in partnership with Venice-based investment firm Stable Road Capital.

That arrangement includes a number of leaseback deals, a popular model to free up capital in the cannabis industry, where financing is difficult because of federal restrictions. The entities are private real estate investment vehicles, not actually publicly-traded REITs. Along with leaseback deals, many offer financing to cannabis companies to fund real estate acquisitions and buildouts.

A handful have cropped up lately to capitalize on the demand for real estate, and a lack of available financing within the cannabis space. Pelorus Equity Group’s $100 million fund and Inception Companies’ $50 million fund are among the larger funds in California.

He made that for a 67 to get into the final group.","PALM HARBOR, Fla. – The final hour changed the dynamics of the Valspar Championship, just not the lead.

That still belongs to defending champion Paul Casey, and he saw only the upside of having his three-shot margin shrink to one, and going from a final round pairing with a player who is 0 for 195 on the PGA Tour to playing alongside the No. 1 player in the world.

On a Saturday at Innisbrook that began with all 70 players who made the cut still very much in the mix, Casey surged to a three-shot lead until a bogey on the 18th hole for a 3-under 68 that left him one shot ahead of Dustin Johnson.

Nick Taylor of Abbotsford, B.C., was tied for sixth, four shots back of Casey, Mackenzie Hughes of Dundas, Ont., was tied for 14th at 3 under and Roger Sloan of Merritt, B.C., was tied for 27th.

At stake for Casey is a chance to become the first back-to-back winner of the Valspar Championship since this PGA Tour event began in 2000.

Behind him is Johnson, who is going for his second victory in three starts.

“Of the guys on the leaderboard, he’s the one I would want to be paired with, so it doesn’t bother me,” Casey said. “Obviously, two shots would have been nicer than one, but one is better than level, or one behind.”

Johnson had some say in that final margin with one of his best shots of the day, a 9-iron from a bunker a few paces in front of a steep lip to the front shelf of the 18th green, 10 feet behind the hole. He made that for a 67 to get into the final group.

And that was good news for Casey?

“He’s the best player in the world. That’s why I work and I do what I do, because I want to play against the best in the world,” Casey said.

He also pointed to Johnson being the favourite, at least in the eyes of thousands of fans on a warm, sun-filled day at Innisbrook, the kind of buzz it had last year when Tiger Woods played for the first time.

“I actually feel very little pressure,” Casey said. “You look at my results versus Dustin’s. He’s the better player, so it’s pretty simple. If I go out tomorrow and beat him, I actually might win, plain and simple. Great scenario.”

Only it’s not that simple, and no one knows better than Casey.

A year ago, he rallied from five shots behind with a 65 and wound up winning by one shot over Woods and Patrick Reed. That’s a tribute to Innisbrook, which players regard as one of the purest tests of the year, certainly in Florida.

Casey was at 8-under 205. Eight players had a share of the lead in the third round, and 10 players finished within four shots of the lead.

That starts with Jason Kokrak, winless in his 195 starts as a pro over the better part of eight years. He showed how quickly fortunes can change when he made three birdies in five holes to start the back nine, and then smashed an 8-iron with a breeze at his back that rolled across the 15th green and into the cup for a hole-in-one .

“You can be three, four, five shots out at this golf course and really make some noise if you get it going early,” Kokrak said.

Kokrak shot 30 on the back for a 66 and was poised to play in the final group until Johnson made his birdie on the 18th. Luke Donald, a past winner at Innisbrook playing for only the second time this year – and first since January – grinded his way to a 70 and joined Scott Stallings (70) three shots behind. Louis Oosthuizen, who had a 66 despite two bogeys on the last three holes, and Jim Furyk were among those four behind.

Casey seized control with three birdies in a five-hole stretch to start the back nine. But on the final hole, after Johnson made his birdie, Casey went into the first of a series of miniature church-pew bunkers on the 18th, couldn’t get to the green and missed his 15-foot par putt.

Johnson looked to be giving up plenty of opportunities, especially on the par 5s. He had an iron into the green on Nos. 1 and 11, just missed and chipped to short range before twice missing birdie chances. And then he picked up a birdie on the par-5 14th in the most unlikely way .

From light rough with trees partially in his way, he tried to hammer a 5-wood 290 yards. But it came out with too much wind and floated into the wind, hit a tree well short of the green and nearly went into water that isn’t typically in play. Still, he had a tree between his ball and the green. Johnson hit a hard pitch from 73 yards to the right of the tree and let the hill bring it back to the green. And then he made a 35-foot birdie putt.

“Makes up for the other two,” he said, walking to the 15th tee.

But the big shot was on the 18th, and the birdie got him into the final group in his first trip to Innisbrook since 2010.

“I’m in a good position … because this golf course, it’s tough,” Johnson said. “If I can go out and shoot a good score, then I’ve got a chance.”",Canadian Nick Taylor sits T6 ahead of Valspar finale,Golf Canada,https://golfcanada.ca/article/canadian-nick-taylor-sits-t6-ahead-valspar-finale

347,Sports,2019-03-17T02:38:00.0000000Z,The 30-year-old Canadian arrived at TPC Sawgrass feeling great about his putter before promptly missing several short putts in Thursday’s first round. After a good day on the greens on Friday ...,"PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. – Don’t call him Goldilocks, but Corey Conners finally played the par-3 island green at TPC Sawgrass just right.

During the first round of the Players Championship, his shot at the iconic 17th hole was too soft. That day, he intended to fly his ball past the front pin and use the back stop to get it close. Instead, his shot – which he deemed his luckiest of the day – barely made it over the water before nestling nine feet from the hole. He made par.

During round two, Conners hit his target but the late afternoon green was too hard and his ball skipped forward, almost meeting the same watery fate as Tiger Wood’s ball. Conners’ ball mercifully stopped in the sliver of rough between the green and the water. He made another par.

On Saturday, Conners arrived at the 17th tee at three-under for the day, five-under for the championship.

Weekends at the Players are different. There is a lot more fun to be had outside of the ropes, especially at the island green. The VIP suites surrounding the hole bustled with action. Everyone’s spirits raised by, well, spirits. Below on the grassy amphitheatre, much of the grass had been replaced by chairs and blankets; fans camped out in the best seats in the house for an afternoon of water balls and cold beer. Marshals had all but given up keeping the fans quiet, raising their arms before each shot more in surrender than authority.

Coming off a birdie at the par-5 16th, Conners wasn’t thinking about the crowd.

“I don’t really notice the noise, don’t really mind it when it’s consistent like that,” he said after the round.

On Saturday, the wind at 17 had turned into the players, and with the pin at the front left, Conners found it trickier to get close.

“I think for most guys it will be a wedge, but you’ve got to hit a good wedge,” he said. “It’s a gutsy wedge I guess.”

Conners’ playing partner Matt Wallace, not happy with his wedge shots on Saturday, hit nine-iron and it went long. The Englishman’s lower trajectory shot penetrated the wind and sent his ball to the back tier. Conners’ pitching wedge was higher, hit harder by the wind, but landed gently 12 feet from the hole.

Just right.

“It was a perfect shot,” Conners said “Exactly how I wanted it. I maybe thought it was going to land one or two yards further into the green but I hit it really solid.”

Being a golf nut was about to pay dividends for Conners. After watching similar putts on television throughout the years, he knew that his 12-foot putt would stop breaking near the hole, a subtlety not obvious from the green. There was a pitch mark near his line and he knew if he started his ball just to the right of it, it would go in for birdie.

He did, and it did.

“My mind is always thinking about golf,” he said when asked about the changing course conditions. “Last night on the practice green I was rolling some putts and envisioning some of the holes, sitting on the couch back at the house I was thinking about how some of the holes might play, sort of visualizing what I wanted my shot to look like.”

Conners’ Saturday 68 moved him up the leaderboard into a tie for 24th at six-under par. Another good round Sunday will mean a great payday and valuable FedEx Cup points.

But, beware, this course is a bear.

Taylor battles putter, finally wins

PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. – Nick Taylor’s patience is being tested this week at the Players Championship.

The 30-year-old Canadian arrived at TPC Sawgrass feeling great about his putter before promptly missing several short putts in Thursday’s first round. After a good day on the greens on Friday, nothing would drop on Saturday.

“To be honest there was probably three putts today where a foot short I would have bet a lot of money they were going in, and they didn’t,” Taylor said.

Taylor made a total of just 47 feet of putts during round three. His first three birdies came on near-gimmes from 8 inches, 3-feet-7-inches and 1-foot-7-inches. Taylor hit 15 greens in regulation on Saturday and had plenty of mid-range looks at birdie that went unrewarded.

“You keep telling yourself that eventually, they are going to drop,” he said. “If you keep hitting edges and starting on the lines you are choosing that’s really all you can do.”

Despite frustration setting in, Taylor was playing well and was determined to keep giving himself chances. At the brutally difficult 18th hole, Taylor had one last chance to make a putt. He had 10-feet-5-inches for birdie get to five-under for the week and head to Sunday tied for 32nd at the Players Championship.

It dropped. Finally.

Taylor shot 69 at TPC Sawgrass on Saturday while making just one putt from outside of five feet.

After years of little or no employment growth, the labour market improved marginally in 2018. Overall employment increased by 2.1%, and the unemployment rate decreased from 8.2% to 6.9%, still significantly higher than the national rate of 5.8%. These aggregate figures, however, obscure regional and demographic differences. Employment continues to decline in regions such as the North Shore, the Annapolis Valley, and especially Cape Breton, where the unemployment rate increased to 16.7%. Province-wide, the youth unemployment rate remains high at 13.4%.

Despite the incremental improvement in Nova Scotia’s aggregate employment statistics, real wage growth is non-existent. In 2018, average weekly earnings increased by only 1.2%, barely keeping pace with inflation and less than half the national growth rate of 2.6%. Earnings growth is on a downward trajectory, falling in each of the past four years. The province’s anemic earnings growth is only worsened by provincial government policies, such as maintaining the lowest minimum wage in the country and labour contracts forcing real wage cuts on teachers, nurses, and other public servants.

Economic growth remains sluggish. The Finance Department’s December Forecast Update projects real GDP growth of only 1% in 2018 and 0.6% for 2019. Since the current government came to power, real economic growth averaged a paltry 1% compared to 1.9% for the national economy. With provincial government spending making up roughly a quarter of its economy, Nova Scotia’s performance has not been helped by its government’s spending restraint to generate surpluses and achieve arbitrary budgetary goals.

The small gains in the Nova Scotian economy are not trickling down to our most disadvantaged citizens. To paraphrase former US President Harry Truman, the measure of any society (and, by extension, its economy and government) is how it treats its most vulnerable members. By this measure, the Nova Scotia economy and government fail miserably.

High Poverty Rates

Nova Scotia has the highest poverty rate in Canada, at 12.8%. The poverty rate for couple-led families with children increased between 2016 and 2017 to 12.3%, the highest in Canada. Along with the persistently high level of poverty for lone parent families (26.4%), these high poverty rates affect Nova Scotia’s children where the poverty rate of 17.1% is by far the highest of any Canadian province and almost twice the national rate of 9.0%. Those who rely on social assistance do not receive enough support to cover their needs; for example, single people receive 38% of the income needed to buy a basic basket of goods. The 2-5% increase promised by the current government, is insufficient and indeed shameful given that the lowest poverty gap for a family with two children would require an increase of 29% to meet their basic needs for food, shelter, clothing.

What about our fiscal health? The budget is balanced, and in 2016-17 and 2017-18 the provincial government generated surpluses of $151 million and $230 million respectively. The debt-to-GDP ratio has fallen to 34.6% and is projected to fall further. Our debt-GDP ratio is much lower than Ontario’s or Quebec’s which have projected ratios of around 40%. With continuing low interest rates, the government is trading in high cost for low cost debt. Consequently, the interest on its debt is in decline, and the ratio of debt servicing costs to revenue has fallen considerably over the past five years, from 8.8% to 7.0%.

The government’s primary focus on fiscal health means that it largely neglects the health and wellbeing of Nova Scotians. Our government has missed opportunities over the last 6 years to make critical public investments that would see our province shift to a bottom-up inclusive green growth strategy, from one centred on failed payroll rebates to profitable companies while denying that our planet’s very existence is in peril.

Address the climate crisis

The government must use this opportunity to be bold, to address the climate crisis and make a significant investment in a just transition to renewable energy and a green economy. A Green New Deal is being proposed in the United States and is now being discussed in Canada, with many aspects echoing the visions of the Leap Manifesto and the 2030 Declaration. These blueprints for change have indeed been the backbone to alternative budgets in Nova Scotia, and federally. The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives’ lens for creating the alternative federal budget and the Nova Scotia alternative budget combine social, economic and environmental justice.

Nova Scotia needs to set targets in line with the Paris Agreement’s goal of keeping warming below 1.5C, by setting a target of at least 50% below 1990 levels by 2030. By achieving this goal, and making investments in the just transition to a green economy, Nova Scotia can create more than 30,700 jobs, according to the Green Economy Network. The development of a green jobs plan could be a starting place.

Our analysis shows what governments could and must do to begin to invest in the tenets of a green new deal for Nova Scotia – within a framework that is fiscally sustainable. Table 1 compares the fiscal baseline projected by the Nova Scotia government to our fiscal situation should we invest an additional billion dollars. Our projections also include a cost of living increase in current expenditures, reallocate some revenue, raise additional revenue by improving the progressivity of the tax system and generating revenue from a strengthened carbon pricing initiative. The result is the debt to GDP ratio increases only slightly, remains fairly stable and in 2022 starts to decline. Concern about overburdening the next generation with debt payments is misplaced; Debt is deferred taxation that is spread out over a lifetime. There are not many opportunities left before we ‘burden’ the next generation with a dead planet.

*From NS Budget December, Update, 2018.

What do we propose to do with this new billion-dollar investment and what impact could it have?

Green New Deal

The green new deal we propose builds on the successes of the original new deal President Roosevelt instituted to address the first great depression in the United States. We need to see similar urgency and level of investment to stimulate the economy, to share the prosperity that exists, to address income inequality, injustice, and the climate crisis.

Our alternative budgets have proposed investments to reduce GHG emissions while ensuring energy is accessible to all Nova Scotians, regardless of income, through fair and progressive taxation and smart investment decisions. (See our spreadsheet for a detailed breakdown of spending and revenue reallocation and generation.) Our proposed investments in climate change mitigation result in lower energy costs and reduced debt by improving energy efficiency, will make our homes more comfortable, and will make it easier to use public transportation. These investments, including in reskilling and training, will support the increased growth of green-sector jobs to support a low-carbon transition.

Our alternative budget backgrounder lays out in detail how the government could enact this plan. These investments will also reduce illness and healthcare costs as pollutants related to fossil fuel combustion decrease. By phasing out coal-fired electricity by 2030, Nova Scotia can avoid 11 premature deaths, 1,200 asthma episode, 19,000 days of breathing difficulty and more than $54 million in healthcare costs. In short, this plan must ensure that those who have been burdened disproportionately by the climate crisis, and who are largely not to blame, do not now bear the costs, including our youth, workers in the non-renewable energy sector, those living in low income, people of colour, and Indigenous Peoples. We must commit to building a just, green economy and society now.

Our alternative budgets prioritize investment to create jobs in the parts of our economy that are already green –those parts focused on caring, sharing, educating our people, building community, and on supporting everyone’s health and wellbeing. Investment to improve access to primary health care, while working to prevent problems from arising in the first place because of poverty conditions, is investing in good jobs that serve the needs in our community. For example, we invest to significantly reduce poverty by investing in the poverty reduction credit (an increase of $2000 per adult), increase the affordable living tax credit ($450 per adult and $120 per child) and double the Nova Scotia Child Benefit, plus providing an increase to social assistance rates themselves and instituting a carbon benefit to offset carbon price increases for people living on low incomes. Investments in real affordable and supportive housing options across our province are critical.

The biggest bang for our investment dollar is undoubtedly in our children and thus investments in early learning and child care and our primary to 12 education system, must be prioritized. Our youth should not have to incur such huge debt loads for post-secondary education. We can reallocate resources and invest to reduce and eliminate tuition fees and to forgive student loans. Our arts and cultural sector, our libraries, our museums, are undervalued critical community infrastructure. Investments in this sector are not only reasons people come to visit, social and cultural infrastructure along with quality public services, and decent jobs, are why they choose to stay.

Nova Scotians need to raise their expectations for what our government can achieve, and what we can achieve collectively. We can build a greener, healthier and just province. This is the lens through which the government’s 2019-20 budget should be judged.

(CSE:MMEN) (OTCQX:MMNFF) (FSE: A2JM6N) (“MedMen” or the “Company”), is pleased to announce that it has signed a binding term sheet for a senior secured convertible credit facility of up to US$250,000,000 (the “Facility”) from funds managed by Gotham Green Partners (“GGP” or the “Investor”), an investor in the global cannabis industry. Management believes this is the largest investment to date by a single investor in a publicly traded cannabis company with U.S. operations.

“This strategic partnership with Gotham Green Partners represents another key milestone for MedMen and stems from our long-standing relationship with The Cronos Group and GGP’s brand portfolio,” said Adam Bierman, CEO of MedMen. “The growth capital will be used to operationalize the balance of our footprint and we look forward to creating further alignment with GGP and their global cannabis platform.”

“We continue to be impressed with MedMen’s industry leading retail execution and iconic branding. With MedMen’s fortified balance sheet, the Company’s future has never been brighter,” said Jason Adler, managing member of GGP. “We feel fortunate to have the opportunity to take such a significant stake in MedMen and begin to work actively with the management team and the board to help the Company achieve its goals.”

The Company intends to use the net proceeds from drawdowns on the Facility to fund the future capital needs of the business. In addition to funding general working capital, the growth capital will primarily be used to:

Operationalize existing retail licenses, with a focus on Florida, where the Company is licensed for 30 stores

Integrate assets acquired through pending transactions, including those related to PharmaCann, LLC

Accelerate geographic expansion through bolt-on acquisitions and investments in core markets

Support national roll-out of higher-margin in-house branded products

Continue to invest in technology and digital infrastructure, with a focus on delivery and loyalty programs

Consolidate the supply chain and enhance margins by ramping up cultivation and production capabilities

The investment from GGP will be in the form of convertible senior secured notes issued by MM CAN USA, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, totaling up to US$250,000,000 (“Notes”) on a private placement basis pursuant to applicable securities laws exemptions. The Notes will be issuable in three tranches, with each of the second and third tranches being issuable at the option of the Company, subject to certain conditions and share price thresholds being achieved by MedMen. The initial tranche will be in the amount of US$100,000,000 (“Tranche I”). The additional US$150,000,000 would be funded in two US$75,000,000 tranches. The second tranche (“Tranche II”) would be available to the Company beginning on the six-month anniversary of the closing date, and the third tranche (“Tranche III”) would be available to the Company beginning on the six-month anniversary of the funding date of Tranche II.

All Notes will have a maturity date of 36 months from the closing date (“Maturity Date”), with a 12-month extension feature available to the Company on certain conditions, including payment of an extension fee. Notes will bear interest from their date of issue at LIBOR + 6.0% per annum. During the first 12 months, interest may be paid-in-kind (“PIK”) at the Company’s option such that any amount of PIK interest will be added to the outstanding principal of the Notes. The Company shall have the right after the first year, to prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Notes prior to maturity, in whole or in part, upon payment of 105% of the principal amount in the second year and 103% of the principal amount thereafter.

All or a portion of the Notes (including all accrued interest thereon) will be convertible, at the option of the holder, into class B subordinate voting shares of the Company (the “Subordinate Voting Shares”) at any time prior to the close of business on the last business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date. The conversion price of each tranche of Notes is as follows:

i) for Tranche I Notes, the conversion price will be equal to 115% of the lesser of (the “Tranche I Reference Price”) (a) US$3.10, which represents the closing price of the Subordinate Voting Shares on the Canadian Securities Exchange (the “CSE”) on the trading day immediately preceding the announcement of the Facility (translated to US dollars), and (b) the closing price of the Subordinate Voting Shares on the trading day immediately preceding the closing date; and

ii) for Tranche II and Tranche III Notes, the conversion price will be equal to the lesser of (a) 115% of the 20 trading day volume weighted average trading price of the Subordinate Voting Shares as of the trading day immediately preceding the date of issue of such tranche, and (b) US$7.00.

The Company may force the conversion of up to 75% of the then outstanding Notes at the applicable conversion price(s) if the volume weighted average trading price of the Subordinate Voting Shares (translated to US dollars) is US$8.00 for any 20 consecutive trading day period. If 75% of the then outstanding Notes are converted by the Company, the term of the remaining 25% of the then outstanding Notes will be extended by 12 months.

Upon drawdown of Tranche I, the lenders would be issued share purchase warrants (“Warrants”), each of which would be exercisable to purchase one Subordinate Voting Share. The number of Warrants to be issued will represent an approximate 50% Warrant coverage on the Tranche 1 Notes, certain of which Warrants will have an exercise price per Subordinate Voting Share that will be equal to a 30% premium to the Tranche I Reference Price, and another group of which Warrants will have an exercise price per Subordinate Voting Share that will be equal to a 50% premium to the Tranche I Reference Price. The Warrant coverage on the Tranche II and Tranche III Notes will be similar to those for the Tranche I Notes. The exercise prices for the Warrants on the Tranche II and Tranche III Notes will be equal to the lesser of (a) a 30% or 50% (as the case may be) premium to the 20 trading day volume weighted average trading price of the Subordinate Voting Shares as of the trading day immediately preceding the date of the drawdowns of such tranches, and (b) US$7.91 or US$9.13 (as the case may be).

The Warrants and any Subordinate Voting Shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes or exercise of the Warrants, will be subject to a four month hold period from the date of issuance of the Notes or such Warrants, as applicable, in accordance with applicable Canadian securities laws.

The terms of the Facility described in this press release are those set out in a binding term sheet. However, completion of any tranche is subject to further agreements being entered into by the parties, including as to the guarantees and/or the collateral to be provided by MedMen and its applicable subsidiaries to secure its obligations under the Facility. The terms of the Facility, the Notes and the Warrants and the conditions to drawdowns are subject to change as the parties negotiate such definitive documentation. The closing of any tranches will be subject to certain conditions being satisfied including, but not limited to, the receipt of all necessary approvals and the absence of material adverse changes. The parties are currently anticipating a closing in April. There can be no assurance that the parties will enter into definitive documentation such that the Facility will be available, or if definitive documentation is entered into, that the terms of the Facility, the Notes and the Warrants and the conditions to receiving the proceeds of any of the tranches will be as stated above.

This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of the securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful. The securities being offered have not been, nor will they be, registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and applicable state securities laws.

352,Politics,2019-03-23T01:34:00.0000000Z,"Bush's administration, was the keynote speaker at an annual gathering of Canadian conservatives in Canada's capital ... attacking policies like the Green New Deal as ""socialism,"" saying in his state of the union address that ""America will never be ...","The timing was impeccable.

As a prominent Republican strategist took to the stage in Ottawa, there was big news breaking south of the border, concerning the Republican-controlled White House where he once used to work.

“If there was collusion, we’d know about it,"" Karl Rove told an Ottawa crowd of conservatives on a Friday night.

Karl Rove, former senior advisor in George W. Bush's administration, was the keynote speaker at an annual gathering of Canadian conservatives in Canada's capital — the Manning Networking Conference.

So when Rove sat down with former federal Reform Party leader Preston Manning, it was no surprise that he was asked about the news that U.S. special counsel Robert Mueller had turned in his report stemming from the law enforcement and counterintelligence investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election.

“I’m in the minority of my party on this. I know Bob Mueller. He’s a really good man, and he’s a straight arrow,"" said Rove.

U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked Mueller's investigation as a ""witch hunt"" while many key Republicans have refused to condemn presidential broadsides against the Justice Department.

Rove also said because the Trump campaign leaked information so heavily to media sources — ""no campaign, in my experience, has leaked worse than the Donald Trump campaign"" — then that suggested something about the campaign's innocence.

“If there was collusion, we’d know about it.”

Among other results, the investigation has already seen criminal proceedings against dozens of people as well as several convictions or guilty pleas from Trump’s former campaign chair Paul Manafort, former national security adviser Michael Flynn, former campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos and former personal lawyer Michael Cohen.

Dozens of Russian nationals, companies and military intelligence officers have also been charged with conspiracy, election interference or hacking Democrats’ emails during the 2016 campaign.

Rove argued in February in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal that U.S. Attorney General William Barr, who will now review Mueller's report, is under no obligation to release it fully, and that doing so would do more harm than good.

Mueller's ""voluminous"" indictments can ""speak for themselves,"" Rove said Friday. ""He put it all in there.""

But Rove also said he thought Trump should have taken a less harsh tone toward Mueller throughout the investigation, given that innocent people generally have nothing to hide.

""I wanted him to be strong,"" he said about Trump. ""I wanted him to say, 'You know what, Mueller's going to get to the bottom of this, we want to know what the Russians did to interfere in our elections, and by God we're not going to let it happen again.'""

Trump could win second term, says Rove

Meanwhile, Rove said he believes Trump can win a second term in 2020 if he attacks his opponent on the basis of their fitness for office.

He told the crowd he felt that while the White House grasped the president's plummeting popularity, that didn't necessary mean the Democrats were on their way back to the West Wing.

Asked by Manning if Trump had a path to victory, Rove said “it can be done — and you know what, he’s going to use a strategy pioneered before by Barack Obama.""

Rove said the former president “spent 2012 disqualifying (Republican nominee) Mitt Romney in the minds of Americans as somebody worthy of holding the Oval Office,"" labelling him as a ""plutocrat who was out of touch with you.""

Romney, who worked in private equity, had wealth estimated at the time to be between $190 million and $250 million.

Such a strategy would be audacious for Trump, the first U.S. president in history never to have served in any public office or in the military prior to his election.

Yet the president, said Rove, has already started to lay the groundwork for this strategy: attacking policies like the Green New Deal as ""socialism,"" saying in his state of the union address that ""America will never be a socialist country.""

Rove implied that Trump was preparing to tear down whoever emerges as the Democratic Party presidential nominee by assaulting the policies they will propose to heal the deep structural economic inequality Americans are facing.

He gave the example of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who is expected to propose a Medicare-for-all health care system, a living wage jobs guarantee and abolishing tuition at public four-year colleges and universities, as well as endorse the Green New Deal that would cut carbon pollution and enact a job-creating public works program.

“I think (Trump) is counting on having an opponent that he can say, ‘Really? Free what, Bernie? Free college? Free health care? Guaranteed jobs? Guaranteed wage? Really? Green New Deal?'"" said Rove.

Speranza says she was the victim of an elaborate scheme by a con man. Andrew Vaughan/The Canadian Press

It started with a chance encounter in a coffee shop. He was charming and attractive, and everything he said mirrored her life.

The relationship developed into a romance but the seduction ended months later in apparent deception, an elaborate scheme by an alleged serial con man to whom she lost thousands of dollars.

“Everything he said to me was a lie,” says Andrea Speranza, an athletic 49-year-old with long brown hair. “I couldn’t understand how he could make love to me with the sole purpose of ripping me off.”

She has since found multiple alleged victims of Marcel Andre Vautour, a man with a criminal record, warrants for his arrest and several aliases.

His suspected victims say he targets busy career women between the ages of 45 and 50, leaving a trail of broken hearts and empty bank accounts across the country.

The Canadian Press has spoken with three women across the country who say they fell victim to his romantic schemes, and one man who was promised a job and ended up losing tens of thousands of dollars. Each alleged victim has positively identified photos of the same person.

Vautour did not respond to requests for comment by phone, e-mail or social media. None of the new allegations against him have been proven in court.

Speranza says she’s sharing her story to prevent more people from falling victim to his alleged scams.

“I want to stop him from hurting more people,” Speranza says. “I’m going to catch a criminal.”

Originally from Ontario, Speranza had a hardscrabble childhood.

Story continues below advertisement

Despite her hard upbringing, she graduated from university and moved to Nova Scotia, where she became a firefighter and one of the first female captains in Halifax.

Speranza has dedicated her life to helping others, running an award-winning camp that educates girls about emergency services careers.

When she met a man who called himself March Hebert last summer, they seemed like kindred spirits.

He told her a story about his difficult family life, saying his parents struggled with addictions. But he turned his life around, worked on offshore oil rigs, and purchased hundreds of acres in rural Nova Scotia to build a youth-at-risk facility.

“It was almost like everything about my life he was saying back to me,” Speranza says.

She says she now realizes it wasn’t a chance encounter. He targeted her, she says, using a well-honed script and asking pointed questions to develop a plan.

Story continues below advertisement

It started off very casually – she wasn’t looking for a relationship. But she was attracted to his desire to help youth and to give back to the community.

The five-foot-eight, 185-pound man with green eyes and a disarming smile eventually persuaded her to hang out. They went hiking and kayaking, and attended charity events.

He told her she was beautiful. She made him a better person. She was the best thing that ever happened to him. He was falling hard and wanted to spend the rest of his life with her.

“Everything was just perfect,” she says. “He was super accommodating and helpful and complimentary. Nothing I could say or do was wrong.”

Speranza now believes he targeted her to invest in his apparently fabricated youth-at-risk facility. When she instead offered to help him apply for grants, she believes he implemented an exit strategy.

He said he suffered from Crohn’s disease and one day he called her to say he’d been hospitalized.

She recalls him saying he was OK, but his wallet had been stolen. He needed money to buy costly medication. Then he had to go to Toronto to get his dog from his ex, and borrowed money for a train ticket and hotel room. He promised to pay her back.

She gave him $5,000.

“He ghosted me after that,” Speranza says, adding that he never repaid her. “I pride myself on good decisions. But I had no inkling whatsoever.”

She filed a police report and encouraged another alleged victim she met, Jean-Baptiste Joachin, to do the same.

The French citizen had met Vautour at a hostel in Quebec City and had travelled with him to Halifax, where he was promised a job on an offshore rig.

Joachin allegedly paid Vautour thousands of dollars for training courses. He also opened up Canadian bank accounts and credit cards, which Vautour had access to.

Story continues below advertisement

By the time Vautour skipped town last fall, Joachin had lost $30,000.

“He completely blindsided me,” Joachin said.

Halifax police spokesman John MacLeod confirmed the force has received two complaints of fraud based on case file numbers provided to The Canadian Press by Speranza and Joachin. But he said one incident had been closed while the second was deemed a civil matter.

Meanwhile, Speranza has discovered more alleged victims in other provinces through social media. They exchanged photos of the fraudster to confirm his identity, and have shared information about their cases.

Together, they’ve pieced together a string of allegations against Vautour across the country.

The Canadian Press has contacted police forces, court houses and justice departments in several provinces and has confirmed he’s a wanted man with a criminal past.

Story continues below advertisement

Documents obtained from Quebec’s Justice Department show Vautour pleaded guilty in 2005 to unauthorized use of credit card data and received a suspended sentence of one year’s probation.

In 2015, Quebec courts issued an arrest warrant for Vautour for fraud.

Victoria Law Courts confirmed a warrant for the arrest of Vautour was issued in 2001, and executed in 2009. He pleaded guilty in August 2009 to obtaining by false pretense and served a six-month conditional sentence in the community, followed by two and half years of probation.

Meanwhile, West Kelowna RCMP said they are aware of a recent incident and have a police file open on the matter. But spokesman Jesse O’Donaghey said specific details are not released until charges are laid by Crown counsel.

The Winnipeg Police Service confirmed Vautour is currently the subject of two arrest warrants. Const. Rob Carver said the charges pending from 1998 include possession of goods obtained by crime over $5,000 and personation.

Records from the Court of Queen’s Bench of New Brunswick indicate Vautour was charged in 1996 with stealing a Volkswagen Jetta in Dieppe.

Despite efforts by law enforcement, some alleged victims have launched their own investigations – even hiring a private investigator.

They’ve tracked down more than 20 phone numbers, 10 e-mail addresses and multiple physical addresses used by Vautour in Canada and overseas.

The alleged victims have even narrowed down his method.

They say he told them all variations on a theme: He had a successful career either working on offshore rigs, as a remotely operated underwater vehicle operator, or running companies.

He claimed he made it big investing in precious metals, cryptocurrency and cannabis, the alleged victims say. He said he owned a white convertible Porsche, a Ford F-350 truck, a baby blue Aston Martin. He even had pictures to show off his upscale possessions.

“He had money and was well-travelled,” says Jodi McMullin, a woman from the Okanagan area of B.C. who met him on a dating site in January 2018.

The whirlwind romance moved quickly, and they began planning a future together.

He told her he had been working in Vietnam and wanted to stay with her in Canada. But he had tax issues, and needed help cashing a business cheque.

The businesswoman offered to help him out. When she had doubts, he was always ready with an explanation.

“Every time I questioned him on something, he had a response right away,” she says. “There was never any hesitation.”

She provided him with her bank account number, and he deposited a cheque and then pressured her to transfer him the money, she says.

McMullin acquiesced and then left for a wedding in the U.S. When she returned, the cheque – which she later learned was a fake purchased online – bounced, she says.

“He ended up stealing just over $45,000 from me,” she says. “My trust is shot. There’s not a day that goes by that I don’t think about it.”

Speranza is determined to bring the man she knew as March to justice, launching www.stopthemarchmadness.com in the hopes of preventing romance fraud and encouraging more potential victims to come forward with anecdotes, stories and possible charges against Vautour.

PORT AUX BASQUES, N.L.—The Canadian Coast Guard is monitoring a tanker carrying eight million litres of refined petroleum and additional fuel that lost steering off the southwest coast of Newfoundland on Thursday morning.

The Jana Desgagnes sustained damage to its rudder southwest of Port aux Basques while en route to Montreal.

The coast guard said in a statement Friday that no pollution has been released and the vessel and its 17 crew are not in immediate danger.

Coast guard ice breakers arrived on the scene Thursday night and have remained in the area since then.

The vessel was about 27 kilometres from Cape Ray, N.L., as of Friday afternoon and is being watched by coast guard and environmental response specialists.

Ice conditions have slowed the recovery process but a commercial tugboat is en route and officials say the plan is to tow the vessel to port in Sydney, N.S.",Coast guard working to retrieve drifting tanker carrying 8 million litres of petroleum,Canadian Manufacturing,https://www.canadianmanufacturing.com/risk-and-compliance/coast-guard-working-to-retrieve-drifting-tanker-carrying-8-million-litres-of-petroleum-229552/
357,Politics,2019-03-21T04:07:00.0000000Z,"May said that the 10 elected Green Party members—federal and provincial—in Canada ... One of the things we’d like to do is create a council of Canadian governments, where there’s a seat at the table for policy-making for municipal governments ...","In conversation with The Journal after her Community Matters town hall meeting in Ashcroft on March 5, Green Party of Canada leader and Saanich-Gulf Islands MP Elizabeth May was asked whether the Green Party had more work to do to get away from the idea that they are mainly concerned with a single issue.

“Absolutely. Right now Canadians are looking around and thinking ‘I don’t feel like I want to vote “fill in the blank”.’ A lot of people are no longer as rooted in one party only. Growing up in Cape Breton, you used to feel that if someone’s parents were Liberals, they were always going to vote Liberal. It was almost genetic.

“That’s changing. People are looking around and thinking ‘Where do I want to put my vote? Who’s earned my vote?’ And almost by process of elimination people find themselves looking at the Green Party with new eyes. So we really have to explain ourselves. We’ve always had credible platforms, budgeted programs that are more detailed and fiscally sound than other parties. But a lot of people don’t know that, because the media coverage hasn’t shown us as the viable option. Now they are.

“Going into the 2019 election we do have work to do. We have an obligation to offer Canadians a viable alternative that answers the questions that they have.”

One of the main questions, May said, was to do with the idea that the Greens are against the economy; that if you care about the environment you are somehow against the economy. “That isn’t valid, but it’s been pitted like that for so long that people have a tendency to assume that’s going to be a problem in voting Green.”

May said that the 10 elected Green Party members—federal and provincial—in Canada have set a standard for being hard-working and ethical. “We’re open to ideas, and wanting to cooperate with others. That’s one of the key things that makes us different from other parties. We want to get the best of the ideas from everybody and work on them together.”

Asked if she wanted to predict how many Green Party candidates might be elected in October, May said it was hard to say. “When I look at the variables I see that a lot is in flux. I’m not trying to be deliberately cagey, but look at what happened to the NDP in Quebec in 2011. That could happen for us this time.

“In the Outremont by election [on Feb. 25] we placed ahead of the Conservatives and ahead of the Bloc Québécois. That’s the best showing the Greens have ever had in Outremont. It’s not the same as saying we’re poised to win Outremont, but for the first time the Quebec media began to say ‘Wait a minute, the Greens could win seats in Quebec.’ Once people begin to say we could win, that’s when voters begin to think ‘Oh, it’s not a wasted vote,’ and they begin to look at our candidates differently.”

May said that she had expected the subject of trains to come up at the town hall in Ashcroft, but not to the extent that it did, and that she had learned a lot. She added that conversation in rural New Brunswick regarding trains was a lot like the one in Ashcroft, although with more emphasis on the inadequacies of passenger travel.

“Where you find a lot of conversation around rail safety is in Montreal, where people are still reeling from Lac-Mégantic.”

Regarding the SNC-Lavalin affair, May said that she did not expect to see any further cabinet resignations, and wondered how much pressure had to be put on every remaining member of cabinet to get their signature on a letter of support for the Prime Minister. “There may be some unhappy [people] who signed that.”

May planned to fly to Ottawa overnight on March 5 to attend the Justice Committee meeting on March 6 to ask questions. “I have a lot of questions, and I hope we make some headway in answering the key bits where there’s missing information.”

May had nothing but praise for the ethics and intelligence of Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, both of whom have resigned from Cabinet over the SNC-Lavalin affair. “They’re both really impressive, and they’ve both done the thing that people with integrity will do. The extent to which that wasn’t anticipated by the old boys’ club that really runs things is fascinating.

“The gender analysis of this episode, when it’s all over, will be really, really interesting. The pressure … in Jody Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, there were a lot of men pressuring her. And Bill Morneau’s response to Jane Philpott leaving was ‘I know they were close friends.’ They’re both women. Women apparently, according to Bill Morneau, form little pinky-pacts where if one goes the other has to go too.

“No, that’s not the case. These are people of integrity, and in our political system it’s so rare for a cabinet minister to step out of that post.”

May said she was doing a lot of digging into the SNC-Lavalin affair, and had a lot of questions. “Where’s the evidence and analysis that would suggest that SNC-Lavalin could fold and all these people could lose their jobs? I don’t see it. There’s a lot to dig into here before I’ll feel as if I know what happened.”

Former Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick recently had a dire warning about the upcoming election, saying that he worried about the “rising tide of incitements to violence” and that he feared “somebody is going to be shot in this country this year during the political campaign”. May called the words a “diversionary tactic”, and said “I don’t think that’s Canada, and I think Michael Wernick’s testimony was unhelpful. Anything that gives oxygen to the idea that we’d take violent actions against people in private life I don’t appreciate, as a person in public life.

“I hope the election won’t be ugly. Of all the leaders of parties and of all the party strategies so far, it’s Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives who’ve been willing to play footsie with white supremacists, willing to run fear-based campaigns. We’ll see if the election unfolds in ways that elevate discourse, or move us closer to the kinds of things that go on in the U.S.”

May said that she is concerned about the potential for social media sites like Facebook to have paid-for advertising and the spreading of fake news designed to advantage one party over another. “Canadians, as intelligent and critical thinkers … I think the best defence against that kind of thing happening is to actually be prepared to be a watchdog. If they see something where they go back to the original media site over some claim that strikes them as unlikely, and it turns out it’s a manipulated propaganda site, they’re going to get on board a campaign that does #don’tbelievethisnewssite. Whatever it takes to say ‘We need to make decisions based on information from reliable news sources, not propaganda websites.'”

Current infrastructure funding, where the costs are split between the federal and provincial governments and municipalities, sees the federal government paying 50 per cent, the provincial government paying 33 per cent, and the municipality paying 17 per cent. The federal government considers a “rural community” to be anything under a population of 100,000, putting Ashcroft in the same boat as Kamloops. The difficulty that very small communities have in raising their 17 per cent share of infrastructure funding was pointed out to May.

“This is a big issue in my riding too,” said May. “A municipal government is still treated as if it’s a child of a province. Most of the critical infrastructure needs are found at [the municipal] level of government. One of the things we’d like to do is create a council of Canadian governments, where there’s a seat at the table for policy-making for municipal governments and First Nations.

“The access to a tax base is so small for municipalities compared to the provinces and feds. The split clearly isn’t sensible. You’re not going to find the tax base here to raise the kind of money that’s needed to gain access to infrastructure funding. But every community in Canada has a huge infrastructure deficit. There’s a better way to deal with it, and cost-sharing isn’t it.

“Infrastructure projects for small and rural municipalities should be 100 per cent federal. Just get it done, because it’s such a barrier when rural municipalities first have to beg the province and then find their 17 per cent. It’s not workable.”

May said that she had had a wonderful visit to the area. “The school, the theatre production of Shrek: I’ve been very fortunate to have had a lot of really great experiences of connecting with community. I visited the screwdriver factory and got my own personalized screwdriver with my name on it.

“Visiting Ashcroft, it’s clear that the number one asset of this community is the community spirit of talented people who love living where they live.

“Small communities are capable of doing amazing things, and Ashcroft is a great example of that. Really impressive.”

The event company introduced more consumers to wheat bran plates at this month’s Green Living Show at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre.,"This week, Toronto citizens learned that wheat bran is good for more than enhancing digestive regularity. An innovative Polish company displayed its disposable, biodegradable tableware made from unprocessed wheat bran at Toronto’s Green Living Show.

While an ordinary disposable plastic plate could take 500 years to break down, Biotrem’s tableware biodegrades through composting within a single month. They’re made from compressed wheat bran, a by-product of the cereal milling process. Biotrem can make up to 10,000 biodegradable plates and bowls from one ton of wheat bran.

The wheat bran tableware can handle hot or cold food, liquid or solids and is microwave-safe. From picnic spots to barrooms, the new biodegradable cups and plates could decrease landfill-bound garbage.

Wheat farmer and miller Jerzy Wysocki devised the process of turning wheat bran into plates. Every time he milled wheat, Wysocki found himself with excess wheat bran. Through trial and error, he discovered that mixing the bran with water, then heating and pressurizing it resulted in a sturdy material. He started what would grow into Biotrem with a single machine that he built on his farm.

Biotrem’s production plant in Zambrow can currently produce about 15 million biodegradable bowls and plates per year. They also make disposable cutlery, which combines wheat bran with fully biodegradable PLA bio-plastic. So far, Biotrem products are available in a dozen European countries, the U.S., Canada, South Korea and Lebanon.

Transform Events & Consulting, based in Charlottestown, Prince Edward Island, distributes Biotrem products to the Canadian market. The event company introduced more consumers to wheat bran plates at this month’s Green Living Show at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre. “As event organizers, we see just how much plastic waste is generated at events of all kinds, especially festivals,” said Mark Carr-Rollitt, owner of Transform Events & Consulting. “We are thrilled to partner with Biotrem to offer a well-designed, viable alternative to single use plastics.”

Make sure to also check out the variety of loose-leaf organic teas, including herbal, fruit, green, and black teas, as well as a wide range of tea accessories.","Located south of Katchewanooka Lake on both sides of the Otonabee River on the Trent-Severn Waterway, the Village of Lakefield offers many of the amenities of big-city life in a quaint small-town setting with a rich cultural heritage.

Dubbed the gateway to cottage country in Peterborough & the Kawarthas, Lakefield’s history dates back to the early 19th century. The village was originally founded by Colonel Samuel Strickland (brother of the iconic 19th-century writers Catharine Parr Traill and Susanna Moodie) when he settled in the area in 1831. Before becoming known as Lakefield, the village was previously called Nelson’s, Herriot’s Falls, and then Selby.

This is part three of a three-part series on Canadian getaways in Peterborough & The Kawarthas.

Originally sustained by the saw mill industry, Lakefield is now a prosperous residential community supported by small business, especially retail and tourism, along with international companies including SGS Research and Savage Arms.

A 15-minute drive north of Peterborough, a two-hour drive from Toronto, and a three-hour drive Ottawa, Lakefield’s historic homes and heritage sites, vibrant downtown, and close proximity to many local attractions make it an ideal destination for your next Canadian getaway.

Explore Canada’s literary history

The Village of Lakefield has a rich literary heritage, with two of Canada’s most important 19th-century writers — sisters Catharine Parr Traill and Susanna Moodie — having lived in the area, as well as one of Canada’s most esteemed and beloved writers, the novelist and short-story writer Margaret Laurence.

Born in England almost two years apart, Susanna and Catharine Parr Strickland eventually married, respectively, John Moodie and Thomas Traill. In 1832, both families emigrated to Canada where they settled on adjacent bush farms along the eastern shore of Lake Katchewanooka just north of Lakefield, with the help of their brother Samuel Strickland.

Their experiences as pioneers led to Catharine Parr Traill’s book The Backwoods of Canada (1836) and Susanna Moodie’s book Roughing It in the Bush (1852).

In 1840, Susanna Moodie and her husband moved to Belleville, but she returned to the Lakefield area for a month each summer to visit her sister.

The prior year, the Traills sold their farm and then lived at various locations in Peterborough County until Thomas Traill died in 1859. Following her husband’s death, Catharine had a cottage built in Lakefield with the help of her brother Samuel.

She called it “Westove”, after her husband’s home in the Orkney Islands in Scotland. Except for short absences to visit family and friends, it was Catharine’s home from 1860 until her death in 1899.

Located at 16 Smith Street in Lakefield, it is now a private residence with a historical plaque located beside the home.

One of Canada’s most esteemed literary figures, Margaret Laurence, spent the last 13 years of her life in Lakefield. She is best known for her iconic books The Stone Angel (1964), A Jest of God (1966), and The Diviners (1974).

Called the “First Lady of Lakefield”, Laurence lived at 8 Regent Street in Lakefield from 1974 until her death there in 1987. She also had a cottage on the Otonabee River near Peterborough, where she wrote The Diviners during the summers of 1971 to 1973.

Laurence’s Lakefield home is located near Christ Church (62 Queen St.), a small stone church built in 1853 under the leadership of Samuel Strickland. It now houses the Christ Church Community Museum, which displays important historical artifacts and displays including the Strickland family history and information about Susanna Moodie, Catharine Parr Traill, Margaret Laurence, and 19th-century writer and poet Isabella Valancy Crawford, who also lived in Lakefield.

Christ Church Community Museum is only open to the public in the summer, when Lakefield also hosts the annual Lakefield Literary Festival. The 25th anniversary festival takes place in 2019 from July 13th to 14th.

Her look ...,"Lady Kitty Spencer, Diana's niece, stuns in Canadian designer on HarpersBazaar.com cover – see the photo! By Sarah Walker

After Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan’s royal wedding last May, Lady Kitty Spencer received an unexpected surprise: She told HarpersBazaar.com that when she signed in to her Instagram account the next day, she was shocked to discover her followers had gone from 17,000 to more than half a million overnight!

The late Princess Diana’s niece has given an intimate and revealing interview to the publication, in which she discusses everything from her aunt to her taste in men. And to top it all off, she posed for the cover photo and related images while wearing a dress by Canadian designer Sid Neigum. His work has also been featured in publications like Vogue and Elle, and he's dressed the likes of Sophie Grégoire-Trudeau, Jennifer Aniston, Jada Pinkett Smith and MTV’s Jessi Cruickshank. It’s safe to say Kitty’s hit the big time!

“It was definitely unexpected. I thought I had someone else’s phone when I woke up the next morning,” she told the publication of the massive wave of interest after she was photographed at the Duke and Duchess of Sussex ’s 2018 nuptials, before joking: “I had to turn my notifications off because my phone was going to die… Can I still FaceTime my cat and put it on my Stories?”

There was a massive wave of interest in Kitty after Harry and Meghan’s nuptials. You’ll remember she arrived at St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle wearing an emerald green slim-fit dress with a gorgeous floral pattern and co-ordinating hat with netting. Her look, which also included a diamond choker lipstick and red lipstick, went viral and became the talk of royal watchers during and after the wedding.

But things didn’t quiet down after that – far from it. Later that month, Charles Spencer’s daughter was also announced as the new face of high-end jeweller BVLGARI. She was also spotted in an absolutely to-die-for Dolce & Gabbana outfit at the V&A Summer Party later in the year.

The model told HarpersBazaar.com she hasn’t gotten used to her new fame, and said she feels a sense of “not belonging.” She said it’s particularly prominent for her when she takes the runway with the likes of Monica Bellucci, Carla Bruni, Isabella Rossellini, Helena Christensen and Naomi Campbell – something she did in the fall of 2018 for Dolce & Gabbana.

“I do feel like I sort of snuck through the back door and no one’s noticed yet,” she said. “I keep thinking that this is potentially short term and a really exciting moment, so I’m trying to embrace it for what it is. And then when it does end, just being grateful because it was something I never imagined in the first place.”

Kitty said one thing that’s kept her grounded through her newfound fame is her upbringing and close family ties. She told the publication she feels “lucky” to have been raised in South Africa, where she enjoyed time outdoors and lived at a relaxed, serene pace.

Mary Greenwall, Princess Diana’s makeup artist, told HarpersBazaar.com that Kitty’s spirit is remarkably similar to that of her late-aunt: “Diana was so willing and open... as is Kitty. Just sort of free – there’s a sense of freedom with all of them. I think the sense of freedom is actually very important, that then they didn’t feel stifled by their upbringing and their circumstances.”

PHOTOS: Lady Kitty Spencer's best style moments

For now, Kitty told the publication she’d like to continue to focus on her career and on being a role model for young women. “I guess I’m doing these things on my own terms,” she said, particularly of maintaining a healthy sense of self. “I look after myself but I’m not obsessive or unhealthy. If a brand wants to work with me, and think their designs look good on me, then they can give them to me in my size.”

Love could also be in the cards. “I’ve been really lucky. I’ve always had really lovely, straightforward boyfriends,” she said. “Whenever anything exciting happens in my life, or sad, the serious boyfriends I’ve had will be the first to get in touch and the first to be supportive. I don’t see the appeal of going for anyone who’s too complicated or not trustworthy… The men that I’ve been with have been kind and still are. And it’s lovely because it’s like a greater form of friendship in a way.”

A new consortium of cannabis businesses is hoping to bring the country’s Indigenous ganjapreneurs together, with the goal of building the brand of Indigenous cannabis as a major player in the Canadian and global markets.

The National Indigenous Cannabis Consortium was launched at the recent National Indigenous Cannabis and Hemp Conference in Ottawa, where Indigenous cannabis companies and workers met to discuss how Indigenous businesses and entrepreneurs can compete in the burgeoning Canadian market.

“We need to consolidate in a consistent fashion that’s going to allow for everyone to be able to be part of the whole supply chain,” Roland Bellerose, director of the consortium, told MERRY JANE at the conference. “The Indigenous community across the country is huge, and each one’s going to set their own desires and aspirations about what they want to do.”

The finer details of the consortium’s plans have not been decided yet, as it builds its membership. Whether it means selling products under a formalized brand — roughly similar to California’s True Humboldt brand , a collective comprised of 200 farmers — or something more loosely-organized remains to be seen.

While Bellerose said it’s “impossible to answer” what the consortium will look like when it matures, he offered a thought experiment: “Imagine you’ve got a poster, and you’ve got 100 different brands on it, and they’re all Indigenous,” he said. “We’re not here to say there’s only going to be one brand.” Rather, Bellerose envisions something more like an umbrella association. He said it might hypothetically work as a branding that identifies that “it’s an Indigenous brand, and here’s all of the standards and certifications of the brands within the brand.”

Bellerose said that this kind of organization is entirely new in Canada, and there are none that he is aware of in the United States that focus specifically on Indigenous communities. “Maybe we’re trendsetters, maybe we’re going to set up a new model,” he said. “It’s still very, very much in its infancy.”

If it’s successful attracting participants — and it already has the support of some of the bigger names in the Indigeous community such as former Ontario regional chief Isadore Day, who is now the CEO of Bimaadzwin, an Indigenous economic development organization, as well as Seven Leaf, the country’s first Indigenous-owned licensed cannabis producer — the consortium could establish itself as a major player in the Canadian cannabis in both industry and political terms.

It’s still the early stages of Canada’s legalized cannabis industry, and the country’s Indigenous people are looking at the nascent market both skeptically and as an opportunity to prosper. So often in Canada, conversations about resources and agriculture have been fraught for Indigenous populations — made so by government policy that has historically been designed to separate the land needed for such agricultural pursuits and the Indigenous peoples living on it. This lingering historical memory looms over the issue of how Indigenous communities should respond to cannabis legalization.



There have long been complaints among Indigenous communities that the government’s legalization roll-out has inadequately consulted Indigenous communities. ""When you’re dealing with individual nations and treaty rights, there’s been so much in the Cannabis Act that hasn’t taken that into consideration,” said Jordan Brant, a resident of Tyendinaga who works with dispensaries on the so-called Green Mile, where dispensaries have flourished on Indigenous land. “While I was reading those regulations, that indicated to me that the federal government’s only position on cannabis with regard to Indigenous communities is that ‘we’d prefer they say no.’”

Early in 2018, while the Cannabis Act was working its way through the Senate, the Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples pushed to have legalization delayed for up to a year, citing the “lack of meaningful consultation” with Indigenous peoples.

“There was an alarming lack of consultation, particularly given this government’s stated intentions of developing a new relationship with Indigenous people,” reads the committee’s final report . In addition to asking the government to delay legalization for another year, they also asked that the government set aside 20 percent of cannabis production licenses for Indigenous operators. The government ultimately chose not to follow either of those two recommendations.

Those disagreements are not just between Indigenous peoples and the federal government, but also within Indigenous communities themselves. At the end of February, a protest turned violent outside a Mohawk police station in Akwesasne, Ontario, after tribal police raided a cannabis dispensary. The band council (an elected council that was granted authority by the federal government as part of the Indian Act in 1867, and which some Indigenous communities view as a colonial body) had not issued a license to the Wild Flower Cannabis Dispensary. But the Onkwehonweh Neha Kanonhseshne, also known as the Indian Way Longhouse, which represents the traditional form of governance that existed prior to colonization, had issued a license. Conveniently, they also owned that particular dispensary. After tribal police raided the dispensary, protests over jurisdiction and who authorized the raids turned violent (some protestors reportedly accused the band council of political motivations), and a police SUV was set on fire, according to local news reports.

There are many who want to see an Indigenous cannabis industry set up outside the reach of the Canadian government, and instead organized around traditional Indigenous production methods and self-governance. Some communities have flouted the government’s laws entirely, betting that the government will leave them alone. Last year, Jamie Kunkel, who owns a dispensary in Tyendinaga, a Mohawk territory east of Toronto, told me ( in a story for NOW Magazine ) that he wasn’t concerned with conforming with federal legalization, because in his interpretation, federal laws don’t apply on reserves. That sentiment was on display at the conference, when one woman who spoke, identifying herself in the Dene language as a clan mother, stepped up to the microphone and launched into a criticism of a panel comprised of government cannabis policy staff.

“Our plants cannot be controlled. Our plants grow out on the land… I hear a lot of talk about making money. in my language we were taught that we cannot profit from our medicines,” she told the panelists. “I’m here to remind the people that the plant you are talking about and want to legislate is our medicine, it is healing people. How are you going to heal our people with policies you are going to create that are barriers to our medicine? It’s almost like our plants are being put on the stock market.”

As she left the microphone, the room launched into a loud and sustained applause.



But at the same time, Indigenous communities and their leadership see cannabis as a massive opportunity. They see a chance to get in on the ground floor of an industry which could be a financial golden ticket for communities that want revenues and a measure of independence from government support. For some, legalized cannabis offers a chance to support their communities with sustainable economies based around a plant that has long been used as medicine. Others see a chance to set up a parallel cannabis industry, distinct from the federal government’s system. And others still see cannabis as a new front on which to exert Indigenous sovereignty.

Within that jurisdictional issue exists a space where Indigenous economic interests can be advanced alongside the interests of the Canadian state.

“I think the more important question that Canada faces, which we’ve heard everywhere in this country, is the jurisdictional issue,” said Bellerose. “But as an entrepreneur and on economic development, jurisdiction isn’t going to stop us from being able to move forward on many, many fronts.”

That conversation does not exist within a vacuum: the backdrop to the issue of jurisdiction over cannabis is the wider issue of sovereignty and nation-to-nation relations. It’s been a big talking point for the same Liberal government that brought about legalization, although they have regularly come under fire for not living up to those talking points.

Debates over cannabis regulation in Indigenous communities are in some ways microcosms of larger debates about the government’s ability, or inability, to consult Indigenous communities on a range of issues. This is a topic that has dogged the Trudeau government of late: last summer the government spent $4.5 billion to purchase a pipeline project that had been blocked by the courts principally because of a failure to consult with Indigenous communities. Later, in January, the government forcibly removed an Indigenous blockade set up to stop another pipeline project, and arrested over a dozen people. So when Indigenous communities talk about a lack of meaningful consultation on cannabis, they are also talking about what many in the Indigenous community perceive as a more generalized lack of consideration.

Some Indigenous leaders see cannabis as yet another front in a battle for sovereignty and rights in Canada. “When I think about cannabis, and economic development, and all the opportunities that it can bring to our communities, it makes me think of our chance to dream,” said Cherie Brant, a Mohawk and Ojibway lawyer, moderating a panel. “It’s going to start with a process. It has to begin with a process.”

“We are at a crossroads in terms of our historical existence here on Turtle Island, more specifically in Canada,“ said Grand Chief Joseph Tokwiro Norton, of the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake. “We have to take back our lives and we have to fight to continue to know our culture, our languages. I’m saying this because it’s a backdrop to what we need to do now and into the future… It’s all part of our resurgence, if you will, to continue to be who we are — very distinct, very knowledgeable.”

Cannabis fits into that discussion largely as a path to economic prosperity that would support reserve communities.

“We have to be our providers,” said Norton. “We have to really take advantage of whatever comes along, and if one of those areas is hemp and cannabis, then that’s what we do.”",Could the Future of Canadian Cannabis Be Indigenous?,Merry Jane,https://merryjane.com/culture/could-the-future-of-canadian-cannabis-be-indigenous

Although it was later brought out of administration by Canadian music store mogul Doug Putman, it still shut 27 branches including in Plymouth and Exeter. HMV had blamed a huge slump ...","The UK's retail sector is quaking as inflation and taxes mount and consumer spending slips. Plymouth is not immune. These are the firms that have caught a cold, or are beyond life support, so far in 2018:

Toys R Us - The advertising jingle sang of toys in their millions, all under one roof, but the huge outlet in Western Approach is now empty as the toy store chain became the first big casualty of the UK's retail meltdown. All Toys R Us stores nationwide are now closed or closing.

Bargain Booze - The off-licence chain Bargain Booze went into administration in April 2018 following a warning that earnings would be £5.2million less than expected. The chain, which has five outlets in Plymouth and another in Saltash, warned earnings for this financial year would be “below current market expectations”. But administrators were able offload the retail division to food wholesaler Bestway in a £7million deal.

Debenhams - Beleaguered Debenhams could shut floors in its Plymouth department store as it looks at solutions to the retail meltdown which has seen its pre-tax profits slump by 84 per cent and insurers cut back on suppliers' credit cover. The chain is understood to be looking to downsize at least 30 stores blaming “profound change” in shopping habits for woes.

House of Fraser - Troubled department store chain House of Fraser announced it will shut storeswhen a Company Voluntary Agreement was accepted by creditors on June 22, 2018. It initially said just 18 outlets would still be trading, but it has since ""saved"" three stores, after being taken over by Sport Direct honcho Mike Ashley, including Plymouth's. The company made a £43.9million loss in 2017 – blaming Brexit, terrorist attacks and increased online competition. Sales fell from £840.9million to £787.8million in 2017 – a drop of 6.3 per cent.

New Look - The budget retailer has had to weighs up “options” amid dismal sales figures and in April 2018 announced it could close 100 stores putting 1,500 jobs at risk.

Marks & Spencer - Retail bellwether Marks & Spencer, which has a huge store in Plymouth city centre, is closing 100 of its biggest stores, about a third of all those selling clothes and homeware, by 2022 after it reported a 62.1 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to £66.8million in the year to March 31, 2018.

Mothercare - The baby and maternity products chain issued a profits warning after like-for-like sales fell by 7.2 per cent during the 12 weeks to December 30, 2017. Mothercare has now decided to move out of Drake Circus mall, but will relocate to a unit more than double the size at the under-construction Plymouth Gateway Retail Park at Marsh Mills. The retailer is looking to shut anything up to more than 50 stores and its March 2018 trading update revealed total UK sales were down 5.6 per cent in the 12 weeks to March 24, compared with the same period in 2017.

Carpetright - The troubled retailer has been floored by painful losses and is preparing to close even more stores – and said things will get worse after Brexit. For the 26 weeks to October 27, 2019, the group made a loss before tax of £11.7million. Underlying earnings swung to a loss of £1.7million compared with a profit of £8.6million for the same time in 2017. Carpetright also said it was braced for a damaging dip in consumer spending and confidence after Brexit. In March 2018 it shut three Devon stores, but kept the two in Plymouth open.

Maplin - Electrical goods retailer Maplin collapsed into administration in February 2018 putting jobs at risk. The company, which employed 2,500 people in the UK and had a large store in Plymouth’s Cornwall Street, said the capital needed to prop up the business – and shield it against tough trading conditions – had proved “impossible to raise”. The store had a huge closing down sale in April 2018 and finally shut in Plymouth in on June 11. All stores in the group are expected to be shut by July.

Poundworld - The budget retailer went into administration in June 2018 after revealing dismal sales figures, putting 5,100 jobs at risk. Private equity-owned Poundworld shut its huge Plymouth store in New George Street in July 2018 after staging a ""closing down sale"".

Laura Ashley - Womenswear and home furnishings retailer Laura Ashley is to close stores after seeing annual profits plummet to just £100,000. The group – which owns 160 stores across the UK including in Plymouth, Exeter, Barnstaple and Truro – saw statutory pre-tax profits fall from £6.3million a year earlier as retail like-for-like sales slid 0.4 per cent amid “difficult” trading conditions..

H&M - Fashion giant H&M has said it is braced for further sales falls across its stores in 2018, including its Plymouth outlet in Drake Circus Shopping Centre.

Poundstretcher - Credit insurers aretightening terms for suppliers to Poundstretcher, a move which is generally seen as an indicator of concerns a retailer is about to go bust. Poundstretcher, which has a huge outlet at Plymouth’s Friary Retail Park, in Exeter Street, saw a £3.4million profit turn into a £3.5million loss in 2017.

Moss Bros - The men’s outfitters made a £1.7million pre tax loss for first six months of 2018 – and blamed the World Cup

The company – which has stores in Plymouth, Exeter, Falmouth and Truro – has warned over profits after hot summer weather and the World Cup “distraction” pushed the menswear chain’s profits into the red. Earnings show the retailer swung to a pre-tax loss of £1.7million for the six months to July 28, having posted a profit of £3.9million in the same period last year. The retailer said it was knocked by £1.2million in store impairments, in light of a “small number of underperforming stores“, and took a further £800,000 hit amid “reorganisation and employee-related costs”.

Game Digital - Profits at Game, which has two stores in Plymouth city centre, nosedived by more than a quarter – amid a tough market for consoles – leaving the retailer looking to revive its fortunes through the fast-rising e-sports sector.

Homebase - There are fears Homebase stores throughout the South West could be dragged into a second wave of closures that could see up to 40 of the DIY outlets shut – putting hundreds of jobs at risk. The DIY chain, which has 21 outles in the West Country including Plymouth, is sounding out advisers for a potential Company Voluntary Agreement (CVA), having already closed 17 outlets.

Topshop, Topman, Dorothy Perkins, Burton, Evans and Wallis - In May 2018 Sir Philip Green's Arcadia Group reported profits dipped by 42 per cent from £215.2million to £124.1million and sales fell 5.6 per cent in the year to August 26, 2017, sliding from £2.01billion to £1.91billion.

Sports Direct - Bargain tracksuit and trainer retailer Sports Direct blamed an £85million hit from its stake in Debenhams for dragging full-year profits down 72.5 per cent. The chain, which has a huge outlet in New George Street, Plymouth, said pre-tax profits plunged to £77.5million in the year to April 29, 2018 – from £281.6million a year earlier.

McColl's - Convenience store operator McColl’s has seen pre-tax profits nearly halve to £2.3 million in just six months during one of the “most challenging” period in the chain’s history. The firm, which has more than 10 outlets in the Plymouth area, saw its surplus drop from £4.5 million during the same period last year. The company blamed the decline, for the 26 weeks to May 27, 2018, in part on the collapse of wholesaler Palmer & Harvey, which disrupted its supply chain. It also impacted McColl’s like-for-like sales which fell 2.7 per cent in the first half of the year.

Saltrock Surfwear - The Plymouth and Exeter branches of the fashion chain were among five that closed, with 29 staff losing their jobs, after the firm went into administration and was instantly taken over by the national Crew Clothing Co Group. Saltrock was started in the 1980s but taken over by Plymouth Argyle's departing chairman James Brent's company in 2012.

Footasylum - Streetwear store Footasylum swung to a £2.5million half-year loss bemoaning a challenging trading environment.The premium sports chain, which opened in the mid-tier at Drake Circus Shopping Centre in 2016, has posted a pre-tax loss of £2.5million in the 26 weeks to August 25, 2018, compared with a £1.7million profit in the same period in 2017.

Paperchase - Stationery chain Paperchase suffered a mammoth fall in profits and had its credit insurance cover slashed in September 2018. The company, which has a flagship store in Plymouth’s Drake Circus Shopping Centre, is coming under mounting pressure after one of its main credit insurers reduced cover following the slump in profits. In March 2019 it entered a CVA and said it would close stores.

Superdry - Fashion chain Superdry has estimated profits will take a £10million hit and is blaming the weather – again.

The chain – which has outlets in Exeter, Truro, Newquay, St Ives and Plymouth’s Drake Circus Shopping Centre – issued a profit warning after it said “unseasonably hot weather” had impacted its autumn and winter sales. Earlier in 2018 it complained the Beast from the East snowstorm had hit sales.

American Golf - The Plymouth and Exeter branches of huge sports retailer American Golf will stay open after a late rescue package saved the company – though the troubled firm is shutting outlets across the country. Customer orders and gift cards are also protected after Europe's largest golf retailer was rescued from collapse in a deal which safeguards 900 jobs and will keep open the store at Plymouth Golf Centre, Elburton, and Exeter’s at Bishops Court Retail Park in Sidmouth Road.

Bonmarché - The budget women’s fashion chain saw profits tank dramatically. The company – which has branches across the South West including Plymouth's New George Street – watched at profits were nearly cut in half in the first six months of 2018 as weak consumer sentiment and lower footfall stung the struggling retailer.

B&Q - DIY giant B&Q is facing woe after seeing sales tank. The company’s owner, Kingfisher, warned there was ""no quick fix"" to its problems as it posted a slump in sales at the DIY chain in November 2018, and said it will exit its business in Russia, Spain and Portugal to focus on its core markets. New figures show B&Q in the UK saw a 2.9 per cent fall in like-for-like sales in the three months to October 31, 2018.

HMV - Music and movies retailer HMV went into administration for the second time in just six years in December 2018 putting 2,200 jobs at risk. Although it was later brought out of administration by Canadian music store mogul Doug Putman, it still shut 27 branches including in Plymouth and Exeter. HMV had blamed a huge slump in the UK’s CD and DVD market for making its situation ""unsustainable"". It blamed a “tsunami of challenges” facing the UK retail sector, and changing behaviour from customers.

It is the fifth time Kovrig has received a consular visit since he was detained by Chinese authorities in early December, but the first since he and fellow detainee Michael Spavor were charged with stealing state secrets two weeks ago.

Spavor has received four consular visits thus far.

The two have not had access to lawyers and receive one visit from Canadian officials a month.

The Canadian government says their detentions are arbitrary and warns Canadians travelling to China to do so with a ""high degree of caution"" because of the arbitrary application of local laws.

Canada is calling for the immediate release of both men.

Canadian officials have complained the two men are being held in retaliation for the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou under an extradition request from the United States.

Global Affairs notes the number of countries who back Canada's position on the matter including the United States, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Spain and Denmark as well as NATO and the European Union.

As part of the first such update in 20 years, the body that regulates judicial conduct has launched consultations as a way to gauge public sentiment on acceptable conduct for federally appointed judges as it seeks to update and streamline its guide: “Ethical Principles for Judges.”

“As society evolves, so do the ethical issues that judges sometimes face,” Chief Justice Richard Wagner said in a statement.

READ MORE: ‘Moral blameworthiness’: Judge in Humboldt Broncos case outlines reasons for 8-year sentence

While bedrock principles for judges such as integrity, independence and impartiality are not up for debate, the review focuses on six themes – some new, some in need of updating: Social media, public engagement, post-retirement, self-represented litigants, case management, settlement conferences and judicial mediation, and professional development.

“The work of judges has changed. Society has evolved. New and emerging ethical questions are before us,” the Canadian Judicial Council says in a background paper. “Reflecting this changing environment, council is reviewing the current ethical principles to ensure they continue to provide guidance for judges in a manner that reflects evolving public expectations.”

Public feedback is requested by way of an online survey in which respondents are asked to agree or disagree with a series of statements such as: “Judges should not identify themselves as judges on social media” or “Judges should not use social media to ‘like,’ ‘friend’ or ‘share’ about matters that could come before the courts, generate negative debates (political or others) or be the subject of controversy.”

WATCH: Semi-truck driver involved in Humboldt Broncos bus crash sentenced

Underlying many of the questions is to what extent judges should be socially reclusive and whether it’s fair or even desirable to demand a judiciary that is isolated and aloof from the kind of active if ordinary social engagement most Canadians take for granted.

“Judges, of course, have private lives and should enjoy, as much as possible, the rights and freedoms of citizens generally,” the guide states. “Moreover, an out of touch judge is less likely to be effective.”

The current document makes it clear that its aim is to provide ethical guidance and “shall not be used as a code or a list of prohibited behaviours.”

WATCH: Hamilton city council approves judicial inquiry over lost study

However, breaches could lead to disciplinary consequences under the Judges Act, up to and including the rare step of being forced from the bench. In November, for example, the council rapped a well respected Ontario Superior Court justice for accepting a temporary dean’s posting at an Indigenous law school – the kind of dilemma the revised guide should help to resolve. The matter, still before the courts, provoked angry criticism of the judicial council itself.

Mixing personal and public interests can also backfire, such as in the case of Frank Newbould, who resigned as a judge under a cloud over his participation at a community meeting to consider a land-claim settlement in an area in which he had a cottage.

“To an increasing degree, judges engage with the wider community to inform and educate the public about the role of the judiciary in maintaining the rule of law, and to participate in opportunities that allow them to become better informed about the communities they serve,” the council says in its background paper. “This theme considers the ethical challenges that this engagement presents.”

One emerging area of concern is the growing number of judges who return to law practice after retirement from the bench. That raises questions about whether they should be allowed to pursue job opportunities before retiring, or use their former position to further a post-bench business career. Another survey question asks respondents to express views on the statement: “In general, former judges should not argue a case or appear in court.”

The internet age also makes it easy for judges, like anyone else, to access information online, raising the question of whether they should avoid looking for material relevant to a matter before them.

And China recently announced a ban on Canadian canola citing “hazardous organisms” in ...","OTTAWA — At least one Canadian company has successfully bid on a contract with the Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank, a nascent multilateral institution based out of Beijing.

In 2017 Canada formally joined the bank, which funds infrastructure projects in Asia, and pledged to spend $256 million over five years on its one-per-cent shareholding — with Finance Minister Bill Morneau promising that Canadian companies would be able to benefit from involvement in projects.

Last fall, Finance Canada reported in a document tabled in the House of Commons that no Canadian investors or companies had gotten involved yet. With the deteriorating Canada-China relationship and the United States’s unwillingness to join the bank as a backdrop, Conservative politicians in Canada demanded a withdrawal.

But in conversation with the National Post, a spokeswoman for the bank, Canadian Laurel Ostfield, confirmed that at least one Canadian company, Hatch Consulting, has won a procurement contract with the AIIB. She said others, including a major Canadian firm — not SNC-Lavalin — are in the running for additional contracts. Hatch’s lead executive for China was not available for an interview this week.

The bank’s president visited Toronto last month to help “raise awareness” about opportunities. “There’s contracts, and we want more Canadian companies to bid on them,” Ostfield said. “Canadian companies have great skill sets, high quality, great reputations and we just invite them to really participate.”

There’s contracts, and we want more Canadian companies to bid on them

Canadian companies could’ve bid to work on projects funded by the bank even if Canada had not become a member. Membership provides other benefits to Canada though, Ostfield said, including a seat on a 12-member board of directors charged with strategy, policy and project approval. Although Canada’s share in the bank is small, this gives it some heft in decision-making.

But hovering over the AIIB are concerns about the potential influence of the Chinese government. The United States warned its allies against joining the development bank when it was announced in 2015.

From the American point of view, this is just another way the authoritarian regime is trying to extend and buy influence — like with the Belt and Road initiative, which has seen China invest hundreds of billions of dollars into expanding transportation infrastructure outside of its borders. As a counterbalance, the U.S. is partnering with Japan to fund its own set of infrastructure projects in the region.

Despite its generally friendlier attitude towards China, Canada has in recent months seen plenty of evidence of that country’s self-interest, and the blurry lines between private entities and Beijing’s communist party leadership. After Canadian authorities arrested a Huawei executive in December on behalf of the U.S., China detained two Canadian citizens, a move widely seen as political retaliation. And China recently announced a ban on Canadian canola citing “hazardous organisms” in seeds, not the first time a non-trade barrier has hurt the agricultural industry.

Ostfield is quick to point out that China was not the only country that supported the AIIB’s development. About 20 countries were involved in the early stages of writing its governance documents and by the time negotiations were finished, 57 countries had signed up as founding members. There are now 93 members in total, including Canada’s allies France, Germany and the United Kingdom.

“We’re not owned by any one particular country,” Ostfield said. The AIIB is similar to, approved by, and works with other institutions such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. “Canada historically has been very actively engaged in multilateralism. I think that them applying to be a part of AIIB and ratifying that is another step in that direction,” she said.

Asked whether perceptions about the Canada-China relationship or about the influence of Chinese authorities have caused trouble for the bank, Ostfield said there has certainly been “skepticism.” But she insisted the 200 or so people who work there — seven or eight of them Canadians — are focused on creating a first-class institution and seeing projects through, including, Ostfield offered as an example, bringing electricity to 2.5 million people in Bangladesh.

“At the end of the day, the proof is going to be in the pudding,” she said. “As we start investing in projects, and people see how our procurements run, and we are transparent, then for some that is what’s going to be required before they start to see that AIIB is an independent international organization.”

Bruce said the political issue engulfing the Liberals has “very little ...,"MONTREAL (Reuters) - SNC Lavalin Group’s chief executive said on Friday the company is looking at ways to protect its business in the event it loses a corruption trial that has created a political crisis for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

FILE PHOTO: Neil Bruce, president and CEO of SNC-Lavalin, poses in their head offices in Montreal, November 10, 2015. REUTERS/Christinne Muschi

An SNC-Lavalin board subcommittee is weighing the construction and engineering company’s options as it takes “steps to minimize the effect of any potential sort of bad outcome in a few years’ time,” chief executive Neil Bruce told Reuters in an interview.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations that top officials working for him leaned on former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to ensure that the construction company avoided a corruption trial. Trudeau has denied the allegations.

At the affair’s center is a request by SNC-Lavalin for a remediation agreement that would have enabled it to avoid a court case which, if lost, would block it from federal government contracts for a decade. SNC-Lavalin is facing fraud and corruption charges related to allegations that former executives paid bribes to win contracts in Libya under Muammar Gaddafi’s regime, which fell in 2011.

Bruce said SNC is now focused on defending itself in court, with little expectation that a remediation would become available. Any court decision which would likely be years away.

“We don’t want to be reacting too late or not early enough if the worst came to the worst,” he said. “We’ve got to be prudent and make sure that we position the company.”

Being blocked from federal contracts would raise the threat of job cuts among the company’s Canadian workforce of 9,000.

“If we were in a position where for whatever reason we couldn’t do work with a certain customer or in a certain country then we would plan all of that and make sure that our business development efforts and the work we were chasing and hopefully winning didn’t fall into that category. That’s part of the mitigation plan.”

Trudeau has often referred to the 9,000 potential job losses as a reason for helping the company, but Bruce told the CBC earlier this week that he never gave a specific number.

SNC wanted to take advantage of new legislation to pay a large fine rather than be prosecuted.

Bruce said the political issue engulfing the Liberals has “very little to do” with the Montreal-based company whose backlog of about C$15 billion ($11.17 billion) is expected to rise during the first quarter.

But politics impacted SNC’s ability to win new work in Saudi Arabia in December and January, amid tense relations between Riyadh and Ottawa. Saudi Arabia froze new trade with Ottawa in August after Canada demanded the release of jailed rights activists.

“Generally we would expect to win sometimes one in two, sometimes one in three,” he said. “And that actually went down to zero in a couple of areas.”

While the dispute has not impacted current contracts underway in Saudi Arabia, Bruce said SNC’s backlog in the country would taper off toward the end of the year if it didn’t win any new contracts in 2019.

The CEO also said an accelerated arbitration process around a delayed Chile project, which hit results from its mining unit in the fourth quarter, would likely not be resolved in 2019.",Canada's SNC Lavalin eyes ways to protect business amid political crisis,Reuters,https://ca.reuters.com/article/idCAKCN1R32TN-OCABS

But arriving just as Alberta heads into an election ...","In the final year of its existence, a private sector group that advocates in favour of carbon taxes is taking another stab at convincing Canadians.

Despite a recent spate of storms and floods whose violence scientists blame on climate change, anti-carbon tax politics seems to be in the ascendancy in many provinces.

Between that and a federal opposition that has described carbon pricing as a ""gimmick,"" the Ecofiscal Commission faces an uphill battle persuading Canadians during the year of a national election that could decide for or against the carbon tax.

The Liberals, of course, have imposed a national carbon tax that will be applied to any province that does not have a carbon pricing system of its own. The federal system, which is very similar to the existing one in B.C., will put a charge on carbon but give most of the money back to consumers in a rebate.

Inescapably political

The commission, which gets its money from private interests including some of the largest players in the Canadian petroleum industry, insists it is apolitical and non-partisan. But arriving just as Alberta heads into an election, the timing of today's report — framed as an antidote to carbon tax ""myths"" — is inescapably political.

Bev Dahlby, research director at the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy and co-author of the report, says the timing of the release just after the Alberta election call is a coincidence. The report's purpose, he said, is to educate residents in provinces that, unlike Alberta, have never had a carbon pricing system in place.

""The purpose of the paper was really to inform the people in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick, who will be subject to the federal backstop carbon price as of April 1st,"" said Dahlby.

""I'm hoping the paper will help people understand the nature of carbon pricing and why some of the alleged problems of carbon pricing are not valid.""

And while it is not aimed at Albertans or their election campaign, ""it can also help people in Alberta understand the issues around carbon pricing,"" he said.

Canadian Press More

As Dahlby points out, the oil and gas producing province has had a carbon tax in place for more than a decade, imposed by a Progressive Conservative government. Just two weeks ago, Canadian oil companies were promoting themselves internationally as coming from a place where carbon reduction is taken seriously.

But in the current Alberta election campaign, the United Conservative Party led by Jason Kenny has taken a strong line against carbon pricing, saying it will abolish the provincial carbon tax and require a referendum before imposing a new one.

Societal consensus

To most people in Quebec, the idea of strenuously objecting to economic measures that might save the world from climate destruction seems strange, says economist France St-Hilaire, vice-president of the Institute for Research on Public Policy, a Montreal-based think-tank.

""I think I would call it almost a societal consensus,"" St-Hilaire said of Quebec, which has had a carbon pricing system since 2013. ""It didn't cause any controversy. The political parties just sensed that is something the public expects that the government would be acting on climate change.

China tore up a bilateral trade deal with Norway and restricted imports of salmon from that country after Norway awarded the Nobel ...,"Chinese importers are unwilling to purchase Canadian canola seed at the moment, the group that represents the industry in Canada says.

Earlier this month, Chinese customs authorities revoked the sales licence for a major Canadian canola distributor, Richardson International. Officials said the move was related to ""dangerous pests"" such as fungi in the crop, an allegation the company has strongly denied.

Against the backdrop of escalating trade tensions with China, there is much speculation that pushing back against a major Canadian crop was an attempt to send a political message.

China tore up a bilateral trade deal with Norway and restricted imports of salmon from that country after Norway awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to Chinese political prisoner Liu Xiaobo in 2010.

""China always links its trade diplomacy with its foreign policy,"" said Meredith Lilly, the Simon Reisman Chair in International Affairs at Carleton University, and an associate professor on international trade.

""They've made this claim before,"" she said, referring to the allegations Canadian canola is somehow unsafe, ""because to not make one with a legal justification would be an outright admission that this is just about geopolitics.""

Regardless of China's true motivations, Richardson is no longer the only Canadian canola seller being shut out of the Chinese market. There are 18 members of the group that represents the industry in Canada, including Viterra Inc., Louis Dreyfus Company, Cargill Ltd. and Parrish & Heimbecker Ltd. All of them say their contracts to sell in China are just drying up.

""While there was some initial optimism that Chinese concerns with canola trade could be resolved quickly, technical discussions to date have not indicated an immediate resolution is possible,"" said the Canola Council of Canada (CCC). ""Canola seed exporters report that Chinese importers are unwilling to purchase Canadian canola seed at this time.""

Canola seeds can be crushed to produce an oil used in food and cooking. The ""can"" in Canola stands for Canada, since the specific variety of the plant known as rapeseed that has a bright yellow flower was invented by Canadian researchers in the 1970s.

A spokesperson for the canola group says that to their knowledge, oil and meal are not subject to the same ""challenges"" that the seeds are having in China.

About 40 per cent of Canada's canola seed exports last year went to China, worth about $2.7 billion. Canada also sent about $1 billion worth of canola oil to China, and about $500 million worth of canola meal, which is the name for canola seeds after they have been crushed and separated from their oil, leaving a product that is used as animal food.

Up until the recent disruption, Chinese demand for Canadian canola has been strong, the group says.

""We urge the government of Canada to continue to intensify efforts to resolve the situation,"" CCC president Jim Everson said.

Canada's Minister of Agriculture Marie-Claude Bibeau said China only recently agreed to have scientists assess the claim that they have found organisms in Canadian canola, after they claimed that about Richardson's.

""Officials from both countries will continue to engage in order to find a science-based solution to this issue as quickly as possible,"" Bibeau told CBC News on Friday. ""We are working closely with industry stakeholders on this matter, and we will continue to keep them informed as additional information becomes available.""

The sudden canola clash has sent prices for the crop plunging. For delivery in May, it has fallen almost $10 to $458 a tonne on Friday, only slightly ahead of the multi-year low of $455 it hit earlier this month.

Lilly said Canadian government officials should do their utmost to solve the dispute, but ultimately she suspects they may not have enough tools at their disposal to make that happen quickly.

""Canada does not have currently a great deal of levers to reverse this situation.""

Alberta Premier Rachel Notley weighed into the dispute on Friday, noting how important the industry is to the province she leads, and calling on the Federal Government to ""work very hard"" to resolve the issue.

""If they are unsuccessful at doing that, then all Albertans will be looking to the federal government to supply relief to our canola industry just as they would to SNC-Lavalin, just as they would to GM, just as they would to any other industry in the country that is in jeopardy because of … international actions outside of our border,"" Notley said.

Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe echoed concerns over the reports in a statement and said the provincial government remains hopeful that the federal government will continue to engage with Chinese officials on a technical level.

""We have also requested that the federal government elevate their engagement to a diplomatic level to rectify this situation as soon as possible.""

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called it an important issue on Friday when speaking with reporters.

""So, we're going to roll up our sleeves and work with the Chinese officials to demonstrate that canola should continue to flow safely from Canada to China,"" he said, adding the government is optimist it'll be able to make headway this year.",China has stopped buying Canadian canola seed,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canada-canola-china-1.5067307

We welcome new bloggers -- contact us for details ...","A friend travelling in Europe pleaded recently on Facebook for information to help her respond to a fellow tourist, an ""alpha male"" from the U.S., who was criticizing the Canadian health-care system. He claimed, for example, that he had seen statistics showing that 20 per cent of Canadians go to the U.S. each year for elective surgery.

We should brace for more such criticisms, as Senator Bernie Sanders and at least some Democrats promote what they call ""Medicare-for-All"" as a plank for the 2020 US elections. They view Canada's system as a possible model. As for my friend, I did some quick research and responded to her, as did a number of her other Facebook contacts.

Ignorantly wrong

The alpha male critic is simply and ignorantly wrong to say that 20 per cent of Canadians (seven million people) go to the U.S. annually for elective surgery. The Vancouver-based Fraser Institute is a right-wing organization known for its hostility to Medicare. It claims that 63,000 Canadians sought medical treatment in other countries in 2016. The Fraser Institute frequently writes ideological reports whose methodology is suspect, and several academics have said that this report is not accurate either. But even if it were, there is a big difference between 63,000 Canadians going to a variety of countries for health care, and seven million going to the U.S. alone every year.

Interestingly, a publication called the Fiscal Times estimated in 2016 that 1.4 million Americans would leave the country in that year for medical procedures. That is mainly because health care in the U.S. is so expensive. In fact, some employers actually encourage their insured workers to seek cheaper care elsewhere.

Yes, in some cases waiting lists in Canada are too long, particularly on elective surgeries for less serious conditions. But I can say that when I was diagnosed with a blood clot in my lower leg late in 2018, I saw my family doctor on a Wednesday, had an ultra-sound on Friday, and visited a specialist on Saturday. I was impressed. Also, our daughter recently had a baby and the medical and associated care was excellent.

Cost comparisons

I am not an expert on health costs, but a quick bit of research provides some interesting comparisons. A study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that in 2017 the US spent 17 per cent of its GDP on health care. Canada spent 10.5 per cent, and the average in comparable countries (Canada, Germany, U.K., France, Belgium, Austria, Australia and Switzerland) was 10.6 per cent. In dollar terms in 2017, the U.S. spent $10,224 per capita on health care. Canada spent $4,826, and the average among comparable economies was $5,280.

Contrary to common belief, there are publicly-funded health-care programs in the U.S. as well, for senior citizens, military veterans and others. Yet most people there have either to pay for services out of pocket, or to face hefty insurance premiums. The Kaiser study also found that spending in the U.S. public health-care sector is quite similar to that in other countries. It is the private sector that is so costly. There are numerous possible answers as to why, but surely high profits extracted from the system and the cost of advertising to compete for clients would be a big part of the reason.

Millions uninsured

And while under Medicare everyone in Canada has access to hospital care, doctors' visits and associated laboratory and diagnostic services, the same cannot be said in the U.S. The government's own National Center for Health Statistics reported that in September 2016, 12.3 per cent of Americans adults aged 18–64 were uninsured.

That was a big improvement over earlier years when more than 20 per cent of those same people lacked insurance. The Affordable Care Act (commonly called Obamacare) is the most obvious reason why more people came to be covered. But the Republicans are doing their best to reverse Obamacare so the number of uninsured may well rise again.

Life expectancy

I am not expert in health outcomes either but one statistic caught my attention. In 2015, the world's highest life expectancy at birth was 83.7 years in Japan. Canada ranked 12th at 82.2 years and followed countries such as Switzerland, Singapore, Australia, Spain, Iceland, Italy, Israel, Sweden, France and South Korea. The U.S. ranked 31st in the world with a life expectancy of 79.3 years, just after Chile and Costa Rica, and just ahead of Cuba, at 79.1 years.

Surely life expectancy is an important health outcome. If so, one has to ask why the U.S., which spends much more on health care than any comparable country, ranks 31st in the life expectancy of its residents.

From what I've seen on Facebook, my friend continues to enjoy her European vacation. I will be curious to know how her fellow tourist responded when provided with the facts.

During her undergraduate studies at Saint Mary’s University, Harris encountered only one Black female professor, and not seeing herself reflected in her university’s faculty left her feeling alienated and undervalued.

Scholar Isalean Harris says it's imperative for Canadian universities to improve racial equity among faculty to ensure diversity of thought and to create more welcoming environments for racialized students. ( Taryn Grant / Star Halifax )

“I found it problematic,” she told the Star in an interview. After finishing a degree in political science, she decided to look more closely at the problem she’d identified and figure out why, despite a 30-year-old federal mandate for equality in Canadian universities, it existed. “I really wanted to investigate it,” Harris said, “especially since I would always see statements about the university’s commitment to employment equity and improving diversity and inclusion on job postings.”

Article Continued Below

Her investigation became a thesis titled Where are the Black female faculty? Employment equity policy failures and the overrepresentation of whiteness, which earned her a master of arts degree in January 2019. “I found, within Canadian academia as a whole, there is an acute underrepresentation of women of colour faculty across Canadian academia,” Harris said. She narrowed her focus to two schools in Halifax, using data that the schools themselves had collected on whom they employ. She chose the two largest universities in the area: her own school, SMU, and Dalhousie University. Even though she had some sense of the racial inequity in academia before starting her research, Harris said the work was eye-opening. The data showed her that representation of visible minorities was “well below” labour market expectations, but it was impossible to parse out the numbers for Black women, specifically, because they weren’t being identified in the schools’ data.

That told her that the way the schools were collecting data needed an upgrade. In addition, Harris interviewed Black women with tenured positions at different universities across Canada about their experiences.

Article Continued Below

She said it was difficult to find interviewees because there were so few Black female scholars to approach — something that Harris said underscored the exact issue she was investigating. As her thesis describes, Harris’s interviewees each faced unique challenges in their academic careers, but “their experiences appear to be rooted in similar systemic, anti-Black processes, procedures and attitudes.” Hearing their stories took a toll on Harris. “Especially as I considered myself to be an emerging scholar, and to know that academia is a space that I would like to believe allows a space for me or welcomes me … it was kind of difficult,” she said. Harris wants universities to update their equity policies to spark a cultural shift. “It is imperative for the university to improve representation so that we have representation of thought, representation of analysis so that we can really understand the root causes to a lot of our social problems,” she said. There’s evidence that policy change can be effective; Harris pointed to the federal Employment Equity Act, which since 1986 has mandated employers to correct “conditions of disadvantage” for four marginalized groups: women, Indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities and members of visible minorities. “It has worked at significantly improving the representation of white women,” she said. But added, “Not all women are white.” A more effective set of policies, Harris said, would consider intersectional identities — not four separate categories but a multitude that represent the ways those categories overlap or intersect. Harris was recently invited to present some of her findings to Dalhousie Senate and make recommendations on their equity practices. Benita Bunjun, a professor of social justice and community studies at SMU and Harris’s thesis supervisor, said the attention and traction Harris’s work is receiving “is very unique” for a master’s student. She said it’s a sign of the importance of her research. “It should be seen as a gift on a platter to both of these universities,” Bunjun said. She said it offers Dalhousie and SMU a “microscopic look at where we’re at — what’s the current status of our failures around equity hiring.” When the Star asked Dalhousie for a response to Harris’s assertion that its equity policies are inadequate, spokesperson Sarah Dawson said in an email, “Ms. Harris’ thesis contributes critical perspectives to academic work exploring the experience of diverse faculty and practices of racialized academic appointments.” Dawson said there is “a lot of online information” about the work the school is doing to address employment equity. She highlighted a few links to the Dalhousie website, including a Diversity Faculty Award and a 2014-18 strategic plan report. “There’s work to be done, and we are making strides to ensure Dalhousie is a place where everyone feels that they belong and have full opportunity,” Dawson said. The Star also asked SMU for a response to Harris’s critique. SMU spokesperson Cale Loney noted in an email that the school’s collective agreement with full-time faculty contains a clause “to improve the employment of women, visible minorities, persons with disabilities and Indigenous peoples.” Loney added that “other practices the university has undertaken include equity training, representative search committees and outreach/targeted advertising of positions. Harris said her thesis work will culminate when she presents some of her findings at SMU on Mar. 29 — an event that’s open to the public. “I don’t know if I intend to continue specifically with this work in research,” Harris said, pointing to the toll it took on her. What’s next is “taking the knowledge that I have and moving it forward into broader conversations about why representation is important.” Taryn Grant is a Halifax-based reporter focusing on education.

What are the options to strike at Canadian identity? How could China most severely wound the country’s self-esteem?

It cannot likely put together a better Olympic hockey team. What else is iconically Canadian? The North Pole? Chinese influence in the Arctic is tempered by Russia’s. What could Beijing do, really, to disrupt Tim Hortons’ supply chain? Surely its agents have no compromising material on Celine Dion.

But there is another heel on the Canadian Achilles, a plant so distinctively and proudly Canadian that it represents a diplomatic, economic and symbolic nexus of vulnerabilities even greater than the sugar maple.

News this week of a Chinese ban on new orders of canola seed is not only so potentially damaging to the Western Canadian economy, but so insulting to canola’s origin story in Canadian wartime initiative and frontier agricultural science, that the Chinese could hardly have aimed the dagger closer to Canada’s cultural heart.

Fears of Chinese industrial espionage and controversy around telecom giant Huawei, including Canada’s detention of company executive (and daughter of its founder) Meng Wanzhou, have dented China’s self-image as an imperial technological powerhouse of the future economy.

China’s new claims of finding “hazardous organisms” in canola seed could have a similar reputational effect on this jewel of the Prairies, once nicknamed the Cinderella Crop for its rags to riches narrative arc — from rough unpalatable rapeseed oil used to lubricate wartime naval steam engines, to the delicate, sunlight-golden, low-fat cooking oil that derives its name from the country Canada.

And the Chinese love canola oil. The annual export market from Canada to China is nearly 5 million tonnes, representing 40 per cent of Canada’s market for the crop and worth $2.7 billion. When crushed, the meal is good for animal feed, and the oil is great in a wok. Revenge is literally delicious, for man and beast alike.

Canola is a Canadian “success story” that has created a “terrific number of jobs,” as close to 50 per cent of the Canadian harvest is processed domestically, Jim Everson, president of the Canola Council of Canada, told the National Post.

He said China has identified specific quality issues on the receiving end that were not detected by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency on the exporting end, so it is “critical” that they sort this out in the coming months, as farmers decide what to plant next year.

The fundamentals of bilateral trade in canola are strong, he said, with a rising Chinese middle class demanding more, and Canadian production increasing year over year.

It is almost as if another factor is in play, something deeper and metaphorical.

Like many Canadian heartstring tuggers, the history of canola is a tale of foreigners doing well on the prairies against all odds.

Canola is a kind of rapeseed, which itself is from the brassica family of sprouts, cabbages and broccolis. Rapeseed came to Canada, as the legend goes, in an envelope of seeds mailed in 1936 from a friend in Poland to Fred Solvoniuk in Shellbrook, Saskatchewan. He shared with his neighbours.

The descendants of these seeds became the first rapeseed low in unhealthy erucic acid, one of two key considerations in its engineered evolution toward a food crop.

Another line, known as “Argentine,” was introduced to Canada in 1940 on a freighter from South America, even though it probably came from Europe, according to a history of rapeseed by Ottawa author Brewster Kneen.

But at the time, Canadian production was small, only on experimental farms, in trials that showed it could grow in Ontario and the West.

Before the Second World War, Canada was primarily importing its edible oils, like palm, coconut or cottonseed. But the war closed those markets, and simultaneously drove up the market for rapeseed oil in naval steam engines.

Rapeseed was not the obvious solution for the former problem, or for diversifying Canada’s reliance on wheat. It was black, and the oil an unappetizing green. It looked like the kind of thing you put in a boat’s engine. Even worse, it’s meal was high in glucosinolate, sulphur compounds that inhibit growth, so it could not be fed to livestock.

It is a rare seed plant that inspires national pride

Nevertheless, with a guaranteed price from the government, massive amounts of rapeseed were planted for the war effort, and a fledgling science took root. Though Canada was better known during the Second World War as the Aerodrome of Democracy, it was also its lubricant.

By 1948, rapeseed production spiked to more than 30,000 hectares, falling off to nearly nothing two years later, as the demand for engine oil plummeted. The real spike happened in the 1950s and took off in the 60s. In 1967, federal industry ministry formalized its support in seeking an “expanding market.”

It was a national project, pushing rapeseed from Saskatchewan experimental farms to the tables of the world. It also needed a better name.

Reflecting on this time 25 years later, Mac Runciman, first president of the Rapeseed Association said: “There were a few growing pains because the group was bringing together people who had never worked together before. For the first time, crushers heard producers’ laments and producers learned how the product they grew was marketed.”

In 1974, the development by food scientists Baldur Stefansson and Keith Downey of a kind of canola that was both pleasant to eat as oil for humans and meal for animals was boosted by a coordinated marketing push for this new wonder-crop, named for Canada, the country that created it.

In 1978, the Canola Council of Canada registered the trademark “canola,” which it holds to this day.

Thus did a crop that was in limited use for thousands of years in Asia and Europe mainly as fuel, become first a key part of a global war effort as a mechanical lubricant, then an icon of a healthy modern low-fat diet, and an expression of Canada’s newfound self-sufficiency.

It is a rare seed plant that inspires national pride, and rarer still for foreign grain purchasing decisions to feel insulting. But already the affair is feeling like a comedy of manners, with Canada taking its stereotypically apologetic stance.

Responding to China’s ban Friday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said simply, “We’re going to roll up our sleeves and work with the Chinese officials to demonstrate that canola should continue to flow safely from Canada to China.”

EDMONTON—Alberta’s election could be a blow or a boon to Justin Trudeau’s federal Liberal government, depending on who wins.

Her primary opponent right now is Kenney, a former minister in Stephen Harper’s federal cabinet, who is leading his newly minted conservative party — formed when Alberta’s Progressive Conservatives merged with the right-wing Wildrose Party — into its campaign debut.

While Notley has been publicly amicable with Trudeau for the most part, the two butted heads in the fall before the federal government committed to buying the Trans Mountain pipeline with provincial support.

Notley and her progressive-leaning party came to power overnight four years ago, unseating a 44-year Progressive Conservative dynasty in a surprise victory dubbed the “orange crush.” But with oil prices low and the economy still sputtering, the party is being hammered by those who say its policies have hindered economic growth and Notley hasn’t worked hard enough to get a pipeline to tidewater built.

Criticizing Trudeau has already become a key point at every stop on the UCP’s campaign trail. But the new party is not without controversy, having suffered several blunders involving candidates, including Calgary-Mountain View hopeful Caylan Ford, who stepped down this past week after messages surfaced of her expressing sympathy with white nationalist views. Kenney’s campaign is also currently under investigation for allegedly running a “kamikaze” candidate that accepted illicit donations to propel him to his party leadership win in 2017.

“So if that message doesn’t resonate here in Alberta, then it suggests that there is an opening for Trudeau to win back some of the support he might have lost over things like pipelines.”

“If I’m the federal Liberal party, a good result for the New Democrats in this province at least gives you a hope of retaining the seats that you currently have. Because the Kenney campaign is spending half its time, I think, railing against the New Democrats provincially and then the Trudeau Liberals federally,” Wesley said.

It might not be that simple, however. Wesley noted some progressives could support Notley’s policies and leadership, but not vote for Trudeau because of his handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair, for example.

A Notley victory on April 16 would not necessarily bode well for the federal NDP, either, as federal party leader Jagmeet Singh has butted heads with Notley on pipeline and energy issues.

While Singh might ask a victorious Notley for help campaigning, he might not get it.

“It’s not unusual for New Democrats that have been at each other’s throats to say no to that kind of thing,” Wesley said.

“Even if (Notley) wins, it doesn’t mean that the Singh New Democrats have got coattails to ride on. Because they might not extend those coattails to them.”

The Alberta Liberal Party is almost nonexistent, with only one seat in Alberta’s legislature.

Wesley compared current-day Alberta to early-2000s Manitoba, when voters who supported the NDP provincially voted Liberal federally. He said a lot rides on the charisma of the party leaders.

A Kenney win, on the other hand, could be big for the Conservative Party of Canada and its leader Andrew Scheer.

Kenney has hammered Trudeau over pipelines and has vowed a legal challenge of the federal carbon tax if elected.

“(The CPC) have got a huge ally kicking on the Trudeau government heading into the federal election in the fall. A man with a megaphone and access to a public purse and government advertising, that could really be a thorn in Trudeau’s side,” Wesley said.

Mount Royal University political science professor Lori Williams said other provinces will watch Kenney’s anti-carbon tax campaign closely.

She said Kenney is part of an attempt to form an alliance between federal and provincial conservative leaders, including Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe and New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs.

“(Kenney) is not going to bring a lot of charisma or likability to the game, so how much impact that’s going to have federally, I don’t know,” Williams said.

Alberta mayors have lauded the federal budget released this past week, which Williams said could help turn some city-dwelling progressives from NDP to Liberal votes.

For the most part, however, she sees Alberta as an easy win for the federal Conservatives, who already have all but five seats in the province.

“Justin Trudeau is colossally unpopular in Alberta right now. He seems to be the focus of all kinds of anger about things that don’t connect to what he’s actually done or failed to do,” Williams said.

“That’s where the anger is going, and Jason Kenney is going to, of course, try to capitalize on that.”

She said federal politics influence Alberta elections than the other way around, as evidenced by Albertans’ anger over Ottawa’s failure to approve pipelines.

While Notley has a “pretty strong record for developing a national consensus,” she said there are legitimate questions to be asked about whether Kenney could do the same.

Albertans are also prone to vote for one party provincially and another federally.

Wesley said Edmontonians, in particular, think differently about the two races, in the sense that they worry more about public services in provincial elections because so many residents are public servants or have friends and family members who are.

“You may like federal conservatism because it offers you a certain suite of outcomes, but not like provincial conservatism because it means things like cutbacks to services,” he said.

“The fact that in 2015, within a period of six months, the province went starkly conservative at the federal level and majority New Democrat in terms of seats, suggests that Albertans think differently about federal and provincial politics.”

In general, he said, voters in Alberta and across Canada don’t get enough credit for making educated choices.

“They’re not blind partisans in a way that we see in other countries. They’re actually discerning,” Wesley said. “A lot of them know the difference between what provincial governments are responsible for and what federal governments are responsible for, and they also are discerning when it comes to what kind of leaders they want to represent them. And that will differ greatly on the federal and provincial level.”

Alberta’s provincial election is scheduled for April 16, while the federal election is slated for Oct. 21.

More reading,"A downturn may be on the way, heralded by the first yield curve inversion since 2007. A closely monitored indicator of the economic climate, the spread between decadal and quarterly treasury rates has finally flipped, causing alarm bells to ring in the U.S. markets, with global implications.

Following last fall’s mass sell-off, falling consumer activity, and warnings signs from the real estate sector, and all of this while beset by trade war machinations, Eurozone worries, and a protracted Brexit, it would appear that the global economy’s fears may be coming home to roost. Below are two key strategies to consider when holding stocks through a possible widespread market downturn.

Get defensive and resist the panic

While there is a Canadian yield curve as well, its inversions are less accurate at predicting a recession. One of the best stocks on the TSX index that looks just about ready made for a U.S. yield curve-predicted recession would be Bank of Montreal (TSX:BMO)(NYSE:BMO). In fact, any investor looking to stabilize a portfolio with a solid stock need look no further than the likes of BMO.

While Canadian banking contracted by 2.5% in the last 12 months, BMO returned 4%, making it an outperforming stock, though not by an enormous margin. Still, margins are far from huge in Canadian banking, with even the biggest six banks only inching ahead. Indeed, even an expected 3.6% annual growth in earnings is considered an acceptable outlook in this sector at the moment.

where BMO really excels is in its track record: its one-year past earnings growth of 24.6% is more than double the banking average for the same period (+10.5%). Meanwhile, a clean balance sheet and a decent dividend yield of 3.97% join attractive valuation (see a P/E of 11.1 and P/B of 1.5) to add up to one solid defensive play.

Know what you’re holding and stay invested

A good stock to hold through a recession would be that of any big utilities or energy company — in addition to a Bay Street banker, or course. One such stock would be Suncor Energy (TSX:SU)(NYSE:SU), an example of the “too-big-to-fail” variety. With a five-year average past earnings growth of 9.1% it might be what you’d call “high growth,” but its solid market share in a defensive sector make it a sturdy choice.

With a decent balance sheet, it’s a fairly low-risk play, and with fair valuation (indicated by a P/E of 22.3 times earnings and P/B of 1.6 times book), shares of Suncor Energy would, at worst, be a neutral influence on a portfolio’s overall health. Meanwhile, a dividend yield of 3.72% and 20.6% expected annual growth in earnings is solid for an energy stock on the TSX index.

The bottom line

Europe as an economic flashpoint has been a concern for some time, but things may come to a head this year, compounding any possible North American business downturn, with ongoing trade concerns adding to the mix; either way, it may be prudent to limit exposure to the E.U. (and to Britain, if it suceeds in breaking away from the monetary and political union).

It's hard to find anybody of note who is even vaguely supportive of them. Sexism is still obviously persistent in politics and ...,"A lot of things have changed in this country since Brian Mulroney was its Prime Minister from 1984 to 1993, namely that it's no longer OK to call a female politician a ""little girl""— unless of course she is a little girl.

Stranger things have happened. In 2012, a 3-year-old boy named Bobby Tufts was appointed mayor of the tiny tourist town of Dorset, Minn., when his name was drawn from a hat at a town fair.

Amanda Simard, however, is not 3 years old, nor was her name drawn from a hat. She is an elected official and an adult.

Unfortunately Brian Mulroney didn't treat her like one on Sunday. The former PM participated in an interview on Radio Canada's Toute le monde en parle, where he went to bat for Ontario's Francophone Affairs Minister, Caroline Mulroney, a.k.a. his daughter.

""Caroline is always there to defend the interests of francophones in Ontario,"" Brian Mulroney said on the program in French.

He said this because last year the Ontario Progressive Conservatives came under fire for eliminating the province's French language commissioner and for cancelling plans to build a French language university.

Simard, herself a representative of a heavily French-speaking riding, was so displeased with these cuts, she left the PC caucus to sit as an independent. It was an action some Canadians regarded as brave and principled.

Brian Mulroney, presumably, was not one of them. In the interview in question he described Simard like this: ""la petite fille qui a démissionné est partie."" Translation: ""the little girl who resigned has left.""

As far as sexist barbs go, it's certainly an odd one, considering that Mulroney made it in a direct attempt to defend his daughter — a powerful female leader who no doubt has come up against similar sexist stupidity during her time in office, and who no doubt wasn't a fan of it.

It's hard to believe that Caroline Mulroney is pleased with her dad right now, whose remarks suggest he thinks she is as much a little girl as Simard is; a little girl who needs her father to fight her battles in the media.",Emma Teitel: Brian Mulroney should leave politics to the ‘little girls’ of the world who can handle it,The Hamilton Spectator,https://www.thespec.com/opinion-story/9229576-emma-teitel-brian-mulroney-should-leave-politics-to-the-little-girls-of-the-world-who-can-handle-it/

I’ll fill up at the next polling station.","I don’t know about you, but I fill up my tank, or begin to squint with nervous suspicion, when the fuel gauge says it’s only a quarter full.

The only indication we have of where the prices of gasoline and diesel will be in the near future, or the future’s future, is dependent on information supplied by the Energy Information Administration (EIA), a subset of the U.S. Department of Energy. The data provided is used by traders, analysts, and speculators worldwide. Without this weekly information, price projections would be more accurate if they were prepared by a professional dart player.

Key components in the weekly EIA reports are inventory and demand levels, as well as refinery runs. The extensive and comprehensive data contained in these reports is mandated by the U.S. government and released a day after the American Petroleum Institute (API) publish its data, which is voluntarily provided by the oil industry and is looked on with suspicion by traders, as the data may be, from time to time, looked at as self-fulfilling prophesies.

We criticize the U.S. for all manner of what we superiorly judge as indiscretions, but when it comes to energy data provision and energy project planning and implementation, they are beyond any form of second-guessing.

Canada, on the other hand, is a second-stringer in the energy game. Sure, we have the third largest proven crude oil reserves in the world or, so we are told. But getting it out of the country is another question for yet another day, and the day after that, and so on, only to be answered by the politicians – or the bevy of environmental evangelists.

Unlike the U.S., neither the Canadian government or Canadian version of the oil industry provide consumers in the private or commercial

sectors with any information on domestic inventories of crude or refined products.

In the U.S., if a refinery or pipeline goes down, state and federal authorities must be informed as to the reason for the incident, how it will affect consumer supply, and when service will be restored. In Canada there are no such rules in place. If a station runs out of gas, all you have to do is call a newspaper or radio station and try to get an answer. Forget calling an oil company or your local MP for enlightenment.

Back in the U.S., there are 143 refineries — and the government just tells them if they want to keep on refining and selling their gasoline and diesel then send us your supply and demand statistics. Here in Canada, we have all but 13 refineries which, if Husky and Shell have their way, will soon be reduced to 11.

How hard can it be for the Trudeau government to order the oil companies to provide the same information?

At the Federal level, Justin Trudeau stated ""We are a country of rule and law"" when asked about intervening in the extradition of Huawei CFO Weng Wanzhou after U.S. President Trump baldly stated he would intervene in her case if it would help the U.S.-China trade negotiations. It would seem Canada is being used by the U.S. administration to gain a trade advantage.

Yet, Trudeau had no qualms at all about intervening in the SNC Lavalin prosecution. Going against the ""rule and law."" His rational is he was saving jobs. Just last week China has banned the import of Canadian Canola. Experts say the Chinese ban has little to do with the stated reason and more to do with the Weng Wanzhou case. How many jobs will be lost due to the ban on Canadian Canola?

The Premier Of Ontario is not far behind in the say one thing and then do another when it suits him. Back in 2013 -2014, then Toronto Councillor Doug Ford filed a complaint with the Office of the Independent Police Review Director regarding then Toronto Chief of Police Bill Blair and Andrew Pringle, a member of the Toronto Police Services Board. Mr. Ford's implication is any friendship between the two would hamper their ability to differ on issues regarding the Toronto police.

Ford family friend, Ron Taverner, showed sense when he withdrew his name for the post of Commissioner of The OPP. Premier Ford, if Mr. Taverner had not withdrawn his name, would have had a family friend in charge of the OPP. The same OPP which is the law enforcement agency charged with investigating any wrongdoing by the Provincial government. That sounds like a conflict of interest to this voter, seasoned with a healthy portion of hypocrisy.

Then, there is our municipal politicians including the Mayor. Each and everyone has identified traffic congestion as an issue in Vaughan during the 2018 campaign and the 2014 campaign and yet little or nothing has been done to remedy the problem. How many times in recent weeks have there been letters in the Citizen complaining about traffic light timing in Vaughan? This would probably be one of the most easily studied areas of traffic movement and yet no heed is being taken of the complaints. Road construction is seemly endless. Do politicians not drive around and see the problems or is it they are wearing blinders?

I think Alan Dershowitz, the U.S. lawyer and civil libertarian, summed up the attitude of voters when he noted:

Britain and other countries were also retaliated against over their ...","TORONTO — China has stopped all new purchases of Canadian canola seeds in what some see as retaliation for Canada's arrest of a top executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei.

The Canola Council of Canada said late Thursday exporters are reporting Chinese importers are unwilling to purchase the seeds at this time.

In 2018, China bought about 40 per cent of Canada's canola exports for a total of $2.1 billion.

Guy Saint-Jacques, a former Canadian ambassador to China, said Canada's government now needs to retaliate and should expel any Chinese athletes training in Canada for the Beijing Winter Olympic Games in 2022.

""We are going to lose billions in dollars in trade and it's time to show our displeasure,"" Saint-Jacques said

Earlier this year, Beijing suspended canola imports from Canadian-based Richardson International Ltd. for what one Chinese official alleged was the detection of hazardous organisms in the company's product.

But David Mulroney, Canada's former ambassador to China, said the blockage of Canadian canola is ""absolutely related"" to the Huawei arrest.

Relations between both countries have been tense since Canada arrested Chinese executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver in early December at the request of the U.S.

U.S. prosecutors have filed fraud charges against Meng, who is Huawei's chief financial officer and the daughter of its founder.

China has warned of ""grave consequences"" if Meng is not immediately released. On Dec. 10, it arrested two Canadians in an apparent attempt to pressure the government of Justin Trudeau. A Chinese court also sentenced a Canadian to death in a sudden retrial in December, overturning a 15-year prison term handed down earlier.

Mulroney said the latest move by China should convince the Canadian government that Huawei should be banned from supplying equipment for 5G networks in Canada.

""This is really the example that should convince people that the risk is too great,"" Mulroney said.

Canada and its security agencies are studying whether to use equipment from Huawei as phone carriers prepare to roll out fifth-generation technology. 5G is designed to support a vast expansion of networks to facilitate medical devices, self-driving cars and other technology.

Huawei is the world's biggest supplier of network gear used by phone and internet companies, but has long been seen as a front for spying by China's military and its highly skilled security services.

""We are about to make a really, really important decision on the future of the technology on which our internet is based,"" Mulroney said. ""How can we not at least consider what's happening in the agriculture sector when we make a decision in the technology sector?""

""If China intervenes capriciously in one sector, might it not intervene capriciously in another? We have to turn the tables on China. China turns the tables on us,"" he added.

Prime Justin Trudeau said Canada's intelligence and security services are very carefully examining Huawei.

Trudeau added that he is optimistic his government will be able to solve the canola issue, noting a previous issue over canola exports to China in 2016 was solved.

It is not the first time that Beijing has struck back against a nation which appears to cross it.

In 2010, China suspended its bilateral trade deal with Norway and restricted imports of Norwegian salmon after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Chinese political prisoner Liu Xiaobo.

Britain and other countries were also retaliated against over their meetings with the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader who is considered a dangerous separatist by Beijing.

""We cannot take this laying down any longer. It's a two-way relationship and they cannot do this to an old friend,"" said Saint-Jacques, the ex- ambassador.

Saint-Jacques also said it is getting close to the point where Canada should expel the China's ambassador.

""He has not been helpful in this crisis,"" he said. ""When you look at what the Chinese are doing this is pretty significant.""

He also said the Trump administration needs to speak up more on Canada's behalf.

""We are in a big mess and Canadian farmers are going to suffer and so the Americans should recognize they have some responsibility in this. And they should try to help us,"" he said.

Bruce said the political issue engulfing the Liberals has “very little ...,"MONTREAL — SNC-Lavalin Group’s chief executive said on Friday the company is looking at ways to protect its business in the event it loses a corruption trial that has created a political crisis for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

An SNC-Lavalin board subcommittee is weighing the construction and engineering company’s options as it takes “steps to minimize the effect of any potential sort of bad outcome in a few years’ time,” chief executive Neil Bruce told Reuters in an interview.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations that top officials working for him leaned on former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to ensure that the construction company avoided a corruption trial. Trudeau has denied the allegations.

At the affair’s centre is a request by SNC-Lavalin for a remediation agreement that would have enabled it to avoid a court case which, if lost, would block it from federal government contracts for a decade. SNC-Lavalin is facing fraud and corruption charges related to allegations that former executives paid bribes to win contracts in Libya under Muammar Gaddafi’s regime, which fell in 2011.

Bruce said SNC is now focused on defending itself in court, with little expectation that a remediation would become available. Any court decision would likely be years away.

“We don’t want to be reacting too late or not early enough if the worst came to the worst,” he said. “We’ve got to be prudent and make sure that we position the company.”

Being blocked from federal contracts would raise the threat of job cuts among the company’s Canadian workforce of 9,000.

“If we were in a position where for whatever reason we couldn’t do work with a certain customer or in a certain country then we would plan all of that and make sure that our business development efforts and the work we were chasing and hopefully winning didn’t fall into that category. That’s part of the mitigation plan.”

Trudeau has often referred to the 9,000 potential job losses as a reason for helping the company, but Bruce told the CBC earlier this week that he never gave a specific number.

SNC wanted to take advantage of new legislation to pay a large fine rather than be prosecuted.

Bruce said the political issue engulfing the Liberals has “very little to do” with the Montreal-based company whose backlog of about $15 billion (US$11.17 billion) is expected to rise during the first quarter.

But politics impacted SNC’s ability to win new work in Saudi Arabia in December and January, amid tense relations between Riyadh and Ottawa. Saudi Arabia froze new trade with Ottawa in August after Canada demanded the release of jailed rights activists.

“Generally we would expect to win sometimes one in two, sometimes one in three,” he said. “And that actually went down to zero in a couple of areas.”

While the dispute has not impacted current contracts underway in Saudi Arabia, Bruce said SNC’s backlog in the country would taper off toward the end of the year if it didn’t win any new contracts in 2019.

The CEO also said an accelerated arbitration process around a delayed Chile project, which hit results from its mining unit in the fourth quarter, would likely not be resolved in 2019.

The company had very ...,"Nearly everyone now knows the story of how Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould, has alleged that she was unduly pressured by Trudeau and other senior officials to offer a remediation agreement to SNC-Lavalin.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau continues to deny that any inappropriate pressure was put on former Attorney General Jody-Wilson Raybould to intervene in the case. He rather claims it was all a misunderstanding. Somehow, almost every top liberal politician in Trudeau’s government had just erroneously thought that former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould was open to granting SNC-Lavalin a remediation agreement even after she said the contrary on several occasions.

“I was not aware of this erosion of trust, and as prime minister and head of cabinet, I should have been aware of it,” said Trudeau. “Situations were experienced differently and I regret that.”

Later, the Prime Minister tried to justify having an interest in the SNC-Lavalin affair on the grounds that thousands of jobs were at stake. However, this excuse seems very far-fetched and he has been called out for it from several quarters.

A commentary on Global News, claims Trudeau’s interference was all about saving liberal seats in Quebec. “If Ottawa were seen to have let SNC-Lavalin get away by failing to give the company a remediation agreement, Trudeau would never hear the end of it, and Legault supporters may well throw their votes to other parties, including the Conservatives or Bloc, in the upcoming federal election.” writes Tasha Kheiriddin“Trudeau had enough trouble in Ontario with Doug Ford; he didn’t need another war with another premier on the eve of an election.”

The Financial Post, supports this viewpoint by insisting that Trudeau’s actions concerning the SNC-was to protect its political interests in Quebec. According to the article,“The willingness of the federal government to aggressively intercede on behalf of SNC-Lavalin is in stark contrast with its refusal to remove environmental and legal roadblocks to actually building the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. The prime minister’s willingness to intervene for SNC-Lavalin reflects a cynical political judgement that his government depends more on Quebec than on Alberta for votes, not an economic need to protect jobs that were never imperilled.”

SNC-Lavalin is said to employ only about 9,000 people across Canada. This number is only aninfinitesimal 0.05 percent of Canada’s total 18,930,000 jobs. Furthermore, a ban from Federal Government projects would not have affected the company at all. Even with a Federal Government ban, the company would still have been allowed to bid on provincial and municipal projects and these projects make up almost 90% of the Canadian government’s infrastructure spending.

The company had very recently confirmed that they were performing very well even after they were told by the Federal Justice Department, that they are likely to face persecution. SNC-Lavalin had recently filed a Management Discussion and Analysis (MDA) discussing its business conditions and outlook where they stated that the business had $10 billion of revenue earned in 50 countries and $15 billion of back orders. This is despite the company being banned from bidding on World Bank projects since 2013 due to allegations of bribery and corruption.

Since leaving Ontario’s political arena, the 63-year-old McGuinty has focused on teaching public policy and ...","There are some parts of his old government job that former Ontario premier Dalton McGuinty misses.

The camaraderie and the “privilege and the joy of public service,” he says.

But Saturday, during a speaking engagement at a Western University environmental event, he said he hasn’t forgotten that politics can be “a contact sport.”

“We can sadly be too consumed by our partisanship, but at the end of the day, it is a wonderful, noble enterprise.”

Six years removed from his decade-long tenure as premier, McGuinty is dipping his toe back into the public waters — but this time he’s laser-focused on the one issue that he believes will either make or break the entire planet.

It’s climate change, and McGuinty, like a Canadian version of former U.S. vice-president Al Gore, has decided he needs to add his voice to the movement for his children and especially his four young grandchildren – a four-year-old, twin two-year-olds and a nine-month-old baby.

Since leaving Ontario’s political arena, McGuinty, 63, has focused on teaching public policy and governance, first at Harvard, and currently at the University of Toronto and Carleton University. He is also on the board of directors for Innergex Renewable Energy Inc.

His own decade-long Queen’s Park rule, even when it was bruised and battered, championed some groundbreaking environmental causes, such as protecting the greenbelt around the Toronto area, closing coal plants and passing the Green Energy Act that encouraged wind and solar power.

McGuinty said he isn’t fazed that his own environmental legacy is being chipped at – that’s politics, after all – but says there needs to be a movement from outside to push politics toward stopping climate change.

“My focus is encouraging people to encourage our politicians of all stripes to find a way to walk and chew gum at the same time,” McGuinty said.

What he means is pushing leaders to balance the immediate “causes of our personal anxiety,” such as household finances and employment, with the larger, daunting issues. “I think you’ve got to be smart as political leaders to reconcile those interests and not present them as competing.

“We need to find a way to address both those immediate, pressing, personal, proximate anxieties at the same time as we address a remote, but a very real, threat. I believe we can do that.”

And here lies what McGuinty calls “the beginning of the biggest social justice movement ever.”

He’s convinced we are on the brink of “a collective awakening” when society at large will come to a point that it will see our treatment of the environment as just as immoral and unethical as slavery and the subjugation of women. It took a change of perspective and an understanding of the very core of those issues before there was societal change, he said.

Once there is recognition that climate change is “compromising our children’s future,” that the consequences will first be delivered to the poorest nations who contributed the least to the problem, and that humankind is the cause of the extinction of thousands of species, “people are just going to come to say, ‘It’s wrong and we’ve got to stop it,’” McGuinty said.

Look no further than to the more than one million young people who demonstrated a week ago in 100 countries, including Canada, he said, challenging the world to make climate change a priority.

“I’m very hopeful that more and more people are going to say it’s not a matter of personal, economic calculus and convenience – it’s a matter of doing what’s right,” McGuinty said.

He said he is counting on the political leaders of today and tomorrow, even the most cynical, to push for that change. His experience tells him they have reasons to join the fight.

“At heart, people really want to do the right thing, they really want to make a difference,” McGuinty said.

Even with what he sees as a global anger and anxiety that has pushed back, particularly in western countries over stagnating wages, globalization, income inequality and the growing use of technology, there is still a desire to leave a legacy.

“I think people long for an option that helps them feel proud of themselves,” McGuinty said. “And I think one of the greatest inter-generational passions that we share is the desire to build a better, happier, safer world for our children.

“And if there was ever a need for us to come together over this issue, it’s now.”

NEW YORK — Regulatory News:

Today, Philip Morris International Inc. (PMI) was informed by its Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. (RBH) that RBH had obtained an initial order from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice granting it protection under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA). RBH announced that obtaining creditor protection became necessary following recent developments in two Class Action proceedings in Québec against RBH, Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited, and JTI-Macdonald Corp. (see “The Class Actions & Other Pending Litigation” below for details).

Key Elements and Impact of RBH’s Decision to File for Creditor Protection

The initial order includes a comprehensive stay of all tobacco-related litigation pending in Canada against RBH and PMI, thus providing an efficient forum for RBH to seek resolution of all such litigation.

The CCAA process allows RBH to carry on its business in the ordinary course with minimal disruption to its customers, suppliers and employees.

As a result of the filing, and under U.S. GAAP, PMI will deconsolidate RBH from its financial statements, resulting in an estimated one-time non-cash charge of approximately $0.10 per share, as described below.

While it remains under creditor protection, RBH does not anticipate paying dividends. As RBH has not paid dividends since the trial court’s judgment in May 2015, the deconsolidation will not have an impact on PMI’s current annualized dividend rate.

2019 PMI Full-Year Forecast & Assumptions and 2019-2021 Targets

As a result of the deconsolidation of RBH, PMI today revises its full-year 2019 reported diluted earnings per share forecast to be at least $4.90 at prevailing exchange rates. This full-year guidance reflects:

The current estimated one-time net impact of the deconsolidation of RBH under U.S. GAAP of approximately $0.10 per share, to be recorded in the first quarter of 2019, which is a non-cash item, plus the tobacco litigation-related charge of approximately $0.09 per share announced on March 4, 2019; and

The exclusion of RBH’s previously anticipated earnings from PMI’s consolidated financial statements from the date of deconsolidation to December 31, 2019, of approximately $0.28 per share.

Excluding the above deconsolidation-related items and the unfavorable impact of currency, at prevailing exchange rates, of approximately $0.14 per share, this forecast represents a projected increase of at least 8.0% versus a pro forma adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.84 in 2018. The 2018 pro forma adjusted diluted EPS of $4.84 is calculated as reported diluted EPS of $5.08, plus tax items of $0.02 per share primarily related to the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, less approximately $0.26 of estimated net earnings attributable to RBH from March 22 through December 31, 2018, in order to present a like-for-like comparison.

Assumptions underlying this forecast, and PMI’s 2019-2021 targets, as communicated by PMI in its earnings release of February 7, 2019, and reiterated at the CAGNY Conference of February 20, 2019, remain unchanged on a like-for-like basis, except for 2019 operating cash flow, which, due to the impact of the deconsolidation, is now estimated to be approximately $9.5 billion, subject to year-end working capital requirements.

This forecast excludes the impact of: any future acquisitions; unanticipated asset impairment and exit cost charges; future changes in currency exchange rates; further developments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; further developments pertaining to the two Québec Class Action lawsuits and the CCAA protection granted to RBH; and any unusual events. Factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to these projections.

Matters Relating to the CCAA Initial Order and PMI’s Deconsolidation of RBH

The Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) is a Canadian federal law that permits Canadian businesses to restructure their affairs while maintaining business as usual.

(CCAA) is a Canadian federal law that permits Canadian businesses to restructure their affairs while maintaining business as usual. The initial CCAA order authorizes RBH to pay all expenses incurred in carrying on its business in the ordinary course after the CCAA filing, including obligations to employees, vendors, and suppliers.

While it remains under creditor protection, RBH does not anticipate paying dividends. As RBH has not paid dividends since the trial court’s judgment in May 2015, the deconsolidation will not have an impact on PMI’s current annualized dividend rate; as always, future dividend increases remain subject to the discretion of PMI’s Board of Directors.

Beginning with the first quarter of 2019, PMI’s adjusted diluted EPS and other impacted results will reflect the deconsolidation of RBH. PMI believes that the adjusted measures will provide useful insight into underlying business trends and results, and will provide a more meaningful performance comparison for the period during which RBH remains under CCAA protection.

The Class Actions & Other Pending Litigation

On March 1, 2019, the Court of Appeal of Québec in Montreal issued its judgment in two class action lawsuits against RBH, as well as Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited, and JTI-Macdonald Corp. PMI is not a party to the cases.

In 2015, the trial court ruled in favor of plaintiffs and found that the estimated class members’ damages totaled approximately CAD 15.6 billion including interest. In its decision, the Court of Appeal largely affirmed the total amount of compensatory and punitive damages, but reduced the total class member damages due to an error in the interest calculation to approximately CAD 13.6 billion including interest. The trial court’s order, as upheld by the Court of Appeal, required the defendants to deposit a portion of the damages, approximately CAD 1.1 billion, into trust accounts within 60 days. RBH’s share of the deposit is approximately CAD 257 million. RBH had already deposited CAD 226 million as security with the Court of Appeal. See PMI’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for more information about these legal proceedings.

On March 4, 2019, as a result of this decision against RBH, PMI announced that it will incur in its consolidated results a pre-tax charge of approximately $194 million, representing approximately $142 million net of tax, in the first quarter of 2019, recorded as tobacco litigation-related expenses. The charge reflects PMI’s assessment of the portion of the judgment that it believes is probable and estimable at this time and corresponds to the trust account deposit required by the court. PMI will continue to monitor developments in the CCAA proceedings as there is a significant lack of clarity with respect to several factors, including the likelihood of resolving in the CCAA process the underlying litigation to which RBH is a party, the financial and other parameters of any resolution of the underlying litigation, and the length of the CCAA process.

While the trial court found that the ultimate damages disposition would depend on an individual claims process, the three defendants in the cases — RBH, JTI-Macdonald Corp., and Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited — are jointly and severally liable for the compensatory damages to be distributed to eligible class members. JTI-Macdonald Corp. and Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited were granted creditor protection under the CCAA in connection with the class actions, on March 8 and 12, 2019, respectively. Without creditor protection, RBH could have been required to pay, in addition to its allocated portion, the portions of the class actions judgment allocated to JTI-Macdonald Corp. and Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited.

RBH is also a defendant in litigation brought by the Canadian Provinces related to the recovery of health care costs. As part of RBH’s filing for creditor protection, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice made an initial order staying proceedings, including the Québec Class Action proceedings and all other tobacco-related litigation pending in Canada against RBH and PMI, including the litigation with the Provinces, to provide RBH with the necessary time to explore a court-supervised resolution of such matters.

The Ontario Superior Court of Justice has scheduled the next hearing (known as the “comeback hearing”) on RBH’s filing for creditor protection for April 4-5 at which time the Court will consider any requests from interested parties, if any, to vary the terms of the initial order for creditor protection.

Pursuant to the initial order, Ernst & Young Canada Inc. has been appointed as Monitor in the CCAA proceedings. Information regarding RBH’s CCAA proceedings, including copies of all court orders made and the Monitor’s reports, will be available on the Monitor’s website at: http://www.ey.com/ca/rbh. The information on this website is not, and shall not be deemed to be, part of this press release or incorporated into any filings we make with the SEC.

The pair defeated Nancy Martin and Tyrel Griffith Sunday afternoon in the final game 9-6.

Peterman and Gallant also won the title three years ago in Saskatoon, when they defeated Geoff and Laura Walker.

But this will be the first time the two are putting on the Maple Leaf together to compete on the world mixed doubles stage – in 2016 they weren't able to travel to the world championship due to scheduling conflicts.

The game was tied 3-3 in the sixth end in a back and forth affair when Peterman made a double with her last rock to score five and take control of the game, 8-3.

""I knew there was a lot on the line with that shot. I took my time. We knew what to expect with the ice and made it,"" Peterman said.

Martin and Griffith wouldn't go away though, answering with three in the seventh.

That made it 8-6 heading to the final end – Peterman was forced to draw to the four foot to secure the 9-6 victory.

""This is incredible. Jocelyn made a huge shot for us,"" Gallant said.

WATCH | Highlights from the mixed doubles national championship final:

Both Peterman and Gallant were emotional after the victory. One year ago the two had high hopes of becoming Canada's first mixed doubles team at the Olympics. They lost in the semifinal – a crushing defeat for them both and something they were thinking about after Sunday's win in Fredericton.

""That was probably one the hardest losses I've ever had,"" Peterman said.

Gallant, fighting back tears, looked at Jocelyn as he expressed his joy over winning this one.

""I love our team""

""I love our team,"" he said. """"We really enjoy getting to play together and making the shots for each other. It's something really special.""

Now they'll take their curling talents and romance - the two are an item - across the ocean next month, wearing the Maple Leaf at the world mixed doubles championship in Norway at the end of April. Canada has never won a mixed doubles world championship.

Peterman, 25, is coming off her first full season as the second for Jennifer Jones. She won a Scotties title in 2016 as a member of Chelsea Carey's team.

""I've never been on the podium at worlds so I'd love to make that happen,"" Peterman said.

Gallant, 29, hadn't been able to play with Peterman at the past two mixed doubles nationals due to being a member of Brad Gushue's rink which had won the past two Briers and then went onto compete at men's worlds. The scheduling conflict didn't allow the two to play together.

But now they've played together twice at the mixed doubles nationals and have two national championship wins.

""To get this opportunity to represent Canada, we want to make the most of it,"" Gallant said.

WATCH | The entire championship gold medal final:

Curling romance

Peterman and Gallant owe at least some of their mixed doubles success to their relationship as a couple. The two really didn't know one another before Gallant reached out to Peterman a few years ago.

Gallant needed a partner for that year's Canadian mixed doubles championship in Saskatoon.

""He just asked me to play over Facebook,"" Peterman says with a laugh. They've been dating ever since.

Gallant says (with a smirk) his only intention was to find a solid curling partner.

""It was strictly about curling ability,"" he says. In that first event together the two captured the championship.

""We've been together ever since and we like mixed doubles a lot,"" Peterman says.

When it comes to communicating on the ice, both Gallant and Peterman say it's an advantage to be dating because they can be blunt with one another and not fear hurting the other's feelings.

""Sometimes I request his feedback to be a little bit nicer,"" Peterman says.

And while those problems are also evident in Delhi Crime, Mehta ...","× Expand Samuel Engelking Richie Mehta Canadian director Richie Mehta takes a harrowing look at the 2012 Delhi gang rape case in the Netflix series Delhi Crime.

DELHI CRIME (Richie Mehta). Seven episodes streaming on Netflix on Friday (March 22).

Canadian filmmaker Richie Mehta always imagined a career making sci-fi movies, never intending to forge a path that keeps returning to his Indian roots.

His 2007 debut feature, Amal, about a rickshaw driver in New Delhi, was meant to be a one-off calling card. Then he happened across a chain-wallah who inspired 2013’s Siddharth. And then came Ridley Scott, who tapped Mehta to turn crowd-sourced videos from YouTube into the 2016 documentary India In A Day. Despite being raised in the GTA, Mehta has distinguished himself among the few filmmakers rigorously and empathically tackling heavy social issues in India.

Now that platforms like Netflix are disrupting the screen industries in Hollywood and Bollywood and allowing new voices to be heard, more content coming from India is exploring the kind of harrowing subject matter that has never made Mehta flinch. Meanwhile, his work is about to reach his widest audience yet.

Delhi Crime, his seven-part procedural dropping on Netflix, painstakingly details the investigation and social fallout from 2012’s Delhi gang rape, also dubbed the Nirbhaya case, in which 23-year-old Jyoti Singh was beaten, raped and tortured with an iron rod by six men on a private bus. She died from her injuries two weeks after the assault. The crime grabbed international headlines, led to protests, riots and some vigilante fervour in a community trying to get a handle on the immense shock and horror and what they should do about it.

The series follows the police investigation spearheaded by the deputy commissioner of police Vartika Chaturvedi (Shefali Shah), who coordinated the hunt for the perpetrators. We don’t see the crime committed, but follow its immediate aftermath. Mehta focuses on the forensics, but as with his previous Delhi-set films, he’s eyeing the periphery.

The show takes place over two weeks in Delhi, observing a patriarchal society where women are routinely victimized, and a widening gap between classes fuels further hatred.

For a Canadian director now residing in the UK, the social structures that feed into gendered violence in India is topical everywhere. Mehta’s investigation into the subject kept bringing me back to the Toronto van attack, and the incel community that inspired it.

Grappling with evil

Mehta is in New Delhi, speaking to me over video chat in the morning, before getting back to work on Delhi Crime’s second season, which will tackle a different crime and likely be released next year. He took five years to develop the first – the last few months consisted of 16-hour days – and the process looks like it considerably aged him since our the last time I interviewed him.

That was in 2013 when Siddharth, Mehta’s devastating fictional story about an impoverished chain-wallah searching for his missing son, had just premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. At that time, Mehta had just begun researching the Jyoti Singh case for Delhi Crime.

The filmmaker was in Delhi when Singh was attacked, completing post-production on Siddharth while following news reports about the Singh case and witnessing the fallout. Some time later, his family friend, a retired police commissioner, encouraged the Canadian director to consider making a film about the incident, offering access to case files and the investigating officers.

“I’m reading about evil,” says Mehta, describing the early stages in his three-and-a-half-year research and writing process. “Diving into it. Dreaming about it. Sleeping with it. Eating with it. I became anti-social in that [early] period. Then you continue on and start to put it together, formatting it in a way that’s palatable.”

He repeatedly met with Singh’s parents, reporting on what he was doing and asking whether they approved. The resulting procedural hangs close to police details and the environment they work in, and makes for an illuminative companion piece to compatriot Deepa Mehta’s 2016 film Anatomy Of Violence, which also took on the Singh rape case.

In that film, Deepa Mehta (unrelated) takes a compassionate but not at all forgiving look at the perpetrators, imagining the conditions in their upbringing and social life that might have led to such a monstrous act.

Anatomy Of Violence’s thesis is similar to that of the investigators interviewed by the Delhi Crime creator. The officers, who Mehta describes as “de facto psychologists after many years on the job,” point to the widening gap between the rich and poor, particularly over the last 15 years.

“You have more money in society literally presenting itself,” he says. “More infrastructure being built, more people are wearing their money, and less people have access to it than before. People at the bottom are physically seeing more money present and they don’t have it, which creates a kind of strife.”

The police also pointed to a boom in uneducated youth, particularly among males, and sudden access to pornography on basic smart phones consumed by many young men.

“You’re seeing women rise up [economically] in society in a manner that you’re not [doing],” Mehta continues. “If you’re taught to treat women a certain way – that they have a certain place in a patriarchal system – and see women rising [up] around you, you’re feeling more and more that you want to objectify them.

“All of these things converge and can create these types of explosions in very frustrated anti-social men. There is a swelling anger that manifests itself in psychotic behaviour.”

The overlap between that explanation and the frustrations and social behaviour attributed to incels in the West, particularly in the case of Toronto van attack culprit Alek Minassian, is not lost on Mehta. Anti-social behaviour, ingrained misogyny and a sense of entitlement are all at work.

Mehta attributes a primary motivation for telling this story to a key statistic. While sex crimes in India are rampant, the U.S. and UK have the most reported rape cases per capita: rape cases per 100,000 people in the U.S. and UK are nearly seven times that of India.

That isn’t meant to minimize the issues in India, and certainly the statistic doesn’t take into consideration how many incidents go unreported. But for the director, that number narrowed the distance between East and West and unravelled the prevailing higher-than-thou attitude some Canadians feel toward Indian society.

In movies like Slumdog Millionaire, Lion and even those made by both Deepa Mehta and Richie Mehta, everything from sex slavery to political corruption in India is on display. And while those problems are also evident in Delhi Crime, Mehta found something inspiring to zero in on: the Indian police officers trying to do good despite the obstacles they face.

Keeping the peace

Mehta’s admiration for the officers involved in the Singh case isn’t an apologia for the rampant corruption within the force, from bribery to human rights abuses. The characters in Delhi Crime work to fight these issues.

In 2016, Human Rights Watch reported 591 deaths in Indian police custody between 2010 to 2015, a regular occurrence stemming from a culture of impunity. Even a perpetrator captured in the Jyoti Singh case died in custody. That was ruled a suicide, though some suspect otherwise.

Mehta likens that police culture to Serpico-era 70s New York City, and believes the Indian police system needs an overhaul. India upholds the Imperial Police Service left behind by the British. During the colonial period, the Brits were the officers and they relied on locals to be constables. Constables could never become high-ranking officers. That system remains, with class hierarchies dictating ranks.

“Incentive is the key to non-corrupt policing,” says Mehta, pointing out why a constable with no opportunity to move up in their career would be susceptible to bribery and more.

Mehta also acknowledges that women being afraid to report sexual assaults to police affects the statistics. But he’s also noticed, at least in Delhi, more female police officers at every station. India began introducing more all-female police stations in the early 2000s to push back against gender biases and make victims feel more comfortable. That led to a 22 per cent increase in reports of violence against women.

The compassion of a female police officer is what Mehta hangs his entire series on. Shefali Shah’s Vartika is based on Chhaya Sharma, the deputy commissioner of police who oversaw the Singh investigation. Called “Madame Sir” – because the patriarchy gets confused – Sharma is portrayed as a woman whose gutted, visceral response to the attack motivates her to go above and beyond and take total control of the investigation.

“It was her reaction to the crime that led to it being solved,” says Mehta.

When he met Sharma for coffee, the woman behind the counter at the café repeatedly refused to take the deputy commissioner’s money.

“She had this look of ‘My superhero just walked in,’” he says. “Imagine this happening in Toronto. Somebody is in awe of a cop!”

A new Indian mainstream

The conversation I’m having with Mehta today is a great deal more optimistic than the one we had in 2013, particularly when discussing Indian cinema as a whole.

At that time, it seemed like Deepa Mehta and Richie Mehta were the only prominent filmmakers grappling with India’s social issues. Meanwhile, Bollywood spoon-fed audiences glamour and fantasy.

“[Bollywood filmmakers] could be more mindful of the power of what they are able to do,” Mehta had said at the time. “But they aren’t, by and large.”

But then along came stellar work like The Lunchbox, Court and, more recently, Village Rockstars. Those are indie films, but Mehta points out that such distinctions are breaking down, as even more Bollywood films like Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury’s Pink and Shree Narayan Singh’s Toilet tackle gender and social issues.

“Things have changed so much,” says Mehta. And at the risk of sounding like he’s stumping for his benefactor, he credits platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video for aiding that progress, giving new voices opportunities to make compelling projects, and giving audiences access to discover them.

Amal and Siddharth were not released in India until they hit Netflix. Soon after Delhi Crime drops, expect Deepa Mehta’s new series, Leila, on the platform as well.

“Filmmakers, artists and creators are enabled to finally do the thing they’ve been fighting so hard to do. It’s edgier work, more probing. And there’s more grey zone.”

394,ScienceAndTechnology,2019-03-25T16:42:00.0000000Z,the country’s first Indigenous-owned licensed cannabis producer — the consortium could establish itself as a major player in the Canadian cannabis in both industry and political terms.,"Canada's legal cannabis industry is still in its early stages, and the country’s Indigenous communities are looking at the nascent market both skeptically and as an opportunity to prosper.

A new consortium of cannabis businesses is hoping to bring the country’s Indigenous ganjapreneurs together, with the goal of building the brand of Indigenous cannabis as a major player in the Canadian and global markets.

The National Indigenous Cannabis Consortium was launched at the recent National Indigenous Cannabis and Hemp Conference in Ottawa, where Indigenous cannabis companies and workers met to discuss how Indigenous businesses and entrepreneurs can compete in the burgeoning Canadian market.

“We need to consolidate in a consistent fashion that’s going to allow for everyone to be able to be part of the whole supply chain,” Roland Bellerose, director of the consortium, told MERRY JANE at the conference. “The Indigenous community across the country is huge, and each one’s going to set their own desires and aspirations about what they want to do.”

The finer details of the consortium’s plans have not been decided yet, as it builds its membership. Whether it means selling products under a formalized brand — roughly similar to California’s True Humboldt brand , a collective comprised of 200 farmers — or something more loosely-organized remains to be seen.

While Bellerose said it’s “impossible to answer” what the consortium will look like when it matures, he offered a thought experiment: “Imagine you’ve got a poster, and you’ve got 100 different brands on it, and they’re all Indigenous,” he said. “We’re not here to say there’s only going to be one brand.” Rather, Bellerose envisions something more like an umbrella association. He said it might hypothetically work as a branding that identifies that “it’s an Indigenous brand, and here’s all of the standards and certifications of the brands within the brand.”

Bellerose said that this kind of organization is entirely new in Canada, and there are none that he is aware of in the United States that focus specifically on Indigenous communities. “Maybe we’re trendsetters, maybe we’re going to set up a new model,” he said. “It’s still very, very much in its infancy.”

If it’s successful attracting participants — and it already has the support of some of the bigger names in the Indigeous community such as former Ontario regional chief Isadore Day, who is now the CEO of Bimaadzwin, an Indigenous economic development organization, as well as Seven Leaf, the country’s first Indigenous-owned licensed cannabis producer — the consortium could establish itself as a major player in the Canadian cannabis in both industry and political terms.

It’s still the early stages of Canada’s legalized cannabis industry, and the country’s Indigenous people are looking at the nascent market both skeptically and as an opportunity to prosper. So often in Canada, conversations about resources and agriculture have been fraught for Indigenous populations — made so by government policy that has historically been designed to separate the land needed for such agricultural pursuits and the Indigenous peoples living on it. This lingering historical memory looms over the issue of how Indigenous communities should respond to cannabis legalization.



There have long been complaints among Indigenous communities that the government’s legalization roll-out has inadequately consulted Indigenous communities. ""When you’re dealing with individual nations and treaty rights, there’s been so much in the Cannabis Act that hasn’t taken that into consideration,” said Jordan Brant, a resident of Tyendinaga who works with dispensaries on the so-called Green Mile, where dispensaries have flourished on Indigenous land. “While I was reading those regulations, that indicated to me that the federal government’s only position on cannabis with regard to Indigenous communities is that ‘we’d prefer they say no.’”

Early in 2018, while the Cannabis Act was working its way through the Senate, the Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples pushed to have legalization delayed for up to a year, citing the “lack of meaningful consultation” with Indigenous peoples.

“There was an alarming lack of consultation, particularly given this government’s stated intentions of developing a new relationship with Indigenous people,” reads the committee’s final report . In addition to asking the government to delay legalization for another year, they also asked that the government set aside 20 percent of cannabis production licenses for Indigenous operators. The government ultimately chose not to follow either of those two recommendations.

Those disagreements are not just between Indigenous peoples and the federal government, but also within Indigenous communities themselves. At the end of February, a protest turned violent outside a Mohawk police station in Akwesasne, Ontario, after tribal police raided a cannabis dispensary. The band council (an elected council that was granted authority by the federal government as part of the Indian Act in 1867, and which some Indigenous communities view as a colonial body) had not issued a license to the Wild Flower Cannabis Dispensary. But the Onkwehonweh Neha Kanonhseshne, also known as the Indian Way Longhouse, which represents the traditional form of governance that existed prior to colonization, had issued a license. Conveniently, they also owned that particular dispensary. After tribal police raided the dispensary, protests over jurisdiction and who authorized the raids turned violent (some protestors reportedly accused the band council of political motivations), and a police SUV was set on fire, according to local news reports.

There are many who want to see an Indigenous cannabis industry set up outside the reach of the Canadian government, and instead organized around traditional Indigenous production methods and self-governance. Some communities have flouted the government’s laws entirely, betting that the government will leave them alone. Last year, Jamie Kunkel, who owns a dispensary in Tyendinaga, a Mohawk territory east of Toronto, told me ( in a story for NOW Magazine ) that he wasn’t concerned with conforming with federal legalization, because in his interpretation, federal laws don’t apply on reserves. That sentiment was on display at the conference, when one woman who spoke, identifying herself in the Dene language as a clan mother, stepped up to the microphone and launched into a criticism of a panel comprised of government cannabis policy staff.

“Our plants cannot be controlled. Our plants grow out on the land… I hear a lot of talk about making money. in my language we were taught that we cannot profit from our medicines,” she told the panelists. “I’m here to remind the people that the plant you are talking about and want to legislate is our medicine, it is healing people. How are you going to heal our people with policies you are going to create that are barriers to our medicine? It’s almost like our plants are being put on the stock market.”

As she left the microphone, the room launched into a loud and sustained applause.



But at the same time, Indigenous communities and their leadership see cannabis as a massive opportunity. They see a chance to get in on the ground floor of an industry which could be a financial golden ticket for communities that want revenues and a measure of independence from government support. For some, legalized cannabis offers a chance to support their communities with sustainable economies based around a plant that has long been used as medicine. Others see a chance to set up a parallel cannabis industry, distinct from the federal government’s system. And others still see cannabis as a new front on which to exert Indigenous sovereignty.

Within that jurisdictional issue exists a space where Indigenous economic interests can be advanced alongside the interests of the Canadian state.

“I think the more important question that Canada faces, which we’ve heard everywhere in this country, is the jurisdictional issue,” said Bellerose. “But as an entrepreneur and on economic development, jurisdiction isn’t going to stop us from being able to move forward on many, many fronts.”

That conversation does not exist within a vacuum: the backdrop to the issue of jurisdiction over cannabis is the wider issue of sovereignty and nation-to-nation relations. It’s been a big talking point for the same Liberal government that brought about legalization, although they have regularly come under fire for not living up to those talking points.

Debates over cannabis regulation in Indigenous communities are in some ways microcosms of larger debates about the government’s ability, or inability, to consult Indigenous communities on a range of issues. This is a topic that has dogged the Trudeau government of late: last summer the government spent $4.5 billion to purchase a pipeline project that had been blocked by the courts principally because of a failure to consult with Indigenous communities. Later, in January, the government forcibly removed an Indigenous blockade set up to stop another pipeline project, and arrested over a dozen people. So when Indigenous communities talk about a lack of meaningful consultation on cannabis, they are also talking about what many in the Indigenous community perceive as a more generalized lack of consideration.

Some Indigenous leaders see cannabis as yet another front in a battle for sovereignty and rights in Canada. “When I think about cannabis, and economic development, and all the opportunities that it can bring to our communities, it makes me think of our chance to dream,” said Cherie Brant, a Mohawk and Ojibway lawyer, moderating a panel. “It’s going to start with a process. It has to begin with a process.”

“We are at a crossroads in terms of our historical existence here on Turtle Island, more specifically in Canada,“ said Grand Chief Joseph Tokwiro Norton, of the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake. “We have to take back our lives and we have to fight to continue to know our culture, our languages. I’m saying this because it’s a backdrop to what we need to do now and into the future… It’s all part of our resurgence, if you will, to continue to be who we are — very distinct, very knowledgeable.”

Cannabis fits into that discussion largely as a path to economic prosperity that would support reserve communities.

“We have to be our providers,” said Norton. “We have to really take advantage of whatever comes along, and if one of those areas is hemp and cannabis, then that’s what we do.”",Could the Future of Canadian Cannabis Be Indigenous?,Merry Jane,https://merryjane.com/culture/could-the-future-of-canadian-cannabis-be-indigenous

The Pound Canadian Dollar (GBP/CAD) Exchange Rate slipped this afternoon and the pairing is currently trading at an inter-bank rate of CA$1.7681.

Prime Minister Theresa May has ruled out having a third ‘meaningful vote’ this week due to a lack of support from MPs.

The Prime Minister said MPs have expressed opposition to a no-deal but the alternative ‘is to pursue a different form of Brexit or a second referendum.’

May adds:

‘The bottom line remains that if the House does not approve a withdrawal deal and cannot countenance leaving without a deal we will have to seek a longer extension.

‘We will have to take part in European elections.’

The European Commission also put further pressure on Sterling today, as they warned the UK is ‘increasingly likely’ to leave the European Union without a deal.

In a statement released Monday, the EC said ‘preparedness and contingency work’ they had been conducting since December 2017 was now complete.

Canadian Dollar (CAD) Rises despite Fears of Potential US Recession

The Canadian Dollar (CAD) was likely muted earlier this afternoon as fears of a potential US recession increased over the last few days.

While fears of a global economic slowdown likely weighed on the ‘Loonie’, the Canadian currency was able to make gains on Sterling (GBP) following a fresh wave of Brexit pessimism.

Another part of the US yield curve inverted, and when this occurred in the past a recession has always followed.

Commenting on this, Martin Farrer of the Guardian said:

‘US 10-year treasury yields slipped below the three-month rate for the first time since 2007 as nervous investors ploughed their money into the safe haven of bonds rather than riskier assets such as shares.

‘This so-called inversion of the bond yield curve – where long-term rates fall below short-term – has predicted every recession for the past 60 years.’

Sterling (GBP) Slides as Government ‘Chickened Out’ of Delivering Brexit

Monday morning saw the Pound (GBP) weighed down by Brexit pessimism as there were calls for Prime Minister Theresa May’s resignation.

The Prime Minister spent Sunday holding crisis meetings with fellow Conservative MPs as she made further efforts to gain support for her Brexit withdrawal agreement.

However, it remains unclear whether or not these meetings were successful as it was only revealed that MPs had discussed ‘whether there was sufficient support’ to bring May’s deal forward for a third vote.

MP Boris Johnson who attended these meetings said the government had ‘chickened out’ of delivering Brexit.

Johnson added that May would need to set out ‘convincing proofs’ to show her next phase of negotiations would be different.

Pound Canadian Dollar Outlook: Will the GBP/CAD Exchange Rate Slide on Fears of a No-Deal Brexit?

As there is a lack of economic data coming from the UK at the start of this week’s session, it is likely that Brexit will remain the main catalyst for movement in the pairing.

While Theresa May has ruled out a third ‘meaningful vote’ due to a lack of support, it is likely further that further signs pointing towards the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal will weigh on Sterling (GBP).

It is also likely that further data indicating that the US is experiencing a slowdown and could potentially be headed towards a recession could see the Canadian Dollar (CAD) slide.

Members of the standing committee on access to information, privacy and ethics are meeting Tuesday to discuss requests from the Conservatives and NDP to study the SNC-Lavalin controversy, which sparked the cabinet resignations of Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott — and left Prime Minister Justin Trudeau facing tough questions.

""The ethics committee is a natural second point for this because we deal with issues of lobbying,"" said Timmins-James Bay MP Charlie Angus, a vice-chair of the ethics committee.

The Conservatives are planning to present a motion at Tuesday's meeting that would:

Ask the prime minister to waive all constraints preventing former attorney general and justice minister Wilson-Raybould from speaking about her experience on the SNC-Lavalin file.

Invite Wilson-Raybould and Philpott to testify before April 5.

Allow the committee to table its findings in Parliament.

Wilson-Raybould appeared before the justice committee last month to answer questions about a Globe and Mail report that alleged she was pressed by senior people in the prime minister's office to allow the Quebec engineering firm SNC-Lavalin to enter into a remediation agreement to avoid criminal prosecution on fraud and bribery charges.

Jane Philpott, who left her role as president of the Treasury Board, recently made waves with an interview she gave to Maclean's, in which she said there's ""much more"" to the SNC-Lavalin story.

Philpott has not testified before committee, but her comments to Maclean's drew a strong response from some in the Liberal caucus. Humber River—Black Creek MP Judy Sgro told Chris Hall, host of CBC Radio's The House, ""it's either put up or shut up,"" in an interview that aired on Saturday.

""You can't tell people to put up or shut up when you're not letting them speak,"" said Angus in response to Sgro's remark.

In addition to a possible Commons ethics committee inquiry, the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner is investigating the SNC-Lavalin case.

The government maintains nothing improper happened — but opposition MPs say the full story has not yet been revealed and they want to hear from both the former ministers.

Last week, the Liberals used their majority on the Commons justice committee to end an inquiry into the matter. The Liberals have a majority on the Commons ethics committee — but Angus said that doesn't worry him.

The NDP MP shares the role of vice-chair of the ethics committee with Liberal MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith.

In late February, as more questions emerged about the SNC-Lavalin story, Erskine-Smith sided with an opposition motion Angus presented that called for a public inquiry and for the prime minister to waive solicitor-client privilege for the former attorney general.

Erskine-Smith didn't respond to CBC's request on Sunday for an interview, but Angus said he would be ""very surprised"" if the Toronto MP didn't support a motion for their committee to investigate the government's handling of the SNC-Lavalin case.

""I'm hoping the Liberal members of the ethics committee will stand up on principle, as their colleagues on the justice committee obviously didn't,"" said Peter Kent, Conservative ethics critic and Thornhill MP.

""The biggest question is to hear what she [Wilson-Raybould] has to say between the moment she was officially removed from the attorney general post up until the moment that she resigned completely from cabinet.""

Cabinet confidence questions

The prime minister has waived solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence for Wilson-Raybould to testify about the matters linked to SNC-Lavalin dating from her time as attorney general, but she remains bound by cabinet confidence and can't speak about the period after she was moved to Veterans Affairs and before she quit cabinet.

An increasing number of Liberal MPs have said Wilson-Raybould and Philpott could share their stories by rising in the House and using parliamentary privilege, but University of Ottawa law professor Errol Mendes said the former cabinet ministers may feel bound by the oath to the privy council.

""It's basically swearing to the Queen and to God that as privy councillors they will keep secret everything that has been treated or debated in their capacity as privy councillors, i.e. members of the cabinet,"" Mendes said.

""I think there is an indication that they have a higher obligation to observe that even if they are allowed to present whatever they want within the confines of parliamentary privilege.""

It's a question of legal constraints versus moral ethical constraints, according to Mendes, which the committee and the former cabinet ministers will have to navigate.

But there's something else Mendes wants the Commons ethics committee to review: the application of deferred prosecution agreements, a newly created legal tool. There are ethical questions to explore there as well, the legal expert said.

The Montreal-based company beat out two other consortia to extend the Trillium Line from Greenboro into Riverside South, a decision cemented with a 19-3 vote by Ottawa city council on March 6.

However, sources with direct knowledge of the Stage 2 evaluation process told CBC that SNC-Lavalin failed to achieve the minimum technical score of 70 per cent, a requirement set out in publicly available documents.

CBC is not naming the three sources because they are not authorized to speak with the media.

SNC-Lavalin, currently at the centre of a major political controversy, is also one of the key partners in Rideau Transit Group, the consortium building the thrice-delayed first stage of Ottawa's LRT system.

The troubled company was one of three pre-qualified bidders for the extension of the Trillium Line. The other two — Trillium Link and Trillium Extension Alliance — scored well above the minimum technical grade of 70 per cent, according to CBC's sources.

City 'stands by' process

City officials and their hired experts overseeing the procurement process have steadfastly refused to confirm whether SNC-Lavalin met the technical threshold.

When council debated and ultimately approved the spending for LRT Stage 2, which includes extending both the east-west Confederation Line and the north-south Trillium Line, Coun. Diane Deans asked if the winning bids had met the minimum 70 per cent score.

She was told the scores were commercially confidential. Deans replied she wasn't asking for the score, only to be assured the winning bids met the threshold.

Coun. Diane Deans expresses frustration that city staff refused to confirm whether SNC-Lavalin met the technical requirements for the Trillium Line contract. 1:12

Again this week, the city refused to say whether SNC-Lavalin made the minimum grade, citing commercial confidentiality of the process.

Given more than two business days to respond to inquiries, the city refused to provide an in-person interview, sending instead an email attributed to Chris Swail, the director of O-Train planning.

""The city stands by the overall integrity of the procurement process in no uncertain terms,"" according to Swail's statement.

The statement also says city officials ""are all satisfied with the results"" of the procurement process and in ""the winning proponent's ability and capacity to design, build and maintain the Trillium Line extension.""

SNC-Lavalin has built rail systems all over the world, including the award-winning Canada Line in Vancouver.

""We are very proud of the proposal we submitted and look forward to getting started,"" said an SNC-Lavalin spokesperson in an email.

The engineering and construction giant said it has no knowledge of the breakdown of the score as the process is confidential.

How the bids were evaluated

The procurement process was overseen by law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, consultants Deloitte, fairness commissioner Oliver Grant, city-hired engineering experts and the city's own staff.

According to the statement from Swail, the three technical proposals were reviewed by a team of experts for ""completeness"" and ""conformance"" to make sure the submissions met the requirements of the contract.

In order to receive a passing score, a technical score threshold of 70 per cent for each of the criteria was required. - City of Ottawa report

But these ""completeness"" and ""conformance"" reviews are not the same as the technical scoring, and in fact were conducted before the bids were scored for their technical merit.

The technical evaluation for the shortlisted bids occurred in two stages, according to public city documents.

Individual expert evaluators reviewed and scored the submitted bids for the Trillium Line on a number of criteria including project design, engineering and operations.

""In order to receive a passing score, a technical score threshold of 70 per cent for each of the criteria was required,"" states a city report.

The evaluators then came together to decide on a so-called ""consensus"" score out of a maximum of 500 points.

It is common in procurement processes that a bid that doesn't make the technical grade be disqualified and barred from the financial evaluation round. This week, the city would not say whether this was the case with the LRT Stage 2 procurement.

According to a statement attributed to Chris Swail, Ottawa's director of O-Train planning, all the bids 'were deemed conformant' to the city's requirements. But that assessment is separate from the technical scoring. (CBC)

Secret committee

But Swail did appear to confirm it earlier this month.

At the March 6 council meeting, Deans asked specifically about the process: ""Pre-qualification, followed by technical scoring, and then if you passed the 70 per cent threshold, you went onto financial assessment. Is that correct?""

Swail answered: ""That is correct.""

The financial evaluation also consisted of several stages, and the resulting consensus score was also out of a maximum of 500 points.

The technical and financial scores were then combined to produce a ""final ranking.""

SNC-Lavalin said it was told by the city that it was the preferred proponent, ""which means that our total score placed us first."" It is possible that a bid could have the overall highest score, but still not have met the 70 per cent minimum technical threshold.

The bid evaluation steering committee oversaw this whole evaluation process, but no one knows who these people are — the membership of the committee is secret.

The steering committee presented the final technical and financial scores, as well as the overall rankings, to an executive steering committee comprised of the city's most senior staff including the city manager, the city solicitor, the treasurer and the head of OC Transpo.

It's the executive steering committee that recommended the preferred proponent to council, which ultimately had the final say on whether to approve SNC-Lavalin for the Trillium contract. But council made that decision without knowing whether the company met the minimum technical score.

According to Norton Rose Fulbright lawyer Geoffrey Gilbert, ""council is not supposed to verify whether … proponents met the technical score. It's council's job to take all the recommendations on the preferred proponent, assess that and make their decision.""

Unanswered questions

That SNC-Lavalin failed to meet the minimum technical grade raises a number of issues.

First, how did the company make it through to the financial evaluation round?

Asked if there are provisions in the request for proposals that would allow a bidder to win without earning a 70 per cent grade, the city wouldn't explicitly say. Instead, Swail's statement repeats the argument that ""specific details that are commercially sensitive or relate to proponent evaluations are kept confidential to protect the integrity of the bidding process and its results.""

Chris Swail, centre, said during last month's technical briefing on the Stage 2 LRT contract that SNC-Lavalin was by far the lowest bidder. (Kate Porter/CBC)

Norton Rose Fulbright lawyers also cite confidentiality as the reason for refusing to confirm whether SNC-Lavalin met the minimum technical score. But Swail has spoken a number of times about the Montreal company's financial score.

""They were by far the lowest bid,"" Swail said last month of SNC-Lavalin's proposal. He's also said SNC-Lavalin was the only proponent to come in under the city's price target.

While SNC-Lavalin's bid will cost the city $230 million more in the short term than planned, the company promises to save the city $100 million over its 27-year maintenance contract.

An SNC-Lavalin board subcommittee is weighing the construction and engineering company’s options as it takes “steps to minimize the effect of any potential sort of bad outcome in a few years’ time,” chief executive Neil Bruce told Reuters in an interview.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations that top officials working for him leaned on former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to ensure that the construction company avoided a corruption trial. Trudeau has denied the allegations.

At the affair’s centre is a request by SNC-Lavalin for a remediation agreement that would have enabled it to avoid a court case which, if lost, would block it from federal government contracts for a decade. SNC-Lavalin is facing fraud and corruption charges related to allegations that former executives paid bribes to win contracts in Libya under Muammar Gaddafi’s regime, which fell in 2011.

Bruce said SNC is now focused on defending itself in court, with little expectation that a remediation would become available. Any court decision would likely be years away.

“We don’t want to be reacting too late or not early enough if the worst came to the worst,” he said. “We’ve got to be prudent and make sure that we position the company.”

Being blocked from federal contracts would raise the threat of job cuts among the company’s Canadian workforce of 9,000.

“If we were in a position where for whatever reason we couldn’t do work with a certain customer or in a certain country then we would plan all of that and make sure that our business development efforts and the work we were chasing and hopefully winning didn’t fall into that category. That’s part of the mitigation plan.”

Trudeau has often referred to the 9,000 potential job losses as a reason for helping the company, but Bruce told the CBC earlier this week that he never gave a specific number.

SNC wanted to take advantage of new legislation to pay a large fine rather than be prosecuted.

Bruce said the political issue engulfing the Liberals has “very little to do” with the Montreal-based company whose backlog of about $15 billion (US$11.17 billion) is expected to rise during the first quarter.

But politics impacted SNC’s ability to win new work in Saudi Arabia in December and January, amid tense relations between Riyadh and Ottawa. Saudi Arabia froze new trade with Ottawa in August after Canada demanded the release of jailed rights activists.

“Generally we would expect to win sometimes one in two, sometimes one in three,” he said. “And that actually went down to zero in a couple of areas.”

While the dispute has not impacted current contracts underway in Saudi Arabia, Bruce said SNC’s backlog in the country would taper off toward the end of the year if it didn’t win any new contracts in 2019.

The CEO also said an accelerated arbitration process around a delayed Chile project, which hit results from its mining unit in the fourth quarter, would likely not be resolved in 2019.

Trudeau said this in the same week that the engineering firm’s CEO has insisted he never brought up potential job losses with the prime minister.

WATCH: Trudeau says extraordinary concessions already made on SNC-Lavalin file

Trudeau faced questions over the SNC-Lavalin affair at a town hall in Thunder Bay, Ont. on Friday night.

The prime minister was asked why he continues to say that he was trying to stand up for Canadian jobs, when SNC-Lavalin CEO Neil Bruce has said he never raised the issue with him as part of discussions toward a DPA.

He was also asked, “If nothing inappropriate really happened, why have two former ministers quit, your staff member quit, your clerk quit and another MP quit? It just doesn’t seem to add up.”

READ MORE: SNC-Lavalin never mentioned 9,000 potential job losses, CEO says

Trudeau began by explaining how a deferred prosecution works.

When a company is facing criminal charges, he said the attorney general has an opportunity to say, “Let’s give you massive penalties and financial sanctions instead, and not cause you to go through the challenge of criminal sanctions, which have direct impact, not just on your ability to do business in Canada but around the world.”

SNC-Lavalin, he said, has as many as 10,000 jobs across Canada (the number was previously pegged at around 9,000).

“And if the company were to go through full criminal prosecution, those jobs absolutely could be at risk,” Trudeau said.

The prime minister said he discussed a DPA with Wilson-Raybould in the fall, but that he directly told her it was “her decision to make.”

“But at the same time, it’s also a decision that can be visited and revisited all the way up to the end of the trial and because of that, we kept having discussions about it, because we really didn’t want to see all these jobs potentially at risk, and yes, potentially lost,” Trudeau said.

He said he and the former attorney general disagree on whether she faced inappropriate pressure when it came to a DPA for SNC-Lavalin.

WATCH: Conservatives continue call for PM Trudeau to testify on SNC-Lavalin

When Wilson-Raybould testified before the House of Commons justice committee in February, she said Ben Chin, chief of staff to Finance Minister Bill Morneau, met with the then-attorney general’s own chief of staff and said that if SNC-Lavalin doesn’t receive a DPA, then they’ll leave Montreal — potentially putting thousands of jobs at risk.

Wilson-Raybould later formed the view that it would be inappropriate for her to intervene in a decision that was being undertaken by the director of public prosecutions and pursue an agreement.

But people with the PMO and the Privy Council Office (PCO) continued to push her, she said.

In interviews this week, Bruce shot down the notions that he raised the issue of jobs with the prime minister, or the prospect of the company leaving Montreal.

Bruce said that if SNC-Lavalin is convicted and prevented from bidding on federal contracts, then its employees could take up work with the company’s foreign rivals.

“There would be a reduction with us but these are talented folks. They’ll get a job,” he said.

“This thing that somehow they’re going to be unemployed is not true because they are highly qualified, highly experienced people.”

He also said SNC-Lavalin did not have plans to move out of Montreal.

The House of Commons justice committee spent five weeks looking into the discussions around a DPA for SNC-Lavalin, Trudeau said.

And that, he said, is where matters stand.

Trudeau also addressed the resignations of former treasury board president Jane Philpott from cabinet, and of MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes from the Liberal caucus.

He said they have made “decisions about their own positions and their own perspectives on this that I absolutely respect, but to a certain extent, I disagree with.”

Trudeau went on to note that an ethics commissioner will look into the matter, and that an “objective look at what actually happened” is taking place.

He has also named ex-Liberal justice minister Anne McLellan as a special advisor who will examine questions that have been raised amid the controversy.

Wilson-Raybould, along with staff from the Prime Minister’s Office, testified on her conversations regarding the criminal prosecution of Montreal-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin, which has been charged with corruption. The former justice minister alleged that there was political interference from the PMO, but staffers denied the allegations.

Wilson-Raybould was allowed to testify because Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had waived both solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidences specifically for the justice committee testimony.

But the waiver for Wilson-Raybould only allowed her to speak about what happened while she was attorney general. Since she was moved to the veterans affairs portfolio on Jan. 14, Wilson-Raybould was not allowed to speak about any discussions on the matter after she was shuffled off the justice file.

But Wilson-Raybould, who has since resigned from cabinet, has stated that she has more to say on the matter, and Conservative and NDP MPs have called for Trudeau to again waive cabinet confidence so she can speak freely.

Additionally, former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott, who also resigned from cabinet over the affair, said in an interview this week that there’s “much more” to the story that Canadians must hear.

In a letter Friday, Wilson-Raybould said she would be supplementing her previous testimony with a written submission to the justice committee — one that was still “within the confines of the waiver of cabinet confidence and solicitor-client privilege.”

What is cabinet confidentiality?

According to the government website, cabinet members “must be able to express their views freely during the discussions held in cabinet.

“To allow the exchange of views to be disclosed publicly would result in the erosion of the collective responsibility of ministers. As a result, the collective decision-making process has traditionally been protected by the rule of confidentiality.”

Experts say the confidentiality rule is tied in with cabinet solidarity, meaning a lack of faith in one minister amounts to a lack of faith in all of them.

“In other words, Parliament might lose faith in the cabinet if it knew that there was substantial disagreement over its plans and/or priorities,” Greg Flynn, assistant professor of political science at McMaster University, explained.

“As a result, cabinet is permitted to discuss and debate its plans and priorities behind the veil of secrecy.”

Cabinet confidence is subject to a statute of limitations — members are allowed to speak freely 20 years after the fact.

Can ministers break confidentiality, and what is the punishment?

Prof. Emmett Macfarlane of the University of Waterloo explains that while in the House of Commons or other House committee meetings, there is something called of parliamentary privilege, which allows MPs to be free to speak and be protected from any legal repercussions.

“Probably the worst consequence they would face could conceivably be being kicked out of caucus of the Liberal caucus,” MacFarland said.

If ministers or former ministers spoke outside of Parliament, there would be a discussion about whether that person would have violated their oath of the Privy Council.

But he cautioned that it would be rare for anyone to do that.

READ MORE: Charges against SNC-Lavalin explained — and how the PMO allegedly got involved

“There are issues of personal ethics here that would dictate whether or not they would actually want to break those confidences rather than have the prime minister lift them,” he explained.

Another way ministers can break cabinet confidentiality is if they are ordered to by a judge.

“It would … be up to a court to decide if the privilege applied and whether the public interest outweighed the interests of the other parties in the litigation,” Flynn explained.

That could possibly come into play during the trial of Vice-Admiral Mark Norman, who stands accused of leaking cabinet secrets.

“For example, if cabinet discussed anything in relation to the alleged offences against Vice-Admiral Norman then it would be subject to the confidence principle,” Flynn said.

“However, the judge in the proceedings could order the information disclosed because the interests of Norman (to make a full answer and defence to the criminal charges against him) outweigh the public interest in keeping the information confidential.”

Added layer of solicitor-client privilege

Also complicating the SNC-Lavalin issue is the fact that Wilson-Raybould was Canada’s attorney general for the case, which means she’s also subject to attorney-client privilege.

If a lawyer breaks privilege, she could face expulsion from the bar, MacFarland explained.

In an interview on CTV’s Question Period that will air on Sunday, the Quebec MP said that if her former cabinet colleagues -- both of which resigned amid the scandal -- want to speak, they have a venue to do so.

“They can clearly speak, they can use their own parliamentary privilege to go before Parliament and speak,” Joly, who is a lawyer, said.

Calls have increased in the last week for the pair to use the Commons to speak to the events surrounding alleged months-long pressure on then-attorney general Wilson-Raybould to seek a remediation agreement instead of criminal charges in a corruption case against the Quebec engineering and construction firm over business dealings in Libya.

That’s because both Philpott and Wilson-Raybould have issued comments indicating they want to, or will be elaborating on the affair that has now dominated headlines for more than a month and a half.

In an interview with Maclean’s magazine that was published on Thursday, Philpott said that that there is “much more to the story that needs to be told.”

Philpott, who shortly followed Wilson-Raybould out the cabinet doors, citing a loss of confidence in the way the government is handling the scandal, said in the interview that she believes Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his top staffers have been trying to “shut down” the story.

Then, in a letter to the House Justice Committee, Wilson-Raybould said that she will provide additional evidence and a written statement on the SNC-Lavalin affair, after her request to testify again was rejected by the Liberal majority on the committee. She wrote that this new information she will provide will still be within the “confines of the waiver of cabinet confidence and solicitor-client privilege.”

Joly, who is a lawyer, said that if both want to “tell more,” they “clearly” can speak because the protections of parliamentary privilege would apply, but they also have other options -- as Liberal MP Judy Sgro put it -- to “clear the air.”

“They have the opportunity, three ways: Before Parliament; through the ethics commissioner; and if the parliamentary committee on justice wants to continue to study this issue, it’s up to them to decide,” Joly said.

It’s unlikely that the committee probe will be revived, and the ethics probe is largely a closed-door avenue.

Liberal MP Marco Mendicino, who was also on Question Period, said that Philpott and Wilson-Raybould would have “immunity” if they stepped into the Commons citing various procedural experts and legal scholars.

In the Maclean’s interview, Philpott was asked about the prospect of using the protections MPs have when speaking in the House of Commons to say what she thinks needs saying. She said she would “prefer to err on the side of caution in terms of the very serious oaths that I made when I became a cabinet minister to respect confidentiality.”

Similarly, Wilson-Raybould -- who over a month ago first stood in the House and implored that she be allowed to “speak my truth” -- told the committee that the unprecedented waiver that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued still limited her. In that waiver, Trudeau relinquished solicitor-client privileges and cabinet confidences so that she and anyone who participated in discussions with her could “address relevant matters.”

Trudeau has been consistently citing the waiver and the hours of testimony as evidence that Wilson-Raybould has already been able to speak “entirely and completely” about her experience on the SNC-Lavalin file when she was justice minister.

“This is something that we have taken very seriously as a government and will continue to take seriously, but there has been a full airing,” Trudeau said on Friday.

They’d ‘take all the risk’: Raitt

Rebuffing the idea in a separate interview on CTV’s Question Period, Conservative Deputy Leader Lisa Raitt said that all of the legal voices opining on whether or not parliamentary privilege is an adequate protection can’t hold a candle to the legal advice these two are likely receiving. In the early days of the scandal, Wilson-Raybould retained former Supreme Court judge Thomas Cromwell to provide legal guidance.

She said that those suggesting all they need to do is walk into the House are putting “all the risk” on their shoulders and not where it should be: on Trudeau.

“They’re the ones that are going to have to make sure that they’re not going to get sued or disbarred or looked down upon because they broke an oath that they made… they’re going to take all that risk, whereas the one guy who can just say, ‘You can speak about anything you want, lets clear the air,’ refuses to do so, and it’s their fault?” Raitt said.

The opposition has used several procedural mechanisms to try to push Trudeau to waive all possible confidences, including a more-than-30-hour vote marathon, to no avail.

“Let’s just rip the Band-Aid off, let’s get this done, bring them in, have a conversation, lift the waivers, relieve them of their oaths, get it done,” Raitt said.

Former NDP Leader Tom Mulcair said on the show that he thinks eventually Trudeau won’t have a choice but to “lift the veil,” with pressure of the story expected to keep up.

‘Politics is a team sport’

Aside from the slow drip of news on the SNC-Lavalin story is the question of whether or not Wilson-Raybould and Philpott will, or should, remain members of the Liberal caucus.

Trudeau has deferred on this question, saying it’s a decision that is up to them, but now some think it should be put to a vote in caucus.

On Wednesday, Liberal MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes removed herself from the caucus, saying that she no longer wanted to be a distraction, after she accused Trudeau of acting with “hostility” towards her when she said she wouldn’t be running again.

Asked whether Philpott and Wilson-Raybould should stay in caucus, Joly said “politics is a team sport, and in a team not everybody agrees… but at the end of the day what‘s the most important is team spirit and if they decide not to want to play in a team, it’s up to them to decide.”

An SNC-Lavalin board subcommittee is weighing the construction and engineering company’s options as it takes “steps to minimize the effect of any potential sort of bad outcome in a few years’ time,” chief executive Neil Bruce told Reuters in an interview.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations that top officials working for him leaned on former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to ensure that the construction company avoided a corruption trial. Trudeau has denied the allegations.

At the affair’s center is a request by SNC-Lavalin for a remediation agreement that would have enabled it to avoid a court case which, if lost, would block it from federal government contracts for a decade. SNC-Lavalin is facing fraud and corruption charges related to allegations that former executives paid bribes to win contracts in Libya under Muammar Gaddafi’s regime, which fell in 2011.

Bruce said SNC is now focused on defending itself in court, with little expectation that a remediation would become available. Any court decision which would likely be years away.

“We don’t want to be reacting too late or not early enough if the worst came to the worst,” he said. “We’ve got to be prudent and make sure that we position the company.”

Being blocked from federal contracts would raise the threat of job cuts among the company’s Canadian workforce of 9,000.

“If we were in a position where for whatever reason we couldn’t do work with a certain customer or in a certain country then we would plan all of that and make sure that our business development efforts and the work we were chasing and hopefully winning didn’t fall into that category. That’s part of the mitigation plan.”

Trudeau has often referred to the 9,000 potential job losses as a reason for helping the company, but Bruce told the CBC earlier this week that he never gave a specific number.

SNC wanted to take advantage of new legislation to pay a large fine rather than be prosecuted.

Bruce said the political issue engulfing the Liberals has “very little to do” with the Montreal-based company whose backlog of about C$15 billion ($11.17 billion) is expected to rise during the first quarter.

But politics impacted SNC’s ability to win new work in Saudi Arabia in December and January, amid tense relations between Riyadh and Ottawa. Saudi Arabia froze new trade with Ottawa in August after Canada demanded the release of jailed rights activists.

“Generally we would expect to win sometimes one in two, sometimes one in three,” he said. “And that actually went down to zero in a couple of areas.”

While the dispute has not impacted current contracts underway in Saudi Arabia, Bruce said SNC’s backlog in the country would taper off toward the end of the year if it didn’t win any new contracts in 2019.

The CEO also said an accelerated arbitration process around a delayed Chile project, which hit results from its mining unit in the fourth quarter, would likely not be resolved in 2019.",Canada's SNC Lavalin eyes ways to protect business amid political crisis,Reuters,https://ca.reuters.com/article/idCAKCN1R32TN-OCABS

Politically, the allegations of interference with the justice system have deeply damaged the “sunny ways” Liberal brand and catapulted the Conservative Party ahead of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in pre-election opinion polls. And, as most scandals do, the SNC affair has led to a series of high-profile resignations. Former minister of justice and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould may have been the first out the door, but her departure was quickly followed by the principal secretary to the prime minister, Gerald Butts, the president of the Treasury Board, Jane Philpott, and, most recently, the clerk of the Privy Council, Michael Wernick.

The government, in its scramble to defuse the political crises, launched a half-hearted study into the allegations before the Liberal-controlled justice committee appointed Anne McLellan to advise the PMO on the role of justice minister and attorney general in cabinet.

But none of this, rightly so given that the rule of law is at stake, has quieted the continuing questions about Trudeau’s integrity and his leadership.

And now there seems to be a rising grumbling that the legal profession should consider what activities former judges can be permitted to engage in after retirement.

After all, the short history of the SNC scandal does reveal a who’s who of the legal profession.

Former Supreme Court of Canada judge Frank Iacobucci, who is now senior counsel at the law firm Torys, was actively involved in SNC-Lavalin’s defence — even signing his name to a letter to the Public Prosecution Service advocating for a deferred persecution agreement.

Wilson-Raybould hired former Supreme Court justice Thomas Cromwell to provide her with legal advice about the scope and application of solicitor-client privilege.

Even the PMO got into the former judge game by floating the idea of retaining former Supreme Court Chief justice Beverley McLachlin to provide a legal opinion on deferred prosecution agreements.

The re-examination of permissible post-judicial activities may all just be a convenient distraction for those who wish to turn the channel away from the actions of the prime minister and his office. But there may be some merit considering what activities judges should be permitted to engage in during their golden years.

Should judges go gently into the good night of retirement? Or should they rage, rage against the dying of the light?

Should former judges have been involved in the SNC case at all?

Well, there are rules about what activities a retired judge can undertake after returning to practice.

In Ontario, a lawyer who was formerly a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada, the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the Federal Court of Appeal or the Superior Court of Justice is barred from advocating in any court or before any administrative board or tribunal absent special permission that can only be granted in exceptional circumstances. Former judges of the Ontario Court of Justice are unable to appear before a court for a period of three years from the date of their retirement.

The Federation of Law Societies has also released a discussion paper on post-judicial returns to legal practice.

But none of the rules — proposed or on the books — would have applied in the SNC case. And that may actually be a good thing.

Prohibiting retired judges from practising law carries hidden costs. Restrictions may limit the pool of qualified lawyers who would want to apply for judicial appointment — many potential applicants won’t want to view the bench as the end of their career. Limiting post-retirement work may indeed encourage judges to serve until mandatory retirement, which risks ossifying our courts and discouraging younger applicants. And limitations on post-retirement work ignores the fact that judges, even after retirement, can make valuable contributions to society through continued legal work. Rules that limit judicial practice could have the effect of discouraging the insight and expertise retired judges can bring to pro bono work and public policy development.

Some have suggested that former judges should not be involved in any litigation that may end up before the Supreme Court or cases that may become political. But it is impossible to determine to which cases that limit would apply until it actually happens.

It seems that the solution to the perceived problem of post-judicial activities may create more problems than it solves.

Sure, there is always a risk that the public may perceive that the involvement of a retired judge in a particular case renders the legal system unfair. This is a valid concern and perhaps there needs to be public education about the current rules of professional conduct. But, in reality, judges are very comfortable disagreeing with each other and being disagreed with. Indeed, the PPSC did not seem to be swayed by anything Iacobucci said on the SNC case — the fact he was a former Supreme Court justice did not seem to move the needle at all.

The real problem may actually be with those in politics who seek to use retired judges as a political weapon.

Former prime minister Stephen Harper did it when he released former Supreme Court judge Ian Binnie’s opinion on the Marc Nadon case — a case that the government clearly knew was going to be controversial.

Iacobucci may have unsuccessfully advocated on SNC’s behalf, but it was the clerk of the privy council, as part of the PMO attempts to influence Wilson-Raybould’s decision, who wielded the name as a weapon, telling her that: “Iacobucci is not a shrinking violet.""

And it was the PMO who was quite keen on the idea of “retaining an ex Supreme Court of Canada judge” to provide “cover in the business community and the legal community.”

So, while examining the scope of work retired judges should be permitted to engage in is not a bad idea, a better idea would be to insist on better and more ethical behaviour from our politicians.

And conventions have policy consequences.

Lost in all the noise surrounding the SNC-Lavalin affair is a broader question about the kind of political system Canadians want. Indeed, the attention accorded to committee hearings dealing with the often secretive, behind-the-scenes business of cabinet is an unprecedented development in Canadian political history, a country so often noted for its stolid approach to political crises. As such, many people have been shocked by the revelations alleging partisan political interference into the office of the attorney general. Has the SNC-Lavalin affair ushered in a new constitutional moment for Canada?

As more details emerge, testimony from the House of Commons Justice Committee has revealed the deeply conventional nature of much of the operation of cabinet and the broader Privy Council. Indeed, reference to the Shawcross doctrine is one example of a convention that aims to clarify the relationship between the attorney general and the cabinet.

But what exactly are constitutional conventions? Conventions are the extra-legal practices that inform the operation of our government. For instance, the role of the prime minister is seldom referred to in the Constitution Act 1867 and 1982, yet conventions inform how and when the prime minister is appointed or removed.

Emphasizing this aspect of conventions, the late Senator Eugene Forsey, one of Canada’s eminent constitutional experts, wrote dramatically of conventions as “political in their birth, political in their growth and decay, and political in their application and sanctions. In politics they live and move and have their being.”

Indeed, if we did not have conventions that informed the way government is conducted, an alien reading our written constitution would be forgiven for thinking we live under the polite dictatorship of the Crown, as there is hardly any substantive reference to the convention of responsible government, or of the role of the prime minister in the Constitution Act 1867 and 1982. In this way, then, constitutional conventions are never clear cut, and can often be highly ambiguous due to the flexibility built in to them and their unwritten nature.

This applies to the Shawcross doctrine. Sir Hartley Shawcross was attorney general in the Labour government of Clement Attlee during the Nuremberg Trials, and Attlee put him in the position of president of the Board of Trade. Questioned in Parliament in 1951 on the Attorney General’s discretionary powers, Shawcross said:

I think the true doctrine is that it is the duty of an Attorney-General, in deciding whether or not to authorise the prosecution, to acquaint himself with all the relevant facts, including, for instance, the effect which the prosecution, successful or unsuccessful as the case may be, would have upon public morale and order, and with any other considerations affecting public policy.

In order so to inform himself, he may, although I do not think he is obliged to, consult with any of his colleagues in the Government; and indeed, as Lord Simon once said, he would in some cases be a fool if he did not. On the other hand, the assistance of his colleagues is confined to informing him of particular considerations which might affect his own decision, and does not consist, and must not consist, in telling him what that decision ought to be. The responsibility for the eventual decision rests with the Attorney-General, and he is not to be ​ put, and is not put, under pressure by his colleagues in the matter.

While one interpretation of the principle simply states that the decision to prosecute is at the discretion of the attorney general alone, it is easy to see the ambiguity and complexity at the heart of Shawcross’s comments.

Two contradictory interpretations of the doctrine have thus emerged during the SNC-Lavalin affair. One is that it is up to the attorney general alone to determine when there has been sufficient policy consideration in the lead-up to a decision to prosecute. The other is that the attorney general should reflect on the considerations of cabinet colleagues when freely coming to a decision. Both interpretations are correct according to the Shawcross doctrine.

Some have suggested that the current political crisis bears some resemblance to the Saturday Night Massacre in 1973, when US President Richard Nixon, in the heat of the Watergate proceedings, had two attorney generals resign as he pressured them to fire the lead prosecutor investigating the Watergate burglaries. Does this analogy hold?

In the American presidential division-of-powers system, political executives are not elected members of congress, and thus they have no obligation to represent an electoral district. There is a strict separation between the legislative and the executive branches, which, despite its other limitations, has the benefit of clearly outlining the chain of accountability. Indeed, such clear lines of accountability are lacking in the Westminster system and constitute its main drawback.

In our Westminster system, which is bilingual and a federation, ministers frequently wear many hats and are accountable to many different — sometimes contradictory — interests; political executives thus speak on behalf of the Crown yet they are also accountable to their local electoral district constituents, their regions, and the political program of their party, among other considerations. Despite their politically fraught nature, then, conventions are what make such a potentially contradictory system workable, in that they regularize processes. Reference to the Saturday Night Massacre in the SNC-Lavalin affair is therefore misleading, because the lines of accountability in the US presidential system are clearer and more explicit.

Constitutional conventions make our contradictory system workable, in that they regularize processes.

Others have maintained that a strict separation between law and politics is desirable, and the best way to achieve this within a Westminster system is by separating the role of the attorney general from that of the minister of justice. Without a major institutional overhaul, however, it is not entirely clear how separating the role of the attorney general from that of the justice minister would lead to better political processes or policy outcomes. Even in the UK, where this separation exists, the attorney general is still expected to be an elected member of Parliament backed by party affiliation. Moreover, while the UK attorney general sits in cabinet, the office is structurally subordinate to the office that is equivalent of the minister of justice, and the attorney general still reports to the prime minister.

For these reasons, Westminster systems will doubtlessly continue to see political considerations hovering around the office of the attorney general. In our system of responsible government, the executive requires the confidence of an elected majority in the House of Commons to govern. It might therefore be preferable to keep the current office free from crudely partisan consideration — but entirely purging important political institutions like the office of the attorney general of political decision-making might not be in our best interest. It is possible to be political while nevertheless maintaining the rule of law, as Shawcross did when prosecuting the Nazis at Nuremberg.

Constitutional conventions have policy consequences. And as Canadians make up their minds about the SNC-Lavalin affair, it is important to consider how each of these approaches regarding when and how the attorney general has ensured sufficient policy consideration for prosecutorial decisions could interface with the way in which our political institutions are organized. While all thoughtful Canadians undoubtedly take the rule of law seriously, there is no easy resolution of the tension between law and politics. Before we change our institutions and conventions, then, we should be sure that we are not simply trading one set of problems for another, thus recreating the conditions for another crisis like the SNC-Lavalin affair, albeit in new ways.

There is a lot of vacant office space in Calgary because during the past four years, Justin Trudeau and his sidekick Rachel Notley have scared away about $100 billion in energy investment. And that equals a lot of empty office towers as oil companies downsize or even close.

So here’s my plan: We offer the empty space to SNC-Lavalin and get them to move their head office to Calgary. Then just watch the Liberals line up to help!

(Of course, as soon as SNC became an Alberta company, Trudeau and his Libs would stop moving heaven and earth to cut them a deal. It’s just Liberal political DNA to ignore Alberta.)

Take the appointment of Joyce Murray as president of the federal Treasury Board last week. It became necessary to swear-in a new Treasury Board president when Jane Philpott, the former president, resigned from cabinet on principle over the Lavscam scandal.

Who did Trudeau appoint? One of the Liberal party’s strongest critics of the Trans Mountain pipeline, Vancouver Quadra MP Joyce Murray.

So let me see if I have this right: If you are a Liberal minister who opposes a cosy deal for Quebec’s SNC-Lavalin, you get punted. But you get promoted to cabinet if you oppose a pipeline vital to Alberta.

Because such Alberta-is-a-second-class-province actions are engrained in the Liberals’ genes, the premier of Alberta has to raise a stink about such appointments. Will the stink do much good? Probably not. But like yelling at a ref over a bad penalty call, you do it in the hope the ref will take the next call more seriously.

So you saw the bloody-hell Notley raised about Murray’s appointment, right?

No? That’s because she didn’t.

It’s the same with Bill C-48, which is currently before the Senate transportation committee.

It is an obnoxiously anti-Alberta bill even by Liberal standards. It bans shipments of Alberta oil and bitumen from being shipped by ocean-going tanker along B.C.’s north coast.

It doesn’t block shipments of Saudi or Nigerian or Venezuelan oil from coming up the St. Lawrence to refineries in Lavalinville (Montreal). It also doesn’t forbid coastal shipments of liquified natural gas from B.C.’s own LNG refineries. Just oil and bitumen from Alberta.

Before they pass C-48, senators want to hold hearings in other parts of Canada among people who would be affected. Yet twice now (most recently last week), Liberal senators on the committee blocked efforts to hold hearings in Alberta.

We will be as affected as any province, but Liberal senators (almost certainly on orders from the prime minister’s office) don’t want to give us a say.

Again, you would expect the Alberta premier to howl in indignation.

Nope. Last week Notley sent a very polite letter — a letter than can be easily ignored — to the Senate asking if they might reconsider, you know, if it’s not too much trouble.

Notley is kind of stuck. Bill C-48 is part of a Liberal effort to make sure the Northern Gateway pipeline proposal is never resurrected. So while Notley should be protesting C-48 loudly, she can’t because, of course, she campaigned against Northern Gateway in the last provincial election.

Even on Energy East, which was cancelled in 2017 because the Trudeau Liberals rigged the approval process against the pipeline, Notley was largely silent because one of her first acts as premier was to go to Quebec and offer that province a veto over the pipeline if they didn’t think her climate leadership plan was good enough.

So when Quebec effectively exercised that veto (through Trudeau) Notley was compromised. She couldn’t do what an Alberta premier should and must do.

And she still can’t.",GUNTER: Maybe SNC-Lavalin should look at Calgary office space,Edmonton Sun,https://edmontonsun.com/opinion/columnists/gunter-maybe-snc-lavalin-should-look-at-calgary-office-space

Now, the CBC reports that SNC’s bid did not meet the city’s technical requirements, a problem which would typically disqualify a bid.

It is time Mayor Jim Watson and senior city staff gave the public some straight answers on what is going on with the $1.6-billion extension of the Trillium Line. Instead, they are stonewalling. When the contract came to city council for approval, Coun. Diane Deans asked if the company had met the technical requirements. Simple question, but it produced only an evasive answer. Now, we know why.

There is an issue of commercial confidentiality when competing firms bid on a project such as rail expansion, but the city has buried the LRT evaluation in unnecessary layers of secrecy. Even the membership of the bid evaluation steering committee is secret. One of the high-billing outside lawyers advising the city on the project even had the audacity to tell councillors that they didn’t need to know if the bid met the technical qualifications.

There is an issue of commercial confidentiality … but the city has buried the LRT evaluation in unnecessary layers of secrecy.

What isn’t secret is who owns this decision. Jim Watson, that would be you. Very little happens at City Hall without the mayor’s stamp of approval and no one is better placed to say, “Wait a minute, why would we choose a company that didn’t meet the technical requirements?”

We can safely assume that it is not because SNC-Lavalin gave Watson a $38-million yacht, an inducement the company is alleged to have given to the son of former Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi to get a contract in that country.

Doug Ford announces $1.2 billion in funding for second stage of LRT

Kirk: Potential of driverless taxis should delay Stage 2 of Ottawa LRT

LRT testing going well, Transpo boss says, but warns things won’t be ‘pretty’ on days trains face trouble

Perhaps there is something about the SNC bid that makes it vastly superior overall to its two competitors, despite the bid’s technical failings, whatever they are. If so, the mayor needs to let the public in on the secret.

We do know that the SNC bid is the cheapest of the three, even though it is $230 million over the city’s estimate. The company has promised to offset that by saving the city $100 million on the accompanying maintenance contract.

The failure to meet the technical threshold is worrying, though, especially when one considers the seemingly large number of technical problems that have plagued the first phase of LRT. The latest round of stories about the rail cars’ inability to cope with the predictable challenges of winter doesn’t exactly inspire confidence.

The federal and provincial governments are giving the city billions of dollars on the premise that city staff and politicians will do the work to ensure that it’s well spent. City tax dollars are in there, too. And yet, no reasonable person could now claim that this project has a solid footing.

When the project came to council for approval, our elected officials were told that it had to be approved right now, or the city would lose the fabulously great price it had when the bid expired at the end of March.

Several councillors expressed frustration and concern about being asked to approve such a large project without all the facts in hand. Combined, the two parts of the LRT expansion will cost $4.7 billion. And yet, all but three councillors voted for it anyway.

Watson clearly isn’t going to address this problem unless he is forced to. Even after the CBC story, he says he has full confidence in the procurement process and it’s not up to council to oversee it. That’s a grossly inadequate response.

It would take only 13 councillors to request an emergency meeting on the SNC contract, based on new information. The bid’s technical failure is new information. Council needs to demand answers, and if they aren’t satisfactory, it should vote to overturn the contract approval.

Earlier this month, we started seeing criticism on Twitter about the lack of diverse voices and perspectives on the SNC-Lavalin affair.

To what extent do media project the image of a White Canada? Do white people interrogate how the mirror they see themselves in is totally distorted? (Looking for replies of between 80-110%) — Nora Loreto (@NoLore) March 5, 2019

The experiences of cishet white women = not an appropriate litmus test in this situation. The movement to get more women into politics needs to recognize how starkly different white women’s experiences of political life are from those of Indigenous, Black & other WOC/POC. https://t.co/j3VhmEuM21 — Rosella Chibambo (@Chibambo) March 9, 2019

Some came from Indigenous women who lamented the lack of column space for their perspectives on an issue that affected Canada’s first Indigenous attorney general.

Written by actual indigenous journalists who are getting paid for their work. That too would be a nice change instead of asking random indigenous (or worse, non-indigenous) people to contribute 'opinions' off the cuff to a staff reporter. https://t.co/X5eg3tD7hg — JE Barnard (@J_E_Barnard) March 7, 2019

Others came from former political staffers, including Lauren Dobson-Hughes, who took particular issue with how media outlets continue to commission op-eds from former political advisors at the expense of new voices:

For example, (and no disrespect to him, who I enjoy reading), do we need 14 columns in 14 days across 3 outlets from an ex-PM’s DComms on the same topic? Meanwhile, none of these outlets have picked up talent like @vmochama and it’s so damn glaring — Lauren Dobson-Hughes (@ldobsonhughes) March 5, 2019

She even went as far as to identify some women of colour whose perspectives she was interested in hearing — and how by not offering paid opportunities for diverse perspectives, media outlets in this country were effectively showing why they are in continual decline. When we mentioned that two ideas we had pitched had been passed on, Dobson-Hughes elevated our voice and signalled that in turning down active solicitations, media was, indeed, reinforcing a tired ideological bubble.

Also, if you commissioned one of the 14 ex-DComms columns on SNC* and turned down @badandbitchy, please accept your role in the reason your industry needs a bailouthttps://t.co/dpLwbS7e6q *I like AM and his writing this isn’t about that — Lauren Dobson-Hughes (@ldobsonhughes) March 5, 2019

And yet we pitched three different ideas to seven different outlets and had only one picked up, by a publication with which we enjoyed a strong existing relationship.

Our approach to discussing the scandal has been through one we know well: being racialized women at work and the power dynamics that exist for us there. Many women don’t necessarily recognize these dynamics, and by giving us a platform, we’re able to raise awareness of the patriarchal systems that structure our day-to-day lives. But more than that, in linking the SNC-Lavalin affair to the workplace, we can show how these issues are systemic and that by allowing an echo chamber of Canadian pundits to say how wonderful Gerry Butts is, we are ignoring the things that not only got him to his privileged position in the first place, but also allow him to be taken as credible despite limited evidence to support his claims.

What has largely been missing from the national discourse regarding the SNC-Lavalin scandal is a discussion of power: power relationships, access to power, and how that power is wielded. We could’ve had a great many discussions about Reconciliation, political party loyalty and how it engages gender and racial power dynamics, and allyship. That sadly hasn’t happened; not because those perspectives aren’t out there, but because the Canadian media complex is a small, incestuous one that prioritizes opinions from those upholding the status quo. We’ve been treated to a parade of op-eds and punditry arguing over the validity of Deferred Prosecution Agreements, the ethics and morality of the current government, and jobs, jobs, jobs — to say nothing of an endless debate over what constitutes “pressure.” Other perspectives have by and large been absent. What makes this all the more concerning is the suggestion in Wilson-Raybould’s testimony that the Liberal government has been all keyed up, whatever the issue of the day, to line up opinion pieces supporting their policy agenda.

Consider how different our public policy outcomes would be if lobbyists, government-relations professionals, and former political staffers did not dominate the newspaper columns or the evening punditry panels.

The perspectives the Canadian mainstream media chooses to project are those from a particular elite class: the political, cultural, media, and business establishments predominantly hailing from Toronto, Ottawa, and/or Montreal. These media outlets seek their consensus while the demographics of society change and technological progress marches on.

The one pitch of ours that did get picked up was published on International Women’s Day and remains among the few pieces that views the SNC-Lavalin situation from the perspective of not only Jody Wilson-Raybould, but also women writ large.

Meanwhile, a recent weekend edition of The Globe and Mail had a two-page spread of columns on the subject, three of which were written by men named David.

With this approach by legacy media, the cost is ultimately borne by society. As we peel back the layers of this scandal’s implications, we uncover truths about ourselves as a country. Yet most analysis of Canadian political culture remains frozen in the past, when society was perceived as more homogenous, where Indigenous peoples were afterthoughts (if thought of at all), when Joe stood in a movie theatre with a screen behind him projecting Canadian cultural cues that no longer apply for a beer that no one drinks anymore. This is the Canada the media still chooses to use as a baseline for reporting — a false image of the Canadian citizen upon which most commentary is built. But context is continually changing, and for a growing number of Canadians, this isn’t a Canada we know; our Canada looks like something else entirely, and it is against this backdrop that political and social analysis must take place.

Canada’s media, in centring the perspectives of a white, mostly male elite, is saying that not only are newsrooms not for people who are from marginalized backgrounds, but neither is the news. How many people can truly identify with Paul Wells’s waxing poetic about the symphony? Why couldn’t political issues be viewed through the lens of pop culture and Cardi B? In continuing to align politics with cultural notes that are typically considered “high-brow,” we are saying that news and politics are just that. And that’s nothing to say of the misguided belief that pop culture is “low-brow” and therefore incapable of being a reflection of our current affairs. The news should be accessible to all. But Canada has only so many Denise Balkissoons to go around.

The future of the media is a media that looks as diverse as the population it’s trying to serve. This whole SNC-Lavalin scandal provided a great opportunity for the Canadian media establishment to show its value — namely why we should fund it directly at the source — and to re-establish itself as a beacon of thoughtful and prescient analysis. Instead, what we got was either the same old hackery, or tepid analysis from those who have seen us through every other scandal this century. Independent media may be an antidote, but is a patchwork quilt of coverage and requires the investment of both time and money. And investing in these perspectives is vital to our collective understanding of ourselves and each other.

Lawyer Dan Simmons objected to Learmonth’s approach. Learmonth saw Meaney’s answers as being slightly evasive, a conclusion to which Simmons objected.

In a week that has already seen a former cabinet minister say Canadians deserve to know the whole story, a week that saw a Liberal MP quit caucus and that saw the CEO of SNC contradict the PM on a central talking point, Justin Trudeau likely didn’t need this.

Jody Wilson-Raybould says she will send a written submission, including texts and emails to the justice committee to back up what she said and clarify what others have claimed.

In a letter to committee chair Anthony Housefather, Wilson-Raybould says she has “relevant facts and evidence in my possession that further clarify statements I made and elucidate the accuracy of statements made by witnesses that came after my Committee appearance.”

Wilson-Raybould says the information she will be sharing includes “copies of texts and emails” that were referenced in her initial appearance on Feb. 27.

She added that all material provided in her written submission would stay within the confines of the solicitor-client privilege waiver issued by the prime minister before she appeared.

That means there likely won’t be any new bombshells dropped on the PM when this information is made public, but it will keep the story alive.

That has some Liberals fuming.

Liberal MPs are griping about Wilson-Raybould and fellow former cabinet minister Jane Philpott making ongoing comments about the SNC_Lavalin affair.

Longtime Toronto Liberal John McKay said it’s one thing to take hits from political opponents, “it’s another thing to take political hits from your own people.”

Environment Minister Catherine McKenna said the two women should speak up and be done with it so the government can focus on their agenda.

Of course the story has been kept alive by the government’s own spectacularly bad handling of the file.

When claims that the PM and his top staffers had pressured the then attorney general to interfere in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin on bribery and corruption charges, Trudeau made a definitive statement.

Trudeau said the allegations were “false” and said at no time did he “direct” Wilson-Raybould to arrive at any particular decision.

At first he refused to deal with the allegation that he “pressured” her and would only speak about directing or giving orders. Eventually the government claimed they did not pressure her, then said they did but that it was not “undue” or “unlawful.”

All of this matters because if the PM or his staff crossed the line, they could face charges of obstruction of justice and up to ten years in prison if found guilty.

Maybe that is why they are so desperate to stop Wilson-Raybould from speaking again and perhaps why she has said there is more to tell.

In her interview with Macleans this week, Philpott said Canadians deserve to know the whole story and that she resigned from cabinet believing the independence of the justice system was at stake.

“I felt that there was evidence of an attempt to politically interfere with the justice system in its work on the criminal trial that has been described by some as the most important and serious prosecution of corporate corruption in modern Canadian history,” Philpott told Macleans.

The Liberals started the week hoping to shut down the justice committee investigation into SNC and make this story go away.

They succeeded in shutting down the committee investigation but their attempts to silence the woman at the centre of the scandal have failed.

They should have just let her speak.

Here, it appears, the goal is to magically switch the SNC-Lavalin conversation from discussion of political interference in the justice system to a topic destined to make people doze off: analysis of the “operating policies and practices across the cabinet, and the role of public servants and political staff in their interactions with the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada,” to quote the PMO press release.

Enlisting the longtime Liberal party loyalist as a “change-maker,” however, offers yet another example of a government once famed for its finesse controlling imagery losing its optics mojo. Anyone following the SNC-Lavalin scandal or controversy or whatever you want to call it knows the problem isn’t “operating policies and practices across the cabinet.” In fact, if there’s one thing both sides do agree on, it’s that systems, or “Canadian’s confidence in their institutions,” weren’t the problem laid bare by the SNC-Lavalin conflict: the problem was the behaviour of the people running them. Wilson-Raybould testified that she faced inappropriate political pressure and interference in her role as attorney general from several people, some of whom have resigned. The government framed the problem as an interpersonal communications breakdown—an “erosion of trust” or the “two people can experience the same event differently” boilerplate that’s become a Trudeau-government mantra. In this context, analyzing operating policies and practices is a bit like obsessing about a car’s brakes after a collision caused by human error.

That said, reviewing a system in place since Confederation is not a bad idea. Wilson-Raybould herself recommended that the justice committee look into bifurcating the attorney general and justice minister roles. But it’s off topic. Dividing the roles also wouldn’t preclude any government that didn’t respect the rule of law from pressuring an attorney general.

The choice of McLellan, now senior counsel at the Edmonton-based law firm Bennett Jones LLP, comes with its own optics challenges. The former law professor and politician, who served 13 years in governments headed by Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin, is respected, a staple on boards and task forces. But bringing in an active Liberal fundraiser as an “independent” adjudicator is a dissonant choice for a government that needs to distance itself from charges of partisan politics. McLellan has also been associated with the Pierre Elliot Trudeau Foundation, where she served as a mentor. The PMO press release notes that McLellan’s former roles as justice minister and attorney general, as well as deputy prime minister, make her “uniquely suited for this role.” But insider familiarity with a system doesn’t make one an objective critic of said system. Arguably, the reverse can be true: no one is exempt from unconscious biases, among them affinity bias and conformity bias.

McLellan’s arrival also signals willingness to take advice from the Liberal old guard, the very scandal-prone establishment the Trudeau government defined itself against in terms of bringing new transparency, accountability, and a decentralized PMO. But McLellan, deputy PM during the Liberals’ “sponsorship scandal,” was also front and centre after the Liberals’ federal defeat in 2006 when the party needed regeneration. She and John Manley, Chrétien’s former right hand, co-chaired a conference at Mont Tremblant in June 2006 that marked the founding of the Canada 2020 think tank. Attendees included Justin Trudeau. Eight months later, Trudeau entered politics, announcing his run for a Montreal riding; five years after that, he was party leader.

Those with longer memories will also recall McLellan’s last federal assignment—chairing the 2016 task force advising the government on how to move forward with its plan to legalize marijuana—triggered its own controversy: conflict-of-interest charges involving business and government, the gist of the SNC-Lavalin case. At the time, concerns were raised that McLellan was potentially shaping legislation that could benefit her employer, Bennett Jones, which marketed itself as an advisor to companies in the cannabis sector; unearthed securities documents listed at least 15 of its employees having been issued several hundred thousand of shares in a company the firm advised, which was positioned to profit from legalization (McLellan’s name was not listed among them).

Drug-policy expert Michael DeVillaer, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioural neurosciences at McMaster University, took issue with McLellan heading the task force in a 2017 paper, “Cannabis Law Reform in Canada: Pretense & Perils, which raised concerns about the integrity of the process: “… the broader entanglement of interests among Canada’s current ruling party, at least one major cannabis producer, and a prestigious law firm connected to both, and of the cannabis producer’s business relationship with criminal elements in the U.S., may nonetheless pose a credibility risk. It may threaten the confidence that at least some public health advocates and the general public will have in the integrity of a process meant to ensure a public health priority in cannabis law reform.”

After the task force wrapped in December 2016, McLellan also came under fire for speaking about her government work at industry-sponsored events across Canada. She saw no problem with her dual role working for a firm that advises and invests in the marijuana industry while speaking about past task force work, McLellan told the Globe and Mail: “When I do these speaking engagements, I do so in my role as the former chair of the task force. I’m not there as senior adviser at the law firm of Bennett Jones LLP.”

McLellan’s new assignment is unpaid (her expenses will be covered), a Privy Council Office spokeswoman tells Maclean’s. She is expected to deliver her “independent recommendations” by the end of June. If all goes to government plan, by then no one will even remember why she was appointed.

Too soon?: By stumbling his way through the opening weeks of the SNC-Lavalin controversy, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau created any number of opportunities for his political opponents to calmly but ruthlessly dismantle his constantly changing narrative. Instead, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer fumbled the opportunity with his pre-mature call for Trudeau’s resignation, writes Andrew MacDougall:

If Canadians are impressed by what they’ve seen from Scheer personally in response to SNC, they’re doing a pretty good job of hiding it. While Conservative support has now surpassed that of Trudeau’s Liberals, Scheer’s personal numbers remain below Trudeau’s. The differential in polling outcomes likely exists because people identify Trudeau much more strongly with his party than Scheer with his, and because the SNC debacle has, to date, been driven more by Trudeau’s missteps than Scheer’s interventions. To wit, Scheer called for Trudeau’s resignation (checks calendar) 12 days ago and Trudeau is (checks www.pm.gc.ca) still prime minister. Canadians will have noticed the misfire. (Maclean’s)

If it walks like a lobbyist and talks like a lobbyist: Last fall Canada’s former top bureaucrat called up Canada’s current top bureaucrat to talk about SNC-Lavalin. In doing so, Kevin Lynch, now the chair of the engineering company’s board, may have broken lobbying rules. Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick disclosed the Oct. 15 call during his second round of testimony to the justice committee last week, but the Hill Times found no record of such a call in the federal lobbyist registry. A spokesperson for SNC-Lavalin said Lynch’s call was merely to inform Wernick the company would be issuing a statement after prosecutors refused to offer it a remediation agreement. As Wernick told it, Lynch asked him: “Isn’t there anything that can be done?” (Hill Times)

Ethically speaking: The watchdog looking into whether the PMO broke any federal ethics rules in the SNC-Lavalin affair has taken a “prolonged” medical leave, according to his office, which said the investigation will continue in his absence. Mario Dion later told a reporter he hopes to be back within weeks and said “There’s no delay that will be attributable to this. (CBC News, Twitter)

When no one wants Alberta’s oil: Twitter fights about pipeline politics, carbon taxes and culture wars are fashionable. But Alberta needs to think long-term—and not just hope for another boom, writes Jen Gerson;

[Alberta] has a bad habit of talking about the need for economic diversification until the next resource boom rolls around to save the day. “On diversification specifically, it’s just one of those words we throw around, but we don’t know what it means or what the actual goals are,” says Trevor Tombe, a professor of economics at the University of Calgary. The problem is that talk of diversification is just that—talk—if the provincial government’s own fiscal situation remains a mess. Alberta has suffered substantial deficits since the oil price dropped in 2015 and oil revenue tanked with it. Just as a decade of Progressive Conservative governments had done before it, the NDP adopted a strategy of waiting for the oil royalties to come back.

When Alberta doesn’t want Canada: University of Calgary professors David J. Bercuson and Barry Cooper imagine a future when Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and parts of Ontario and B.C. have split from Canada to form the Republic of the Northwest:

The immediate benefits were obvious. Indeed, gaining them was a major part of the failed negotiations of 2020. How long ago that all seems now! First there was an end to the corrupting equalization payments. More symbolic, but tied to equalization, came an end to the absurdities of official bilingualism. With the accession of northern British Columbia, the Northern Gateway oil pipeline to Prince Rupert was built in less than two years. The huge new container port, built at the same time, has cut transit times from Chicago to the Western Pacific by three days as compared to shipping through Vancouver or Seattle. (Maclean’s)

417,,2019-03-25T18:20:00.0000000Z,"OTTAWA — Jody Wilson-Raybould recommended in 2017 that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau nominate a conservative Manitoba judge to be chief justice of the Supreme Court, even though he wasn't a sitting member of the top court and had been a vocal critic of ...","OTTAWA — Jody Wilson-Raybould recommended in 2017 that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau nominate a conservative Manitoba judge to be chief justice of the Supreme Court , even though he wasn't a sitting member of the top court and had been a vocal critic of its activism on Charter of Rights issues, The Canadian Press has learned.

Well-placed sources say the former justice minister’s choice for chief justice was a moment of ""significant disagreement"" with Trudeau, who has touted the Liberals as ""the party of the charter"" and whose late father, Pierre Trudeau , spearheaded the drive to enshrine the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in the Constitution in 1982.

The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal discussions about a Supreme Court appointment, which are typically considered highly confidential.

For her part, Wilson-Raybould said Monday ""there was no conflict between the PM and myself.""

In an email, she characterized the matter as part of the normal process of appointing a Supreme Court justice, which involves ""typically CONFIDENTIAL conversations and communications — back and forths between the PM and the AG (attorney general) on potential candidates for appointment.""

She said she's ""not at liberty to comment"" on the ""veracity"" of what the sources said occurred, adding, ""Commentary/reporting in this regard with respect to a SCC appointment(s) could compromise the integrity of the appointments process and potentially sitting justices.""

The issue suggests Trudeau may have had reasons unrelated to the SNC-Lavalin affair for moving Wilson-Raybould out of the prestigious Justice portfolio earlier this year — a cabinet shuffle that touched off a full-blown political crisis for the governing Liberals.

Wilson-Raybould has said she believes she was moved to Veterans Affairs as punishment for refusing to intervene to stop a criminal prosecution of the Montreal engineering giant on bribery charges related to contracts in Libya . Trudeau has denied the SNC matter had anything to do with the decision.

She resigned a month later amid allegations she was improperly pressured by the Prime Minister’s Office to interfere in the SNC-Lavalin case, triggering a furor that has engulfed the Trudeau government ever since.

The issue, the sources say, arose after Beverley McLachlin announced in June 2017 her decision to retire that December after 28 years on the high court, including 17 as chief justice.

Her retirement meant the government would have to choose a new chief justice and find another bilingual judge from western or northern Canada to sit on the nine-member bench.

Trudeau created an independent, non-partisan advisory board, headed by former Conservative prime minister Kim Campbell , to identify qualified candidates to fill the western/northern vacancy and submit a short list of three to five names for consideration.

According to the sources, one of the names on the eventual list was Glenn Joyal , who had been appointed in 2011 by former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper as chief justice of Manitoba’s Court of Queen’s Bench.

Wilson-Raybould then sent Trudeau a 60-plus-page memo arguing that Joyal should not only be added to the top court but should be named chief justice as well.

Only once before in Canadian history — in 1906, when Sir Wilfrid Laurier appointed his justice minister to the top judicial job — has a prime minister chosen a chief justice who was not already sitting on the Supreme Court .

Wilson-Raybould’s pick puzzled Trudeau but he became disturbed after doing some research into Joyal’s views on the charter, the sources said.

Joyal had criticized the judiciary for broadly interpreting charter rights and expanding them to apply to things not explicitly mentioned in the charter or, in his view, intended by provincial premiers when they agreed to enshrine a charter in the Constitution .

The Supreme Court’s liberal interpretation has led to things like legalization of same-sex marriage, the right of women to choose to have an abortion and the legalization of medical assistance in dying, among other things ­— developments Trudeau has celebrated.

In a January 2017 speech to the Canadian Constitution Foundation’s Law and Freedom Conference , Joyal echoed conservative arguments that the top court has usurped the supremacy of elected legislatures to determine social policy.

The charter, Joyal argued, was the result of a compromise between Pierre Trudeau and premiers, most of whom had originally opposed inclusion of a charter in the Constitution . The compromise was intended to maintain a balance between the judiciary and the legislative branch of government, with provisions allowing governments to limit or override rights altogether in some circumstances.

Since then, judicial interpretation of the charter has ignored the intentions of the drafters and ""led without question to a level of judicial potency that was not anticipated back in 1982,"" Joyal said in the speech, a video of which is available on the foundation's website. That, in turn, has resulted in a ""less potent and less influential legislative branch that seldom has the final word.""

""With the 'constitutionalizing' of more and more political and social issues into fundamental rights, the Canadian judiciary has all but removed those issues, in a fairly permanent way, from the realm of future civic engagement and future political debate,"" he said.

Joyal was particularly critical of the Supreme Court’s interpretation of section 7 of the charter ­— the section which guarantees everyone the right to life, liberty and security of the person and under which the top court struck down Canada’s abortion law and the prohibition on medically assisted death.

The court’s liberal interpretation of that section ""has become, particularly in recent years, the single most fertile source for the discovery of new rights and the de facto constitutionalization of political and social issues,"" he said.

Trudeau rejected Wilson-Raybould’s advice. He ended up appointing Sheila Martin , a judge on the appeal courts of Alberta , Northwest Territories and Nunavut , to fill the vacant western Canadian seat on the bench. Sitting Supreme Court Justice Richard Wagner was elevated to the role of chief justice.

Wilson-Raybould’s advocacy of Joyal for the top judicial job may not come as a total surprise to some Liberals, who’ve privately noted what they consider her conservative, restrictive approach to charter rights in a number of bills, including those dealing with assisted dying, impaired driving and genetic discrimination.

Jane Philpott , as health minister at the time, was jointly responsible with Wilson-Raybould for the assisted dying legislation. She quit the cabinet earlier this month in solidarity with Wilson-Raybould, saying she no longer had confidence in the government’s handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair.",Snc Lavalin : Sources say Trudeau rejected Wilson-Raybould's conservative pick for high court,marketscreener.com,https://www.marketscreener.com/SNC-LAVALIN-GROUP-INC-1411719/news/Snc-Lavalin-Sources-say-Trudeau-rejected-Wilson-Raybould-s-conservative-pick-for-high-court-28235017/

The United States has the political train wreck of Donald Trump. Britain has the inept Theresa May and her self-inflicted Brexit disaster. New Zealand, that most peaceable of countries, suddenly confronts the slaughter of Muslim citizens while they are at prayer.

Canada, for lack of genuine trauma, turns a molehill into a mountain. The government is in crisis and may be thrown out of office in October. Over what? Over – let us remember – over a disagreement as to whether the pressure brought to bear on the country's attorney general by her cabinet mates and political colleagues was ""appropriate"" or ""inappropriate.""

There was a genuine difference of opinion among them, a disagreement. Her colleagues thought the pressure was appropriate; she thought it inappropriate. But no one ordered the attorney general to do anything. Her original decision – to confirm the decision made by her director of public prosecutions to proceed with criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin – still stands. Yet the government has been under unrelenting siege for 47 days over a difference of opinion: at what point does ""appropriate"" become ""inappropriate?""

To repeat, nothing happened. Why should anyone who is not suffering from oxygen-depletion in the Ottawa bubble care how many angels can dance on the head of this pin?

It is the stuff of political farce, a crisis inspired by a news media that cannot, or does not choose to, distinguish between a political disagreement and a political scandal, and embraced by opposition politicians shopping for weapons to bring down the Liberals.

Last week, the Conservatives went to the barricades, forcing the Commons into 31 hours of recorded voting on non-confidence budget amendments – all this, however improbably, to defend the honour of a former Liberal minister (and still Liberal MP) against slings and arrows from members of her own Liberal team.

Beneath the farce lies ambition. Years ago, when Jody Wilson-Raybould's father was introduced to Pierre Trudeau, he told the then prime minister that he had two young daughters who aspired to be PM. Jody Wilson-Raybould is not the only Liberal in Ottawa with that ambition. But at the expense of bringing down her own government and electing a Conservative government that would embrace few, if any, of her core values?

There has to be more to it than ambition. What began as a relatively routine disagreement within the government became intensely personal. JWR says she wants to be a Liberal. She could have crossed the floor to the Conservatives or New Democrats, but she didn't. She supports the goals and policies of the Liberal government. But she no longer accepts the leadership of Justin Trudeau.

Her former cabinet colleague (and still Liberal caucus mate), Jane Philpott, fanned the flames of speculation last week when she teased Maclean's magazine in an interview, claiming there was ""much more"" to be revealed about the SNC-Lavalin affair.

As of right this minute, however, only one is planning to do so in public: the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics, which is currently scheduled to meet on Tuesday afternoon to discuss the Conservatives’ already much-discussed proposal to launch a new investigation into what the party is now billing as “the ongoing corruption scandal involving the prime minister.”

The full text of the motion:

That, given the public statement of March 14 by Ms. Jody Wilson-Raybould that “this matter is serious, and some questions remain unanswered”, and given the public statement of March 21 by Ms. Jane Philpott that “there is much more to this story that needs to be told”, the committee:

A. Immediately begin a study of the ongoing corruption scandal involving the Prime Minister,

B. Instruct the Chair to write to the Prime Minister requesting that he waive all constraints that may prevent individuals invited to appear before the Committee from speaking freely,

C. Invite Ms. Jody Wilson-Raybould to appear as a witness in this study no later than April 5,

D. Invite Ms. Jane Philpott to appear as a witness in this study no later than April 5, and

E. That upon conclusion of this study, a report of the findings of this committee be tabled in Parliament.

It’s worth noting that the ethics committee is one of just three House committees chaired by a member of the opposition: Conservative MP Bob Zimmer, who has already publicly stated that the motion is in order.

That decision could, however, still be the target of a procedural challenge from the Liberal side of the table, on the not entirely unreasonable grounds that it doesn’t clearly fall within the mandate of the committee, which, as per the standing orders, is “to study matters related to reports of the Office of the Information Commissioner of Canada, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, the Office of the Commissioner of Lobbying of Canada, and the Office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner pursuant to the Conflict of Interest Act.”

While the ethics commissioner has confirmed that he’s looking into the allegations as a potential violation of the Conflict of Interest Act provisions against “seeking to influence a decision of another person so as to improperly further another person’s private interests,” he hasn’t yet released any further details on his investigation, which could give the Liberals sufficient grounds to ask Zimmer to reconsider whether the motion is in order.

They could even use their combined majority voting power to overturn his ruling, which would effectively block it from debate, although that would make it even easier for their opposition adversaries to claim that they’re trying to shut down the investigation. (Which, to be fair, they would be.)

In any case, while such a move would, at least, mean a quick end to the extra-sessional get-together, given extreme sensitivity that Liberal MPs are developing vis a vis any suggestion that they’re simply following orders from the Prime Minister’s Office, they’re more likely to allow the debate to play out over the two allotted hours before banding together to either a) forcibly amend it to remove some of the more problematic elements (which, in this instance, would seem to be nearly all of it) or b) vote against it.

But Process Nerd, you ask, what if the Liberals don’t vote as a block? What happens then?

Under the configuration of this particular committee, at least two Liberal MPs would have to side with the opposition to set up a tie scenario, in which the chair — who, as noted above, is a Conservative — would have the deciding vote.

All of which is to say that, while there’s always a chance the Conservative motion will be adopted as written, it’s probably the least likely outcome.

Meanwhile, the House justice committee may have wrapped up its inquiry into the allegations of attempted political interference — over, it’s worth noting, the adamant objections of the opposition parties, whose efforts to extend the probe were methodically squelched by the Liberal majority — former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould has served notice that she intends to file a written submission as an add-on to her testimony earlier this month, which will include text messages and emails to which she referred in her presentation, as well as other “relevant facts and evidence.”

What, exactly, that might involve is still unclear, but thanks to committee chair Anthony Housefather, we know what he intends to recommend, as far as how the committee should handle the new evidence.

On Friday, he tweeted that the “standard practice” is to translate it into both official languages, redact any personal information like cellphone numbers or similar data, and circulate the submission amongst committee members for review, after which it will be posted to the committee website.

But while that may be the usual practice, when it comes to an issue as highly politically-charged as this one, it’s hard not to wonder whether the “review” by committee members could delay the public release — particularly since the review will likely have to be conducted via phone and/or email, or, alternately, postponed until the committee returns to its regular meeting schedule next week.

Given that uncertainty, Process Nerd will be keeping a close eye on communications from Wilson-Raybould, who will presumably find some way to give the media and the public a heads up when she files the additional documentation, if only so we can all start the clock on how long it will take to appear online.

Finally, given the twists and turns in the SNC-Lavalin saga, there’s always the possibility of more action on the off-week committee front. Former health minister Jane Philpott could, for instance, decide to submit her own written evidence to the justice committee, given her comments to Maclean’s that there’s “much more” to come out, although it’s not clear that would be in order, as the study itself has concluded.

(Then again, to go back to the optics, how evasive would it look for a committee to reject such an offer on what would seem to most outside observers to be a very minor technicality?)

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau continues to deny that any inappropriate pressure was put on former Attorney General Jody-Wilson Raybould to intervene in the case. He rather claims it was all a misunderstanding. Somehow, almost every top liberal politician in Trudeau’s government had just erroneously thought that former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould was open to granting SNC-Lavalin a remediation agreement even after she said the contrary on several occasions.

“I was not aware of this erosion of trust, and as prime minister and head of cabinet, I should have been aware of it,” said Trudeau. “Situations were experienced differently and I regret that.”

Later, the Prime Minister tried to justify having an interest in the SNC-Lavalin affair on the grounds that thousands of jobs were at stake. However, this excuse seems very far-fetched and he has been called out for it from several quarters.

A commentary on Global News, claims Trudeau’s interference was all about saving liberal seats in Quebec. “If Ottawa were seen to have let SNC-Lavalin get away by failing to give the company a remediation agreement, Trudeau would never hear the end of it, and Legault supporters may well throw their votes to other parties, including the Conservatives or Bloc, in the upcoming federal election.” writes Tasha Kheiriddin“Trudeau had enough trouble in Ontario with Doug Ford; he didn’t need another war with another premier on the eve of an election.”

The Financial Post, supports this viewpoint by insisting that Trudeau’s actions concerning the SNC-was to protect its political interests in Quebec. According to the article,“The willingness of the federal government to aggressively intercede on behalf of SNC-Lavalin is in stark contrast with its refusal to remove environmental and legal roadblocks to actually building the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. The prime minister’s willingness to intervene for SNC-Lavalin reflects a cynical political judgement that his government depends more on Quebec than on Alberta for votes, not an economic need to protect jobs that were never imperilled.”

SNC-Lavalin is said to employ only about 9,000 people across Canada. This number is only aninfinitesimal 0.05 percent of Canada’s total 18,930,000 jobs. Furthermore, a ban from Federal Government projects would not have affected the company at all. Even with a Federal Government ban, the company would still have been allowed to bid on provincial and municipal projects and these projects make up almost 90% of the Canadian government’s infrastructure spending.

The company had very recently confirmed that they were performing very well even after they were told by the Federal Justice Department, that they are likely to face persecution. SNC-Lavalin had recently filed a Management Discussion and Analysis (MDA) discussing its business conditions and outlook where they stated that the business had $10 billion of revenue earned in 50 countries and $15 billion of back orders. This is despite the company being banned from bidding on World Bank projects since 2013 due to allegations of bribery and corruption.

Trudeau knew all this yet still interfered so strongly with the SNC-Lavalin case, it makes a lot of sense to think that he was only doing so, to protect his political interests.",SNC-Lavalin Scam Was Never About Saving Canadian Jobs,Agora Cosmopolitan,http://www.agoracosmopolitan.com/news/headline_news/2019/03/20/13606-snc-lavalin-scam-was-never-about-saving-canadian-jobs.html

With the Trudeau Liberals in full blown damage control mode, Budget 2019 is a simple, two-step plan: Throw around billions of dollars to distract from the Liberal’s SNC-Lavalin scandal before the election and pay for it with tax hikes after the election.

Justin Trudeau promised the budget would balance itself in 2019. With this budget he is now breaking yet another promise. He’ll be borrowing an additional $19.8 billion this coming year alone, all to distract from his own corruption scandal.

If Justin Trudeau thinks he can get away with corruption by trying to distract Canadians with their own money he is wrong. Canadians are smarter than that.

With Budget 2019, Canada’s Conservatives had hoped to see Justin Trudeau and the Liberals tackle the affordability crisis facing Canadians.

According to a recent IPSOS poll, nearly half of all Canadians are within $200 a month of not being able to pay their bills and service their debt. Roughly the same number say missing one paycheck would result in financial hardship.

In the three years since Justin Trudeau was elected, wages have stagnated and taxes have risen. Canadians are worried. They’re worried about having enough money left over at the end of the month. About having enough money to send their children to university or having enough to retire.

More than 80% of middle-income families have seen their tax bills increase under the Trudeau Liberals. And when Justin Trudeau’s Carbon Tax officially takes effect in two weeks, that number will only go up. This is a crisis. One Justin Trudeau helped create with his massive deficits and tax increases.

Budget 2019 should have acknowledged that Canadians are struggling and offered significant tax relief. Instead the Liberals remain focussed on diverting attention from the ongoing SNC-Lavalin scandal.

But while he’ll adopt a more conciliatory tone, well-placed sources say Trudeau will continue to insist there was no unethical or illegal behaviour involved. Rather, he is expected to attribute the controversy to a breakdown in trust and communications between his office and former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould.

The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the statement Trudeau is scheduled to make at an early morning news conference today.

Trudeau’s government has been reeling for the past month since allegations first surfaced that Wilson-Raybould was improperly pressured to stop a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin and was punished for her refusal to give in by being moved out of the justice portfolio to veterans affairs in an early January cabinet shuffle.

She resigned from cabinet shortly after the controversy erupted. Her close friend and cabinet ally, Treasury Board president Jane Philpott, resigned in solidarity on Monday, saying she’d lost confidence in the government’s handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Along the way, Trudeau’s principal secretary, longtime friend and trusted adviser Gerald Butts, also resigned.

Butts testified before the House of Commons justice committee Wednesday, methodically and calmly rebutting explosive testimony from Wilson-Raybould the week before that she was relentlessly pressured last fall — and even received veiled threats about her future as justice minister — to intervene in the criminal trial of the Montreal engineering giant.

Wilson-Raybould maintained the pressure was exerted to convince her to reverse a decision by the director of public prosecutions, Kathleen Roussel, to pursue a criminal trial of SNC-Lavalin on charges of bribery and corruption related to contracts in Libya.

She said Trudeau, his senior aides, the clerk of the Privy Council and Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s office all wanted her to direct Roussel to negotiate a remediation agreement, which would have forced the company to pay stiff reparations while avoiding a possible criminal conviction that could threaten its financial viability and the livelihoods of its 9,000 Canadian employees. While the pressure was inappropriate, Wilson-Raybould said it was not illegal.

Butts countered that all they wanted was for Wilson-Raybould to seek a second opinion from an eminent retired judge so that the government could demonstrate it had seriously considered all legal options, given the jobs that were potentially at stake. He maintained all involved recognized that the final decision was the attorney general’s alone and no one crossed the line into applying inappropriate pressure.

Butts also laid the groundwork for the approach Trudeau is expected to take today.

“A breakdown in the relationship between the former attorney general and the prime minister occurred,” he told the committee. “That breakdown coloured the unrelated events of the fall of 2018 in a negative light for many of the people involved. As the main point of contact in the PMO for the former minister of justice, I take responsibility for it.”

Insiders believe Butts offered a credible counter-narrative that now allows the prime minister to say both sides thought they were doing the right thing but a breakdown in communications between them led to the rupture.

In owning some responsibility for the mistakes, the sources said Trudeau will essentially be offering a way for Wilson-Raybould and Philpott to walk back their professed loss of confidence in the government, rejoin the Liberal team and move on with the heavy agenda he hopes to accomplish before Canadians head to the polls in October.

Both former ministers have said they intend to continue as part of the Liberal caucus and both have been nominated to run again for the Liberals this fall. However, should they persist in saying they have no confidence in Trudeau’s government, the source said Liberal MPs would likely demand they be kicked out of caucus and Trudeau would refuse to allow them to run for the party again.

Wilson-Raybould showed little sign Wednesday of relenting. Opposition members of the justice committee are pushing for her to be invited back to respond to Butts’ testimony and she indicated in a statement that she’d be happy to do so.

Opposition parties also have no interest in letting Trudeau portray the controversy as a family dispute that can be fixed and forgotten. They will doubtless continue asserting that the affair amounts to political interference in the criminal justice system and demanding that all other officials named by Wilson-Raybould be called to testify.

In a letter to the RCMP, former conservative justice ministers and attorneys general Peter MacKay (2013 to 2015 and Douglas Grinslade Lewis (1989 to 1990) and provincial attorneys general Jonathan Denis (Alberta, 2012 to 2015), Cecil Clarke (Nova Scotia, 2007 to 2009) and the NDP's Colin Gabelmann (B.C., 1991 to 1995), say Wilson-Rayboud, in her testimony to the justice committee earlier this week, exposed political interference prohibited under the Criminal Code.

MacKay served as justice minister under former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper.

""'Undue pressure' was placed on former Attorney General (Wilson-Raybould) by political actors urging her to exercise her authority to overrule the director of public prosecutions,"" says the letter, dated Feb. 28.

drian Wyld/The Canadian Press Former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould leaves the Justice committee in Ottawa on Feb. 27, 2019.

It references a section of the Criminal Code that prohibits attempting to obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice.

""We believe that there are reasonable and probable grounds to suspect that the conduct of the Prime Minister's Office has crossed that threshold,"" the letter says. ""In our shared view, ordinary Canadians ... have been charged under these sections with much less evidence.""

On Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould detailed a ""consistent and sustained effort"" by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and top political staff to ""inappropriately"" interfere in her role as justice minister and attorney general to secure a deferred prosecution agreement and avoid a trial on corruption charges for Quebec-based engineering company SNC-Lavalin.

The pressure, she said, began in September and was sustained until December. She was shuffled out of that role in early January.

""Given the subsequent chain of events that include portions of conversations that reference immense pressure and political interference and the subsequent removal of the former attorney general and justice minister from the position ... there is reason to believe that pressure and interference did occur,"" the letter says.

Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer has also written to the RCMP requesting they investigate.
