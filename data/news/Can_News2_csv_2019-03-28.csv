Kristy Kirkup, The Canadian Press





OTTAWA -- Jagmeet Singh celebrated his byelection win the same way he rang in winning the NDP leadership race: on a dance floor.

""We danced the night away,"" Singh said Tuesday morning in an interview as his party breathed a collective sigh of relief following a win in the federal riding of Burnaby South.

Preliminary results from Elections Canada show he was able to clinch the riding with 39 per cent of the vote.

For Singh, the win means he can finally go toe-to-toe in the House of Commons with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau -- something he hasn't been able to do since taking over the reins of the NDP from Tom Mulcair in October 2017.

Singh is now calling on New Democrats to make the most of months leading up to the October election, knowing full well he has a limited amount of time to shine in the Commons with Parliament to rise in June.

The earliest Singh can take his new seat in the House of Commons will be March 18, but he will be in Ottawa Wednesday to lead the party's weekly caucus meeting on Parliament Hill.

""It allows me to ramp up the pressure on Mr. Trudeau, on the Liberal government and allows me to really put into focus the question 'Is this Liberal government more interested in helping their well-connected, powerful friends like SNC-Lavalin,"" he said.

There is no time for Singh to waste, said Mulcair's former principal secretary Karl Belanger, noting the election is just around the corner.

""Now (Singh) has an opportunity to be seen and heard on the same stage as the other main party leaders and it will be up to him to perform and do well and connect with Canadians with a narrative that speaks to their priorities.""

The Liberals and Conservatives were also celebrating byelection wins this week. Conservative Scot Davidson easily won in York-Simcoe in southern Ontario, replacing Peter Van Loan, who held the seat since 2004 before announcing his retirement.

Liberal Rachel Bendayan was the winner in the Montreal seat of Outremont, much to the delight of Liberal cabinet ministers who are declaring the NDP's ""orange wave"" in Quebec dead.

""It's finished,"" said Infrastructure Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne. ""Just look at the results.""

The early Elections Canada data suggests Bendayan won with 40 per cent of the vote followed by the NDP's candidate Julia Sanchez, who had 26 per cent of the vote. The Green party had a third place finish, the Bloc Quebecois were fourth and the Conservatives were fifth.

Outremont was the seat won by Mulcair in a 2007 byelection, a victory that helped the party build support in Quebec and led to the NDP's Quebec breakthrough during the 2011 election. The NDP formed official opposition for the first time that year before falling back to third-party status in 2015.

Singh said it was not a surprise that Outremont was a challenge but he disputed the idea that the orange wave has crested.

""The base that we built in Quebec is alive and well,"" he said, adding that he's planning a visit to the province next week.

Quebec MP Alexandre Boulerice said asserting the NDP is dead in Quebec is ""classic Liberal arrogance.""

He said the NDP is very proud of Singh's victory, noting he is the first racialized federal leader to sit in the House of Commons.

Quebec Conservative MP Gerard Deltell also insisted the NDP is not dead in his province while he stressed no one should be drawing conclusions based on byelection results.

Maxime Bernier, who left the Conservative fold to launch the People's Party of Canada last fall, tweeted on Tuesday to give his assessment of the byelection results, which was the first test for his fledgling political party.

He said he expected his party to fare better in the ridings of York-Simcoe and Outremont, where the candidates earned about two per cent of the vote but adding there were ""great results"" in Burnaby South with nearly 11 per cent of the vote.

The progress is ""overall encouraging"" after five months as a party, Bernier added.

View full cov…,"British Prime Minister Theresa May has sown more confusion into the Brexit process by opening the door to delaying Britain’s departure from the European Union without saying how long the extension might last.

On Tuesday, Ms. May said members of Parliament would be able to vote to extend the March 29 deadline for the United Kingdom to leave the EU if she is unable to win parliamentary support for a Brexit deal with the bloc.

Ms. May has been scrambling for weeks to salvage a withdrawal agreement she struck with the EU that has met fierce opposition from within her Conservative Party caucus. On Tuesday, she told the House of Commons that she believed a final deal was still possible before March 29, but she acknowledged that many MPs have become “genuinely worried that time is running out” and that businesses are growing uneasy about the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. The EU would have to consent to an extension and Ms. May refused to say how long it might last, indicating only that she’d like any delay to be “as short as possible”.

Story continues below advertisement

The announcement was a reversal for the Prime Minister who had spent months insisting that she would not delay Brexit. That stance had rattled many business leaders who feared the U.K. would crash out of the EU without any arrangements for trade, banking, transportation and many other issues. A government report released after Ms. May spoke confirmed many of those fears by pointing out how unprepared the country was for a no-deal Brexit.

According to the report, only 40,000 of 240,000 businesses have signed up for a special customs number they will need in order to trade with the EU after Brexit. The report also said that a majority of people have no idea they will face new EU customs and immigration controls after Brexit or that they will require an International Driving Permit to drive in the EU. Food imports from the EU could be disrupted, the report noted, and there will be widespread problems for financial service companies, law firms, chemical manufacturers, car makers and transport companies. The government also hasn’t come close to converting 40 EU trade deals into U.K. agreements. Ministers had hoped to have all 40 deals in place by the Brexit deadline, but so far just six have been signed and they don’t include large trading partners such as Canada, Japan or South Korea.

Ms. May has been under increasing pressure to rule out a no-deal Brexit and extend the March 29 deadline. On Tuesday, three junior cabinet ministers said they would resign unless Ms. May rejected leaving without a deal and up to a dozen senior ministers are believed to have also threatened to quit. Ms. May finally bowed to the pressure and agreed to allow MPs to vote on an extension. However, she faced criticism from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn who said Ms. May had been ""grotesquely reckless” in her Brexit strategy and was just trying to “run down the clock.”

In her revised timetable, Ms. May is due to present a new Brexit deal to parliament on March 12 and, if it’s rejected, MPs will vote over the next two days on whether to leave the EU without a deal or move to extend the deadline. “Let me be clear, I do not want to see [the deadline] extended,” she told MPs. “Our absolute focus should be on working to get a deal and leaving on 29 March.”

EU officials have indicated that any delay beyond the end of June would be difficult because of elections to the European parliament. Those elections are in May and the new parliament convenes on July 2. The U.K. isn’t participating in the elections because the country is supposed to be out of the EU as of March 29. Any extension of that deadline beyond the end of June would mean the U.K. would have to field candidates for the European parliament. “What kind of message would that send to the more than 17 million people who voted to leave the EU nearly three years ago now?” Ms. May asked MPs on Tuesday.

It’s also not clear if an extension will make it any easier for Ms. May to get her Brexit deal approved by parliament. The main sticking point remains the so-called backstop, a provision in the withdrawal agreement that guarantees no hard border between Northern Ireland, which is part of the U.K., and the Republic of Ireland by ensuring that Northern Ireland remains linked to the EU’s regulations. Many Tory MPs say the backstop will keep the U.K. tied to the EU indefinitely and they wanted it removed or restricted with a time limit. The EU has refused to make any changes to the agreement, arguing the backstop protects assurances made in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that ended decades of sectarian violence and eliminated border controls.",May leaves opening for Brexit delay if parliament unable to reach deal - The Globe and Mail,The Globe And Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-may-leaves-opening-for-brexit-delay-if-parliament-unable-to-reach-deal/

President Trump seems to think so. “We’re getting very, very close,” he told a group of governors visiting the White House in February.

Citing “substantial progress” in recent negotiations, Trump postponed a March 1 deadline that would have sharply increased the rate of tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods. Trump said he hoped a meeting with China’s President Xi Jinping, most likely in late March at Mar-a-Lago, would become a “signing summit.”

Trump’s lunge for a deal may be driven in part by the fast-advancing U.S. electoral calendar. As Democrats begin lining up to run against him next year, the President may be hoping to avoid the stock-market gyrations and economic pain an escalating trade war might soon begin to inflict.

He could surely use what he sees as a big political win on China at a time when multiple investigations, increasingly aggressive Democratic lawmakers, his failure to build a border wall and embarrassing public testimony from his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen are all clouding his political horizons.

But as with his would-be reset with Russia, Trump can’t change the structural game with China with a single agreement. Although Trump entered office predicting he would improve relations with Moscow, lawmakers of both parties continue to accuse Russia of interference in U.S. elections and various other crimes. Sanctions remain in place and may well expand. Neither Trump’s praise nor congressional punishment has persuaded Russia to change course.

The same goes for China. Trump will doubtless win some concessions from Xi, perhaps expanded access for U.S. companies to the Chinese marketplace, agreements on currency management, more Chinese purchases of American soybeans and promises in principle to address other U.S. demands.

What Trump cannot do is persuade Xi to overhaul China’s broader economic model. The Chinese state will continue to subsidize state-owned companies and privately owned national champions, tilting the global playing field in its favor. It will push forward, by any means necessary, on expanding technological innovation to compete with U.S. and European firms in the most important economic sectors of the 21st century–AI, fintech and consumer electronics, for example. On these subjects, whatever Xi promises Trump or Chinese officials say publicly, they will not compromise.

There are also limits to what Trump can offer to get that deal with Xi. If he signs off on an agreement that removes pressure on Chinese telecom giants Huawei and ZTE, each suspected of undermining U.S. national security, he’ll get pushback from Congress. If he tries to use Meng Wanzhou–the Huawei executive arrested in Canada for allegedly violating U.S. sanctions on Iran–as a bargaining chip, he’ll face criticism that he’s meddling in a law-enforcement matter and exceeding his authority.

Even if Trump and Xi cheer markets in March with a broad Mar-a-Lago agreement over coffee and chocolate cake, the damage to relations between the superpower and the rising challenger has already been done. Trust between them now stands at its lowest point in 30 years, and each government will continue a long-term project of making its side less vulnerable to pressure from the other.

In short, the U.S.-China relationship is fundamentally broken, and no politically inspired, vaguely worded compromise will change that.

DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press

Jagmeet Singh faces the biggest test of his NDP leadership in a by-election on Monday as he vies for a seat in the House of Commons.

The Burnaby South vote in the Vancouver region is one of three by-elections taking place on Monday, with others north of Toronto and in Montreal. The votes come just six months before campaigning is likely to officially begin for the general federal election.

Much is at stake for Mr. Singh, who was elected leader of the NDP in the fall of 2017 on a decisive first-ballot victory. Previous NDP leader Tom Mulcair said in January that it would be difficult for Mr. Singh to stay on as leader if he loses Burnaby South. Mr. Singh at the time insisted he would lead the NDP this fall regardless of the by-election result. The 40-year-old has struggled at times as party leader: He has been criticized for low poll numbers and poor fundraising.

Story continues below advertisement

Brad Lavigne, who helped orchestrate Jack Layton’s orange wave in 2011 as NDP campaign chief, said on Sunday that a victory in the by-election would be essential to unite the NDP.

Mr. Lavigne said Mr. Singh has poured considerable personal energy into the riding, through extensive door-knocking and meetings with constituents. The riding has voted NDP in the past on a federal and provincial level. The B.C. NDP dominated Burnaby when John Horgan was elected in 2017, and on Saturday the Premier on Twitter called on voters to get to the polls to back Mr. Singh.

The Burnaby South contest has been turbulent. The Liberals’ first candidate, Karen Wang, stepped down after a social media post on the social messaging app WeChat that zeroed in on Mr. Singh’s ethnicity and highlighted that she was only candidate of Chinese ethnicity. A recent all-candidates’ debate became heated on issues of race and immigration.

Richard T. Lee is the new Liberal candidate. Jay Shin is running for the Conservatives. Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson represents the upstart People’s Party of Canada. The Greens chose not to run a candidate against Mr. Singh.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faced criticism last fall for delaying a by-election call after the NDP’s Kennedy Stewart vacated the Burnaby South seat in September to become the mayor of Vancouver.

Mr. Singh said voters are “very disappointed” in Mr. Trudeau’s Liberal government.

“It looks more and more like this government and Mr. Trudeau and the Liberal party are working in the interest of a massive multinational corporation,” said Mr. Singh, referring to the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Story continues below advertisement

Political scientist Richard Johnston at the University of British Columbia said the SNC-Lavalin case could be a “gift” for Mr. Singh, because it could turn some potential Liberal voters to the NDP.

David Moscrop, a political scientist at the University of Ottawa, said it is unclear whether Mr. Singh should stay on as leader of the NDP if he lost.

“There’s this assumption that if he lost the by-election, he couldn’t show his face in the general election. I don’t think Canadians would really care,” Mr. Moscrop said. “The NDP caucus might see things differently.”

In 2015, the NDP barely won Burnaby South, as the Liberals had a strong showing in the province when Mr. Trudeau swept to power. Mr. Stewart, who had won a close race in Burnaby-Douglas in 2011, won 35.1 per cent of the vote in Burnaby South, ahead of the Liberals’ 33.9 per cent. The margin was 547 votes. The Conservatives had 27.1 per cent of the vote.

The Burnaby-South riding is an amalgam of two older ridings, the southern half of Burnaby-Douglas – where the NDP had a long, but narrow, hold on power federally – and the western half of Burnaby-New Westminster – where the NDP had a long, and mostly dominant, hold on power federally.

Germany's Alternative For Germany (AfD) party (previously) are an insurgent neofascist movement with ties to senior mainstream politicians and the country's super-wealthy would-be oligarchs; the party put on a hard push in the the 2018 Bavarian elections and their meme warfare was full of familiar voter-suppression tactics, from garden-variety disinformation to exhortations to stay home on election day.

Also prominent in the group's messaging: hashtags and tropes from the US far-right conspiracy theory Qanon (previously), an incoherent toxic stew of antisemitism, murder accusations, numerology, Islamophobia, and other pathologies of the moment.

The connection between Qanon and AfD comes from an unreleased report from the London School of Economics-affiliated Institute for Strategic Dialogue, which bills itself as an ""anti-extremist think tank""; some details of the study have been reported in the German and US press.

The researchers traced the inclusion of Qanon-affiliated hashtags in AfD social media, including German translations and adaptations of popular Qanon tags (e.g. #linksliegenlassen, #MerkelMussWeg); as with the US-based Qanon activists, the German Qanon phenomenon was driven by small numbers of incredibly prolific social media users -- not bots (Erin Gallagher's research found that Qanon tweeters posting 500+ messages/day were often ""older retired people with a lot of free time"").

There's evidence that US-based Qanon activists forged alliances with German neofascists; some popular fascist hashtags (""#ChemnitzIstDerAnfang"") originated with US Qanon accounts.

Qanon is becoming a kind of ideological signifier among far-right groups: members of the far-right who have adopted the yellow vest for street demonstrations in Canada and the UK have been spotted decorating the vests with Qanon memes and carrying Qanon-boosting signs. Qanon networks have also been used to boost the virality of racist videos.

I think far-right extremism is the intersection of garden-variety bigotry/xenophobia with economic precarity and a breakdown of the epistemological consensus about what constitutes a reliable indicator that something is true.

Xenophobia and bigotry are always around, but they surge when people feel afraid for their overall economic circumstances, and that surge has been supercharged by decades of both scientific denialism (well-funded campaigns to sow doubt about the motives of climate scientists, doctors who warn of the link between smoking and cancer, etc) and corruption -- for example, anti-vax builds on the assertion that experts have corrupt motives and that regulators are so captured that they let them get away with murder. The thing is, regulators really are that captured.

I can't say for sure that a more equitable economic system -- which would cut off the resources used by corporate influences to distort policy, and by ideological entrepreneurs to push expensive, profitable scientific denial -- would neutralize the far-right, but I think it's worth a try.

The crossover between QAnon and far-right German movements like the Chemnitz riots makes sense. Both movements are aggressively anti-Muslim and anti-refugee. And both make vague gestures toward a right-wing revolution. “At the time I got the impression that some people thought Chemnitz was going to be ‘Germany's great awakening,’” Gallagher said, referencing QAnon’s promise of a “great awakening” in America. It’s a trend she’s previously observed, as America’s alt-right moved on to trolling on behalf of their counterparts in Europe after Trump’s victory in 2016. “I've noticed crossover of US alt-right networks with European alt-right for a long time,” she said. “How QAnon fits into all that is a great question, but the international alt-right coordinated swarms—QAnon related or not—do not surprise me.”

BURNABY, B.C.—A trio of federal byelections on Monday will offer more than just an early glimpse of voters’ dispositions, potentially shaking up the political landscape months before Canadians head to the polls en masse.

“There’s already rumblings that if he loses, it will be difficult for him to stay on as leader — and (it) would probably further undermine the NDP’s electoral prospects going into the federal election after an already underwhelming year.”

“Singh needs to win to consolidate his power as the leader of the party,” explained political scientist David Moscrop, a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Ottawa.

Burnaby South is a key test of both Singh’s hold on his left-leaning party and the popularity of Maxime Bernier’s new far-right populist party, focused on immigration and carbon taxes.

Burnaby South is historically a diverse, working-class riding. Its median income falls 18 per cent below the national average. It has a higher proportion of visible minorities than neighbouring Vancouver or Surrey — even higher than Toronto. It was previously an NDP stronghold.

“I think he will win,” said Moscrop. “But he doesn’t have federal experience as MP … Forget forming government: He needs to show he can hold the government accountable, with only months left until the election.”

So it may be Singh’s to lose.

And with Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada running its first big candidate in Burnaby South — former radio host Laura Lynn Tyler Thompson — the election has seen tense all-candidates debates devolve into audience heckling and allegations of racism and extremism.

“If she can nab even 10 per cent, Bernier will be crowing for months,” Moscrop argued. “This is the perfect time for his party to do well. It’s getting outsized media attention, and they can focus on locking down a smaller segment of the electorate.

“Plus, there’s enough disaffection, not to mention xenophobia, today that could express itself as support.”

Here’s what’s at stake in Burnaby South, what voters are saying their top issues are and why this byelection is being so scrutinized across the country.

Who is running?

Singh, a former Ontario provincial politician and lawyer, is facing off against three rival party hopefuls.

One of those rivals, Thompson of the People’s Party of Canada, has generated considerable controversy by tapping into public anxieties around immigration and refugees.

Also running is another former provincial politician, Richard Lee, with the Liberals. Jay Shin is carrying the flag for the federal Conservative party, mounting concerns over the Liberals’ more than three years in office, expressing particular opposition to certain taxes and drug policies.

There are also two independent candidates running.

What is at stake nationally?

It’s seen as a high-stakes byelection beyond the borders of B.C.’s Lower Mainland mainly because experts say it’s a key test of Singh’s hold on the leadership of his party — which he’s headed since 2017 despite not yet holding a seat in Parliament. Facing the Liberals in Ottawa is seen as essential to his party’s chances, and some have speculated he could face an internal coup if he fails his first ballot-box test.

It also remains to be seen whether Bernier’s right-wing populist party, the People’s Party of Canada, has the kind of broad appeal he claims. Burnaby South is the first chance to test that support in a largely working-class city.

Another dynamic is how well the Liberal brand performs, as the party is currently embroiled in allegations that staffers pressured the former attorney general to stop prosecuting Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau paid a high-profile campaign visit to Lee and faced cheering crowds, but Liberal support has fallen in recent polls across the country, including in B.C.

“Byelections are pretty silly tests of public mood,” Moscrop cautioned, “because they don’t really mimic the conditions of a general election.

“They’re a really strange one-off, or in this case, three. People try to read a lot into them but shouldn’t.”

What is the tone on the campaign trail?

Unusually bitter and divisive for a local riding byelection. Three all-candidates debates in a row have descended into audience members shouting accusations of racism, fascism and extremism against each other and candidates onstage.

The spark has been any conversation about immigration, refugees and people illegally crossing the border into Canada. The subjects have stoked anger at recent Yellow Vests rallies and from the People’s Party of Canada, which alleges all three rival parties are soft on screening people entering the country. The People’s party wants a tighter cap on immigration numbers and more prevention of irregular asylum-seekers.

That’s led to accusations of racism and xenophobia — but some in Burnaby South have cited the murder of a Chinese-Canadian teen, allegedly by a Syrian refugee, as evidence of a public safety risk. Meanwhile, the Liberal and NDP candidates have countered that the actions of one individual should not represent an entire group of people.

The People’s party candidate has accused her Conservative opponent of “smearing” her in a pamphlet delivered to constituents, which included pictures of marijuana leaves and empty syringes and alleged the party supports drugs.

The original Liberal candidate in Burnaby South was forced to resign by the party after the Star unearthed online posts in Chinese pointing out that Singh is South Asian.

What do locals say?

Despite Singh’s future hanging in the balance, when the Star hit the suburban city’s streets to find out what regular voters think, locals appeared more focused on anything but the NDP leader’s prospects in Ottawa.

By far, the most commonly cited issue in this byelection was affordable housing, followed by taxes, jobs, the environment and immigration.

Who are Burnaby’s voters?

Burnaby’s demographics are increasingly young and not white, the 2016 census found. Its average age is three years below B.C.’s average, and 69 per cent of its population identifies as a visible minority, more than triple Canada’s rate. (The Greater Toronto Area, by comparison, was 51 per cent visible minorities.)

Burnaby South is home to a sizable Chinese-Canadian community, followed in number by Caucasians, South Asians and Filipinos.

In fact, 54 per cent of Burnaby South residents say they are immigrants, according to the 2016 census, compared to the Canada-wide figure of 14 per cent. (Immigrants in the Greater Toronto Area make up 46 per cent of the population.)

It’s also a historically working-class riding, with the median income at just $28,183 per year, 18 per cent less than the national average. Burnaby South’s poverty rates are significantly higher than the national average, with 22 per cent of residents being defined by Statistics Canada as low income, compared to 16 per cent nationally.

How can eligible voters cast their ballots?

Polls are open to any eligible Burnaby South resident from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Monday. Since not all Burnaby residents are eligible — the city contains multiple federal ridings — you can find out if you can vote, and where, on Elections Canada’s website.

I want to make clear to our witnesses and to anyone else watching: US military intervention is not an option,"" US Representative Eliot Engel said at the opening of a hearing on the volatile political situation in the nation.

Engel also warned about the possible effects on the Venezuelan people of US sanctions on state oil company PDVSA . The United States in January imposed sanctions aimed at limiting President Nicolas Maduro's access to oil revenue.

Trump: 'Terrible mistake in blocking aid'

President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that Venezuela's leftist leader Nicolas Maduro is ""making a terrible mistake"" by blocking US humanitarian aid.



Trump said it was ""sad"" that the oil-rich Latin American country is in ""turmoil"" and said Washington has still not ruled out sending troops to the region.



""We look at all options,"" he said. ""You'll see,"" he said when asked if thousands of US troops could deploy.



Trump was meeting with Colombian President Ivan Duque at the White House to discuss the crisis in Venezuela.

China denies holding talks with opposition

Beijing refuted a Wall Street Journal report stating it was in talks with Venezuela's opposition leader and self-declared interim president in order to protect its investments in the crisis-hit Latin American country.

""I think that [the journal's] approach is not constructive nor is it professional,"" Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Wednesday.

""In fact, the report is false and it is fake news,"" she said, adding that China sought a ""political solution through dialogue and consultation"" to Venezuela's ongoing crisis.

The Journal had reported on Tuesday that Chinese officials met with representatives of opposition leader Juan Guaido in Washington to discuss Venezuela's 20-billion-dollar debt to China and the status of joint projects.

At UN, Venezuela FM says no humanitarian crisis

Venezuela's foreign minister insisted at the United Nations on Tuesday that there is no humanitarian crisis in his country even as he announced plans to step up cooperation with UN agencies to help the economy.

Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza met on Monday with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres - their second meeting in a month.

The UN has said it stands ready to ramp up humanitarian aid to Venezuela but requires consent from Maduro's government.

190213060829530

Arreaza told a news conference at UN headquarters, that the US has used aid as a political weapon against Venezuela.

""There isn't a humanitarian crisis. There is an economy that is subject to a blockade,"" he added, arguing that US sanctions were responsible for the economic problems and accusing the US of seeking regime change.

""A government that is threatening you with use of force, with invasion, with a blockade, that gives orders to other countries for them to block you, do they really want to provide you with humanitarian aid?"" said Arreaza.

Russia's Lavrov warns US against using force in Venezuela

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned his US counterpart Mike Pompeo against US interference, including ""use of force"", in Venezuela.

""Lavrov has warned against all interference in Venezuela's domestic affairs including the use of force threatened by Washington and which is in violation of international law,"" the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement.

The socialist leader told the BBC, according to a transcript made public Tuesday, that his country may have gold reserves weighing 80 tonnes or more deposited at the Bank of England.

Maduro said the gold is ""legally Venezuela's, it belongs to the Central Bank of Venezuela"".

Guaido: Aid will enter on February 23

Venezuela opposition: 'Let aid in'

Venezuela's opposition supporters will take to the streets nationwide on Tuesday to keep the heat on an embattled Nicolas Maduro and to demand he allow humanitarian aid into the country where food and medicine shortages are rife.

The rallies will take place nearly three weeks from the day that opposition leader Juan Guaido invoked a constitutional provision to declare himself Venezuela's legitimate president, arguing that Maduro's re-election last year was a sham.

The 35-year-old Guaido is coordinating Western relief efforts, while Maduro, who denies there is a crisis, is blocking supplies from coming in.

""We will return to the streets ... to demand the entry of humanitarian aid that will save the lives of more than 300,000 Venezuelans that today are at risk of dying,"" Guaido said on Twitter late Monday. ""This is a time to unite and fight!""

Opposition supporters at the rally said they are eager to see a change in the country.

""Finally we see a light at the end of the tunnel, I believe that none of the students here has had the facility to study, it has been difficult for everyone, it is a way of manifesting the discontent that we currently live."" Elena Davila, a 21-year-old student, told Al Jazeera.

Maduro denounced attempts to deliver aid as a US-orchestrated show to undermine and overthrow his government. US supplies were among the first delivered to a collection point established in the Colombian border town of Cucuta.

""The Ku Klux Klan governing the White House today wants to take possession of Venezuela,"" Maduro said in an interview with the BBC.

""Venezuela is not a country of famine. In the west, Venezuela's situation is distorted to justify any sort of intervention,"" he said.

Guaido has vowed that the opposition, which he has regalvanised after several years of infighting, will keep protesting to pressure Maduro to step down so new presidential elections can be held.

Russia: Venezuela hasn't asked for military assistance

A senior Russian diplomat says Venezuela hasn't asked Russia for military assistance amid the South American country's political crisis.

Alexander Shchetinin, head of the Russian Foreign Ministry's Latin America department, said on Monday that Moscow hasn't received any such request from Caracas, according to Russian news reports.

Shchetinin strongly warned the US against calling on the Venezuelan military to drop support for President Maduro, saying it represented an ""unthinkable meddling into foreign affairs of a sovereign nation"".

Maduro seeks OPEC help against US sanctions: Report

Nicolas Maduro has sought OPEC support against US sanctions imposed on his country's oil industry, citing their impact on oil prices and potential risks for other members of the producer group, Reuters reported on Monday.

The request was made in a letter sent to OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo dated January 29 and seen by Reuters.

""Our country hopes to receive the solidarity and full support of the member countries of OPEC and its ministerial Conference, in the fight we are currently having against the illegal and arbitrary intrusion of the United States in the internal affairs of Venezuela,"" Maduro wrote.

Venezuelan opposition envoy says Brazil will send aid to border

Venezuelan opposition representative Maria Teresa Belandria was received as her country's official ambassador in Brazil on Monday, and said Brazil's government will provide all possible support to get humanitarian aid to the border.

Belandria told reporters several Brazilian government agencies will be involved in the aid operation, which would open up a second route for food and medicine to enter Venezuela after the main one in Colombia.

The aid to be sent to the Brazilian state of Roraima, bordering Venezuela, would not only come from the US, but also from Brazil's government, private companies and other nations, she said.

Asked whether the Venezuelan military will allow the aid into the country, Lester Toledo, coordinator for international humanitarian aid and an opposition state legislator, replied: ""The soldiers know this is food that will go to the children.""

US, Russia present rival UN draft resolutions on Venezuela

The US has presented a draft resolution on Venezuela calling for international aid deliveries and presidential elections to the United Nations Security Council.

The resolution also expresses ""full support for the National Assembly as the only democratically elected institution in Venezuela"", according to a copy of the text obtained by the AFP news agency.

The US move triggered a Russian counterproposal, which contains language expressing concern for Venezuela's territorial integrity and political independence.

Russia's draft resolution criticises any ""attempts to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of Venezuela"".

Doctors demand humanitarian aid be allowed into Venezuela

Venezuelan doctors have called on their nation's military to allow humanitarian aid into the country, the AP news agency reported.

About two dozen doctors held a protest on Sunday in neighbouring Colombia, in front of the entrance to a bridge that has been blocked by the Venezuelan military.

Aid including food and emergency medical supplies provided by the US is sitting in a storage facility near the bridge.

Venezuela's opposition is pledging to get the assistance into the country but President Nicolas Maduro has vowed not to accept it.

Maduro contends the aid delivery is part of a larger US intervention to remove him from power.

Venezuela moves to replace US executives on Citgo board

Venezuela's state-run oil company Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) is taking steps to remove at least two American board members of its US's refining subsidiary, Citgo Petroleum Corp, the Reuters news agency reported, citing people close to the matter.

Citgo is facing unprecedented challenges to its finances and management after the US government last week imposed tough sanctions on PDVSA designed to prevent oil revenue from going to leftist President Nicolas Maduro.

The US and dozens of other nations have refused to recognise Maduro, viewing his re-election last year to another six-year term as fraudulent.

Venezuelan's self-proclaimed president Juan Guaido is setting up bank accounts with US help that would take income accrued by Citgo, Venezuela's top foreign asset, to finance an interim government, Reuters reported.

China calls for peaceful talks

Venezuela should resolve its own matters itself via peaceful talks and China supports the international community's efforts in this regard, the Chinese foreign ministry said.

About 20 European Union nations have aligned with the US in recognising Juan Guaido as Venezuela's interim president and pressuring socialist President Nicolas Maduro to call a new election.

190205064856707

Offering a counterpoint to Washington's hardline stance, the EU and a group of Latin American governments that have kept a moderate line on Venezuela called for dialogue and fresh elections.

The EU-backed International Contact Group on Venezuela in its inaugural meeting in the Uruguayan capital of Montevideo this week said overly forceful intervention could aggravate the crisis.

Responding to that meeting, China's foreign ministry said in a statement late on Friday that China supported the efforts of the international community on the peaceful settlement of the Venezuela issue and hoped all parties would continue to play a constructive role.

""Venezuela's affairs should be resolved by its people within the framework of the constitution and the law through peaceful dialogue and political channels,"" the ministry said.

""Only this way can Venezuela realising lasting stability.""

Volunteers ready US emergency aid

US humanitarian aid destined for Venezuela was being prepared at a warehouse on the Colombian border on Friday, as opposition leader Juan Guaido assured his countrymen that supplies would reach them despite objections from embattled President Nicolas Maduro.

Maduro vows to block 'fake' aid 'spectacle'

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said the US-backed humanitarian aid being stockpiled in the Colombian border city of Cucuta for his country should be distributed to poor Colombians as Venezuelans are not ""beggars"".

190208180029890

The day after trucks carrying medicine and food arrived in Cucuta, Maduro, who has become increasingly isolated internationally, told a news conference that Venezuela did not need the aid that includes supplies provided by the US.

""Venezuela won't allow the spectacle of fake humanitarian aid because we're no-one's beggars,"" Maduro said.

""Venezuela is not suffering the humanitarian crisis fabricated by Washington over the last four years to justify intervening in our country.""

He blamed the shortage of food and medicine on US sanctions, which mostly target regime individuals as well as state oil company PDVSA.



""Liberate the money that has been blocked and sequestered,"" said Maduro. ""This is a macabre game: we squeeze them by the neck and make them ask for crumbs.""



He said the aid offer was ""a message of humiliation for the people.""

At least 14 children die in Venezuelan hospital

A hospital in Venezuela has said 14 children have died this week following an outbreak of amoebiasis, a form of dysentery transmitted by contaminated food or water.

Dozens of other children infected by the disease can not receive adequate treatment due to a lack of medical supplies, employees at the Luis Razetti hospital in the coastal city of Barcelona told Al Jazeera on Thursday.

190208085644270

The staff at the hospital, located 300km east of Caracas, granted Al Jazeera access to the wards because they said they wanted the world to see that they are unequipped to save children's lives.

Marleea Marino lost her two-month-old baby this week as a result of the outbreak, but his body remains in the hospital because she has not been able to get the money needed to buy a coffin.

""There is nothing here, they have no medicine, they don't have food,"" she said. ""And now my son is dead.""

Protesters welcome aid convoy's arrival at Colombia border

Demonstrators at the Colombian-Venuzelan border welcomed an aid convoy carrying food and medicine from the US by blowing horns and chanting slogans calling for a change in crisis-hit Venezuela.

Venezuela has rejected the aid delivery, which was organised by the US and Venezuelan opposition leaders, barricading its own side of the border and vowing not to allow entry.

At Tienditas bridge, Luigi Rivas, a 31-year-old Venezuelan migrant, brandished a cardboard sign reading ""humanitarian aid now"".

""It is a cowardly action he's made,"" Rivas told Al Jazeera, referring to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's bridge closure.

US imposing travel ban on some Maduro allies: US envoy

The Trump administration is imposing a ban on travel to the US for members of Venezuela's constituent assembly, a body controlled by President Nicolas Maduro and denounced by the opposition as illegitimate, a senior US official said on Thursday.

Elliott Abrams, Washington's special envoy on Venezuela, said the time for dialogue with Maduro ""has long passed"", except to negotiate his departure, and reinforced US backing for opposition leader Juan Guaido, who swore himself in as interim president last month and earned recognition from the US and a number of other countries.

Trucks carrying aid arrives in Colombian border city

The first trucks carrying humanitarian aid meant to cross the border into Venezuela arrived in the Colombian border city of Cucuta on Thursday, where officials were to await instructions on how to distribute the food and medicine.

Escorted by police motorcycles, the trucks pulled into the northern city, where desperate Venezuelans were waiting to see whether President Nicolas Maduro's government would clear the border road he has blocked and allow the humanitarian shipments to pass.

US sends aid to Colombia; Maduro rejects help

The US has sent food and medicine to Colombia's border with Venezuela, US officials said on Tuesday. It is still unclear, however, how the aid will get past the objections of President Nicolas Maduro, who has blocked shipments in the past.

Two officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the aid will be staged at the main Colombian-Venezuelan border crossing at Cucuta. One official said more supplies would be staged in Brazil and in the Caribbean.

""I anticipate having perhaps a dozen locations all around Venezuela where such aid will be staged,"" the official said.

The US officials said trucks carrying the aid, including high-protein foods, would arrive in Cucuta this week at the request of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, who last month declared himself to be the South American nation's interim president.

Mexico FM says 'not defending' Maduro

Mexico's government said it is not defending Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro after European nations, the US and others recognised opposition leader Juan Guaido as the South American country's legitimate head of state.

""We don't defend Maduro or his regime, nor are we taking a political position, we want there to be dialogue,"" Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said in an interview with local television. ""We're not taking sides, everyone can have their point of view.""

Major European countries on Monday joined most members of the Lima Group, including Argentina, Brazil and Canada, supporting Guaido as interim Venezuelan leader and calling for free elections.

UN won't be part of any initiative dealing with Venezuela crisis

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says he has been in contact with supporters of the rival initiatives to deal with the Venezuela crisis and has decided the United Nations won't be part of any of them.

He told reporters on Monday that he took the decision ""in order to give credibility to our continued offer of good offices to the parties to be able at their request to help find a political solution"".

Guterres said he has been following the evolution of the situation in Venezuela with ""a lot of concern"".

The presidents of Mexico and Uruguay have offered to negotiate between socialist President Maduro and opposition leader Juan Guaido. But Guaido rejected the offer.

Lima group reaffirms support for Guaido

A coalition of Western Hemisphere nations is urging Venezuela's military to allow badly needed food and medicine to enter the country as the bloc pushes for a peaceful transition of power in the South American nation.

The call came Monday from the Lima Group, made up of nearly a dozen conservative Latin American countries and Canada. It has led the push to recognize opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's rightful leader and seeks ways to remove President Maduro.

The coalition met on Monday in Ottawa, Canada and issued a declaration saying Venezuela's soldiers must show loyalty to Guaido. The group also said the United Nations and the international community should be ready to step in with humanitarian assistance for Venezuela.

Further, the bloc dismissed the idea of opening negotiations with Maduro, who has used past talks as a stalling tactic.

Guaido calls for aid conference on Venezuela

Guaido says the opposition will hold an international conference to seek emergency humanitarian assistance at the headquarters of the Organization of American States in Washington, DC.

Carlos Vecchio was recently designated as ambassador to Washington by Guaido.

Dozens of countries have now recognized Guaido as interim president, but many others back Maduro, who holds practical power in the country.

Maduro rejects European demands, US aid

President Nicolas Maduro is again rejecting moves by at least eight European nations recognising opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate president.

Stand for America, a social welfare group that cannot endorse candidates or make political donations, vows to help every American accomplish the “American dream” and claims Americans’ success is “being threatened by socialist schemes of higher taxes, burdensome job-destroying regulations, government-run health care, and unsecure borders.” The group also says numerous rogue regimes internationally are jeopardizing U.S. national security.

""As U.S. Ambassador to the UN, I was able to see firsthand the challenges we face around the globe. Iranian-backed radical Islamic terrorism threatens the lives of innocent Americans,” Haley said in a statement Monday. “Communist China is spreading its influence throughout the world and engaging in unfair and illegal trade practices. North Korea still has nuclear weapons that can hit us. Russia meddles in our elections and invades its neighbors with no regard for their sovereignty. In our own backyard, socialist dictators in Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua oppress their own people and support narco-trafficking that invades America.”

Haley, a former governor of South Carolina and daughter of immigrants, said her life story is evidence the American dream is still alive, due to “hard work, determination, and the incredible support of the people of South Carolina.”

""My story is proof positive that the American dream is alive and well,” Haley said in a statement Monday. “America’s greatness comes from our freedom and our values and they must be protected for future generations.”

""Even though I have entered private life, I will never stop standing up for America’s freedom and values,” Haley said. “We all have a part to play in keeping our country safe, strong, and prosperous.""

On 5 January, lawmaker Juan Guaido was elected as the president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, which all other Venezuelan government branches have refused to recognize. On 23 January, two days after the Venezuelan Supreme Court annulled his election, Guaido declared himself the country's ""interim president"". Incumbent President Nicolas Maduro, who was sworn in for his second presidential term on 10 January after winning reelection in a contest partially boycotted by the opposition in May, qualified Guaido's move as an attempt to stage a coup orchestrated by Washington.

The United States immediately recognized Guaido, after which some 50 other countries followed suit. Russia, China, Cuba, Bolivia and a number of other states have, in the meantime, voiced their support for the legitimate government of constitutionally elected Maduro. Mexico and Uruguay have refused to recognize Guaido, declaring themselves neutral and promoting crisis settlement via dialogue.

US Vice President Mike Pence said in Colombia on Monday that the Trump administration was mulling new sanctions against Venezuela's government. Pence also urged Monday all Lima Group members to freeze the assets of Venezuela's oil giant PDVSA and restrict visas for Venezuelan officials. The US vice president also called on these countries to immediately transfer the ownership of Venezuelan assets from the government of incumbent President Nicolas Maduro to self-proclaimed Interim President Juan Guaido.

Earlier on Monday, the US Treasury Department sanctioned four Venezuelan governors.

The United States has imposed numerous rounds of sanctions on Venezuela. In January, Washington blocked around $7 billion in assets belonging to Venezuela's state oil firm PDVSA. Maduro said that the restrictions were tantamount to illegal seizing.

The Lima Group of 14 countries was created in 2017 and currently seeks to end the political crisis in Venezuela. The group includes Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Chile, Guyana, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and Saint Lucia. The majority of the organization's member states are backing Guaido.

BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — The latest on Venezuela’s political crisis (all times local):

10:35 p.m.

The U.N. Security Council has scheduled an open meeting Tuesday on the latest events in Venezuela at the request of the United States.

U.N. political chief Rosemary DiCarlo is expected to brief the afternoon meeting.

The Security Council is divided over Venezuela. The U.S. and many Western and Latin American nations back opposition leader Juan Guaido as interim president, while Russia, China and other countries support President Nicolas Maduro and oppose any interference in Venezuela’s internal affairs.

The U.S. call for the meeting follows a widely publicized effort by Guaido to deliver humanitarian aid to the economically devastated nation that met strong resistance from security forces loyal to Maduro.

The Trump administration announced new sanctions on Maduro’s allies Monday.

Colombia’s foreign minister says Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido and his family face “serious and credible” threats on their lives that if carried out would lead to a forceful international response against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

Carlos Holmes Trujillo’s accusation came at the conclusion of a Monday meeting of regional diplomats and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence to discuss Venezuela’s crisis. He provided no details about the alleged plot against Guaido and his family, saying only that Maduro will be held responsible if any of them are harmed.

The Lima Group of nations and Guaido issued an 18-point declaration Monday in which they reiterate their call on the Venezuelan military to recognize Guaido as their commander in chief. They also ask the International Criminal Court to consider Maduro’s blocking of emergency food and medical supplies a crime against humanity and urge the United Nations to play a bigger role in resolving the crisis.

Brazil’s vice president says his nation will maintain its strategy of avoiding military intervention when it comes to neighboring Venezuela.

Monday’s tweet by Vice President Hamilton Mourao came as U.S. Vice President Mike Pence met with regional leaders about Venezuela and said that “all options are on the table.”

Mourao said Brazilian officials “believe in diplomatic and international economic pressure.”

Pence, Mourao and several other top leaders were in the Colombian capital of Bogota for a meeting of the so-called “Lima Group.”

The group is a 14-nation coalition of mostly conservative Latin American nations and Canada that has joined together to pressure President Nicolas Maduro to leave power.

The meeting comes two days after a U.S.-backed effort to deliver humanitarian across the border from Colombia and Brazil ended in violence.

12:30 p.m.

Vice President Mike Pence says the United States is sending another $56 million to neighbors of Venezuela to help them cope with migrants fleeing that nation’s deepening crisis.

Pence said Monday that the United States has already provided more than $139 million in aid to help Venezuela.

He spoke in Colombia’s capital at a meeting of The Lima Group, a coalition of mostly Latin American nations formed to address Venezuela’s turmoil.

Pence also met with opposition congressional leader Juan Guaido, who has declared presidential powers, arguing that the re-election of socialist President Nicolas Maduro was invalid.

Pence said the U.S. has sent five military transport planes with 400 tons of food and medicine to Colombia and Brazil.

Deadly clashes erupted over the weekend when Maduro refused to allow the aid cross, calling it part of a U.S.-led coup.

12:05 p.m.

U.S. Vice President Mike Pence is asking a coalition of mostly Latin American nations to freeze assets of Venezuela’s state oil company following a weekend of violent clashes over blocked humanitarian aid.

Pence met in Colombia’s capital on Monday with regional leaders in the Lima Group after President Nicolas Maduro’s security forces blocked U.S. aid from crossing Venezuela’s borders.

At least four protesters died while more than 300 were injured in nationwide clashes.

Pence called on regional leaders to freeze PDVSA assets — a measure taken earlier by the U.S.

He repeated President Trump’s threat that “all options are on the table” to push out Maduro, whose re-election the United States and dozens of other countries consider invalid.

Pence says the U.S. is also slapping financial sanctions on officials loyal to Maduro who blocked emergency aid and another in his inner circle.

11:50 a.m.

The United States is imposing new sanctions against allies of President Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela.

The Treasury Department on Monday announced the measures against four governors: Omar Prieto of Zulia, Ramon Carrizales of Apure, Jorge Garcia Carneiro of Vargas and Rafael Lacava of Carabobo state.

The move blocks them from financial or commercial transactions with U.S. citizens or entities.

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said they had blocked humanitarian aid shipments backed by the United States and opposition leader Juan Guaido, who is recognized by some 50 nations as Venezuela’s legitimate leader.

___

11:45 a.m.

Germany is calling for greater pressure against the Venezuelan government of President Nicolas Maduro to bring about fresh elections.

Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Adebahr said Monday that Germany believes “the pressure on Maduro needs to be increased so as to move in the direction of free, fair and democratic presidential elections.”

Adebahr said Germany is consulting with fellow European countries, but would seek to have additional EU sanctions target those close to Maduro “and of course not worsen the dramatic hardship experienced by the citizens of Venezuela.”

Government spokeswoman Ulrike Demmer condemned violence at points on the Venezuelan border where opposition figures have been trying to bring in aid shipments.

Demmer said Germany was particularly concerned by “the apparent deployment of militias and groups of thugs to intimidate the population.

10:30 am.

The United States is planning new ways to pressure Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to give up power and to provide assistance to the people of the economically devastated South American nation.

Vice President Mike Pence arrived in the Colombian capital on Monday and immediately met with Colombian President Ivan Duque. He’ll also meet with members of a regional coalition and Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido to discuss the next steps aimed at ousting Maduro.

Pence’s appearance before the Lima Group comes two days after a U.S.-backed effort to deliver humanitarian across the border from Colombia ended in violence.

The Conservatives have owned this vast riding along Lake Simcoe — which includes Georgina, East Gwillimbury, King, Bradford West Gwillimbury and the Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation — dating back five elections. It’s a political juggernaut that, for the past 14 years, has featured Conservative MP Peter Van Loan, a Tory stalwart who triggered Monday’s byelection with his retirement announcement last September. The Tory bid to fill Van Loan’s shoes against a slate of eight contenders from all major federal parties rested with Davidson, a Georgina businessman and political newcomer.

The married father has lived in the riding his entire life, serving on the Georgina Medical Health Board, the Georgina Waterways Advisory Committee, and the Lake Simcoe Fisheries Stakeholder Committee, according to his bio. His wife, Suzanne, is a member of Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation, which makes him “keenly aware of their major issues and challenges,” it reads. The strongest threat to Tory dominance was expected from second-time Liberal candidate Shaun Tanaka, an articulate University of Toronto and Queen’s University geography professor and mother of twin sons who declares in a video on her website: “I know in my heart that this is a Liberal riding.”

Tanaka trailed in second on Monday night, followed by NDP candidate Jessa McLean, but by a wide gap. The byelection in York-Simcoe is historic in this way: It marks the first-ever candidate running for Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada. The newly minted party — it launched in September — announced last month that Toronto lawyer Robert Geurts would carry it into its first political contest. “Take a stand, make a difference!” Geurts posted on his Twitter feed Monday. “It’s time to stop the lies and the corruption.” Bernier joined Geurts for a rally in Bradford two weeks ago. The riding’s NDP candidate is community organizer Jessa McLean. In her nomination acceptance speech, McLean pitched an alternative vision to past elected representatives who don’t “reflect who we are, and who appear to be completely out of touch with most peoples’ lived reality,” the Georgina Advocate reported last month. “People are working harder, but are not getting ahead ...

16,Empty,2019-02-27T12:21:00Z,An under-the-hood look at the share price at which Cronos Group would offer intriguing value to investors.,"Marijuana stocks can seemingly do no wrong lately, and it's not hard to see why. Since October, we've seen Canada legalize recreational marijuana, had a handful of U.S. states approve medical or recreational weed during midterm elections in November, witnessed President Trump sign the Farm Bill into law, and heard of rumors that Mexico may choose to legalize recreational marijuana in 2019. Not shockingly, the first-ever marijuana exchange-traded fund in Canada, the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences ETF, is up more than 50% this year.

But even with rapid global sales growth of up to 38% expected in 2019, not all pot stock valuations make sense. While yours truly has been critical of mid- and large-cap marijuana stock valuations in recent months, no company has stood out as more overvalued recently than Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON) -- this year's top-performing pot stock.

However, just because I view Cronos Group as a stock worth avoiding now, it doesn't mean I don't see value in the business or the stock. There is a share price at which I believe Cronos Group becomes attractive to investors. But before I divulge that price point, let me walk you through my thought process from both the buy and sell sides of things.

The Cronos Group buy thesis

Make no mistake about it, the clearest reason to be excited about Cronos Group is the $1.8 billion equity investment from tobacco giant Altria (NYSE:MO), announced in early December. Altria, which has faced years of declining cigarette demand in the U.S., is looking for ways to reignite growth, without having to continuously raise tobacco prices. By taking a 45% equity stake in Cronos Group, Altria is getting its foot in the door in the high-growth cannabis industry.

Furthermore, Altria's equity stake in Cronos Group, which has yet to close, comes with warrants that could be exercised at a later date. If Altria were to exercise all the warrants it'll be receiving, it could become a majority stakeholder (55%) in Cronos. Given its $3.6 billion market cap, Cronos could easily be gobbled up by Altria and its still-substantial free cash flow. Thus, premium is being paid to the likelihood that Altria will eventually buy the remainder of Cronos Group that it doesn't already own.

On the flip side, once the deal closes, Cronos Group will have north of $1.8 billion in cash on hand to execute on its long-term strategy. No longer having to worry about raising capital, Cronos will be focused on expanding internationally, diversifying its product portfolio to feature high-margin items, and growing its production capacity. This also means that dilution becomes less of a concern, with the company not having to turn to bought-deal offerings to raise capital.

Partnerships are another key selling point for Cronos Group. In September, it and Ginkgo Bioworks entered into a deal that'll cost Cronos up to $100 million. It will, however, give Cronos access to Ginkgo's microorganism development platform. This platform should allow for the creation of yeast strains capable of producing eight types of cannabinoids. These cannabinoids, some of which are rare, could be produced at commercial scale, presumably for a cheaper cost than traditional extraction methods.

Why avoiding Cronos Group makes sense

On the other hand, there are also a number of reasons why this $3.6 billion valuation (soon to be $5.4 billion once the Altria deal closes) makes little sense.

To begin with, Cronos' production isn't all that impressive, relative to its market cap. The top three projected growers -- Aurora Cannabis, Canopy Growth, and Aphria -- are on track for 700,000 kilos, 500,000 kilos, and 255,000 kilos, respectively, at peak production in my estimate. Aurora, Canopy Growth, and Aphria carry respective market caps of $7.2 billion, $15 billion, and $2.4 billion (albeit Aphria has had a crisis of confidence with management of late).

By comparison, Cronos Group should net 70,000 kilos from its joint venture, 40,000 kilos from Peace Naturals, about 7,000 combined kilos from its international grow farms, and some smaller amounts from other grow sites. That's squeezing every last drop of blood from the proverbial turnip for maybe 120,000 kilograms of peak annual production. Investors could purchase about a half dozen other pot stocks that should net between 100,000 kilos and 138,000 kilos at their peak for anywhere from a third to a tenth of Cronos' post-Altria investment market cap (i.e., $5.4 billion).

Cronos Group has also done a pretty poor job of moving into overseas markets like its peers. As we've witnessed from recreationally legal states in the U.S., dried cannabis flower has a tendency to be oversupplied and commoditized over time. By the early part of the next decade, it wouldn't be surprising if domestic Canadian supply far outpaced demand, leading domestic growers to seek foreign outlets to sell their excess supply. Aurora Cannabis is nearing a presence in two dozen countries, whereas Canopy Growth has a presence in more than a dozen foreign markets. As for Cronos, it's made little foreign impression beyond Israel and Australia, which could threaten its margins if dried flower oversupply does hit, as expected.

Lastly, with marijuana now legal to our north, fundamentals and earnings reports actually matter now. Even though Cronos Group is receiving a very welcome cash infusion from Altria, and the duo may work on joint products (pun intended) in the future, the company isn't expected to generate much in the way of profits anytime soon. The four analysts covering Cronos are calling for just CA$0.06 per share (that's six cents in Canadian dollars) for fiscal 2019, and it's unclear if that includes a number of one-time benefits that have been helping pot stocks like Cronos Group. Even assuming Cronos Group is profitable, which is far from a guarantee, its forward price-to-earnings ratio might be north of 400!

Here's the price at which Cronos Group offers real value to investors

Now that you've heard both sides of the argument, I can walk you through the share price at which I feel Cronos Group offers value, which for me is $9 per share. And yes, I'm aware that this is 55% lower than where Cronos is currently trading, which also backs up my thesis of the company as being the most overvalued pot stock.

Just how the heck did I pull $9 out of the hat? Well, on the positive side, I'm factoring in that about a third of the postinvestment market cap of this company will be in cash. Of course, Cronos Group will be actively using this capital to hopefully expand overseas and make complementary acquisitions. Thus, this $1.8 billion in cash might be more like $1 billion in 12 to 18 months.

I'm also counting on Cronos Group to focus on higher-margin products and medical cannabis patients. Its partnership with Ginkgo is a good example of the company aiming for high-margin sales.

Then again, Cronos Group will probably be lucky to turn a profit in 2019, and it's unlikely to even cross $100 million in annual sales until fiscal 2020. That's a lot of premium that investors are giving a company with a triple-digit forward price-to-earnings ratio.

Ultimately, a share price of $9, post-Altria deal closing, assumes a forward cash value of around $1 billion and assigns a value of an additional $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion to its 120,000-kilo production, its high-margin cannabinoid output with Ginkgo, and the intangible value that a name like Altria brings to the table. While still not traditionally cheap, a $9 share price would likely give Cronos a PEG ratio less than 2, which could offer modest upside and represent a potentially attractive entry point for investors.",At What Price Is Cronos Group Worth Buying?,Fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/02/27/at-what-price-is-cronos-group-worth-buying.aspx

The House of Commons scheduled an emergency debate Thursday on the deepening controversy, the most serious faced by Trudeau since assuming office in 2015.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer accused the Liberal prime minister's inner circle of possibly attempting to obstruct justice, in a letter to Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner Brenda Lucki -- which the RCMP confirmed to AFP it has received.

""The matter at hand appears, on its face, to be a gross violation of the law,"" Scheer wrote.

He pointed to ""explosive testimony"" by former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould, who told the House of Commons justice committee on Wednesday that Trudeau's staff and other senior officials applied undue pressure on her to settle a criminal case against SNC-Lavalin.

The Montreal-based company was charged in 2015 with corruption for allegedly bribing officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011 to secure government contracts during former strongman Moamer Kadhafi's reign.

Wilson-Raybould, after resigning from cabinet, testified that she experienced a ""consistent and sustained effort"" to politically interfere in the prosecution of one of the world's top engineering firms.

She added that she faced ""veiled threats,"" and described the intense pressure on her to comply as ""inappropriate,"" but stopped short of suggesting it was illegal.

In the end, Wilson-Raybould refused to ask prosecutors to settle, and the trial is set to proceed.

Trudeau has rejected her characterizations of events, saying Wednesday that he had made clear to his former attorney general that the ""decision around SNC-Lavalin was Jody Wilson-Raybould's and hers alone to make.""

Thursday morning, dodging calls to resign, he said: ""My team and I have always acted in a professional manner.""

""Canadians expect their government to look for ways to protect jobs, to grow the economy, and that's exactly what we've done every step of the way ... in a way that has respected our laws and respects the independence of the judiciary,"" he added.

For weeks, Trudeau's Liberal government has been rocked by the allegations first reported by The Globe and Mail newspaper, only eight months before elections.

COSTA MESA, Calif. – A false claim bubbled up from the internet last month that Sen. Kamala Harris, the recently announced presidential candidate, wasn’t eligible for election because she had immigrant parents and spent part of her childhood in Canada. The claim, an echo of the “birther” conspiracy that trailed President Barack Obama, was widely debunked but still addressed seriously by mainstream news pundits, including CNN’s Chris Cuomo.

Even better for Jacob Wohl, the 21-year-old Californian who ignited the Harris birther claim with a tweet, some people actually seemed to accept it as fact.

“The believability stuck at about 15 to 18 percent by my measurement,” Wohl said in an interview shortly afterward, declaring it “not a bad campaign.”

Wohl, a self-professed “political and corporate intel consultant” and supporter of President Donald Trump, is dedicated to plying the malleable fringe of the electorate with dubious claims and disinformation schemes.

Amplifying him in that quest are his links to the world’s loudest Twitter cheerleader, Trump. Wohl’s father, attorney David Wohl, says that as a Trump surrogate he was on calls with the 2016 presidential candidate daily. David Wohl has regularly appeared on cable news networks to promote the president and his policies.

Trump has retweeted Jacob Wohl’s praise – of the president’s economy, or just general “WINNING”-ness that the “left-wing media can’t stand” – at least three times. They appear to have met at least once, as evidenced by a photo of father, son and president together, and the younger Wohl says he has spoken to the president “several” times. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on their relationship.

On Twitter, where he has 186,000 followers and is adept at quickly responding to Trump’s tweets to gain many more eyeballs, Wohl has claimed, without evidence, that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg is secretly dead or in a vegetative state and that pipe bombs sent to prominent Democrats and media outlets were a left-wing “false flag” operation.

He flew to Minnesota last week to “investigate” the rumor that Somali-American Rep. Ilhan Omar married her brother, a mission for which he tried to fund-raise $25,000 from his online followers. Wohl’s trip to the heartland devolved into bizarre tweets in which he suggested that Minneapolis was so overrun by Somali jihadists that he had to wear a bulletproof vest and travel with a team of “security professionals.”

Wohl’s most prominent gambit was also his most disastrous: an apparent sloppy attempt to accuse Trump's nemesis special counsel Robert Mueller of sexual misconduct days before the midterm elections in November. His actions were referred to the FBI for potential criminal investigation. The woman he named as a credible accuser of the special prosecutor, Carolyne Cass, recently told USA TODAY that Wohl “made it up,” deceived her with a false identity and tried to coerce her to appear at a news conference against her will.

Wohl initially maintained that Cass's allegations were credible. When told that Cass said they were inaccurate, Wohl then claimed that he couldn’t speak about the situation because of a legal non-disclosure agreement with Cass, who denied that such an agreement exists. An FBI spokesperson declined to comment on whether the agency was investigating the episode.

Deciphering the Mueller saga is characteristic of how difficult it is to grasp at the truth with Wohl, who represents a political moment in which even the most basic facts are in dispute.

In some ways, Wohl is simply carrying on the dubious American tradition of deceit in politics, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a communications professor at the University of Pennsylvania and author of “Cyberwar: How Russian Hackers and Trolls Helped Elect a President.” Jamieson described 19th-century political operatives who would secretly buy newspapers to dictate coverage, and the dissemination of false accounts about President Andrew Johnson being a murderer.

The difference now, she said, is that the internet has democratized that deceit. It’s more difficult online to determine the source of a claim, a major factor in deciding whether to believe it. Being repeatedly bombarded with a claim – social media’s specialty –increases its perceived accuracy, even if it’s false and has been publicly debunked. People are more likely to believe a false claim that fits their ideology, and the internet naturally facilitates people like Wohl finding and communicating with like-minded groups.

“It takes a real talent to figure out what kind of deceptions will gain traction,” Jamieson said, and to have both the knowledge of their demographic and technical ability to “figure out what will resonate as opposed to what will be laughed at.”

Wohl disclosed a raft of schemes he says are in the works that he hopes will resonate in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election.

He says he plans to create “enormous left-wing online properties” – such as deceptive Facebook and Twitter accounts – ""and use those to steer the left-wing votes in the primaries to what we feel are weaker candidates compared with Trump.” It’s a plot similar to what Mueller has charged in indictments that the Russians crafted in an effort to boost the 2016 campaigns of Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein and hobble Hillary Clinton.

Another stated scheme: seeking to collect damaging information on left-leaning non-profits including Media Matters for America, the Southern Poverty Law Center and Right Wing Watch by offering their insiders “moral reconciliation,” and if that doesn’t work, “things of worth” – such as money.

Or perhaps those stated plans themselves are a ruse to fool the mainstream media, which he calls a “band of lying goblins.”

Wohl stressed that the accuracy of the information he spreads is “not the important part.” All that matters is how far those claims travel, and how many people believe them.

Wohl said he yearns for the days – before he was born – when conservatives would join in outrage over a scene in a sitcom and funnel that unity into other pursuits, like support for unchecked military actions. “You think about these incredibly large-scale wars that were just launched without congressional approval, and they were pretty damn good at carrying out the conservative torch, whatever it happened to be at the time,” Wohl said.

In the spread of information, he said, truth is an obsolete concept. “It’s something that can’t be thought about in a linear, binary true-false, facts-non-facts – you can’t do that anymore,” Wohl said. “It’s just not the way it works.”

Packing heat at the hipster coffee shop

Wohl chose to meet at Coffee Nature, probably the closest thing to a hipster coffee shop in his resident Orange County, in a nod to the tweets that gained him fame and derision before he was best known for allegedly trying to catfish the special counsel.

Since last year, Wohl has more than a dozen times claimed on Twitter to have overheard liberals in hipster coffee shops sharing pro-Trump secrets with one another, such as that they were actually overjoyed by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation. The tweets conjure up the image of Wohl furtively eavesdropping on surrounding patrons from behind the foam of an oat milk cappuccino.

He arrived at the Orange County cafe in a black Corvette with new-car paper license plates and extended a rigid hand but did not shake when a reporter grasped it. Sipping a free cup of ice water, the thin, severe-featured Wohl, who speaks in clipped verbiage, quickly worked into conversation that he was carrying a concealed firearm in response to the “voluminous left-wing threats” he has received.

Wohl explained that he picks on bohemian coffee shops because he sees them as the “Temple Mount” of liberalism and calculated that “if you in any way impugn the sanctity of the hipster coffee shop, it’s going to be something that gets them really charged up.” In describing his methods, Wohl casually explained that he makes it up: “I’ll literally hear one thing and I’ll flip it 180 degrees.”

Wohl said he was eager to correct the record on the Mueller episode, in which his apparent efforts to disgrace Trump’s foremost adversary ended up unraveling into one of the weirdest major news stories in a cycle full of them.

It started with emails received by several news outlets in which the sender claimed an intelligence company had tried to pay her to accuse Mueller of sexual misdeeds. A professor produced emails showing that she had also been approached for information by the company. Reporters followed a bizarre online trail to reveal that Wohl was behind the intelligence company, which seemed to be staffed by an office full of imagined employees. Wohl and his partner in the episode, Republican lobbyist and conspiracy theorist Jack Burkman, then announced a news conference devolving into farce when a woman who they said was going to make allegations against Mueller didn’t show up.

The result of the Elmore Leonard-esque plot was a media cycle of ridicule for Wohl. One outlet’s headline read: “Fabricated Mueller Smear Appears to Have Come From Comically Inept Far-Right Internet Person.” The special prosecutor’s office broke its customary silence to announce that it had referred the scheme to the FBI for criminal investigation.

Wohl claimed at the coffee shop, however, that a goal of his scheme had been to trick journalists into thinking that he had offered to pay for dirt on Mueller, so he made up a person and sent those allegations to media outlets. On his phone, he scrolled through emails from reporters at major outlets like The Washington Post, The New York Times and Buzzfeed who had tried to garner more information from a person who he says did not actually exist.

He described these emails-- of reporters doing their due diligence-- as trophies from a logic-stretching plan that had as the ultimate goal getting reporters to go to a news conference at a D.C.-area Holiday Inn. “The real allegations against Mueller would have been ignored … had we not roped the media into attending the press conference,” Wohl said.

Someone inside Mueller’s office likely sent out the hoax email claiming to be a woman offered payment to make an accusation against Mueller!



They know that Mueller’s real victims are coming forward!



Tick tock... — Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) October 31, 2018

But those “real allegations” appear to be even more problematic. At the news conference, Wohl distributed a document that was digitally signed, purportedly by the absent accuser Carolyne Cass, in which she said she had been sexually assaulted by Mueller in New York in 2010. In the interview this month, Wohl referred to Cass as a “real accuser” and called her allegations credible.

But when reached by USA TODAY, 34-year-old Carolyne Cass of Los Angeles said Wohl, whom she met on Craigslist, had tricked her by pretending to be an investigator named Matthew Cohen who was trained by Israeli intelligence forces and agreed to help her with “unscrupulous characters ripping me off.”

Cass said she paid the man she knew as Cohen $2,000, for which he did no work but instead offered her the prospect of employment at his intelligence agency and had her speak on the phone to people whose identities she now believes Wohl fabricated.

Cass said it ultimately became clear that Cohen and his associates, imaginary or otherwise, “needed a credible female to put on the line” for false allegations about Mueller. “They made it up,” Cass said of the document accusing Mueller, which was passed around at the news conference. “They wrote it and docu-signed it.”

She claimed Cohen tried to get her to speak at the news conference but she “escaped” and learned only as the scheme exploded that Cohen was in fact Wohl. “He completely lied to me,” Cass said.

Wohl had as recently as this month referred to Cass while speaking in detail about the Mueller episode. But when asked about Cass’s version of events, Wohl said he could not speak further because he had signed a non-disclosure agreement with her and “can’t violate any confidences.” Cass said no such agreement existed.

Burkman also refused to discuss his role in the Mueller scheme.

Both Wohl and Cass say they have not been contacted by the FBI. Stanford Law School professor Robert Weisberg said Wohl’s actions could be construed by a federal prosecutor as wire fraud, obstruction of justice or conspiracy – or as possibly violating various state statutes – but likely fell into a legal “gray zone.”

“The whole thing smacks of illegality and nefariousness and deception, but it still needs to have an anchor in criminal statute,” Weisberg said.

Tax liens and exotic birds

Wohl said he didn’t decide to fully apply his “talents” to politics until the rise of Trump, who he describes as a political soulmate in both ideology and tactics. But he said his political awakening came in 2008, when he was in fifth grade and watched Obama’s inauguration with great trepidation for what it meant for the national debt.

Despite his stated concern for fiscal responsibility, public records suggest that both Jacob and his television pundit father have had their own turbulent financial histories.

A search of television appearances shows that David Wohl – who was admitted to the California bar in 1989 and works largely in criminal defense – has been an analyst on Fox News and other cable stations for more than a decade, and his appearances have shifted from that of a legal expert to a fervent defender of the then-candidate and president.

Like his son, David Wohl has promoted conspiracy theories including that the pipe bombs sent to Democrats and media outlets, for which a Trump supporter in Florida was arrested, were a hoax.

In a brief interview, David Wohl said he had daily conference calls with Trump to hone messaging during the campaign. A spokesman for Trump’s campaign didn’t respond to a request for comment on the elder Wohl’s role.

A search of public records shows that at least a dozen times since 1995, David Wohl has been the subject of state and federal tax liens in California’s Orange and Riverside Counties. Most recently, the IRS named him and his wife in a property lien for $22,002.31 for back income taxes. Though several of the past liens were marked as released, or paid off, the most recent lien was not shown to have been released.

In divorce filings last year, David Wohl’s wife, Michelle, said that he spends money on guitars, watches, firearms, tickets to concerts and sporting events and a recently purchased “exotic bird"" costing $8,000 to $10,000 while “I struggle to make ends meet and live from paycheck to paycheck.”

David Wohl said he had no knowledge of tax liens against him and called this article a ""hit piece. ... Trump calls you guys out for (stuff) like this.""

He said that he and his wife have since reconciled and that her claims in the divorce were ""extreme exaggerations"" and ""garbage.""

""I don't have my lawyer file documents that are garbage,"" Michelle Wohl said when reached for comment, adding that her filings were under penalty of perjury.

Jacob Wohl’s own history with money got off to a rocky start when, as a teenage hedge fund trader, he was investigated by multiple regulatory bodies in 2016.

The Arizona Corporation Commission and National Futures Association (NFA) investigated allegations including that Wohl and his partner had failed to pay back an investor, did not accurately present the risk of their investments and claimed that they had been in business for 35 years when neither of them had been alive that long.

Wohl father and son teamed up to fend off the regulators. David Wohl said he called the Los Angeles Police Department to report financial investigators for stalking them. Jacob Wohl declared in filings that his treatment by NFA investigators was evidence of the organization’s “broader culture of harassment, stalking and thuggery.”

The Arizona Corporation Commission ordered Wohl to no longer trade securities or provide investment advisory services in the state and to pay just under $33,000 in restitution. The NFA permanently barred Wohl. According to Wohl, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also investigated him and declined to pursue enforcement action. The commission declined to comment.

Wohl said he ultimately sold his half of his financial business to his partner. He maintained that there was “nothing even remotely illegal” about his financial enterprise, saying his father “wasn’t going to let me run a rogue hedge fund.”

As he has in his political schemes, Wohl displayed glee for high stakes, calling his financial career “a good experience” and remarking: “Who gets to go through a SEC investigation at age 18?”

A threat from Avenatti

While describing his recent professional work – a vague resume involving doing “corporate intelligence” for a Los Angeles businessman he won’t name and helping Republican lobbyists “butt out other lobbyists” by gathering information for them – Wohl’s phone began buzzing with the screen reading “Dad.”

He learned in the ensuing phone conversation that Michael Avenatti, the California attorney who has turned his representation of porn star Stormy Daniels into full-time work as a Trump antagonist, had tweeted at Wohl: “I am coming for you.”

Avenatti had been under investigation by Los Angeles authorities for an alleged domestic violence incident and had suggested that Wohl was involved in setting him up. Upon learning that criminal charges would not be forthcoming, Avenatti celebrated with the vengeful tweet.

Wohl responded by retreating to the bathroom of the hipster coffee shop, where he retweeted his father’s message that they would be reporting Avenatti’s threat to the authorities.

It’s not clear why Avenatti has suggested Wohl was involved. In a later interview, Avenatti said he was “not at liberty” to expound on Wohl’s role. Wohl said Avenatti has “accused me of putting a GPS device on his car” and “sending thugs after him to taunt him in public,” both of which he denies.

Avenatti’s response: “I have no idea what this idiot is talking about. This child is so stupid and so hungry for attention that he will say anything.”

Like a drawn-out pro wrestling feud, the duel between Avenatti and Wohl will surely have many chapters, each one more convoluted than the previous. Avenatti vowed that ultimately, Wohl “is going to find himself in a penitentiary somewhere.”

When Wohl came back from the bathroom, he bristled at a reporter’s suggestion that Avenatti – who is prone to melodrama, has scads of detractors and is skilled at intertwining himself in the major events of a bizarre political era – is the closest thing to his foil on the left.

“Kind of,” Wohl protested. “But he’s a loony tune because he’s making provably false accusations.”

In a joint statement yesterday, the international group voiced deep concern: ""In particular, President Al Bashir's recent decisions to declare a national State of Emergency, to appoint military and security members to senior government positions, and to issue emergency orders criminalising peaceful demonstrations and allowing security forces to act with impunity will further erode human rights, governance and effective economic management.""

'Return to military rule'

The statement asserts that ""the return to military rule does not create a conducive environment for a renewed political dialogue or credible elections. We note the ongoing detention of political leaders, activists and journalists, and call upon the Government of Sudan to abide by its public commitments to free them as well as others who have been arbitrarily detained. We also note continuing reports of unacceptable use of live fire, beating of protestors and mistreatment of detainees.""

The statement suggests that ""there remains a clear need for political and economic reform in Sudan that is fully inclusive, and which addresses the legitimate grievances expressed by the protestors. Economic stability cannot be achieved without first reaching political consensus. Political consensus cannot be achieved by imprisoning, shooting, and criminalizing peaceful protesters.""

Troika countries and Canada say they will continue to monitor the situation closely, and to emphasise that ""the government of Sudan's response to these protests and the actions of the military-led government will determine our countries' future engagement"".

Restraint

In a statement in January, the Troika and Canada warned that ""the government of Sudan's actions and decisions over the coming weeks will have an impact on the engagement of our governments and others in the coming months and years,"" and urged the government of Sudan ""to respond to the current challenges by implementing the necessary political reforms, to allow the Sudanese people to exercise their constitutional rights to peacefully express their political, economic and social views freely and without any fear of retaliation or persecution.""

In an earlier statement following the start of the mass protests in December, the Troika expressed ""concern about the violence occurring during recent protests in Sudan, including credible reports of the use of live fire by the government of Sudan and of multiple deaths during several protests.""",Sudan: International Troika Voices Concern Over State of Emergency in Sudan,Allafrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201902280675.html
20,Empty,2019-02-27T23:43:17Z,Jody Wilson-Raybould's opening statement at a parliamentary committee pointed to four conversations in which senior Liberals worried about political repercussions The post Trudeau and senior Liberals kept linking SNC-Lavalin prosecution to elections appeared …,"Jody Wilson-Raybould lifted a veil on the unseemly (and blatant) intersection between government decision-making and electoral calculus in the former justice minister and attorney general’s testimony to the House of Commons justice committee. She cited four occasions on which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau or senior aides—even Canada’s top civil servant—brought up a forthcoming election (Quebec’s or their own) during a discussion of a potential deferred prosecution agreement for SNC-Lavalin, which Wilson-Raybould did not support.

From her explosive half-hour opening statement:

Sept. 6, 2018: Ben Chin, chief of staff to Finance Minister Bill Morneau, to Jessica Prince, Wilson-Raybould’s chief of staff

He wanted to talk about SNC and what we could do, if anything, to address this. He said to her that if they don’t get a DPA, they will leave Montreal, and it’s the Quebec election right now, so we can’t have that happen. He said that they have a big meeting coming up on Tuesday and that this bad news may go public.

Sept. 16: Mathieu Bouchard and Elder Marques, senior advisors to the Prime Minister, to Jessica Prince

They said that they think we should be able to find a more reasonable resolution here. They told her that SNC’s next board meeting is on Thursday (Sept 20). They also mention the Quebec election context.

Sept. 17: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, to Wilson-Raybould

The PM again cited potential loss of jobs and SNC moving. Then to my surprise—the Clerk started to make the case for the need to have a DPA—he said ‘there is a board meeting on Thursday (Sept 20) with stock holders’ … ‘they will likely be moving to London if this happens’… ‘and there is an election in Quebec soon’…

At that point the PM jumped in stressing that there is an election in Quebec and that ‘and I am an MP in Quebec—the member for Papineau.’

I was quite taken aback. My response—and I remember this vividly—was to ask the PM a direct question while looking him in the eye—I asked: ‘Are you politically interfering with my role / my decision as the AG? I would strongly advise against it.’ The Prime Minister said, ‘No, no, no—we just need to find a solution.’

Oct. 26: Mathieu Bouchard to Jessica Prince

My COS (chief of staff) said that this would obviously be perceived as interference and her boss questioning the DPP’s decision. Mathieu said that if—six months from the election—SNC announces they are moving their headquarters out of Canada, that is bad. He said “we can have the best policy in the world, but we need to be re-elected.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States said on Tuesday it wants the United Nations Security Council to vote this week on a draft resolution calling for elections in Venezuela and the delivery of humanitarian aid, but the move is likely to be opposed by Russia and other states.

Speaking ahead of a council meeting on Venezuela, the U.S. special envoy for Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, also told reporters Washington would impose more sanctions on ""high-ranking members of the regime and their financial affairs"" this week and next.

Russia and the United States have been at loggerheads over a U.S.-led campaign for international recognition of Juan Guaido, the Venezuelan opposition leader and head of the country's elected National Assembly, over President Nicholas Maduro. Guaido last month declared himself the interim head of state.

Earlier this month the United States proposed a draft Security Council resolution, which prompted Russia to propose a rival text that makes no reference to elections or aid. A resolution needs nine votes in favor by the 15-member council and no vetoes by Russia, China, France, Britain or the United States to pass.

""I would not like to predict what the Russians are going to do. I think it would be shameful to veto a resolution that calls for more humanitarian aid,"" Abrams told reporters.

The Security Council met on Tuesday at the request of the United States, days after Maduro troops violently drove back U.S.-backed foreign aid convoys from Venezuela's border with Colombia on Saturday, killing two protesters and prompting Guaido to propose that Washington consider ""all options"" to oust Maduro.

Venezuela's Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza told the Security Council that a U.S.-led campaign to oust Maduro had failed. ""That was the last chapter in the coup on Saturday,"" he said. ""Read my lips - it failed. Now is the time for us to return to sanity.""

""FORCE-FEEDING""

Guaido crossed into Colombia on Saturday in preparation for efforts to move aid over the border to Venezuela. He then met with members of the Lima Group, a bloc of nations from Argentina to Canada, on Monday in Bogota. Abrams told the Security Council he was concerned for Guaido's safety upon his return to Venezuela.

""What took place on Saturday was reminiscent not of assistance but what is called force-feeding in the United States,"" Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council. ""The U.S. authorities now decided to force feed a whole country.""

Nebenzia also questioned what other countries would have done if confronted with ""an attempted illegal state border crossing for the delivery of unknown cargo.""

""One country even wants to build a huge wall on the border of another country to prevent an illegal border crossing,"" he said, referring to U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico.

China said it opposed the use of humanitarian aid for political purposes.

U.N. political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo said the world body was concerned by Venezuela's serious humanitarian problems.

""Available information depicts a grim reality with the economy continuing to deteriorate, people dying of preventable causes and leaving the country in search of assistance,"" she told the council.

Abrams denied Russian accusations that the United States is preparing to intervene militarily in Venezuela, but reiterated that Trump has said all options are on the table in dealing with Venezuela.

Abrams said that U.S. policy was ""to use as much diplomatic and economic and political pressure as we can ... to support the Venezuelan people's desire for democracy, that's our policy.

""We call on member states to consider what resources and tools they have to contribute to Venezuelan democracy and pressure the illegitimate Maduro regime to peacefully step down,"" he told the Security Council.

The United Nations Security Council is due to vote on Thursday on rival U.S. and Russian draft resolutions on Venezuela, diplomats said, with Washington's proposal calling for free and fair presidential elections and unhindered aid delivery.

The Russian draft text, seen by Reuters, expresses support for a political solution to the crisis and backs the Venezuelan government as the primary coordinator of international assistance efforts in the country.

A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, France, Britain or the United States to pass. Diplomats said the U.S. draft is likely to gain the minimum nine votes to force a likely Russian veto, while the Russian draft is expected to fail without the need for a U.S. veto.

Russia and the United States have been at loggerheads over a U.S.-led campaign for international recognition of Juan Guaido, the Venezuelan opposition leader and head of the country’s elected National Assembly, over President Nicholas Maduro. Guaido last month declared himself the interim head of state.

The U.S. draft resolution, seen by Reuters, asks U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to help ensure there is a free, fair and credible presidential election with international observers. It stresses the need to ensure the safety of all the members of Venezuela’s National Assembly.

The U.S. envoy on Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, told the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday that he was concerned for Guaido’s safety upon his return to Venezuela.

Guaido crossed into Colombia on Saturday in preparation for efforts to move aid over the border to Venezuela. He then met with members of the Lima Group, a bloc of nations from Argentina to Canada, on Monday in Bogota.

The Russian draft resolution expresses concern over threats to use force against Venezuela. U.S. President Donald Trump has all options are on the table in dealing with Venezuela.

The United States and dozens of other nations have recognized Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate president, but Maduro still controls the military, state institutions and oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA, which provides 90 percent of the country's export revenue.

The United States targeted Venezuela's government with new sanctions on Monday and called on allies to freeze the assets of state-owned PDVSA after deadly violence blocked humanitarian aid from reaching the country over the weekend.

In Geneva, Venezuela Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza, addressing the U.N. Human Rights Council, suggested on Wednesday that Maduro and U.S. President Donald Trump meet to ""try to find common ground and explain their differences.""

Maduro also ""stands ready for dialogue"" with the Venezuelan opposition, he said.

Singh addressed his supporters, saying “My friends, it’s a new day. It’s a new day,” and promising to take the issues of Burnaby residents to Ottawa.

Singh said many Canadians are falling behind, despite working hard, and they are starting to become fearful for themselves and their children.

He said some people will use that fear to “point at your neighbours, the people you live with, the people you work with.”

Singh said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was trying to protect his “friends at SNC-Lavalin” and subsidizing big oil. He said Canadians are drowning in debt, as he attacked corporations, saying the Liberals and Conservatives are not helping Canadians.

“Times up,” Singh said. “It doesn’t have to be this way.”

The results

Singh has 38.7 per cent of 20,346 votes counted, enough to be declared the winner.

There are 76,204 registered voters in the riding. 181 of 196 polls have been counted so far, representing 92 per cent of the vote.

Singh was up against Liberal Richard T. Lee, Conservative Jay Shin, independent candidates Terry Grimwood and Valentine Wu, and People’s Party of Canada candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson.

In the 2015 federal election, the NDP won with 35 per cent of the vote, with the Liberals taking 33.9 per cent, the Conservatives 27.1 per cent, Greens 2.8 per cent and 1.1 per cent for the Libertarian party.

Lee has 26 per cent of the votes counted so far. The right-wing vote appears to be split, with Shin so far holding 22.7 per cent of the vote and Thompson with 10.9 per cent. Thompson is the first candidate seeking a seat for former Conversative Maxime Bernier’s newly formed PPC.

“Singh, Singh, Singh!”

Postmedia News reporter Matt Robinson said Singh supporters broke out into spontaneous chants of “Singh, Singh, Singh”, prior to Singh taking the podium at the election night party at the Metrotown Hilton.

Vancouver-Kingsway MP Don Davies has earlier taken the mic with an optimistic: “Welcome to the victory party.”

Peter Julian, MP for New Westminster-Burnaby, said with voters giving Singh the seat, “they’re saying they want a fighter. They’re saying they want someone who will stand up when the government makes bad choices.”

Jenny Kwan, a former and longtime MLA and now MP in Singh’s party, said “it’s a very exciting night. It’s one we’ve been waiting for for a long time. I know that Jag is so looking forward to going to Ottawa.

“We need a voice in the House of Commons that is on the side of the people and we haven’t had that with the Liberals and not with the Conservatives.”

Second place for Lee

Postmedia reporter Dan Fumano was with supporters of Liberal candidate Lee at the Delta Hotel.

Harjit Sajjan, the Liberal MP for Vancouver South an the Minister of National Defence, was at Lee’s event Monday night. Sajjan said he was happy to support Lee, who he described as a “humble, great person” and “I’ve had the opportunity to go door-knocking with him as well,” Sajjan told Postmedia.

“His compassion that he has for his community, that’s what really, I think, sets him apart.”

The Greens did not run a candidate in this byelection in order to improve the chances of an NDP win.

Burnaby South was vacated by former New Democrat MP Kennedy Stewart last October, when he was voted in as Vancouver’s mayor.

Quick things to know

• In the 2015 election, the New Democrats beat the Liberals in this riding by just over 500 votes.

• Lee announced he would be running after Karen Wang stepped down earlier this year after singling out Singh’s ethnicity in an online post.

• Tyler Thompson, who ran unsuccessfully for a school trustee position on the Burnaby school board, was the first candidate to seek a seat for Maxime Bernier’s newly formed PPC. She has been vocal against SOGI (sexual orientation and gender identity) education in B.C.’s education curriculum.

• Green party Leader Elizabeth May had said her party will respect the “leader’s courtesy” by not running a candidate against Singh.

Read Full Article at RT.com","Justin Trudeau has dismissed calls to resign amid explosive allegations from Canada’s ex-attorney general, who testified that the prime minister tried to pressure her to drop a bribery probe into a Quebec-based firm.

Former minister of justice and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould told parliament’s justice committee on Wednesday that senior officials “barraged” her with requests to drop criminal charges against SNC Lavalin, a Canadian engineering company accused of using bribes to secure government contracts in Libya. Wilson-Raybould testified that the intense political pressure included “veiled threats” and even attempts by Trudeau to persuade her to shut down the proceedings in favor of a wrist-slap fine.

“I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the attorney general of Canada in an inappropriate effort,” she said in her opening statement.

Also on rt.com Trudeau in ethics probe over handling of Libyan contract fraud

The prime minister, Wilson-Raybould claimed, had expressed concern that the probe could endanger jobs in Quebec and asked her to “help out” with the case. In total, the former attorney general recounted 10 meetings and 10 phone calls she had with Trudeau and top government officials urging leniency for the firm.

Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she believed her refusal to abandon the prosecution was the reason she was abruptly demoted to the position of veteran affairs minister.

Her testimony has led to calls from Canada’s conservative opposition for Trudeau to step down.

“I was sickened and appalled by [Wilson-Raybould's] story of inappropriate and, frankly, borderline illegal pressure brought to bear on her by the highest levels of Justin Trudeau's government,” Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said.

Trudeau has dismissed demands for his resignation, insisting that he has “always acted appropriately and professionally.”

The alleged attempt to pressure Wilson-Raybould to drop the case against SNC Lavalin was first reported by the Globe and Mail in early February, creating a major headache for Trudeau’s Liberal Party ahead of federal elections in October.

SNC-Lavalin was accused of issuing $48 million in bribes to Libyan officials in the decade leading up to the NATO-led overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi's government in 2011. The company was also charged with defrauding Libyan companies of about $130 million.

The scandal has shaken Trudeau’s image as a poster boy for progressive government. His support for a controversial pipeline in British Columbia has also left some Canadians questioning Trudeau’s ‘eco-friendly’ credentials.

He will be the first person of colour to lead a federal party in the House of Commons. With all polls reporting, Singh earned 39 per cent of the vote.

He took to the stage at the Metrotown Hilton and said, “We made history today,” as jubilant supporters chanted “NDP! NDP!” “I want to promise you something. I will be your champion. I will take each and every one of you to Ottawa where I will fight for you in the House of Commons,” he said to roaring cheers. Political scientists say Burnaby South’s unusually divisive byelection has been a test of Singh’s hold on his party, which has campaigned on bread-and-butter issues like housing and health after electing him leader in 2017.

Experts said that even a tenth of Burnaby South’s electorate casting a ballot for People’s Party of Canada candidate Laura-Lynn Thompson would signal an appetite for far-right policies against carbon taxation and at least some forms of immigration. Such arguments had found support even among Burnaby’s sizable minority populations. After the final tally, Lee earned 26 per cent of votes, Shin had 22.5 per cent and Thompson earned 10.6 per cent of votes.

In his concession speech at the Liberal’s election night celebration, Lee asked the more than 200 supporters present to congratulate Singh on his victory. There was no half-hearted applause; the crowd cheered enthusiastically. “We are very fortunate to live in a democratic society in Canada,” Lee said. “Congratulations to Mr. Singh. He has the opportunity to serve the best community in Canada.” But Lee reminded Singh that he must defend his seat when a federal election comes before Oct. 21 — a remark that garnered more cheers from the party faithful. “I and the community expect him to serve with intregity and grace — before running again in Burnaby South in October.” Asked if Lee would carry the Liberal flag in the general election just months away, Lee told the Star, “I plan to.”

As for what kind of campaign voters might expect in October, Lee said the strategy will be “a fair and transparent politics that is positive.” Lee had replaced the original candidate for the Liberals, Karen Wang, who resigned after the Star unearthed her online posts in Chinese making reference to Singh’s ethnicity. The mostly suburban community where the conflict played out is diverse and historically working class, with a median income 18-per-cent below the national average. It has a higher proportion of visible minorities than neighbouring Vancouver or Surrey — even higher than Toronto. In recent days, all-candidates debates had devolved into audience heckling and allegations of racism and extremism. Some in Burnaby South have cited the murder of a Chinese-Canadian teen, allegedly by a Syrian refugee, as evidence of a public-safety risk connected to immigration. The Liberal and NDP candidates countered that the actions of one individual should not represent an entire group. The tension spread beyond the podium as well. The People’s Party candidate accused her Conservative opponent of “smearing” her in a pamphlet delivered to constituents, which included pictures of marijuana leaves and empty syringes and alleged the party supports drug use. Singh promised to address the uncertainty and fear among his constituency and said he wants to give people hope. Residents of Burnaby South were “left behind” by a housing crisis and the Canadian government purchasing a pipeline they didn’t want, he told reporters on Monday, referring to the Trans Mountain project that runs through the riding.

Share your thoughts:

The federal riding was previously an NDP stronghold. However, in the last 2015 election, former New Democrat MP Kennedy Stewart squeaked by with a surplus of roughly 600 votes over the Liberals, while the Conservative candidate was a close third. Stewart vacated the seat to become the current mayor of Vancouver. Yearly donations to the federal NDP have tanked from $18.6 million in 2015 to about $5 million last year, according to fundraising returns filed with Elections Canada. The party subsequently mortgaged its Ottawa headquarters — the Jack Layton building — for $12 million. Former NDP leader Thomas Mulcair has been critical of Singh, publicly chiding his political acumen and the direction of the party under his leadership. But Jenny Kwan, MP of Vancouver East, said the NDP under Singh’s leadership has resonated with voters dissatisfied with affordability under both the Liberal and Conservative governments. “We need a strong voice in Ottawa — one who can challenge Trudeau and hold him accountable,” she told the Star on Monday. Political observers were keen to watch how the Liberal brand performed in Burnaby South, as the party is currently embroiled in allegations that staffers pressured the former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to stop prosecuting engineering giant SNC-Lavalin. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau paid a high-profile campaign visit to Lee to cheering crowds, but Liberal support has fallen in recent polls across the country, including in B.C. The PPC has carved out space for itself to the right of the Conservative Party of Canada since Leader Maxime Bernier announced the party’s formation last year. It represents the first real challenge the federal Conservative Party has faced from the right since its own formation in 2003 out of a merger between the Progressive Conservatives and the Canadian Alliance.

The leader of Canada's left-wing New Democratic Party and first member of a minority ahead of a major movement, Jagmeet Singh, has won his first seat in parliament. The NDP is expected to pull votes from PM Trudeau's Liberals in October elections.

Jagmeet Singh, a practising Sikh, shot to prominence in October 2017 when he became the first ethnic minority leader of a major federal political party in Canada.

At 40, his win in a by-election in a Vancouver suburb on Monday sets the stage for the NDP to steal votes on the left and hurt Liberal hopes of hanging onto their majority in parliament in the upcoming general election.

In the lead up to Monday's special ballot, Singh struggled with low national visibility and insider criticism of his leadership.

Now, with eight months to go before the general election, he will face off almost daily against Trudeau in the House of Commons.

The third-ranked NDP, however, lost another seat in Montreal held by Singh's predecessor to the Liberals.

Meanwhile, the main opposition Tories -- which are neck and neck with the Liberals in recent public opinion polls -- held onto a seat in the Toronto area.

Pundits were watching to see if an upstart People's Party, led by former Tory foreign minister Maxime Bernier, would split away significant votes from the Conservatives on the right -- which would help the Liberals in October.

But it barely registered in all three special ballots held Monday.

The rupee has gone from being the best-performing Asian currency last quarter to the worst this year, sovereign bonds are set for a second month of declines and equities have sat out the rally that’s driven Asian stocks to a four-month high.

The nervousness ratcheted up Wednesday after Pakistani fighter jets struck at targets inside Indian-controlled Kashmir, prompting both nations to close down large swathes of airspace as tensions between them reached their highest point since a 1971 war. The conflict came a day after India bombed a major terror camp inside Pakistan.

“Further geopolitical tensions will increase the premium in the rupee assets,” said Eugene Leow, a rates strategist at DBS Bank Ltd. in Singapore. “This is already reflected in the increasingly divergent forex and bond performance between the two high-yielders in Asia -- Indonesia and India.”

The rupee lost 0.3 percent to 71.2475 dollar at the close and the yield on most-traded 2028 bonds surged nine basis points to 7.68 percent. The S&P BSE Sensex index of stocks erased almost all of its intraday gain of 1.1 percent to end marginally in the red. Across the border, Pakistan’s main equities gauge fell 0.3 percent to the lowest level since Jan. 7.

The modest reaction prompted some analysts to say that markets are underestimating the impact of a further flare up.

Optimism about the U.S.-China trade talks and the Brexit delay are “distracting traders and investors from the broader point that military escalation between two nuclear powers has huge implications,” said Sue Trinh, head of Asia FX strategy at Royal Bank of Canada.

This week’s skirmish represents the worst escalation since 2001, when the countries moved ballistic missiles and troops to their border following an attack on parliament in New Delhi that was also blamed on Jaish-e-Mohammad. The two nations have fought three major wars since partition and independence in 1947.

“If India responds again there will a problem in the short term,” said Aneesh Srivastava, chief investment officer at IDBI Federal Life Insurance Co. “This issue may continue to simmer until elections.”

Poll Prospects

Facing a general election due by May, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is under pressure after blaming Pakistan for the worst attack on security forces in Kashmir in decades earlier this month. There’s a possibility for this event to unite the nation behind Modi at the polls, which could help support markets, analysts including Saktiandi Supaat at Maybank wrote in a note, advising clients to buy the rupee on declines.

Maybank’s not alone in recommending the buy-the-dips strategy. Global funds bought a net $487.5 million of shares so far this week, taking the month’s purchases to $2.3 billion. That’s set to be the biggest inflow since November 2017, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

“India is still a good place to pick good stocks, and yesterday we saw foreigners coming back to buy,” said Sameer Kalra, president at Mumbai-based advisory Target Investing. “There will be short-term pain if this escalates but the outcome of an escalation helps India prove that Pakistan is being used as a terror ground. We remain a buyer.”

The US vice-president, Mike Pence, has repeated a veiled threat of military intervention in Venezuela, but Washington appeared increasingly isolated in its willingness to contemplate using force to oust President Nicolás Maduro.

European powers and some of Donald Trump’s key Latin American allies – all of whom have recognised the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, as Venezuela’s legitimate leader – warned that they would oppose sending troops into the country.

Guaidó had for weeks insisted his movement was focused on peaceful, democratic change. But after the opposition failed in a weekend bid to defy Caracas and bring aid into the country, he called on the international community to “keep all options open”.

That hint at the use of military force won an enthusiastic response from hawks like US senator Marco Rubio, but sparked alarm elsewhere, particularly as Trump has previously mooted ordering an invasion.

Speaking at an emergency summit of regional leaders in the Colombian capital Bogotá, Pence renewed the threat of intervention, describing Maduro as “a usurper”, and calling for a global push to oust him.

“To leaders around the world: it’s time. There can be no bystanders in Venezuela’s struggle for freedom,” he said. “We hope for a peaceful transition to democracy, but as President Trump has made clear, all options are on the table.”

But beyond the US, few appear willing embrace the prospect of violence. In Latin America, there is a painful and bloody history of US interventions, and the terrible fallout from the 2003 invasion of Iraq is another deterrent to the use of military force.

An invasion would be complicated and bloody, with a strong chance of sliding into protracted civil war. Venezuela has armed forces that are more than 300,000 strong, thousands more members of pro-government gangs or guerrilla groups, complex terrain – and a government that still has some support from international partners including China and Russia.

Brazil’s vice-president, retired general Hamilton Mourão, said on Monday that under no circumstances would his country allow the United States to intervene militarily from Brazilian territory, even though the country’s rightwing president Jair Bolsonaro has previously vowed to do “everything for democracy to be re-established” in Venezuela.

Colombian president Iván Duque has also now ruled out intervention, according to sources in his administration. Chile and Peru were among other regional powers opposing military action on Monday.

There was similar concern across the Atlantic, where European nations including Spain and Germany made clear they considered the deployment of troops a line that should not be crossed.

“Not every option is on the table,” the country’s foreign minister, Josep Borrell, told the Spanish news agency Efe on Sunday, in a blunt rebuke to both Guaidó and US supporters of intervention.

The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, insisted there could be no military solution to a political crisis.

“The origins of the ongoing crisis in Venezuela are political and institutional, hence the solution can only be a political one,” she said in a statement. “We reiterate our firm rejection and condemnation of violence and of any initiatives that can further destabilise the region.”

Before the meeting of the Lima group of Latin American powers and Canada, Pence told Guaidó, attending as Venezuela’s interim president: “We are 100% with you.”

The Lima group also said credible threats have been made against the life of Venezuelan opposition leader Guaidó and his family, adding that President Nicolas Maduro was responsible for Guaido’s safety.",'Maduro must go': Pence bids to ramp up effort to oust Venezuelan leader,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/apos-maduro-must-apos-pence-193214527.html

And Royal Bank of Canada says the currency may suffer more pain.

The rupee may weaken to 80 per dollar by September as a dovish turn by the central bank lowers the currency’s yield appeal, said Sue Trinh, head of Asia forex strategy at RBC in Hong Kong. The prediction is way more bearish than the 71.25 median forecast in a Bloomberg survey, and implies a drop of more than 11 percent from current levels.

Reserve Bank of India’s new chief Shaktikanta Das cut interest rates last month to support the economy, and kept the door open for more easing citing growth concerns. Data on Thursday showed expansion in the three months ended December slowed to the weakest pace in five quarters, just as the outlook gets clouded by growing tensions with Pakistan.

“The combination of consumer inflation undershoots and dovish policy bias of Governor Das suggests big rate cuts could be around the corner,” Trinh said. The challenge of funding the widening budget deficit will also weigh on the currency, she said.

The rupee is already the worst performer this year in Asia ex-Japan amid the uncertainty surrounding the upcoming elections, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seen facing a tight contest. This week’s military skirmish with Pakistan added to the anxiety, though the currency did rally hard late Thursday as Pakistan said it will release a captured Indian pilot as a gesture of peace.

“It is not specific to India, but everywhere you look there are potential flashpoints that can flare up at the drop of a dime in the context of slowing global growth, massive levels of debt and increasingly desperate governments,” Trinh said. This risk is being “under-priced” by markets, she said.

The draft resolution is likely to be opposed by Russia, the diplomats said. A resolution needs nine votes in favour and no vetoes by Russia, China, France, Britain and the United States to pass.

Russia and the United States have been at loggerheads over a U.S.-led campaign for international recognition of Juan Guaido, the Venezuelan opposition leader and head of the country’s elected National Assembly, over President Nicholas Maduro. Guaido last month declared himself the interim head of state.

Earlier this month the United States proposed a draft Security Council resolution, which prompted Russia to propose a rival text that makes no reference to elections or aid. A revised U.S. draft, seen by Reuters, was circulated on Wednesday. It was unclear if Russia planned to put its text to a vote as well.

The U.S. draft asks U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to help ensure there is a free, fair and credible presidential election with international observers. It stresses the need to ensure the safety of all the members of Venezuela’s National Assembly.

The U.S. envoy on Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, told the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday that he was concerned for Guaido’s safety upon his return to Venezuela.

Guaido crossed into Colombia on Saturday in preparation for efforts to move aid over the border to Venezuela. He then met with members of the Lima Group, a bloc of nations from Argentina to Canada, on Monday in Bogota.

The United States and dozens of other nations have recognised Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate president, but Maduro still controls the military, state institutions and oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA [PDVSA.UL], which provides 90 percent of the country's export revenue.

The United States targeted Venezuela's government with new sanctions on Monday and called on allies to freeze the assets of state-owned PDVSA after deadly violence blocked humanitarian aid from reaching the country over the weekend.

In Geneva, Venezuela Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza, addressing the U.N. Human Rights Council, suggested on Wednesday that Maduro and U.S. President Donald Trump meet to ""try to find common ground and explain their differences.""

Maduro also ""stands ready for dialogue"" with the Venezuelan opposition, he said.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council is due to vote on Thursday on rival U.S. and Russian draft resolutions on Venezuela, diplomats said, with Washington's proposal calling for free and fair presidential elections and unhindered aid delivery.

The Russian draft text, seen by Reuters, expresses support for a political solution to the crisis and backs the Venezuelan government as the primary coordinator of international assistance efforts in the country.

A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, France, Britain or the United States to pass. Diplomats said the U.S. draft is likely to gain the minimum nine votes to force a likely Russian veto, while the Russian draft is expected to fail without the need for a U.S. veto.

34,Empty,2019-02-26T04:00:54Z,The win returns the riding to its Liberal roots after 11 years under NDP’s Tom Mulcair.,"MONTREAL—The NDP era in Outremont came to a close Monday as voters in this diverse urban riding returned to their long-standing tradition of electing Liberals to the House of Commons. Months after former NDP leader Tom Mulcair resigned the seat he held for 11 years, residents of this central swath of Quebec’s biggest city were on track to be represented again by a Liberal, according to late night results from Elections Canada.

Rachel Bendayan, a lawyer who ran as the “Team Trudeau” candidate here, thanked her family and campaign supporters in a victory speech at a Mile End lounge late Monday night. With all polls reporting, results showed she won just over 40 per cent of votes. The NDP came second with 26 per cent. “This victory wouldn’t be possible without you,” Bendayan said in French. “Today our voices were heard,” she said, stating that voters “spoke loud and proud in favour of Liberal values.”

Outremont is home to some 100,000 Montrealers in a riding that comprises the Côtes-des-Neiges neighbourhood, part of Mile End and portions of downtown Montreal near the centre of the island where the city is located. But while the riding was a Liberal stronghold for most of the 20th century, its more recent history has made it significant for New Democrats as well. Outremont became the party’s symbolic toehold in Quebec, when Mulcair won a 2007 byelection and successfully defended the seat the following year, marking the first time the NDP ever won a riding in the province in a general election.

Three years later, the “orange wave” surge of support in the province lifted the NDP to its best election result ever. Now that Mulcair is retired from political life — almost three years after he was turfed as leader following the party’s 2015 election defeat — local NDP candidate Julia Sanchez hoped to maintain the party’s grip in this diverse central Montreal riding. Polls in the province suggested her main foe in the byelection was Bendayan. A few hours before the polls closed Monday evening, Sanchez canvassed voters at a local metro station, and introduced herself to people in cafes and shops in the riding. “I got into this race because of how hugely important it is — Outremont — for the NDP,” she said. “All of that made it super exciting and important to me ... It’s not just any byelection.” David Coletto, chief executive officer of Abacus Data, said Monday’s result could be a bellwether for the party’s standing in the province, given that it is the first test in “the heart of the rise of the orange wave” since the last federal election. Their performance in Outremont — a multicultural district in the urban heart of Montreal — may signal whether the NDP’s allure to Quebec voters has faded under Jagmeet Singh’s leadership. Monday’s byelection was also the first time voters in Quebec cast ballots since the Bloc Québécois new leader, Yves-François Blanchet, took over last year. Michel Duchesne, an author who is the party’s candidate in Outremont, campaigned for the separatist party on a push to protect Quebec culture in the digital era. His background could help lift the Bloc in a riding that many artists call home, one NDP insider suggested. “If they come third or fourth, that’s a big problem,” Coletto said of the NDP, pointing out that more than a third of the party’s MPs in the Commons are from Quebec. “That’s something they’re going to have to somehow explain.” The Conservative candidate in the race was Jasmine Louras, a University of Ottawa law student. Daniel Green ran for the Green Party and James Seale campaigned for Maxime Bernier’s upstart People’s Party. Alex Ballingall is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

Sputnik News

00:43 26.02.2019(updated 01:40 26.02.2019)

The Lima Group on Monday asked the International Criminal Court (ICC) to make an assessment of the situation in crisis-torn Venezuela, proposing that Venezuela's partners help organize ""free elections"" in the country.

""We have decided to turn to the International Criminal Court with a request to take into account the grave humanitarian situation in Venezuela, the criminal violence of [Venezuelan President] Nicolas Maduro's regime against civilians and the denial of access to international aid, which is a crime against humanity"", the statement said.

Participants at the Lima Group meeting also stressed that the transition to ""democracy"" must be performed by Venezuelans themselves without the use of force and in line with the country's constitution.

""We call on the countries that continue to maintain partnership relations with Nicolas Maduro's illegitimate regime, to help find solutions that would open the way to a democratic transition and the holding of free, fair, transparent and credible elections"", the statement added.

Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo called on the international community to join the Lima Group on the situation in Venezuela.

""It is important to invite more and more members of the international community, those who will participate with us in the expanded dialogue, so that they will join the actions that are made by us as the Lima Group and will support Venezuelans' efforts aimed at restoring democracy and hope"", the foreign minister said Monday.

On 5 January, lawmaker Juan Guaido was elected as the president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, which all other Venezuelan government branches have refused to recognize. On 23 January, two days after the Venezuelan Supreme Court annulled his election, Guaido declared himself the country's ""interim president"". Incumbent President Nicolas Maduro, who was sworn in for his second presidential term on 10 January after winning reelection in a contest partially boycotted by the opposition in May, qualified Guaido's move as an attempt to stage a coup orchestrated by Washington.

The United States immediately recognized Guaido, after which some 50 other countries followed suit. Russia, China, Cuba, Bolivia and a number of other states have, in the meantime, voiced their support for the legitimate government of constitutionally elected Maduro. Mexico and Uruguay have refused to recognize Guaido, declaring themselves neutral and promoting crisis settlement via dialogue.

US Vice President Mike Pence said in Colombia on Monday that the Trump administration was mulling new sanctions against Venezuela's government. Pence also urged Monday all Lima Group members to freeze the assets of Venezuela's oil giant PDVSA and restrict visas for Venezuelan officials. The US vice president also called on these countries to immediately transfer the ownership of Venezuelan assets from the government of incumbent President Nicolas Maduro to self-proclaimed Interim President Juan Guaido.

Earlier on Monday, the US Treasury Department sanctioned four Venezuelan governors.

The United States has imposed numerous rounds of sanctions on Venezuela. In January, Washington blocked around $7 billion in assets belonging to Venezuela's state oil firm PDVSA. Maduro said that the restrictions were tantamount to illegal seizing.

The Lima Group of 14 countries was created in 2017 and currently seeks to end the political crisis in Venezuela. The group includes Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Chile, Guyana, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and Saint Lucia. The majority of the organization's member states are backing Guaido.

Glob…","NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is on his way to the House of Commons, Justin Trudeau’s Liberals are poised to make further gains in Quebec and Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives need to keep an eye on Maxime Bernier’s splinter movement, after by-elections Monday that took the political temperature in the country’s three largest provinces.

Mr. Singh won the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South with 39 per cent of the vote. Only a few months ago there were rumours that the NDP was trailing the Liberals in the riding; had he lost, Mr. Singh would have become the answer to an embarrassing trivia question.

But things ultimately went his way. The first nominated Liberal candidate, Karen Wang, was forced to withdraw, after predicting Chinese-Canadian voters would prefer her over a candidate of “Indian origin.” And the furor surrounding the resignation of Jody Wilson-Raybould from Mr. Trudeau’s cabinet dissipated whatever wisps of wind remained in Liberal sails.

The Grits took 26 per cent of the vote, Monday, well down from the 34 per cent they garnered in the 2015 election. How much did Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s resignation, and that of principal secretary Gerald Butts, push down the vote? That is a very large question.

The results in Burnaby South were worrying for the Conservatives, as well. At 23 per cent, they were down 4 percentage points from 2015, and the People’s Party, a new populist right-wing party led by the disaffected Tory Mr. Bernier, came in at 11 per cent. Had even some of the People’s Party vote gone to the Conservatives, they would have been in a strong second place, instead of trailing the Liberals.

But the Tories could feel much more reassured by the results in York-Simcoe. The riding, which sits on the northern edge of Greater Toronto, has been reliably Conservative since 2004, and Monday was another solid win.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh wins Burnaby South by-election, clearing key hurdle ahead of federal campaign

Conservative Scot Davidson held the vote at 54 per cent, while the Liberal vote slumped from 38 per cent in 2015 to 29 per cent Monday night. Even more encouraging for Mr. Scheer, the People’s Party sat at only 2 per cent, suggesting Mr. Bernier won’t be a factor in the fight for the 905, the large belt of suburban ridings surrounding the city of Toronto, named after its area code. The 905 almost always votes for the party that forms the government.

But there was also good news for the Liberals on Monday night – very good news indeed. The Montreal riding of Outremont had been a Liberal bastion before Thomas Mulcair snatched it away in a 2007 by-election for the New Democrats, foreshadowing the rise of the NDP and the collapse of the Liberals in Quebec.

But the Liberals surged back in Quebec in 2015, and their convincing victory in Outremont on Monday – they had 40 per cent of the vote – means not one of the NDP’s remaining 14 seats in the provinces is safe.

Did allegations of political interference by Mr. Trudeau and his advisers in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin help the Liberal cause in Quebec, where many jobs could be lost if the company suffered, and hurt it in English Canada? Expect a lot of entirely speculative punditry on this in the days ahead.

The Greens polled at 13 per cent in Outremont, half the NDP’s 26 per cent. Make of that what you will.

For the NDP, the news is both bitter and sweet. Sweet: Mr. Singh will finally be in the House of Commons. He will arrive with Justin Trudeau’s government staggering over the SNC-Lavalin affair, giving him a perfect opportunity to reboot his troubled leadership, only eight months before the next election.

Bitter: The New Democrats are no longer in the game in Quebec. The NDP appears destined to become again what it was before: a rump, a third place-place party in English Canada, and soon to be only a memory in Quebec.

US broadcaster Univision says its team was briefly detained in the Venezuelan presidential palace where they had been interviewing President Nicolás Maduro.

The incident happened after award-winning journalist Jorge Ramos showed Mr Maduro images of Venezuelans eating from a bin lorry, the network says.

Their equipment was confiscated.

Venezuela's Information Minister Jorge Rodríguez said the government had welcomed hundreds of journalists but it did not support ""cheap shows"".

The team was deported on Tuesday.

Univision, the leading Spanish-language TV network in the US, said the six-member crew had been released after almost three hours but that their recording and personal belongings had not been returned.

Speaking on Univision, Mr Ramos said Mr Maduro ""had not liked"" some of the questions about ""the lack of democracy in Venezuela, torture, political prisoners and the humanitarian crisis"".

""He got up after I showed him videos of young people eating out of a bin lorry,"" he said of the interview at the Miraflores palace in the capital, Caracas.

""What I told Nicolás Maduro is that millions of Venezuelans and many governments around the world don't consider him a legitimate president but a dictator.""

During their detention, Mr Ramos and Univision Vice President María Martínez were kept for ""a few minutes"" in a separate room where the lights were turned off, the broadcaster said.

Mr Ramos, a veteran Mexican-born American journalist, is known for his confrontational style of questioning. In 2015, he was thrown out of a news conference of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump.

Natalie Southwick, Central and South America programme co-ordinator of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said: ""By shutting down an interview and censoring one of Latin America's most high-profile reporters, Nicolás Maduro has demonstrated his fundamental disregard for the press.""

Last month, several local and foreign journalists were briefly detained while working in Caracas. Some ended up being deported.

On Twitter, Mr Rodríguez added: ""Hundreds of journalists have come through Miraflores who have received decent treatment that we always give to those who do journalistic work.""

Earlier, a group of Latin American countries and Canada said Mr Maduro was a threat to peace and security in the region and called for his immediate exit, a democratic transition and free elections.

Meeting in the Colombian capital, Bogotá, the Lima group urged the International Criminal Court to consider whether Venezuela was guilty of crimes against humanity for refusing to allow aid into the country.

At least two people died in Saturday's clashes between civilians and troops loyal to Mr Maduro that blocked the entrance of foreign aid organised by opposition leader and self-declared interim President Juan Guaidó.

Mr Maduro says the aid efforts are part of a US-orchestrated coup.

Following President Nicolás Maduro's inauguration for a disputed second term in January, the speaker of the opposition-dominated parliament, Juan Guaidó declared himself ""interim president"" of the country.

Guaidó was immediately recognised by the US, Canada and a group of Latin American conservative governments, who called upon the Venezuelan military to rise up against Maduro. The UK, France, Spain, Germany and other European countries also recognised Guaidó after Maduro rejected their demand for fresh elections. Paredes, who presented his credentials to President Hage Geingob at State House last week, said the situation is normal, while accusing external forces for attempting to cause political instability in Venezuela.

""If you visit the main cities in Venezuela, you can see people going to work, the kids going to school. Unfortunately, foreign forces are trying to create instability in the country,"" he told New Era and NBC in an interview.

""One of the topics I discussed with President Hage Geingob, who is also the Chairperson of Sadc [Southern African Development Community] was to thank him on behalf of the government of President Nicolás Maduro and the people of Venezuela for his brave and strong support,"" Paredes said.

Last month, Namibia added her voice to growing international concern over the situation in Venezuela, calling on the international community to allow the Venezuelans to resolve their internal issues in an amicable and peaceful manner.

Namibia's Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah at the time said the international community should allow the people of Venezuela to resolve their internal issues within the confines of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.

""Namibia has been following with great concern the political developments in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The concern is that the political developments are arising from the unwarranted interference in the domestic affairs of Venezuela by foreign powers,"" Nandi-Ndaitwah said.

Paredes noted that Namibia's support is well received by the democratic institutions in Venezuela as it supports the truth, adding Maduro last year was elected with more than 67 percent of the voters in a process where more than a million people participated in the elections.

He said the African Union (AU) also send a delegation who validated the results. Hence, he said the position of the African countries was very important for the true democratic processes and respect of the international law and the United Nations charter. Since Guaidó's declaration, US President Donald Trump's administration has imposed new sanctions on Maduro's government, seized billions-worth of Venezuelan oil-related assets on US soil, and started making barely veiled threats of military intervention.

Paredes admitted that the country is experiencing hyperinflation due to economic blockade and sanctions imposed by unilateral position of the government of the United States.

According to him, the Venezuela economy has lost more than U$30 billion in the last few years. ""So please tell me which country in the world can resist an impact on their economy with such criminal blockade against our financial institutions and oil industry. That is why we are seeing the challenges in our economy. Despite, this situation, our government never stopped providing assistance to the poor people through social programmes in education, health, housing and in other sectors to stabilise our country,"" he noted.

Because of challenges emanating from the hyperinflation, more than three million Venezuelans are said to have fled the country, causing consternation across the continent.

On Saturday, clashes broke out in Venezuelan border towns, as government allegedly blocked humanitarian aid from crossing from Colombia and Brazil.

Jonathan Hayward/The Canadian Press

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh won a seat in the House of Commons, clearing a critical hurdle for his troubled leadership and triggering the start of an urgent effort to renew his caucus.

In his victory speech, Mr. Singh derided the Liberals and the Conservatives for presiding over a series of governments with a goal of enriching corporations while neglecting ordinary Canadians. He urged his supporters to hang on to the energy that they put into his winning campaign, noting they will need it for the upcoming federal election.

“I know it’s been a long slog, but I hope you have more left in the tank. We have just eight more months to let the people know they can choose a government that stands up for people and not corporations, that doesn’t give handouts to SNC-Lavalin,” Mr. Singh said in reference to the scandal currently enveloping the Liberals.

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Singh secured 39 per cent of the vote, comfortably ahead of Liberal Richard T. Lee’s 26 per cent and Conservative Jay Shin’s 22 per cent.

Mr. Singh’s victory will help quell rumblings within his party over his future. Previous NDP leader Tom Mulcair said in January that it would be difficult for Mr. Singh to stay on as leader if he lost Burnaby South.

The former Ontario provincial politician has faced criticism about his seeming unfamiliarity with federal issues and his handling of internal caucus matters − particularly his decision to kick Saskatchewan MP Erin Weir out of caucus for alleged misconduct, which infuriated many NDP stalwarts in the province seen as the cradle of the party.

Under his leadership, the NDP has plunged to its lowest standings in public opinion polls since 2000, when it won just 13 seats. The party is mired in debt and its fundraising is sluggish. At least 11 of the 44 MPs who won seats for the party in 2015 have announced they won’t seek re-election this fall.

Despite Mr. Singh’s win, the party’s troubles were evident in another by-election result Monday: In a loss heavy with symbolism, the NDP was defeated in the Outremont riding they had held since 2007.

Liberal contender Rachel Bendayan held more than 42 per cent of the vote with two-thirds of the riding’s polls reporting results, with the NDP’s Julia Sanchez running second with just over 25 per cent.

The riding had been a Liberal stronghold until Mr. Mulcair scored an upset in a 2007 by-election. His victory turned Outremont into a beachhead for the NDP, which helped to launch the Orange Wave that swept the province in 2011 and boosted the party to Official Opposition status for the first time in its history. While the party held onto just 16 Quebec seats in 2015, Quebec MPs still make up more than a third of the NDP caucus.

Mr. Mulcair won the riding, but resigned in 2018 almost a year after Mr. Singh became NDP Leader.

Mr. Singh, brushed aside the loss in Outremont, saying the party “always knew” that contest was going to be tough.

But he said he will be heading to Quebec next week to talk about the NDP environment agenda, which he suggested may resonate in the province.

He also said voters in Quebec are as concerned as voters elsewhere in Canada about offshore tax havens, the government purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline and the access corporations like SNC Lavalin have had to the federal government.

“No one believes this is a good way to run a country,” he told a news conference following his victory speech.

Mr. Singh had said he was comfortable not being in Parliament while he worked on managing the party. But his view changed amid the party’s troubles. Earlier this month, the president of the Canadian Labour Congress said the NDP is struggling to reach members of the labour movement and Canadians in general.

Hassan Yussuff told The Canadian Press that Mr. Singh might find a “better groove” if he won a seat in the House of Commons.

Brad Lavigne, who helped orchestrate Jack Layton’s Orange Wave in 2011 as NDP campaign chief, said Sunday that victory in the by-election would be crucial for Mr. Singh’s efforts to unite the NDP before the federal election in the fall.

Mr. Lavigne said Mr. Singh poured considerable personal energy into the riding through extensive door-knocking and meetings with constituents. The riding has voted NDP in the past both federally and provincially.

With a win in hand, Mr. Lavigne said there is a lot of work in a short amount of time before the next federal election. Fundraising will be key, as well as building a team of candidates. Mr. Lavigne said Mr. Singh will have to “reintroduce himself” to the country and focus on key issues to form the underpinnings of the NDP campaign.

Mr. Singh’s Burnaby South win comes as the Liberals have been under fire over the scandal involving SNC-Lavalin and the cabinet resignation of former attorney-general Jody Wilson-Raybould. Mr. Singh had called for a public inquiry into the situation.

Burnaby South was one of three by-elections called Jan. 9 by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. In addition to Outremont, there was a by-election in York-Simcoe, north of Toronto.

Story continues below advertisement

The seat was left vacant by the retirement of Peter Van Loan, who had held the seat for the Conservatives since 2004. Conservative candidate Scot Davidson captured just over 50 per cent of the vote with a majority of polls reporting results to Liberal Shaun Tanaka’s 30 per cent.

In Burnaby South, Mr. Singh overcame challenges from Tory Mr. Shin, a corporate lawyer, and the Liberal Mr. Lee, a former Burnaby member of the provincial legislature representing the BC Liberals.

Mr. Lee replaced daycare operator Karen Wang, who stepped down after her campaign circulated social-media material highlighting Mr. Singh’s ethnic background.

The breakaway People’s Party of Canada, created last summer by one-time Tory leadership contender Maxime Bernier, faced its first electoral test in the by-elections and the results suggest it could be a spoiler that deprives the Conservatives of victory in tight contests.

While the fledgling party won less than two per cent of the vote in Outremont and York-Simcoe, it did surprisingly well in Burnaby South, where Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson won nearly 11 per cent of the vote after running on a campaign denounced as anti-immigration by her critics.

Venezuela is currently going through a political crisis. On 5 January, lawmaker Juan Guaido was elected as the president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, which all other government branches have been refusing to recognize in 2016. On 23 January, two days after the Venezuelan Supreme Court annulled his election, Guaido declared himself the country's ""interim president"". Incumbent President Nicolas Maduro, who was sworn in for his second presidential term on 10 January after winning the May election, which part of the opposition boycotted, qualified Guaido's move as an attempt to stage a coup orchestrated by Washington.

The United States immediately recognized Guaido, after which some 50 other countries followed suit. Russia, China, Cuba, Bolivia and a number of other states have, in the meantime, voiced their support for the legitimate government of Maduro. Mexico and Uruguay have refused to recognize Guaido, declaring themselves neutral and promoting crisis settlement via dialogue.

REUTERS/Luisa Gonzalez

The United States targeted Venezuela’s government with new sanctions on Monday and called on allies to freeze the assets of its state-owned oil company PDVSA after deadly violence blocked humanitarian aid from reaching the country over the weekend.

As Colombia’s foreign minister warned about “credible threats to the life” of Venezuela’s opposition leader Juan Guaido, the Trump administration also took its pressure campaign to the United Nations Security Council, asking it to discuss the situation in Venezuela, diplomats said.

The U.S. Treasury Department’s sanctions were imposed on four Venezuelan state governors allied with the government of President Nicolas Maduro, blocking any assets they control in the United States.

The new sanctions were announced in Bogota as U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Guaido met with members of the Lima Group, a bloc of nations from Argentina to Canada dedicated to peaceful resolution of the political and economic crisis in Venezuela.

Pence said the United States would stand by Guaido until freedom was restored. He called for all Lima Group nations to immediately freeze PDVSA’s assets and to transfer ownership of Venezuelan assets in their countries from Maduro’s “henchmen” to Guaido’s government-in-waiting.

He also said tougher measures were coming against the OPEC member.

“In the days ahead … the United States will announce even stronger sanctions on the regime’s corrupt financial networks,” Pence said. “We will work with all of you to find every last dollar that they stole and work to return it to Venezuela.”

While the day presented a united regional front against Maduro, who is widely accused of coming to power through fraudulent elections, there was no clear sign that the latest measures would succeed in pushing him toward the exit.

‘CREDIBLE THREATS’

On a day that began with Guaido urging “all options” to be considered to remove Maduro, the threat of military intervention seemed if anything weaker after the meeting.

Guaido, sitting next to Pence at the meeting, asked for a moment of silence for those killed in what he called the “massacre” of the weekend.

Guaido himself could be in danger from the Maduro regime, Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo said, speaking on behalf of the Lima Group.

“There’s information about serious and credible threats to the life and integrity of Juan Guaido and his family, as well as to his wife’s family. From Bogotá, we want to hold the usurper Maduro responsible for any violent action against Guaido, against his wife and against their relatives,”

At least three people were killed and almost 300 wounded during protests and clashes on Saturday as U.S.-backed aid convoys attempted to enter Venezuela to deliver food and medicine.

In a joint statement at the close of the meeting, the Lima Group said Maduro was a threat to peace and security in the region and called for his immediate exit, a democratic transition and free elections.

Guaido, recognized by most Western nations as Venezuela’s legitimate leader, has urged the bloc to consider “all options” in ousting Maduro.

But the Lima Group said it “reiterates the conviction that the transition to democracy must be conducted by the Venezuelans themselves peacefully and within the framework of the Constitution and international law,” the statement said.

CALL FOR AMNESTY

Pence repeated an earlier statement that there would be an amnesty for members of the armed forces who throw their support behind Guaido. He said he hoped Maduro and those supported by his “corruption and his brutality” will leave Venezuela peacefully.

“We make clear to them that we will support the interim president’s call for amnesty, an inclusive government, an inclusive future for members of the armed forces, who have laid down their arms and stand with the Guaido government,” Pence said.

Unlike the Lima Group, of which the United States is not a member, the Trump administration has so far declined to rule out the use of military force. But Peruvian Deputy Foreign Minister Hugo de Zela Martinez denied there was any division in the group over the use of force.

Pence also called for Mexico and Uruguay, two-left leaning regional governments, to join most of the region’s other powers in embracing Guaido as Venezuela’s rightful president.

“We believe there can be no bystanders, no one on the sidelines of this, particularly in our hemisphere,” Pence said.

Washington wants the 15-member U.N. Security Council to formally call for free, fair and credible presidential elections with international observers. Russia, which along with China has major investments in Venezuela’s energy sector and back Maduro, proposed a rival draft resolution.

Soldiers and armed groups loyal to Maduro blocked a convoy of trucks with food and medicines during the weekend. Maduro says the aid efforts are part of a U.S.-orchestrated coup.

At least 167 members of Maduro’s armed forces have deserted since Saturday and more are expected to flee across the border to Colombia.

In the Venezuelan town of San Antonio, near the border with Colombia, residents on Monday chafed at the continued border closure ordered by Maduro’s government last week. Four people have been killed, 58 have suffered bullet wounds and at least 32 arrested since Friday, local rights group Penal Forum said.

Residents increasingly cross into the neighboring country to work and buy basic goods that are unavailable in Venezuela, which has suffered years of hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine. Illegal crossings over back roads known as “trochas” generally require paying tolls to low-level criminals who control them, known as “trocheros.”

“We were hungry when before the border closed. Now it will be even worse,” said Belkis Garcia, 34, walking with her husband along a trail that leads to Colombia. “We have to pay (to cross), so the little money we have for half the food is not enough. We don’t know what will happen if the border continues closed.”

The Lima Group said it would ask the International Criminal Court to consider “the serious humanitarian situation in Venezuela, the criminal violence of Nicolas Maduro’s regime against the civilian population, and the denial of access to international assistance.”

He sat down Tuesday morning with The Early Edition host Stephen Quinn to discuss his election victory.

You have been the federal leader of the NDP for about a year-and-a-half now, but you haven't held a seat in Parliament until now.

What is it going to mean to the party that you have finally been elected as a member of Parliament?

It gives us a chance to put some more pressure on the Liberal government in Ottawa to answer the question: why is it that they're so concerned with helping the wealthy and powerful, whether it's SNC-Lavalin or pharmaceutical companies or oil and gas?

NDP Leader <a href=""https://twitter.com/theJagmeetSingh?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@theJagmeetSingh</a> has won a byelection in Burnaby South that put his political career at stake. Do his MPs have confidence in him? <a href=""https://t.co/V5fvEppRl2"">pic.twitter.com/V5fvEppRl2</a> —@CBCEarlyEdition

There's been a lot of talk in this byelection that your position as the leader of the NDP rested on the outcome of the election last night.

Did you feel that way?

I never had any doubts.

We run campaigns in a way [that] we connect directly with the people, and our offer was better than the other parties.

Did you have any worries at all about the confidence that your own MPs had in you as leader of the party without an elected seat?

Well, when it comes to what we care about as New Democrats, every New Democrat is committed to fighting for the people that don't have a voice.

Our job is to take their concerns and their values and what they're worried about to Ottawa and represent them.

And we're all unified on that front.

We're all unified in building a better Canada that invests in housing, that invests in a green economy, that transforms the way we've envisioned things in the past and moves us towards investing in green technology, that creates great jobs and reduces emissions. And also an opportunity to invest in our health-care system, to expand it for medication coverage for all.

The question was: do you believe your MPs have confidence in you?

Absolutely. No question.

You're a new resident of Burnaby. How do you balance your responsibilities as leader of the NDP with representing the concerns of your constituents?

This is the struggle of all MPs: being able to take the concerns of your constituents to Ottawa, but also being able to have time on the ground to hear people's concerns.

I'll be spending my time across Canada but the Lower Mainland is incredibly important to me.

Elections are expensive. The NDP are trailing the Conservative and the Liberals when it comes to fundraising.

How prepared financially is your party to fight an election in October?

Oh, we will be ready to fight a strong election.

Or, rather, will the United States invade Venezuela to topple the despotic regime that has ruined Latin America’s once-wealthiest economy and created Latin America’s worst humanitarian crisis in many years.

The threat of invasion has increasingly been implied, with senior U.S. administration officials suggesting routinely that “all options are on the table.” Indeed, they are, as they always are in the conduct of foreign affairs. But the implication is clearly that if Maduro and his inner circle refuse to depart, then the use of force may be employed.

Maduro plainly needs to go. His mandate as president expired on January 10, 2019, at which point he re-inaugurated himself based on the results of a clearly fraudulent election in May 2018. According to Venezuela’s constitution—a document instituted under Hugo Chavez, the founder of the so-called Bolivarian Revolution and Maduro’s political godfather—in the absence of a president the head of the National Assembly becomes the interim president and is then obligated to call for new elections. Under this scenario, Juan Guaido, the newly-installed, thirty-five-year-old head of the National Assembly, became the constitutional leader of Venezuela. The United States, the Lima Group of Latin American nations and Canada, European nations, Japan, and numerous others have now recognized Guaido as the legitimate, albeit interim, leader of Venezuela.

Over the past six years of Maduro’s misrule, Venezuela has become a humanitarian disaster. Fully 10 percent of the population has fled due to lack of food and healthcare, hyperinflation, and out of control crime. National oil company PDVSA, the life-blood of the economy, has been politicized and corrupted, and production is falling rapidly. The educational system has been fully coopted by Chavismo, and every institution of the state except the National Assembly has been bent to the will of the executive. Venezuela’s sovereignty has been sold cheaply to Cuba, which has thoroughly infiltrated the security services and state functions, and sweetheart deals have been cut to provide Venezuela’s national patrimony—oil—to China, Russia, and others in exchange for short term financing and support. In short, Chavismo has mortgaged Venezuela’s future. Interim president Guiado himself has obliquely called for an armed international response.

As bad as the situation continues to get in Venezuela, however, an armed response is unlikely. First of all, there is no casus belli that would justify a U.S.-led invasion. Nor is there a mandate from the United Nations or OAS. The doctrine of Responsibility to Protect is not sufficiently developed or accepted at this point, and circumstances do not yet justify its application to Venezuela in any event. Latin American nations, including those that support strong actions against Maduro, have publicly indicated little support for armed intervention, and, despite the rhetoric, there does not appear to be much enthusiasm in Washington for such a step.

In particular, while the U.S. military would be able to decapitate the Maduro regime and install Guaido in the Miraflores Palace without significant exertion, the aftermath of such action would be messy. Venezuela is a large country, much of it rural or jungled, and numerous non-state actors occupy large portions of the nation, from regime-sponsored goon squads, to FARC and ELN guerrillas seeking safe haven from Colombia, to illegal goldminers and wildcatters, to drug traffickers and common criminals and highwaymen. Invasion would be relatively easy; pacification could be complicated. Of course, with invasion would also come the responsibility to lead recovery efforts and shoulder the blame if such efforts did not lead to desired results. Within the context of administration efforts to deal with China and North Korea and Iran, pass the trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, address domestic issues including the economy, border enforcement, and the activities of the Special Counsel, an invasion of Venezuela is not necessarily high on the priorities list.

What can be anticipated, however, is that there will be further intensified pressure on the regime, which will squeeze it like the large anacondas that inhabit Venezuelan waters. In addition to efforts to entice regime officials, including the military, to shift their loyalty from Maduro to Guaido, the United States, in coordination with other nations, looks to amplify asset seizure and forfeiture. Collectively, they aim to deny new and cancel existing visas for regime officials and their families, thus forcing departures from the United States, Europe, and Latin American nations that host them, and increase humanitarian assistance. All of these activities will further the goal of turning Maduro into an international pariah, and, it is hoped, create conditions that will ultimately see him turfed from office.

The key is to keep the Maduro regime on the defensive. There are no guarantees, and nobody can say when the dam will ultimately break—or if it will break. Meanwhile, Venezuelans face an unpleasant choice between protesting and exposing themselves to the excesses of the regime, hunkering down, or joining the millions of Venezuelans who have already left their nation behind. It is a tragedy lain squarely at the feet of Chavismo.

The Russian draft text, seen by Reuters, expresses support for a political solution to the crisis and backs the Venezuelan government as the primary coordinator of international assistance efforts in the country.

A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, France, Britain or the United States to pass. Diplomats said the U.S. draft is likely to gain the minimum nine votes to force a likely Russian veto, while the Russian draft is expected to fail without the need for a U.S. veto.

Russia and the United States have been at loggerheads over a U.S.-led campaign for international recognition of Juan Guaido, the Venezuelan opposition leader and head of the country’s elected National Assembly, over President Nicholas Maduro. Guaido last month declared himself the interim head of state.

The U.S. draft resolution, seen by Reuters, asks U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to help ensure there is a free, fair and credible presidential election with international observers. It stresses the need to ensure the safety of all the members of Venezuela’s National Assembly.

The U.S. envoy on Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, told the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday that he was concerned for Guaido’s safety upon his return to Venezuela.

Guaido crossed into Colombia on Saturday in preparation for efforts to move aid over the border to Venezuela. He then met with members of the Lima Group, a bloc of nations from Argentina to Canada, on Monday in Bogota.

The Russian draft resolution expresses concern over threats to use force against Venezuela. U.S. President Donald Trump has all options are on the table in dealing with Venezuela.

The United States and dozens of other nations have recognized Guaido as Venezuela’s legitimate president, but Maduro still controls the military, state institutions and oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA, which provides 90 percent of the country’s export revenue.

The United States targeted Venezuela’s government with new sanctions on Monday and called on allies to freeze the assets of state-owned PDVSA after deadly violence blocked humanitarian aid from reaching the country over the weekend.

In Geneva, Venezuela Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza, addressing the U.N. Human Rights Council, suggested on Wednesday that Maduro and U.S. President Donald Trump meet to “try to find common ground and explain their differences.”

Talks between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ended today with no agreement on any issue. Kim said that he would continue a moratorium on missile testing and development, but the fate of future negotiations remain very much in doubt. Can the peace process be put back on track?

Thursday's weekly series ""Criminal Injustice"" is about the most egregious conduct of our courts and prosecutors and how justice is denied to so many people in this country. Paul Wright, the founder and executive director of the Human Rights Defense Center and editor of Prison Legal News (PLN), and Kevin Gosztola, a writer for Shadowproof.com and co-host of the podcast Unauthorized Disclosure, join the show.

Michael Cohen, President Trump's longtime personal attorney and fixer, testified on Capitol Hill, saying that the President was a liar, a conman, and a racist, and that those around the President had traded their own integrity for proximity to power. Expectedly, the President exploded on Twitter, despite being busy with his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Cohen is due to report to prison on a myriad of felony charges in the next few weeks, which his opponents cite as reason to disbelieve his testimony. Walter and John speak with Dan Kovalik, a human rights and labor lawyer who is the author of the book ""The Plot to Control the World: How the US Spent Billions to Change the Outcome of Elections Around the World.""

President Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner is finishing up a visit through the Middle East to publicize an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan. Meanwhile, the United Nations released a report saying that ""the commission found reasonable grounds to believe that… the use of live ammunition by Israeli security forces against demonstrators was unlawful."" Ariel Gold, a peace activist and the national co-director of Code Pink, joins the show.

Veterans for Peace is Thursday's regular segment about the contemporary issues of war and peace that affect veterans, their families, and the country as a whole. Gerry Condon, a Vietnam-era veteran and war resister who refused orders to deploy to Vietnam and lived in exile in Canada and Sweden for 6 years, organizing with other U.S. military deserters and draft resisters against the Vietnam war, and for amnesty for U.S. war resisters, joins the show. He has been a peace and solidarity activist for almost 50 years and has served on the Board of Veterans For Peace for the last 6 years, currently as national president.

A regular Thursday segment deals with the ongoing militarization of space. As the US continues to withdraw from international arms treaties, will the weaponization and militarization of space bring the world closer to catastrophe? Brian and John speak with Prof. Karl Grossman, a full professor of journalism at the State University of New York, College at Old Westbury, the author of six books, and the host of a nationally-aired television program focused on environmental, energy, and space issues.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif resigned earlier this week just hours after meeting with an American peace delegation, apologizing for what he called his shortcomings. But President Hassan Rouhani refused the resignation, and Zarif was back in the office two days later. What was behind the resignation? Walter and John speak with Massoud Shadjareh, the founder of the Islamic Human Rights Commission.

View full coverage …,"NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh urged his caucus on Wednesday to “double down” on their efforts to unseat the Trudeau Liberals in the eight months left to the next election.

An enthusiastic Singh, who hugged, hive-fived and spoke to members of his caucus for the first time Wednesday morning since winning a seat in the riding of Burnaby South, spun a message that the NDP is a party focused on people while the Liberals side with big companies.

Preliminary results from Elections Canada show Singh was able to win the B.C. riding with 39 per cent of the vote – a success that means he will now be able to challenge Trudeau in the Commons for the first time since becoming leader in October 2017.

ANALYSIS: A bittersweet byelection night for Singh’s NDP and a warning for Scheer’s Conservatives

“I’ll be fighting for the things that matter to people,” he said to a room of MPs and supporters visibly elated by his recent win. “But I need you all to be a part of this. Together, we can put Canada on a new course.”

Singh said Canadians gave Justin Trudeau a chance, but the prime minister is too busy “doing favours for corporate friends,” alluding to the controversy involving Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

“From changing the law to get powerful executives off the hook, to giving billions in subsidies to the oil and gas (sector), to protecting the profits of pharmaceutical industries while keeping drug prices high,” Singh said.

“It’s clear: Justin Trudeau is not on our side, he’s not on your side – he’s on their’s.”

Since taking over the reins of the NDP from Tom Mulcair, Singh has faced external and internal questions about his effectiveness as the NDP’s popular support and fundraising slid.

Members of his caucus, however, were repeatedly on their feet in celebration of Singh during the part of Wednesday’s meeting opened up to media.

Veteran B.C. MP Nathan Cullen said there was a palpable sense of relief and optimism in the room.

“There’s a feeling that, with the kind of message that we have, the opportunity is there for us,” Cullen said in an interview.

“It is beyond just the symbolism of him winning a seat. This is Canada’s first racialized leader of a federal party. The new face of the NDP is diverse and strong and unapologetically progressive.”

For his part, Singh told his caucus he didn’t imagine that someone like him could ever run to be prime minister.

The United States, China and other world powers have urged restraint from the two nations as tensions escalate following tit-for-tat airstrikes in the wake of a suicide car bombing that killed at least 40 Indian paramilitary police in Indian-controlled Kashmir on Feb. 14.

Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has called for talks.

""History tells us that wars are full of miscalculation. My question is that, given the weapons we have, can we afford miscalculation,"" Khan said during a brief televised broadcast to the nation. ""We should sit down and talk.""

Pakistan and India have fought three wars since independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two over Kashmir, and went to the brink of a fourth in 2002 after a Pakistani militant attack on India's parliament.

Pakistan has shut its airspace, forcing commercial airlines to reroute. Thai Airways International announced on Thursday that it had cancelled flights to Pakistan and Europe, which left thousands of passengers stranded in Bangkok.

On Thursday morning troops from India and Pakistan briefly exchanged fire in Poonch, a district in Indian-occupied Kashmir, according to a statement from the Indian army.

""The Indian army retaliated strongly and effectively,"" said Lieutenant Colonel Devender Anand, a defence ministry spokesman.

The firing, that India claims was initiated by Pakistan began just after 0600 local time (0030 GMT), lasted a little over an hour and was significantly less elevated than artillery fire between the two sides on Wednesday. There were no reported casualties in the last clash.

India is building more than 14,000 bunkers for families living along its border with Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir state, hoping to keep them safe near their homes instead of evacuating them due to artillery firing.

On Wednesday evening India's foreign ministry handed a dossier to Pakistan that it claimed detailed camps of the Paskistan-based militant group that carried out the Feb 14 attack.

The conflict comes at a critical time for Indian Prime Minster Narendra Modi, who faces a general election in a matter of months.

Late on Wednesday B.S. Yeddyurappa, the leader of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party in the southern state of Karnataka, said India's strike inside Pakistani territory would help the party to win back power in the state - the first such comment from a member of the ruling party.

""This has brought a pro-Modi wave all through the country,"" he told reporters.

""The effect of this will be seen in the elections.""

INTERNATIONAL CONCERN

The latest escalation marks a sudden deterioration in relations between the two countries. As recently as November, Pakistan's leader Khan spoke of ""mending ties"" with India.

The White House urged ""both sides to take immediate steps to de-escalate the situation.""

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement he had spoken separately with the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan and urged them to ""prioritise direct communication and avoid further military activity"".

Pakistan's envoy to the United States, Asad Majeed Khan, said Islamabad would like to see the Trump administration play a more active role in easing the crisis.

At the same time, he said the lack of U.S. condemnation of India's strike on Pakistan was ""construed and understood as an endorsement of the Indian position, and that is what emboldened them even moreâ€.

China, the European Union and other countries including Iran also called for restraint.

The Chinese government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, spoke by telephone with Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and expressed ""deep concern"", China's foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday.

The United States, Britain and France proposed the United Nations Security Council blacklist the head of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad, which claimed responsibility for the Feb. 14 attack. China is likely to be oppose the move.

FLIGHTS CANCELLED

Thai Airways said it had cancelled more than a dozen flights to Europe due to Pakistan's move, along with all flights to and from the country.

Several airlines including Emirates and Qatar Airways, suspended flights to Pakistan on Wednesday, while others such as Singapore Airlines and British Airways were forced to reroute flights.

Singapore Airlines said on Thursday all of its Europe-bound flights would continue as planned, avoiding the affected airspace as necessary.

Flights from the Middle East and India were also affected. Air Canada said on Wednesday it has temporarily suspended service to India.

A Sikh leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP) won a by-election to enter the Canadian parliament.

Jagmeet Singh, 40, won the Burnaby South constituency seat in British Columbia (BC) province after defeating Liberal party candidate Tory Shin, a corporate lawyer, and Lee, a former Burnaby member of the provincial legislature representing the BC Liberals, his campaign said.

The by-election was held in three different provinces on Tuesday, with barely eight months left for the federal elections in October, also sealed Mr Singh's position as an undisputed leader of the NDP, the third largest party in the House of Commons.

The other two seats were bagged one each by the ruling Liberals from Ontario province and the main opposition Conservatives from Quebec.

The Scarborough-born Sikh leader, also rated as a rising star in Canadian politics, had a shaky position as the head of the NDP as he was not a Member of Parliament.

Following his win, Mr Singh is now considered as a viable challenge to the main Opposition Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer, who is younger to him and streering a progressive alternative on the national stage to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Liberal party.

According to Mr Singh's campaign spokesperson, James Smith, the NDP leader has now redeemed his supremacy in the party.

Affordable housing, pharmacare and meaningful action to combat climate change are his focused areas of work to solve the problems of the people, Singh told his supporters in his victory speech.

Mr Singh maintained that the successive governments of the Liberals and the Conservatives had only enriched corporations while neglecting common Canadians.

""I know it's been a long slog, but I hope you have more left in the tank. We have just eight more months to let the people know they can choose a government that stands up for people and not corporations, that doesn't give handouts to SNC-Lavalin,"" Mr Singh said in the context of the ongoing controversy involving SNC-Lavalin.

The NDP victory comes at a time the Liberals are facing the worst crisis involving the SNC-Lavalin bribery scandal, which led to the resignation of the former justice minister attorney general Jody Wilsom-Raybould

According to many experts on the country, the situation has gotten even worse. The most prominent example of this is the case of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist who was living in exile and serving as a columnist for the Washington Post when he was murdered in early October 2018 in Istanbul.

Only after weeks of international pressure did Saudi Arabia admit that the murderers were committed by its own secret service. According to American media reports, the CIA is even said to hold evidence that MBS personally ordered the murder of the journalist.

Rainer Sollich, from DW's Middle East Regional Desk

""The Saudi state is dictatorial and oppressive,"" Saudi Prince Khaled bin Farhan Al-Saud, who lives in exile in Germany, told DW's Arabic language program in October 2018. ""The authorities will not tolerate even cautious criticism."" He himself is under police protection.

Freedom for women

Saudi women were also victims of harassment and oppression. Although the leadership in Riyadh officially lifted the ban on driving for women in June 2018 and earned international recognition for it, the action was flanked by the arrest of numerous Saudi Arabian human rights and women's rights activists. At least three of the women arrested have been subjected to electric shocks, lashings and various forms of sexual violence, with claims of torture reported by Human Rights Watch in November 2018.

The cards are the only way for them to prove who they are, for example in disputes relating to inheritance or property issues. IDs were only issued with the permission of a woman's guardian, though, and to the guardian instead of directly to the woman. Only in 2006 were women able to get IDs without permission.

One of them was Sarah Attar, who ran the women's 800 meter race at the 2012 Olympics in London wearing a headscarf.

Human rights defenders say the law does nothing to address the fact that Saudi women can only obtain divorces in exceedingly limited cases — such as with her husband’s consent or if he has harmed her.

Public criticism of such conditions is not possible in Saudi Arabia. The media operate on the same level as journalists' activities and social media activism is strictly monitored. Anyone who expresses criticism is likely to face imprisonment or worse punishments.

Last year, Saudi Arabia once again landed on the ""Ranking of Freedom of the Press"" published annually by Reporters Without Borders, as one of the worst places for freedom of the press, coming in at 169 out of a total of 180. It is also one of the five countries detaining the highest number of journalists.

Intense coverage by numerous international media outlets had increased the pressure to act in her case. At the same time, her fate had been largely hushed up by the Saudi media and had been described in the country as anti-Saudi rhetoric orchestrated by foreign media.

Outremont's polls are open from 9:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.,"Liberal Rachel Bendayan has won the federal riding of Outremont in Quebec after taking 40 per cent of the vote with 95 per cent of polls reporting.

""I will honour your vote by working very hard,"" she said Monday night at Liberal party headquarters in Montreal's Outremont.

She stressed that the Liberals would continue to fight climate change and promote a national housing strategy.

Mélanie Joly, the minister of official languages and La Francophonie, said that despite losing to the NDP in 2015, Bendayan was always a strong candidate who continued working in the riding in the years since.

""We hope this is the end of the Orange Wave in Quebec,"" Joly said Monday night.

The NDP, which had held the riding since 2007, trailed in second place with less than 30 per cent of the votes.

Outremont was one of three ridings where federal byelections took place Monday on a crucial day for Canada's major political parties.

Voter turnout was low, as is typical for a byelection. Less than 20 per cent of the 70,400 registered voters in Outremont cast a ballot.

Political insiders had bet that the Liberals would retake the riding — a welcome boost for the governing party's morale in the midst of the SNC-Lavalin controversy.

""Tonight, the people of Outremont and thousands of Canadians voting in these byelections have offered a strong vote of confidence in Justin Trudeau's positive plan to strengthen the middle class,"" said Suzanne Cowan, president of the Liberal Party of Canada.

Outremont resident, Claudette Dumas Bergen, says the weather was holding her back but she adds “my civic duty came to me and I said I have to go because it’s important!” <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Outremont?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Outremont</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/CBCMontreal?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@CBCMontreal</a> <a href=""https://t.co/H6ds1wsZZ4"">pic.twitter.com/H6ds1wsZZ4</a> —@mia_anhoury

Analysts said the Outremont race was a crucial test for the NDP.

The riding had been a Liberal stronghold until Thomas Mulcair scored an upset in a 2007 byelection: the Liberals had lost the riding only once, to the Progressive Conservatives in 1988, since 1935.

The so-called Orange Wave followed in 2011 and boosted the NDP to Official Opposition status for the first time in its history.

While the party held onto just 16 Quebec seats in 2015, Quebec MPs still make up more than a third of the NDP caucus.

These are the candidates who ran in Outremont and how much of the vote they took by the time 95 per cent of ballots had been counted:

40 per cent: Rachel Bendayan — Liberal Party of Canada.

29 per cent: Julia Sánchez — New Democratic Party.

54,Empty,2019-02-27T12:21:00Z,An under-the-hood look at the share price at which Cronos Group would offer intriguing value to investors.,"Marijuana stocks can seemingly do no wrong lately, and it's not hard to see why. Since October, we've seen Canada legalize recreational marijuana, had a handful of U.S. states approve medical or recreational weed during midterm elections in November, witnessed President Trump sign the Farm Bill into law, and heard of rumors that Mexico may choose to legalize recreational marijuana in 2019. Not shockingly, the first-ever marijuana exchange-traded fund in Canada, the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences ETF, is up more than 50% this year.

But even with rapid global sales growth of up to 38% expected in 2019, not all pot stock valuations make sense. While yours truly has been critical of mid- and large-cap marijuana stock valuations in recent months, no company has stood out as more overvalued recently than Cronos Group (NASDAQ: CRON) -- this year's top-performing pot stock.

However, just because I view Cronos Group as a stock worth avoiding now, it doesn't mean I don't see value in the business or the stock. There is a share price at which I believe Cronos Group becomes attractive to investors. But before I divulge that price point, let me walk you through my thought process from both the buy and sell sides of things.

The Cronos Group buy thesis

Make no mistake about it, the clearest reason to be excited about Cronos Group is the $1.8 billion equity investment from tobacco giant Altria (NYSE: MO), announced in early December. Altria, which has faced years of declining cigarette demand in the U.S., is looking for ways to reignite growth, without having to continuously raise tobacco prices. By taking a 45% equity stake in Cronos Group, Altria is getting its foot in the door in the high-growth cannabis industry.

Furthermore, Altria's equity stake in Cronos Group, which has yet to close, comes with warrants that could be exercised at a later date. If Altria were to exercise all the warrants it'll be receiving, it could become a majority stakeholder (55%) in Cronos. Given its $3.6 billion market cap, Cronos could easily be gobbled up by Altria and its still-substantial free cash flow. Thus, premium is being paid to the likelihood that Altria will eventually buy the remainder of Cronos Group that it doesn't already own.

On the flip side, once the deal closes, Cronos Group will have north of $1.8 billion in cash on hand to execute on its long-term strategy. No longer having to worry about raising capital, Cronos will be focused on expanding internationally, diversifying its product portfolio to feature high-margin items, and growing its production capacity. This also means that dilution becomes less of a concern, with the company not having to turn to bought-deal offerings to raise capital.

Partnerships are another key selling point for Cronos Group. In September, it and Ginkgo Bioworks entered into a deal that'll cost Cronos up to $100 million. It will, however, give Cronos access to Ginkgo's microorganism development platform. This platform should allow for the creation of yeast strains capable of producing eight types of cannabinoids. These cannabinoids, some of which are rare, could be produced at commercial scale, presumably for a cheaper cost than traditional extraction methods.

An enthusiastic Singh, who hugged, high-fived and spoke to members of his caucus for the first time Wednesday morning since winning a seat in the riding of Burnaby South, spun a message that the NDP is a party focused on people while the Liberals side with big companies.

Preliminary results from Elections Canada show Singh was able to win the B.C. riding with 39 per cent of the vote — a success that means he will now be able to challenge Trudeau in the Commons for the first time since becoming leader in October 2017.

""I'll be fighting for the things that matter to people,"" he said to a room of MPs and supporters visibly elated by his recent win. ""But I need you all to be a part of this. Together, we can put Canada on a new course.""

Singh said Canadians gave Justin Trudeau a chance, but the prime minister is too busy ""doing favours for corporate friends,"" alluding to the controversy involving Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

""From changing the law to get powerful executives off the hook, to giving billions in subsidies to the oil and gas (sector), to protecting the profits of pharmaceutical industries while keeping drug prices high,"" Singh said.

""It's clear: Justin Trudeau is not on our side, he's not on your side — he's on theirs.""

Under pressure

Since taking over the reins of the NDP from Tom Mulcair, Singh has faced external and internal questions about his effectiveness as the NDP's popular support and fundraising slid.

Members of his caucus, however, were repeatedly on their feet in celebration of Singh during the part of Wednesday's meeting opened up to media.

Veteran B.C. MP Nathan Cullen said there was a palpable sense of relief and optimism in the room.

""There's a feeling that, with the kind of message that we have, the opportunity is there for us,"" Cullen said in an interview.

""It is beyond just the symbolism of him winning a seat. This is Canada's first racialized leader of a federal party. The new face of the NDP is diverse and strong and unapologetically progressive.""

For his part, Singh told his caucus he didn't imagine that someone like him could ever run to be prime minister.

56,Empty,2019-02-27T10:59:11Z,"Today, Colombia is a bright spot in the developing world, endowed with rich natural resources, a stable political environment, and prudent market-friendly polic","Colombia is one of a few Latin American countries that never experienced dictatorship or defaulted on its sovereign debt, largely escaping the swell of a populism.

Global X launched its first ETF, the Global X MSCI Colombia ETF (NYSEARCA:GXG), 10 years ago this month. The fund was born out of a need for targeted exposure to a growing economy that was often overlooked by investors or represented a miniscule portion of broad emerging market indexes. With a decade of history behind the fund, we thought it would be an opportune time to revisit Colombia - to see what's changed, and what's stayed the same, since 2009.

Colombia, 2009

After decades of controlling the political climate and narcotrafficking business, the guerrilla paramilitary group, the FARC, was losing territory and assets to aerial fumigation, military intervention, and international sanctions. Colombia's President Álvaro Uribe, who was two years into his second term, restarted Colombia's peace talks with the FARC, in an effort to set the country on a peaceful path of growth.

Despite working towards peace, foreigners rarely traveled to Colombia during this time, given the lack of Open Skies agreements, residual violence related to narcotrafficking, and skeptical views on Colombia's overall national stability.

Economic growth was stymied by limited trade, with few free trade agreements in place and regional integration efforts unrealized. Foreign capital was limited, Colombia's capital markets were comparatively small versus other Latam emerging markets like Mexico and Brazil, and efficient tools for direct access were sparse (hence the launch of GXG).

Progress was slow, steady, and uneven.

Yet today, Colombia is a bright spot in the developing world, endowed with rich natural resources, a stable political environment, and prudent market-friendly policies. Investors are increasingly attracted to Colombia's growth potential, liberal market values, and favorable business conditions. Below are some key stats illustrating Colombia's transformation from 2009 to today:

Macroeconomic Backdrop

Colombia's history is marked by its strong democratic institutions and prudent macroeconomic policies. It is one of a few Latam countries that never experienced dictatorship or defaulted on its sovereign debt, largely escaping the swell of a populist ""Pink Tide"" in the 2000s and the waves of populism and protracted Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI) policies that defined regional politics for decades.

As such, Colombia's economic development over the past decade was steadily built upon the solid foundation of an independent central bank, a healthy current account, increasingly strong trade relations, and a modernizing economy.

Independent Central Bank : Colombia's Central Bank is among the most well-respected across EMs and is seen by some as Colombia's strongest institution. Utilizing an inflation-targeting regime, a flexible exchange rate, and supervisory tools, the central bank has maintained autonomy and credibility and buttressed investor confidence. In 2011, policymakers introduced a structural fiscal rule seeking to anchor government finances and debt sustainability. Colombia also benefits from the support of the IMF, which extends a Flexible Credit Line (NYSE:FCL) of over $11 billion to the country

The deficit is narrowing faster than expected, and could accelerate with the growth of domestic and international demand as Colombia continues diversifying its exports and attracting FDI Strong Trade Relations : Colombia joined Chile and Mexico in the OECD (the only other Latin American members), and signed several bilateral and multilateral trade agreements, including with the US, Canada, EU, South Korea, and the Pacific Alliance (a trade bloc formed in 2012 by Colombia, Chile, Mexico, Peru). It continues negotiating with Turkey and Japan and has an agreement pending with Panama. 2 These agreements cover trade in goods and services and expand capital markets access by granting legal protections and better terms to foreigners

It continues negotiating with Turkey and Japan and has an agreement pending with Panama. These agreements cover trade in goods and services and expand capital markets access by granting legal protections and better terms to foreigners Modernizing Economy: As Colombia grows its service sector, it reduces the size of its informal economy, which expands the tax base, improves access to education, and encourages female labor participation. Further, the country has made significant efforts to diversify away its dependence on oil and has committed to modernizing its infrastructure to create a better business environment

Safety and Security

Colombia officially ended a decades-long civil conflict two years ago, signing a Peace Accord with the FARC, an insurgent guerilla group that truncated Colombia's growth since the 1940s. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize shortly after, an international symbol of recognition for Colombia's momentous progress which has also led it to becoming the fourth-largest economy in Latam.3

Colombia's economy was stymied by violence and narcotrafficking but began to develop before the conflict was officially ended. During the 1990s, security began to improve incrementally. Tourism in Colombia is one of the industries that has benefitted most from an improved security situation and has helped reduce unemployment and improve GDP. As one of the fastest growing industries, Colombia last year estimated that it would welcome nearly double the 1.4 million tourist visits from 2009. Looking forward, Colombian officials anticipate tourism will continue on its growth trajectory through 2028.

From Conflict to Capital Markets

Colombia's capital markets have fluctuated, but overall improved markedly from 2009. The local Bolsa de Valores stock exchange (BVC) has nearly doubled its total market capitalization as the economy continues formalizing and integrating with global markets.

Liquid Local Bond Market: Colombia's debt composition favoring peso-denominated debt, protects it from currency depreciation and external risk while attracting bond investors looking for relatively lower risk EM exposure. Colombia aims to increase its domestic to foreign debt ratio from 62:38 to 70:30 and expects its bond markets to raise ~$2.6 billion this year (only 16% in foreign currency) 4

International Integration: In 2011, Colombia joined the Latin American Integrated Market (MILA), an integrated stock exchange between the Pacific Alliance countries (Colombia, Chile, Mexico, and Peru), established to increase depth, liquidity, and market access across the region. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and Development Bank for Latin America (NYSE:CAF) played critical roles in capital markets by supporting MILA and advising on general regulatory framework

Past Headwinds: One year after joining, the BVC took off, peaking in market cap and trading activity. More challenges arose in 2015 when falling oil prices dragged down the peso and the overall economy, which was then compounded in 2016 with a national drought and a trucker's strike, and then again in 2017 with tax reform. These events dampened market potential and complicated the central bank's inflation-targeting efforts, but fixed and foreign investments and the expansion of Colombia's liquid bond market by corporate issuers, helped buoy capital markets and stimulate reform appetite

Reforms: Reforms aimed at formalization and capital mobility have been critical to Colombia's capital markets development over the last 10 years. Fiscal reform in 2012 incentivized Colombians to make formal social security contributions, fomenting demand in both the equity and money markets. The reforms were fairly successful, leading to ""an unprecedented growth"" in private pension plan contributions.5 Last year, Colombia also announced it would more closely align with Basel III standards, which could improve Colombia's credit profile and attract more inflows; in October 2018, Finance Minister, Alberto Carrasquilla, launched a ""Capital Markets Experts Commission"" that seeks to analyze and recommend policies to further develop and deepen Capital Markets

While greater retirement contributions are overall positive, Colombia's four private pension funds' investments are concentrated on foreign investment vehicles such as ETFs, as well as large domestic public companies, and private equity investments. This has somewhat disincentivized smaller companies from going public, resulting in a stock exchange dominated by large-caps. More reforms are needed to balance formalization with capital market development. Reducing the shadow banking sector by capping interest rates, for example, could boost competition and increase banking penetration or public offers, rebalancing issuers' dependence on debt markets with capital raising opportunities in equity markets.

Investments help Colombia Boost Production but Reduce Reliance on Oil

As an export-driven economy reliant on oil revenues, many would classify Colombia as a commodity economy. But its services sector, which comprises a majority of its GDP and labor market, are evidence of an economy that is well into a transition phase. Oil revenues should continue to fuel growth, but consumption and non-traditional exports, which include services, renewable energy, and agriculture, are expected to become a greater source of growth as the country expands its infrastructure and increases productivity. Some important considerations pertaining to investment and the service sector are highlighted here:

Domestic and International Investment: High yields have attracted international investors to Colombia, but the depth of its local markets have kept interest rates competitive - encouraging domestic investment into key infrastructure initiatives, including the 4G toll road initiative, estimated to entail $25 billion investments. Gross fixed capital formation is expected to increase 4.5% 6 this year whereas an estimated $17.5 billion is expected in Foreign Direct Investments (NYSE:FDI)

this year whereas an estimated $17.5 billion is expected in Foreign Direct Investments (NYSE:FDI) Services: Services make up 62% of its GDP and labor force composition.7 This includes areas like Finance, Construction, Tourism, and Infrastructure, which occupy a smaller portion of equity markets, compared to oil and gas names, even though their contribution to GDP is collectively greater. As reforms encourage expansion of capital markets, the dominance of large-cap energy firms could level the playing field to diversify the universe of equities represented

Outlook

Colombia's progress over the last 10 years has been thoughtful and steady, but this gradualist approach has allowed the country to overcome challenges associated with its legacy of civil conflict and oil market volatility.

Following Presidential elections in 2018, Colombia's outlook is marked by higher expected GDP levels and lower expected inflation levels compared to Latam on average. Forecasts according to the IMF project solid performance8 in the near term as growth is projected to accelerate because of resilient FDI inflows and non-traditional exports. Its stable political climate, reform appetite, and infrastructure projects continue to stimulate investor interest. Year-to-date, Colombia has outperformed EMs broadly - a trend that could continue given the rebound in consumer spending following the release of broader positive economic data.

In the near term, municipal elections this Fall could ease political and reform stagnation to allow the government to pass needed pension and labor market reform, which could improve market efficiency by formalizing more jobs and prompting wage increases. Over the long term, Colombia should benefit from higher consumption aided by low inflation, currency stability, and investor confidence. The economy is likely to remain sensitive to commodity prices but could benefit if higher oil and coal revenues increase fixed investments and infrastructure spending.

Lastly, if there is a positive reversal of the political and economic turmoil in neighboring Venezuela, Colombia's manufacturing exports could accelerate given that Venezuela was Colombia's 2nd largest trade partner in 2008 and accounted for 17% of total exports.

The base isn’t stupid, and if they stay home on election day because you’ve disavowed them in the general election campaign then you aren’t going to pick up enough “moderate” voters to make a difference. That so-called strategy has looked more an more bleak for several years. Now the alleged moderates have not only decreased in number but they actually don’t represent any view on the American political landscape. These two graphs are from the Pew Research Center’s report Political Polarization in the American Public.

CREDIT: http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/section-1-growing-ideological-consistency/

Because our “first past the post” system crushes third parties like the bugs that they are, this polarization hasn’t been felt in American politics. But the same thing is happening in Europe and Australia/Oceania where parliamentary systems and you can see the effect.

Writing at the Washington Post, Harry Olsen has an intriguing piece on how centrist, “third way” politics are foundering basically everywhere after this philosophy had been declared victorious a couple of decades ago. The article is titled Don’t fool yourself. The political center won’t recover anytime soon and I don’t think the phenomenon is as surprising as some.

…Globally, the prevailing trend is rising support for anti-immigrant, nationalist populist parties — not a resurgence of the center. That trend is easy to see almost anywhere you look. Estonia holds national elections in a week, and polls show the big winner is likely to be the Conservative People’s Party of Estonia, which is set to more than double its share of the vote, becoming the third-largest party in the country. Spain’s Socialist president, Pedro Sánchez, recently called for a snap election after his government failed to pass a budget, but again, polls show an anti-immigrant, nationalist party called Vox will likely gain the most. Vox has skyrocketed in support from less than 1 percent in 2016 to an average of around 11 percent in recent polls. A three-party, center-right coalition including Vox shocked the country by winning the state elections last December in the longtime Socialist bastion of Andalusia. It now looks like that coalition will govern Spain, too. …Italy’s Lega is led by the notorious anti-immigrant and social conservative Matteo Salvini, who has garnered international attention with his opposition to admitting refugees from Muslim Northern Africa. Lega’s support has doubled within a year, from 17 percent in last March’s election to more than 35 percent today, easily making the brash populist the most popular political figure in Italy. …That’s the coalition that currently governs New Zealand, where Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, known for her environmental policies and deft use of social media, governs in coalition with the anti-immigrant and nationalist New Zealand First party. Their coalition agreement is opaque on the matter, but annual net migration has declined nearly 30 percent since the coalition took power in 2017. …Quebec elected a center-right government for the first time in decades last year, partially on its promise to reduce immigration to the province by 20 percent. A new political party, the People’s Party of Canada, formed last year with a platform of free-market economic reforms and reducing immigration. It is already receiving more than 2 percent in the polls, and could easily gain more support ahead of this fall’s national election.

What Olsen paints as anti-immigrant is, I think, much more a natural resurgence of nationalism that has been tamped down…tribalism, dontcha know…by would-be elites married to a populism abetted by the breaking of the information monopoly that has large numbers of people looking at the policies promoted by those elites and asking “WTF??” because a blind man could see they do nothing to benefit current or future generations of their nation. Immigration is a lightning rod for this effect because in so many Western nations, the elites either have or have no problem with opening the flood gates to no-skills/low-skills immigrants who either survive on the dole (paid for by the citizen taxpayer) or compete for low-end jobs with disadvantaged citizens and who, either by their own desire or the benighted policies of the host nation, show no desire to assimilate or even pretend to assimilate.

Those bemoaning the loss of a “center” are actually crying over the demise of Failure Theater and the log-rolling and deal-making that benefited only a relatively small number of people to the detriment of most everyone else. They are complaining that the rule by elites is coming to an end now that everywhere people are seeing that what was marketed as “bipartisanship” was actually just a self-serving scam.

This is “how you got Trump” in a nutshell.

As Texas Democrat and populist Jim Hightower was noted for saying, there’s nothing in the middle of the road but yellow stripes and dead armadillos. The 2016 GOP primary demonstrated that in spades. The closer you were to being a “moderate” the sooner you looked like dead armadillo (Scott Walker, Jeb Bush). The closer your views were to those of the average voter the better your chance of survival. Ted Cruz understood that when he ran this commercial in 2016 highlighting the fact that illegal immigration was only supported by people whose jobs were not put at risk by it:

It will be shocking if the same dynamic doesn’t play out in the Democrat primary for 2020.

Fifty years ago, both US parties commanded a broad consensus opinion on the American Experiment. That consensus has unraveled. The two major parties now have very differing ideas about what the nation should look like and how our economic system should operate. The challenge in 2020 will be to appeal to those common values remaining with sufficient strength to bring along people who might not agree with large parts of your platform. It implies that rather than trying to appeal to moderates, the successful candidate will lock down and motivate their base and build enough common ground with some “moderate” elements to create a winning coalition. Will that common ground be reducing illegal immigration, as it is in Europe? Will it be restricting abortion and limiting the ability of the federal government to meddle in our lives? Or will it be guaranteed free day care, a $15/hour minimum wage and a stipend for those who, according to the Green New Deal, are “unwilling to work?” I really don’t know. Regardless, the unalloyed good here is that both sides are coming to see “moderates” as the feckless and uncertain allies that they are.

Russia and the United States have been at loggerheads over a US-led campaign for international recognition of Juan Guaido, the Venezuelan opposition leader and head of the country’s elected National Assembly, over President Nicholas Maduro. Guaido last month declared himself the interim head of state.

The US draft resolution, seen by Reuters, asks UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to help ensure there is a free, fair and credible presidential election with international observers. It stresses the need to ensure the safety of all the members of Venezuela’s National Assembly.

The US envoy on Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, told the UN Security Council on Tuesday that he was concerned for Guaido’s safety upon his return to Venezuela.

Guaido crossed into Colombia on Saturday in preparation for efforts to move aid over the border to Venezuela. He then met with members of the Lima Group, a bloc of nations from Argentina to Canada, on Monday in Bogota.

The Russian draft resolution expresses concern over threats to use force against Venezuela. US President Donald Trump has all options are on the table in dealing with Venezuela.

The United States and dozens of other nations have recognised Guaido as Venezuela’s legitimate president, but Maduro still controls the military, state institutions and oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA, which provides 90% of the country’s export revenue.

The United States targeted Venezuela’s government with new sanctions on Monday and called on allies to freeze the assets of state-owned PDVSA after deadly violence blocked humanitarian aid from reaching the country over the weekend.

In Geneva, Venezuela Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza, addressing the UN Human Rights Council, suggested on Wednesday that Maduro and US President Donald Trump meet to “try to find common ground and explain their differences.”

Maduro also “stands ready for dialogue” with the Venezuelan opposition, he said.

59,Empty,2019-02-27T15:17:10Z,The second-in-line to the throne is in Belfast with his wife Kate (pictured today) and will say Britain needs strong leadership during a speech in Belfast tonight in a nod to the current Brexit deadlock.,"Advertisement

The Duke of Cambridge has urged people to 'come together in times of trouble and work for the common good' in a speech echoing the Queen's call for unity on Brexit as he pays a visit to Northern Ireland.

Prince William, 36, praised individuals seeking to work for 'the common good' in a speech delivered in Belfast last night, in what was thought to be a thinly veiled reference to Brexit.

Speaking about the appointment of former Olympian Dame Mary Peters to the Order of the Garter in Belfast, Prince William said: 'Mary Peters is not only one of the United Kingdom's sporting legends, she's also inspired generation after generation to come together in times of trouble and work for the common good - a lesson I hope many of us can learn from.

'So it was fitting today that Her Majesty The Queen has appointed Mary to be a Lady Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter - one of the UK's highest honours.'

The Prince's intervention comes just a month after the Queen highlighted the need for respect and seeking out common ground in an address seen as a veiled reference to the bitterness over Brexit.

His words will be particularly significant because much of the Brexit tension is over Northern Ireland's border and the backstop demanded by Brussels to keep trade flowing without the need for controls.

The Duke of Cambridge's message at the celebratory dinner in Belfast could also be seen as a prompt to Stormont to resume its work after the power-sharing deal between the DUP and Sinn Fein collapsed two years ago.

The Duke of Cambridge was joined by his wife the Duchess of Cambridge last night at Empire Music Hall.

William and Kate laughed and exchanged jokes as they got behind the bar at the Empire Music Hall.

There were cheers as Kate poured a pint of Harp Ice lager and set her effort on the bar.

The couple are all smiles as they arrive at Belfast's Empire Music Hall.

William then took his turn, saying 'here we go' as he tilted the pint glass. He watched the tap intently before exclaiming 'look at that bad boy' as he admired his work, and added: 'Perfect... good enough for an advert.'

Prince William calls for people to 'work for the common good' The Duke of Cambridge used his speech to make a thinly veiled reference to Brexit as he praised former Olympian Dame Mary Peters will become a Lady Companion of the Order - the oldest and most senior British Order of Chivalry. He said: 'Mary Peters is not only one of the United Kingdom's sporting legends, she's also inspired generation after generation to come together in times of trouble and work for the common good - a lesson I hope many of us can learn from. 'So it was fitting today that Her Majesty The Queen has appointed Mary to be a Lady Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter - one of the UK's highest honours.' In the brief speech he also praised the work of the people at the event. He said: 'From using sport to encourage people to talk openly about mental health to delivering services to children and young people who are at risk of entering care or custody – the work you do transcends community divisions and is helping deliver a brighter future for everybody in Northern Ireland.'

Her Majesty and the rest of the royals are expected to remain politically neutral.

Using barely coded language in a speech to her local Women's Institute in Norfolk, The Queen said in January she preferred 'respecting different points of view'.

Her intervention split opinion with many praising the Queen but others claiming she should not get involved.

She also used her Christmas message to the nation to preach a similar message of unity.

William's hastily-arranged two-day visit to Northern Ireland with his wife Kate comes as MPs argue over the terms of Brexit with just over a month to go until the scheduled departure date.

The royals began their trip with a visit to Windsor Park football stadium to find out about outreach programmes and take part in a game of football with local children.

The tour will include a meeting with a youth charity in the border region of Fermanagh.

Even though the royals tend to steer well clear of politics, their visits are often organised in conjunction with the government to assist Britain's wider political and economic agenda at home and abroad.

The shock result of the 2016 EU membership referendum has forced the royals into diplomatic overdrive.

Not long after the referendum, William toured Canada, then Europe, in what was seen as a bridge-building exercise as Britain looks to retain old alliances with European and build new trade ties with the Commonwealth.

Strategic royal visits have multiplied since then.

But the trip to Northern Ireland, where the IRA fought a bloody campaign against British rule for three decades until 1998, is particularly sensitive.

Since the end of the conflict, residents of the province have become accustomed to a free-flowing border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member state.

Northern Ireland voted to stay in the EU by 56 percent to 44 percent but the United Kingdom as a whole voted to leave.

Should the Queen or Prince William speak out about Brexit? As Head of State The Queen has to remain strictly neutral with respect to all political matters. She is unable to vote or stand for election - as are other senior members of the royal family. But on rare occasions the Queen will use a key speech, such as her Christmas speech, to make more general observations about life in Britain if she think it's important. In the past two months she spoke out twice about respecting opposing views in an obvious nod to the current crisis surrounding Brexit. Prince William's intervention in Northern Ireland - a subtle message about Brexit and Stormont - is also highly significant. The Monarch has several ceremonial and formal roles in relation to the government, including the State Opening of Parliament where she reveals upcoming legilsation. The Queen also has a special relationship with the Prime Minister, retaining the right to appoint and also meeting with him or her on a regular basis. But she is not allowed to push them in any political direction. However, in the past, others have let slip her views on major issues. In 2012 the BBC apologised to her when it said the Queen had voiced concerns to the previous government about the inability of UK authorities to arrest and deport hate preacher Abu Hamza. More recently The Sun defended its own claims that the Queen was pro-Brexit and the BBC claimed that Her Majesty said that Britain should 'just get on with' leaving the European Union at a private lunch.

The future of the border - and in particular how to fulfil British and EU promises to keep it open - has been a flashpoint for Brexit divisions ever since.

There are fears on both sides of the Irish border that any disruption could undermine the peace process.

But many Conservative MPs are refusing to approve the draft Brexit deal on the table because they fear Britain would be trapped in an indefinite 'backstop' arrangement with the EU to keep the border open.

After her deal was overwhelmingly rejected by parliament last month, Prime Minister Theresa May has said she will look for changes to the backstop but has sought to reassure Northern Ireland over its future.

Royals getting involved in politics is extremely rare, but the Prince of Wales has promised he will not 'meddle' in public affairs when he becomes king after a series of high-profile rows.

In 2015 Charles had to defend his decision to write a series of letters to government ministers, some of which are known as the 'black spider' memos, so-called because of his use of black ink and his scrawled handwriting.

A long-running legal battle by Guardian newspaper journalist Rob Evans to secure the release of the documents culminated in the UK's highest court ordering the Government to publish them.

The letters showed the prince had raised issues with ministers on several occasions between September 2004 and March 2005.

He tackled then-prime minister Tony Blair over the lack of resources for the armed forces fighting in Iraq and also wrote to ministers about the benefits of complementary medicine, the need for affordable rural homes and the threat to heritage buildings.

In the same year there was controversy when it emerged Charles had been routinely receiving copies of confidential Cabinet papers for more than 20 years.

The Prince of Wales has long espoused the benefits of homeopathic remedies and complementary medicine – and come under fire from some in the medical profession as a result.

In a private letter to Mr Blair in 2005 he complained that a European Union directive on herbal medicinal products was having a 'deleterious effect' on the UK's complementary medicine sector by 'effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts'.

In 2008 his Duchy Originals firm and British homeopathic manufacturer Nelson launched a range of herbal remedies.

The following year the UK medicines regulator told the firm to change the wording of a campaign promoting two products because their claims were misleading.

In January, using barely coded language in a speech to her local Women's Institute in Norfolk, the Queen said she preferred 'respecting different points of view' and also called for calm

In a major documentary to mark his 70th birthday last year, Prince Charles, the heir to the throne tackled head-on the issue of his controversial lobbying and promised not to 'meddle' when he is king

Vice president Mike Pence said four Venezuelan state governors allied to Mr Maduro were the target of the new sanctions, while he urged the international community to freeze assets of the nation's state-run oil company. The US also asked the United Nations Security Council to hold an urgent meeting on the crisis.

“I want to assure you, President Guaidó, that the tragic events of the past weekend have only steeled the resolve of the United States of America,” Mr Pence said at a meeting of the Lima Group in Colombia.

The meeting was attended by opposition leader Juan Guaido, who last month declared himself Venezuela's president.

According to the Associated Press, Mr Pence added. “We are with you 100 per cent.”

Also in Colombia at the weekend, where he visited efforts to transport US aid across the border into Venezuela – an effort that resulted in violence and several deaths – was Republican senator Marco Rubio, who has been highly influential on Donald Trump’s Latin American policy and whom the New York Times has termed the “ouster in chief”.

On Sunday, he tweeted several messages attacking Mr Maduro’s government before then posting three images of ousted dictators – Libya’s Gaddafi, Panama’s Manuel Noriega and Romania’s Nicolae Ceausescu. The gruesome, blood-laced image of the Libyan leader was taken as he was bayoneted to death by rebels in the city of Sirte in October 2011. Nato had earlier engaged in a devastating bombing campaign against Gadafi's forces.

Mr Rubio’s tweet of the image contained no text, but quickly sparked outcry on social media. A number of commentators said he was tweeting the equivalent of stills from a “snuff movie”.

In Colombia at the meeting of nations from the Americas, Mr Pence spoke with Mr Guaido, who Washington had encouraged to declare himself the country’s “legitimate” president and who it quickly regonised as such after he did so. The UK, Canada and up to 50 other nations quickly followed, while China, Russia and Mexico still recognise Mr Maduo.

Mr Pence accused Mr Maduro’s forces of burning several trucks containing medical supplies over the weekend as the opposition tried to deliver US aid, even though it was unclear how they were set alight.

“As the world watched, the tyrant in Caracas danced as his henchmen murdered civilians and burned truckloads of food and medicine destined for the people of Venezuela,” Mr Pence claimed. “These men worked to block aid for people in need and suppress peaceful protests – and their actions will not go unpunished.

“In the days ahead, the US will announce even stronger sanctions on the regime's corrupt financial networks. We will find every last dollar they have stolen and return that money to the Venezuelan people.

“As we continue to bring economic and diplomatic pressure to bear on the Maduro regime, we hope for a peaceful transition to democracy, but as President Trump has made clear, all options are on the table.”

But others - including several European nations - voiced caution. Hamilton Mourão, vice president of Brazil, one of the nations that has recegnised Mr Guaido, said under no circumstances would his country allow the US to intervene militarily in Venezuela from Brazilian territory.

Mr Maduro has denied claims that he is refusing to accept aid. Indeed, the UN has stepped up distribution of humanitarian supplies in the country. His supporters point out the US has previously used shipments of aid in Latin America to smuggle weapons to rebels. Three decades ago, Elliott Abrams, currently Mr Trump’s point person on Venezuela, oversaw such an operation against the democratically elected government of Nicaragua.

Mr Maduro on Monday tweeted that the “empire and its lackey” must understand that in “Venezuela the self-determination of our people reigns. We will solve the problems in a national union, with the Bolivarian government that I preside over. Together for Venezuela!”.

Meanwhile, the US asked the UN Security Council to discuss the Venezuela situation on Tuesday. Reuters said Washington wanted the 15-member council to formally call for free, fair and credible presidential elections in Venezuela with international observers, a move that prompted Russia to propose a rival draft resolution.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - The United States targeted Venezuela's government with new sanctions on Monday and called on allies to freeze the assets of its state-owned oil company PDVSA after deadly violence blocked aid from reaching the crisis-hit country during the weekend.

The United States also took its pressure campaign to the United Nations Security Council, asking that body to discuss the situation in Venezuela, diplomats said.

The U.S. Treasury Department's sanctions were imposed on four Venezuelan state governors allied with the government of embattled President Nicolas Maduro, blocking any assets they control in the United States.

The new sanctions were announced in Bogota as U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and opposition leader Juan Guaido met with members of the Lima Group, a bloc of nations from Argentina to Canada dedicated to peaceful resolution of the Venezuelan crisis.

Pence said the United States would stand by Guaido until freedom was restored to the OPEC member. He called for all Lima Group nations to immediately freeze PDVSA's assets and to transfer ownership of Venezuelan assets in their countries from Maduro's ""henchmen"" to Guaido's government-in-waiting.

He also said tougher measures were coming.

""In the days ahead ... the United States will announce even stronger sanctions on the regime's corrupt financial networks,"" Pence said. ""We will work with all of you to find every last dollar that they stole and work to return it to Venezuela.""

Guaido, sitting next to Pence at the meeting, asked for a moment of silence for those killed in what he called the ""massacre"" of the weekend.

At least three people were killed and almost 300 wounded during the protests and clashes on Saturday as U.S.-backed aid convoys attempted to enter Venezuela to deliver food and medicine.

Guaido, recognised by most Western nations as Venezuela's legitimate leader, has urged the bloc to consider ""all options"" in ousting Maduro.

Pence repeated an earlier statement that there would be an amnesty for members of the armed forces who throw their support behind Guaido. He said he hopes Maduro and those supported by his ""corruption and his brutality"" will leave Venezuela peacefully.

""We make clear to them that we will support the interim president's call for amnesty, an inclusive government, an inclusive future for members of the armed forces, who have laid down their arms and stand with the Guaido government,"" Pence said.

Unlike the Lima Group, of which the United States is not a member, the Trump administration has so far declined to rule out the use of military force. But Peruvian Deputy Foreign Minister Hugo de Zela Martinez denied there was any division in the group over the use of force.

Pence also called for Mexico and Uruguay, two-left leaning regional governments, to join most of the region's other powers in embracing Guaido as Venezuela's rightful president.

""We believe there can be no bystanders, no one on the sidelines of this, particularly in our hemisphere, and our message today very much was intended to say - to Mexico, to Uruguay, to nations across the eastern Caribbean - that they need to come off the sidelines, they need to take a stand for freedom. Stand with us and with the people of Venezuela,"" said Pence.

Washington wants the 15-member U.N. Security Council to formally call for free, fair and credible presidential elections with international observers. Russia, which along with China has major investments in Venezuela's energy sector and back Maduro, proposed a rival draft resolution.

Violence escalated during the weekend when the convoy of trucks with food and medicines was blocked by soldiers and armed groups loyal to Maduro. He says the aid efforts are part of a U.S.-orchestrated coup against Venezuela.

In the Venezuelan town of San Antonio, near the border with Colombia, residents on Monday chafed at the continued border closure ordered by Maduro's government last week.

Residents increasingly cross into the neighbouring country to work and buy basic goods that are unavailable in Venezuela, which has been wracked by years of hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine. Illegal crossings over back roads known as ""trochas"" generally require paying tolls to low-level criminals who control them, known as ""trocheros.""

""We were hungry when before the border closed. Now it will be even worse,"" said Belkis Garcia, 34, walking with her husband along a trail that leads to Colombia. ""We have to pay (to cross), so the little money we have for half the food is not enough. We don’t know what will happen if the border continues closed.""

Four people have been killed, 58 have suffered bullet wounds and at least 32 arrested in unrest since Friday, local rights group Penal Forum said in a press conference.

The four governors sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury include the flamboyant Rafael Lacava of state of Carabobo, who in 2018 visited Washington as part of talks that led to the release of Joshua Holt, an American who was imprisoned in Venezuela for nearly two years. Lacava goes by the nickname ""Dracula"" in reference to his habit of doing late-night patrols and is known for off-the-cuff social media videos.

The U.S. isn’t a banana republic, but its police apparatus sometimes comes close.

The broadening revelations of the lawless, almost putschist excesses of the Comey-McCabe FBI and elements of the Justice Department and the Brennan-Clapper intelligence services invite serious contemplation of how close the United States came to being a country where regime change might be plausibly and self-righteously attempted by what in undemocratic countries is generally known as the secret police. It is fantastic to contemplate such a thing in the United States, which is fundamentally prouder of nothing than of its Constitution and the immense place that the system created by that Constitution and maintained these 230 years by recourse to interpretation and reassertion of it has played in the unprecedented rise of America from a loosely connected group of colonists numbering only a few million at independence to the overwhelming preeminence of the U.S.A. at the end of the Second World War. That preeminence has been substantially maintained since.

For at least 60 years I have heard high American officials announce that the United Sates is not a “banana republic.” Of course it is not, and never was. But there is a complacency about America’s status as a society of laws that is both unbecoming and unjustified. As many judges, lawyers, and commentators have noted, the level of prosecution success in criminal cases is over 95 percent, 97 percent of those without a trial; these, and the proportion of the population that is incarcerated, are totalitarian numbers. Congressional investigations where there is no lawyer–client privilege, the ease of alleging and gaining convictions on charges of dishonest responses to the police, as well as media trials long before a defense has even been filed (as in the Jussie Smollett case, where the chief of police of Chicago has been garrulously babbling out the prosecution evidence); all of this is a Star Chamber. None of it would be admissible in any other serious common-law country, such as Great Britain, Canada, Australia, or Ireland.

Every nomination to the Supreme Court is now a pitched battle replete with paid demonstrators at hearings and extensive campaigns of character assassination, but that court has sat inert as practically all the Bill of Rights’ constitutional assurances of due process, prompt and impartial justice, and the avoidance of capricious prosecutions have been abandoned. It is in this, as other civilized jurisdictions would consider it, tenuous state of the rule of law that the antics of the Comey-McCabe FBI and Brennan-Clapper intelligence direction, and their partisan effort to bend the law to install Hillary Clinton as president and sandbag Donald Trump, should be considered.

Celebrated as Thomas Jefferson rightly is for his seminal role in the creation of the country’s initial texts and its early governance, one achievement for which he has received insufficient credit is the founding of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1802. While this began as a corps of engineers limited to 20 men at first (led by Benjamin Franklin’s nephew, Jonathan Williams), the objective was to assure a non-political class of officers. The focus on engineering was, at this early stage, the young nation’s chief military requirement.

Jefferson’s initiative assured the United States of a nonpolitical military. The country has had twelve presidents who were celebrated combat military officers, from Washington to Eisenhower, including citizen generals such as Jackson, Hayes, and Garfield. And it has had a number of presidents who were distinguished middle or junior officers, including Presidents Truman, Kennedy, Nixon, Ford, Carter, and George H. W. Bush, and six high-ranking military officers who were unsuccessful presidential candidates, including the first Republican candidate, Colonel John C. Frémont; a general fired by Abraham Lincoln as commander of the Army of the Potomac, George B. McClellan, who had the effrontery to run against Lincoln in 1864; and a hero POW, John McCain.

The point of this recitation is that none of these people dabbled in politics while they were in the armed forces. The only serious figure who did so was General Douglas MacArthur, who, in response to a freshet of Republican-delegate enthusiasm from a midwestern state while he was preparing to liberate the Philippines, wrote to a supporter for public circulation a letter stating that he would accept the Republican nomination in 1944, but would be unable to campaign (as if his commander-in-chief, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, would tolerate such a thing from a serving theater commander). When General Dwight D. Eisenhower was nominated as the Republican candidate for president in 1952, and was asked when he became Republican, he replied: “Today.” No soldier has led Great Britain since Oliver Cromwell in the 17th century, except the Duke of Wellington, for two years.

The federal police (FBI) are another matter. The leader of a successful previous organization and of the FBI for a total of 47 years, J. Edgar Hoover, has been strenuously criticized for his unscrupulous political machinations, but he never attempted to influence a presidential election. When the military are depoliticized, the secret police and intelligence services, if not reined in, can be very powerful, in a democratic country as in a dictatorship. In the Soviet Union, the army only briefly was politically influential, under Marshal Zhukhov just after the death of Stalin, while Stalin’s last three secret-police leaders, Yagoda, Yezhov, and Beria, were all summarily executed after they had done a great deal of his unimaginable dirty work. Even in revolutionary and Napoleonic France, the greatest police minister in all history, the egregiously cunning Joseph Fouché, who sent the head of the Committee of Public Safety, Robespierre, to the guillotine at the end of the Reign of Terror, after Robespierre had tried to do the same to him, was sent packing finally, rich but mistrusted and powerless.

American democracy is insuperably strong in the hearts of the people and in 230 years of triumphant survival through a vehement and contentious national history. But the recent fantastic cascade of professions of righteous untouchability from Comey and McCabe and Brennan and Clapper shows that there is no institutional tradition of respect for and deference to the constitutional integrity of the system in the main police and intelligence agencies. Though fired for dishonesty and sent for grand-jury evaluation as a criminal lying to Congress and out of control, Andrew McCabe generally enjoys the support of the Trump-hating media in his book tour, celebrating a lawless disregard for the supremacy of the people under the Constitution. He feared that Trump might be a “Russian asset,” and accordingly set a special counsel with practically unlimited powers, who engaged a fervently partisan Democratic staff, upon him.

Almost the entire legal system of the United States requires radical reform and democratization, and the disarming of a virtually omnipotent prosecutocracy. It is the strength and the weakness of America that it is not really the gentle and kindly country portrayed by Norman Rockwell and Walt Disney. That America exists and is a revered pastoral self-image. But the United States is ultimately a jungle, and jungles are ruled by 30-foot constricting snakes and 600-pound cats, and these are usually the rulers of America, with a varying level of humanization.

The intense struggle for the highest positions in the country is a generally meritocratic struggle, with only rare lapses into mediocrity. The survival and elevation process leaves an inordinate number of severely shattered people. In such a society, the senior police and intelligence apparatus can be dangerous, and in the last few years, it has been. The outcome of the present struggle for power in Washington should include tighter civilian control of these agencies, as in the military, the end of the effort to criminalize policy differences, and the end of the attempted reduction of the drastic remedy of impeachment to a partisan power play to reverse the result of elections. That is essentially what it was in the Nixon and Clinton presidencies and has been since the 2016 election.

64,Empty,2019-02-26T00:30:27Z,"The US Treasury Department's sanctions are imposed on 4 Venezuelan state governors allied with the government of President Nicolas Maduro, blocking any assets they control in the US.","BOGOTA: The United States targeted Venezuela’s government with new sanctions on Monday and called on allies to freeze the assets of its state-owned oil company PDVSA after deadly violence blocked humanitarian aid from reaching the country over the weekend.

As Colombia’s foreign minister warned about “credible threats to the life” of Venezuela’s opposition leader Juan Guaido, the Trump administration also took its pressure campaign to the United Nations Security Council, asking it to discuss the situation in Venezuela, diplomats said.

The US Treasury Department’s sanctions were imposed on four Venezuelan state governors allied with the government of President Nicolas Maduro, blocking any assets they control in the United States.

The new sanctions were announced in Bogota as US Vice-President Mike Pence and Guaido met with members of the Lima Group, a bloc of nations from Argentina to Canada dedicated to peaceful resolution of the political and economic crisis in Venezuela.

Pence said the United States would stand by Guaido until freedom was restored. He called for all Lima Group nations to immediately freeze PDVSA’s assets and to transfer ownership of Venezuelan assets in their countries from Maduro’s “henchmen” to Guaido’s government-in-waiting.

He also said tougher measures were coming against the OPEC member.

“In the days ahead … the United States will announce even stronger sanctions on the regime’s corrupt financial networks,” Pence said. “We will work with all of you to find every last dollar that they stole and work to return it to Venezuela.”

While the day presented a united regional front against Maduro, who is widely accused of coming to power through fraudulent elections, there was no clear sign that the latest measures would succeed in pushing him toward the exit.

On a day that began with Guaido urging “all options” to be considered to remove Maduro, the threat of military intervention seemed if anything weaker after the meeting.

Guaido, sitting next to Pence at the meeting, asked for a moment of silence for those killed in what he called the “massacre” of the weekend.

Guaido himself could be in danger from the Maduro regime, Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo said, speaking on behalf of the Lima Group.

“There’s information about serious and credible threats to the life and integrity of Juan Guaido and his family, as well as to his wife’s family. From Bogota, we want to hold the usurper Maduro responsible for any violent action against Guaido, against his wife and against their relatives,”

At least three people were killed and almost 300 wounded during protests and clashes on Saturday as US-backed aid convoys attempted to enter Venezuela to deliver food and medicine.

In a joint statement at the close of the meeting, the Lima Group said Maduro was a threat to peace and security in the region and called for his immediate exit, a democratic transition and free elections.

Guaido, recognised by most Western nations as Venezuela’s legitimate leader, has urged the bloc to consider “all options” in ousting Maduro.

But the Lima Group said it “reiterates the conviction that the transition to democracy must be conducted by the Venezuelans themselves peacefully and within the framework of the Constitution and international law,” the statement said.

Pence repeated an earlier statement that there would be an amnesty for members of the armed forces who throw their support behind Guaido. He said he hoped Maduro and those supported by his “corruption and his brutality” will leave Venezuela peacefully.

“We make clear to them that we will support the interim president’s call for amnesty, an inclusive government, an inclusive future for members of the armed forces, who have laid down their arms and stand with the Guaido government,” Pence said.

Unlike the Lima Group, of which the United States is not a member, the Trump administration has so far declined to rule out the use of military force. But Peruvian Deputy Foreign Minister Hugo de Zela Martinez denied there was any division in the group over the use of force.

Pence also called for Mexico and Uruguay, two-left leaning regional governments, to join most of the region’s other powers in embracing Guaido as Venezuela’s rightful president.

“We believe there can be no bystanders, no one on the sidelines of this, particularly in our hemisphere,” Pence said.

Washington wants the 15-member UN Security Council to formally call for free, fair and credible presidential elections with international observers. Russia, which along with China has major investments in Venezuela’s energy sector and back Maduro, proposed a rival draft resolution.

Soldiers and armed groups loyal to Maduro blocked a convoy of trucks with food and medicines during the weekend. Maduro says the aid efforts are part of a US-orchestrated coup.

At least 167 members of Maduro’s armed forces have deserted since Saturday and more are expected to flee across the border to Colombia.

In the Venezuelan town of San Antonio, near the border with Colombia, residents on Monday chafed at the continued border closure ordered by Maduro’s government last week. Four people have been killed, 58 have suffered bullet wounds and at least 32 arrested since Friday, local rights group Penal Forum said.

Residents increasingly cross into the neighbouring country to work and buy basic goods that are unavailable in Venezuela, which has suffered years of hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine. Illegal crossings over back roads known as “trochas” generally require paying tolls to low-level criminals who control them, known as “trocheros.”

“We were hungry when before the border closed. Now it will be even worse,” said Belkis Garcia, 34, walking with her husband along a trail that leads to Colombia. “We have to pay (to cross), so the little money we have for half the food is not enough. We don’t know what will happen if the border continues closed.”

The Lima Group said it would ask the International Criminal Court to consider “the serious humanitarian situation in Venezuela, the criminal violence of Nicolas Maduro’s regime against the civilian population, and the denial of access to international assistance.”

Every one of my elementary school teachers said it: You will be judged by the company you keep. In Donald Trump's case, that company not only includes Michael Cohen and the others who have been indicted or convicted for breaking the occasional law, but even bigger fish: Vladimir Putin of Russia, Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia (MBS) and Kim Jong Un of North Korea. This is Trump's own Axis of Evil.

The original Axis of Evil, an idiotic formulation propounded by George W. Bush in his 2002 State of the Union address, consisted of Iraq and Iran -- who had recently tried to annihilate each other -- and North Korea. Iran's membership remains in good standing, but a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq no longer qualifies. And North Korea's cuddly tyrant has now been embraced by the president as ""my friend."" Trump found him wholly innocent for the death of the American college student Otto Warmbier, who was returned to the U.S. in a vegetative state.

Kim assured Trump he had nothing to do with Warmbier's death, and the president, as he has done with MBS and Putin in similar circumstance, bought it. Kim ""tells me that he didn't know about it, and I will take him at his word,"" Trump said while in Hanoi for his sit-down last week with the North Korean dictator. It should be pointed out that Kim had his dear uncle executed, maintains a Gulag system similar to Stalin's of old and is his country's absolute ruler. It's hard to believe that an American was imprisoned without Kim getting the memo.

For Trump, there is precedent here. He shrugged off the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi operatives in that nation's Istanbul diplomatic consulate. Repeatedly, Trump insisted that he had given MBS the third degree and that the crown prince, whose close associates the CIA strongly suggested had murdered Khashoggi, was wonderfully alibied. At the moment, there are reports that Saudi-American dual citizen, Walid Fitaihi, was tortured while detained in November 2017. I can save Trump the phone call: MBS knows nothing about this.

Finally, we come to Putin. His regime is accused of numerous human rights violations and the murder of dissidents, both at home and abroad. And yet Trump has nary a word of criticism for the Russian leader. On the contrary, he has slobbered him with praise, not even holding him responsible for interfering in the 2016 elections. Instead, Trump has been harsher on his own intelligence officials, all of whom dusted the elections and found Putin's fingerprints all over it.

""I believe that President Putin really feels, and he feels strongly, that he did not meddle in our election,"" Trump has said. Case closed.

If you collected the despots Trump has singled out for praise, you would have an international version of the storied Apalachin meeting, the 1957 mobster fest in a once-obscure New York State hamlet. That meeting established without question the existence of the Mafia, which -- pre-Godfather movies -- was doubted by, among others, J. Edgar Hoover. A Trump meeting with his associates would establish his stunning moral and political corruption.

If, on the other hand, you assembled the world leaders he has insulted, you would have an entirely different kind of meeting: Justin Trudeau of Canada, whom he called ""very dishonest and weak""; Theresa May of Great Britain, whom he said is mishandling Brexit and had the effrontery not to follow his advice; and, above all, Angela Merkel of Germany, for whom he has shown unbridled contempt. He criticized her immigration policy and later, in an act of sheer schoolroom disrespect, tossed a handful of Starburst candy at her at a G-7 meeting. ""Don't say I never give you anything,"" he said.

As others have pointed out, Michael Cohen described a Mafia-like organization, built around protecting one man. Cohen alleged lying. He alleged payoff. Cohen alleged a code in which denial meant assent, assent meant denial and the truth was uttered only if some stranger got off the elevator at Trump Tower on the wrong floor.

But while Trump's personal corruption was never in doubt -- ask any New York real estate developer if they would take Trump's check -- his moral complicity in human rights atrocities gives him a breadth and stench that remain both puzzling (what does Putin have on him?) and sickening. I am tempted to say he keeps the wrong company, but Aesop, the Bible and school teachers everywhere know better. He's precisely where he belongs.

“Believe in your dream, work towards it, keep the consistency without any thought of giving up. Deafen your ears and blind your eyes to people’s negativity and put God first.”

These we’re the words of serial entrepreneur, Engr. Alabi Samson Ayobami, Founder/CEO, Starwise Group, in a chat with Vanguard.

It is not all the time we see integrity, brilliance, capacity, and performance all in one person at the same time. The example of Starwise Group CEO is compelling.

Amstel Malta awards Samson Itodo “Young Person of the Year” at Future Awards Africa

This is because an extraordinary entrepreneur in the person of Engr Alabi Samson Ayobami has deployed the magnitude of his integrity, brilliance, and capacity in the conceptualization and execution of the company’s mandate in the world of entertainment and other business circles.

Alabi Samson Ayobami (aka. Rubson) from Ogun state, was born and bred in Kaduna state, Northern Nigeria, but currently resides in Canada. He is a graduate of Civil Engineering from Liaoning University, China.

He is a man of many parts, and in his own words, “I love challenges because those are what make me a God-fearing man.” Mr. Alabi is a fast-rising entrepreneur and founder/CEO of Starwise Group. His diversity and work ethic is an inspiration to many. He got an MBA from the University of South Wales, London and is presently pursuing another Masters in Civil Engineering in Canada.

Samson was influenced by the environment around him before bursting into the entertainment business. He was known in his Secondary school, Airforce Military School, Jos, for his affinity for music and comedy shows.

Getting to China in 2013, Samson realized there were a lot of opportunities and platforms for foreigners in China to feel at home through such entertainment events and shows as they often would have had if they were in there various countries. He is a happy person and wants everyone around him to be happy as well.

He found out early enough that entertainment is one of such things that can make people happy. This earned him, Entrepreneur of the Year award by Toosabi Awards and ‘Face of Foreigners in China’ award all in China. Since then, he and his Starwise Group have held different events in Nigeria and China, keeping up the entertainment spirit and making people happy.

He founded Starwise Group in 2013 after realizing his strong knack for entrepreneurship and providing solutions to the problems around him. The company is a strong image of his personality and according to him, his daily affirmation, “strive to succeed”. He lived by those words each day even before turning it into a brand, which birthed his legally recognized Starwise Group company. Mr. Alabi is Starwsie and believes that he is his own inspiration. Of course, it hasn’t been an easy road for him and the company but with each challenge, the company is elevated to the next level.

Timi Frank to INEC, Police: March words with actions on elections’ day

Turning his vision into reality wasn’t so much of a challenge. He saw it as the beginning of a new chapter that somehow had already been written; in his words, “all that was left was for me to start acting my part”. He persevered through many challenges while setting up Starwise Group but through extra work, effort, consistency and personal inspiration, Mr. Alabi was able to break through and become successful.

“managing hard work and lifestyle isn’t much of a challenge because hard work is my lifestyle”.

There is no doubt that Samson has a restless mind. He is also enamored of adventurism in the quest for innate and profound self-fulfillment. That would explain why he was awarded the Best Treasurer Award by the Association of Nigerian Students in China (ANSIC). Working in harmony with the members of the Starwise team, Samson is strategically poised to deliver wonderful concerts, shows, and events. Starwise has leading its leadership infrastructure, a brilliant, honest and capacitated man who can break the glass ceiling and whose limit is the sky.","Meet Alabi Samson, Founder/CEO Starwise Group",Vanguardngr.com,https://www.vanguardngr.com/2019/02/meet-alabi-samson-founder-ceo-starwise-group/

US broadcaster Univision says its team was briefly detained in the Venezuelan presidential palace where they had been interviewing President Nicolás Maduro.

The incident happened after award-winning journalist Jorge Ramos showed Mr Maduro images of Venezuelans eating from a bin lorry, the network says.

Their equipment was confiscated.

Venezuela's Information Minister Jorge Rodríguez said the government had welcomed hundreds of journalists but it did not support ""cheap shows"".

The team was deported on Tuesday.

Univision, the leading Spanish-language TV network in the US, said the six-member crew had been released after almost three hours but that their recording and personal belongings had not been returned.

Speaking on Univision, Mr Ramos said Mr Maduro ""had not liked"" some of the questions about ""the lack of democracy in Venezuela, torture, political prisoners and the humanitarian crisis"".

""He got up after I showed him videos of young people eating out of a bin lorry,"" he said of the interview at the Miraflores palace in the capital, Caracas.

""What I told Nicolás Maduro is that millions of Venezuelans and many governments around the world don't consider him a legitimate president but a dictator.""

During their detention, Mr Ramos and Univision Vice President María Martínez were kept for ""a few minutes"" in a separate room where the lights were turned off, the broadcaster said.

Mr Ramos, a veteran Mexican-born American journalist, is known for his confrontational style of questioning. In 2015, he was thrown out of a news conference of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump.

Natalie Southwick, Central and South America programme co-ordinator of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said: ""By shutting down an interview and censoring one of Latin America's most high-profile reporters, Nicolás Maduro has demonstrated his fundamental disregard for the press.""

Last month, several local and foreign journalists were briefly detained while working in Caracas. Some ended up being deported.

On Twitter, Mr Rodríguez added: ""Hundreds of journalists have come through Miraflores who have received decent treatment that we always give to those who do journalistic work.""

Earlier, a group of Latin American countries and Canada said Mr Maduro was a threat to peace and security in the region and called for his immediate exit, a democratic transition and free elections.

Meeting in the Colombian capital, Bogotá, the Lima group urged the International Criminal Court to consider whether Venezuela was guilty of crimes against humanity for refusing to allow aid into the country.

At least two people died in Saturday's clashes between civilians and troops loyal to Mr Maduro that blocked the entrance of foreign aid organised by opposition leader and self-declared interim President Juan Guaidó.

Mr Maduro says the aid efforts are part of a US-orchestrated coup.

Indian and Pakistani troops traded fire briefly along the contested border in Kashmir on Thursday morning, a day after the two nuclear powers both downed enemy jets, with Pakistan capturing an Indian pilot.

The United States, China and other world powers have urged restraint from the two nations as tensions escalate following tit-for-tat airstrikes in the wake of a suicide car bombing that killed at least 40 Indian paramilitary police in Indian-controlled Kashmir on Feb. 14.

Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has called for talks.

""History tells us that wars are full of miscalculation. My question is that, given the weapons we have, can we afford miscalculation,"" Khan said during a brief televised broadcast to the nation. ""We should sit down and talk.""

Pakistan and India have fought three wars since independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two over Kashmir, and went to the brink of a fourth in 2002 after a Pakistani militant attack on India's parliament.

Pakistan has shut its airspace, forcing commercial airlines to reroute. Thai Airways International announced on Thursday that it had cancelled flights to Pakistan and Europe, which left thousands of passengers stranded in Bangkok.

On Thursday morning troops from India and Pakistan briefly exchanged fire in Poonch, a district in Indian-occupied Kashmir, according to a statement from the Indian army.

""The Indian army retaliated strongly and effectively,"" said Lieutenant Colonel Devender Anand, a defense ministry spokesman.

The firing, that India claims was initiated by Pakistan began just after 6 a.m., lasted a little over an hour and was significantly less elevated than artillery fire between the two sides on Wednesday. There were no reported casualties in the last clash.

India is building more than 14,000 bunkers for families living along its border with Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir state, hoping to keep them safe near their homes instead of evacuating them due to artillery firing.

On Wednesday evening India's foreign ministry handed a dossier to Pakistan that it claimed detailed camps of the Paskistan-based militant group that carried out the Feb 14 attack.

The conflict comes at a critical time for Indian Prime Minster Narendra Modi, who faces a general election in a matter of months.

Late on Wednesday B.S. Yeddyurappa, the leader of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party in the southern state of Karnataka, said India's strike inside Pakistani territory would help the party to win back power in the state - the first such comment from a member of the ruling party.

""This has brought a pro-Modi wave all through the country,"" he told reporters.

""The effect of this will be seen in the elections.""

The latest escalation marks a sudden deterioration in relations between the two countries. As recently as November, Pakistan's leader Khan spoke of ""mending ties"" with India.

The White House urged ""both sides to take immediate steps to de-escalate the situation.""

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement he had spoken separately with the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan and urged them to ""prioritise direct communication and avoid further military activity"".

Pakistan's envoy to the United States, Asad Majeed Khan, said Islamabad would like to see the Trump administration play a more active role in easing the crisis.

At the same time, he said the lack of U.S. condemnation of India's strike on Pakistan was ""construed and understood as an endorsement of the Indian position, and that is what emboldened them even more”.

China, the European Union and other countries including Iran also called for restraint.

The Chinese government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, spoke by telephone with Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and expressed ""deep concern"", China's foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday.

The United States, Britain and France proposed the United Nations Security Council blacklist the head of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad, which claimed responsibility for the Feb. 14 attack. China is likely to be oppose the move.

Thai Airways said it had cancelled more than a dozen flights to Europe due to Pakistan's move, along with all flights to and from the country.

Several airlines including Emirates and Qatar Airways, suspended flights to Pakistan on Wednesday, while others such as Singapore Airlines and British Airways were forced to reroute flights.

Singapore Airlines said on Thursday all of its Europe-bound flights would continue as planned, avoiding the affected airspace as necessary.

Flights from the Middle East and India were also affected. Air Canada said on Wednesday it has temporarily suspended service to India.

Migrant workers were fleeing India's Jammu and Kashmir and tourist arrivals have fallen to a trickle due to the conflict, badly hurting businesses in the Himalayan region known for its scenic beauty and fruit harvests.

Christopher S. Ripley -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. We have some great results to report and some equally exciting updates on our business strategies. Since our board approved a $1 billion share repurchase authorization last August, the largest in our company's history, we've used approximately $320 million to buy back 11 million shares or 11% of the total shares outstanding, generating $0.63 of annualized free cash flow per share. At a 5x average free cash flow multiple, that represents approximately $300 million of equity value created.

As you know, local news is one of our most valuable assets and an area that we have made significant investments in over the years, including additional news hours, 24/7 content centers, townhalls and deeper investigative reporting. We continue to be an industry leader with our cutting edge drone journalism, and are proud to announce that our drone program just flew it's 10,000th flight. Through our drone journalism across the country, we've been able to provide our viewers with a unique visual perspective on significant local stories.

The return on our news investments is evident in the almost 350 awards received this past year and in our 2018 political revenue results. Not only did we generate a company record $255 million of political revenues, but we grew our share of the total ad dollar spent.

As we think about the strength of 2018's mid-term elections and a number of candidates already announcing their candidacy for President, we believe the 2020 presidential cycle will result in yet another record breaking political year for us.

While we continue to strengthen our local news offerings, we also have been focused on local sports, entering into a joint venture with the Chicago Cubs and bringing together one of America's most iconic sports franchises with our company's expertise in production, distribution and local sales.

Marquee Sports Network, as the newly created regional sports network will be called, launches in the first quarter of 2020 and represents a new level of premium content for which we can use the many strengths of our organization cultivated over decades of operating broadcast stations.

On the ATSC 3.0 technology front, we had many exciting announcements at CES, along with our partner Saankhya Labs, we showcased the first 3.0 mobile chipset which Samsung Foundry will begin producing in volume this year. What's even more exciting is that this ATSC 3.0 chip is designed for all the mainstream global TV standards, making it a global SKU for OEMs. Meanwhile, we signed a joint venture agreement to work with SK Telecom on the technologies needed for the convergence of next-gen television and 5G wireless. We also announced an MOU with SK Telecom and Harman, world leaders in automotive and infotainment systems, to co-develop an advanced automotive platform based on the ATSC 3.0 broadcast standard.

The new platform will use terrestrial broadcast facilities to allow drivers to experience various in-vehicle services, such as HD terrestrial video broadcast, TV broadcasting, 3D maps, software updates, and vehicle-to-everything certificate management.

Finally, we and Spectrum Co. are in the process of finalizing deployment plans for ATSC 3.0 in 20 to 30 of our markets in 2019. I know many of you are awaiting an update on the status of some of our network affiliation and MVPD agreements. We are pleased to report that we have renewed NBC affiliations in 13 markets and successfully negotiated 26 FOX affiliations, as well as our retransmission renewal of Mediacom. We are reconfirming our guidance for net distribution revenues to be up low teens percents this year and in 2020.

Before I turn it over to Lucy, I think it's important to give you some color around the many initiatives that we are working on, because you'll see those expenses running through our 2019 outlook, and we want to make sure you understand the value proposition. Our initiatives can be broken down into content, distribution and marketing services. On the distribution side, an important company focuses your continued investment in ATSC 3.0, which we believe will transform our industry through added capacity in an over-the-air and 5G hybrid environment. Addressability, interactivity and mobility of our signal. Our content initiative is centered around controlling more of our rights in establishing brands to monetize the content on multiple platforms.

Included here are investments in our emerging networks of Comet, Charge! TBD and Stadium and our newly launched direct-to-consumer offering STIRR. We are also making investments in Tennis Channel securing long-term rights for the WTA and ATP. Tennis Channel will also launch an international consumer offering, which we are targeting for launch later this year. Furthermore, our newly announced RSN with the Cubs which will go live in 2020 will have some minor CapEx and start-up costs this year.

On the marketing side, our media network sales group is making further strides into the $50 billion pool of advertising dollars allocated to cable networks. We continue to launch new digital products, such as Compulse OTT and have several sales initiatives around technology and automation and transforming our sales force from generalists to dedicated category specialists.

At the same time, we are constantly reviewing our initiatives. This quarter, we've launched a cost-cutting program, under which we expect to achieve $20 million in annualized cost savings by ramping down non-performing initiatives and implementing other operating efficiencies.

Our initiatives are bending the curve on advertising growth and helping replace what is lost from fragmentation. We believe that by diversifying our offerings and revenue mix and by being broadly distributed with unique and defensible content, we can create long-term value for our shareholders.

As I mentioned, you'll see these strategic expenses in our 2019 guidance. Absent these initiatives and step-ups and reverse retrans and pro forma for our cost-cutting program, our media expenses are estimated to increase less than 1% for the year.

Now Lucy will take you through the fourth quarter results.

Lucy A. Rutishauser -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Chris. Continuing with the positive news, I'm pleased to report that we exceeded our fourth quarter media revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow guidance.

Media revenues for the fourth quarter were $849 million, an increase of 22.5% or $156 million higher than fourth quarter 2017 and exceeding our guidance. For the year, we achieved record-setting media revenues of $2,919 million. Included in our fourth quarter media revenues was $334 million of distribution revenue, an 11% increase over the prior year period. For the year, distribution revenues were $1,299 million, and as guided, we achieved pro forma net retrans growth of low-single-digit percent for the year.

Political revenues in the fourth quarter were a record-setting $150 million versus $16 million in the fourth quarter of last year, a non-election year, and higher than the top-end of our guidance range. Media operating expenses in the fourth quarter, defined as media production and media SG&A expenses, were $475 million, up from the fourth quarter last year on higher reverse retrans fees, the growth initiatives, and compensation and sales commissions on a higher revenue. Our reported media expenses were $11 million unfavorable to our previous guidance, but that was primarily due to exceeding our revenue projections.

Corporate overhead in the quarter was $22 million. Non-media EBITDA was approximately $7 million in the quarter, $13 million better than our prior guidance on higher sales at our antenna company, Dielectric, and timing of ONE Media and R&D expenses that will roll into 2019.

EBITDA in the fourth quarter adjusted for $3 million of legal, regulatory and other nonrecurring costs, was $340 million, up $108 million and exceeding guidance. Net interest expense for the quarter was $49 million and our weighted average cost of debt is approximately 5.5%. Equity method and other investments for the quarter were a net expense of $17 million, primarily related to our sustainability initiatives.

Diluted earnings per share on $98 million weighted average common shares was $2.10 in the quarter or $2.13 per share, excluding $0.03 of onetime and nonrecurring costs. Recall, that in 2017 in addition to $24 million of tax reform, bonuses, legal, regulatory and other non-recurring costs we also had $225 million gain related to vacating spectrum in two markets, as well as a non-recurring benefit of $272 million related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities as a result of the reduction in corporate federal income tax rate.

Excluding these onetime in non-recurring items, the prior year adjusted diluted earnings per share would've been $0.50, as compared to an adjusted $2.13 in the fourth quarter of 2018.

As Chris mentioned, we continue to buy our shares back, repurchasing 6.1 million shares in the fourth quarter. Excluding the $3 million of legal regulatory and other non-recurring costs, we generated $268 million of free cash flow in the quarter and exceeded guidance on the EBITDA beat. $175 million of the free cash flow went to share repurchases, $12 million to debt pay-down, and $19 million to dividend distributions, the dividend rate, which we increased 11% in the fourth quarter.

For the year, free cash flow was a record-setting $730 million. Combined 2017-2018 pro forma cash flow was $1,173 million, beating guidance and representing free cash flow per share of $5.98 on 98 million shares. For 2018-2019, we are raising the low end of our guidance for a new range of $1,150 million to $1,220 million or $6.18 to $6.56 of free cash flow per share on 93 million shares. We are introducing 2019-2020 free cash flow guidance of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion or $6.45 to $6.99 of free cash flow per share on 93 million shares.

Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $27 million, including $9 million for the repack. For full year 2018, non-repack CapEx was $74 million below our guidance of $81 million, with the difference rolling into 2019. In addition, repack CapEx was $31 million for the full year of 2018, compared to our expectation of $37 million also on timing.

For 2019, we expect non-repack CapEx to be $110 million to $120 million, including timing of the 2018 projects, as well as deploying ATSC 3.0 in 20 to 30 markets. Repack CapEx in 2019 is expected to be $140 million, which is expected to be reimbursed by the government.

Cash programming payments during the fourth quarter were $25 million and for the year were $108 million, in line with our prior guidance. We're expecting 2019 film (ph) payments to decline to $95 million.

Net cash taxes paid in the fourth quarter were $11 million, with $10 million related to spectrum sales and therefore not deducted from free cash flow purposes. For 2019 we are estimating cash taxes to be approximately $29 million, with the majority of that relating to the 2018 extension payment. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be 9% for the year.

At December 31, total debt to a $3,892 million, including $21 million of non guaranteed and VIE debt. Cash at December 31st was approximately $1,060 million. In addition, we had $485 million available on our revolver, bringing total liquidity to over $1.5 billion.

Total net leverage through the holding company at quarter end was 3.21x on a trailing eight quarter basis, excluding the VIE non-guaranteed debt and net of cash. The first lien indebtedness ratio on a trailing eight quarters was 1.17x on a covenant of 4.45x. I know I've said this every quarter this past year, but this is now our strongest balance sheet in our company history, and that's even after having repurchased 8% of our total equity in 2018.

As mentioned, we did repurchase 6.1 million shares of that in the fourth quarter and another 3.4 million shares in the first quarter of 2019, representing 11% of total equity repurchased since August 2018. We currently have approximately $767 million remaining on our share authorization.

Now Steve Marks will take you through our operating performance.

Steven M. Marks -- Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer

Thank you, Lucy and good morning everybody. We ended 2018 on a very positive note with the strongest midterm political year in the company's history. We beat both our political and core advertising guidance in the quarter. In fact, despite the political crowd-out effect, the back half of 2018 outperformed better than the first half and the fourth quarter was the strongest of all quarters, with the core advertising down just over 3%.

Political ad revenue in the fourth quarter was $150 million versus $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $2 million better than our guidance. For the year, we did over $0.25 billion in midterm political advertising. To put this in perspective, 2018's $255 million just missed beating 2012's $266 million of pro forma Presidential Year dollars and crushed both 2016's $206 million and 2014's $155 million pro forma results. With more than a dozen candidates already campaigning for 2020, we believe there are strong indications that the coming presidential year will be extremely robust and our biggest year ever. Our digital business continues to perform very well with revenues growing 22% in the fourth quarter as compared to the same period last year. Our Compulse OTT product has been a hit, and one of our fastest-growing digital verticals.

Turning to our outlook for first quarter, we are expecting media revenues to be approximately $667 million to $673 million, up 4% to 5% as compared to first quarter 2018. This assumes $2 million of political revenues versus $7 million last year, and includes $344 million to $347 million in distribution fees versus $314 million last year.

Core advertising revenues in the first quarter, excluding political, are expected to be flattish versus the same period last year. On the expense side, we are forecasting media expenses in the first quarter to be approximately $476 million to $478 million. Pro forma for the cost-cutting program were $482 million to $484 million on a as-reported basis. The majority of the increase versus the first quarter of 2018 is due to reverse retrans and the growth initiatives and added Tennis rights that Chris talked about.

For the year, media expenses are expected to be $1,964 million to $1,967 million. Pro forma for the cost-cutting program were $1,970 million to $1,973 million on a as-reported basis. The year-to-year increase is due primarily to reverse retrans renewals and escalators, and our growth initiatives and rights fees.

These revenue-generating initiatives, including STIRR, launched last month upgrades the content on our multicast channels of Comet and Charge! and TBD, expanding our (ph) digital and content labs to do proof-of-concepts on future content and digital offerings.

Tennis Channel's long-term rights to the WTA and ATP, as well as plans to roll out an international direct-to-consumer tennis product later this year, sales transformation, investments in news and marquee start-up costs. Excluding reverse, the growth initial investments in tennis rights, media expenses are forecasted to increase by less than 1% in 2019. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter is expected to be approximately $152 million to $157 million. Pro forma for the cost-cutting program were $146 million to $151 million on an as-reported basis. As a reminder, net retrans for the year is expected to grow low-teen percents.

For the quarter -- for the first quarter, we expect adjusted free cash flow to be $77 million to $82 million pro forma for the cost-cutting program, with $71 million to $76 million on an as-reported basis. As Lucy mentioned, 2018-2019 average free cash flow per share is estimated at $6.37 and for 2019-2020 $6.72 per share.

I know we've provided a lot of numbers to you this morning. So before turning it over to questions, I want to highlight some of the key takeaways.

One, core advertising continued to improve throughout 2018 and we expect it to be up for 2019. Net retrans is expected to grow low-teen percents in each of 2019 and in 2020. The company is undertaking an annualized $20 million cost-cutting program. Free cash flow per share is expected to grow for 2018-2019 and again for 2019-2020. Our credit profile is at (technical difficulty), and our initiatives are bending the advertising growth curve.

And with that I would like to open it up to questions.

Questions and Answers:

Operator

(Operator Instructions). We'll go first to Aaron Watts with Deutsche Bank.

Aaron Watts -- Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc -- Analyst

Hey everyone. Thanks for all the details. I am going to start with a question on core. It sounds like you're seeing kind of a flattish environment in the first quarter. Can you talk about a little bit what you're seeing on the local side versus national? Maybe touch on the auto category as well? And then what gives you confidence you see an improving trajectory, as you move through the year?

Steven M. Marks -- Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer

I want to take you through fourth quarter beginning in November, because it tells a great story ending the year. We were just a pinch shy off flat in November and remember there is -- first week of November, there is political advertising. In December, we were up in core and we were up impressively in December. And when you take a look at the automotive category in 2018, which was clearly down, and fourth quarter, hard to pinpoint because of the crowd-out figure, we did huge money in political in fourth quarter. We're also very encouraged right now in the first quarter with that flattish figure, as automotive continues to be slightly down for us, and I don't think you're going to hear that from most of the calls that you'd be doing after us.

We're doing actually quite well in auto and we believe auto, for 2019, will be in the plus category for us, as will core. So when you take a look at the last two months of 2018, and you take a look at the momentum that we have going into 2019, we're really encouraged with this report. We believe core will be up in 2019. We believe oil will be up in 2019. So again, not sure how much you're going to hear that from others, but that's how we feel right now about our business.

David Smith -- Chairman Of The Board

And as Chris mentioned going from generalist to specialist, we've made a concerted effort to hire folks that are selling to the auto groups to come from the auto industry, especially for tier-3 in our local markets, and that's part of our transformation again, trailing down from generalist to specialist.

Christopher S. Ripley -- President and Chief Executive Officer

I also want to mention one thing, in addition to the automotive category, we should take a look at the services category, and how it has been really robust. For us its the second biggest billing category we have, and there was a ton of money. And it was up in the fourth quarter and it is up really big in first quarter and driving our numbers. So the goods and services category for us is on a low and a very impressive low.

Aaron Watts -- Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc -- Analyst

Okay. That's really helpful. Are you seeing any kind of bifurcation between local and national? Or are both trending relatively -- kind of evenly within the context of the guidance you gave?

Christopher S. Ripley -- President and Chief Executive Officer

They are both trending relatively evenly. Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge, Fiat, has moved to a new agency along with Chevy, and we expect to see quality results from the moves to these new agencies.

Aaron Watts -- Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc -- Analyst

All right great. And maybe one more if I can. For Chris, bigger picture; as you look at the M&A pipeline and opportunities that may be ahead of you for this year, maybe you can just talk about what's in focus for Sinclair on both the station side? I don't know if you can comment on the latest on the regional sports networks or other opportunities you see maybe being out there for the company? Obviously you're sitting on a large cash balance and your leverage is -- as Lucy pointed out, historically low.

Christopher S. Ripley -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Sure thing Aaron. So we have participated in the last couple of processes around the TV broadcast side and they both -- net of going for multiples that were well above our price thresholds to other buyers. And so it's certainly nice to see a very robust M&A market for TV broadcast. I think that's going to have a knock-on effect here for the public players, since the private market is very robust, very high multiples being traded out.

And we'll continue to be active looking at future opportunities as they come up. We're just very disciplined right now on our multiples and what we're willing to play, and it just appears that others are willing to stretch more than us on the TV broadcast side.

On the RSN side we are ecstatic about our announcement with the Cubs. We obviously have -- well not obviously, but there has been reports about us having other opportunities in this space. I can't comment specifically on those reports, due to non-disclosure agreements we've signed. But there is a very unique moment in time here in the RSN space that we really like our positioning on.

At the end of the day, these RSNs represent the most watched programs on TV, and they're really super premium content with true scarcity value. You can't create more sports. You can create almost anything more of any other genre, including entertainment programming, as we've seen with the explosion of peak TV on the entertainment side and you can certainly create more news, though it has held up better in terms of scarcity value than entertainment. But the real -- most scarcest content at the end of the day is sports, and it's showing in the ratings. Sports overall has grown in ratings over the last eight years in linear television, and really the only thing that's even close to that is news, in terms of the strength. Everything else has suffered under fragmentation and increased supply.

So we think RSNs are highly complementary. They fit well with what we do on the broadcast side. They play on our strengths on distribution, production and ad sales, and as I said, we're ecstatic with what we've done with the Cubs and that's going to be a great addition for us, and we'll of course be very disciplined on value and look forward to seeing what opportunities may come our way.

Aaron Watts -- Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc -- Analyst

Great. Thank you very much.

Christopher S. Ripley -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thanks Aaron.

We'll go next to Steven Cahall of Royal Bank of Canada.

Steven Cahall -- Royal Bank of Canada -- Analyst

Yeah, thank you. Maybe first if we could just drill down a little bit on your commentary around auto. So I think it's really interesting that you think it'll be up in 2019. I think a lot of forecasters are expecting deliveries to be down. So maybe if you could give us just a little bit more color on what's driving your commentary there? And then I have got a follow up on your share count outlook.

Steven M. Marks -- Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer

I think we got a secret sauce on the automotive category. We've been out hiring people from the space. As our business changes, we have to change with the business. And we are essentially a technology company. We're out there tackling the technology and tackling the technology as it pertains to this category, and we're out hiring people that know the category, and we're hiring them and we're having these people call on the automotive business, and we're seeing the results of it. So it's a different strategy. Instead of hiring people that sell spots, we're hiring people that sell cars, and we're speaking the language better today than we've ever spoken the language, and we're bearing the results.

David Smith -- Chairman Of The Board

So to put it a little succinctly is, we're dealing directly at the tier-3 level, as well as the advertising agency. So we're saturating this category horizontally and vertically.

Steven Cahall -- Royal Bank of Canada -- Analyst

Great. Thanks for that. On the buyback just taking the guidance that you gave for 2019-2020 share count and doing some back of the envelope math, I'm getting to maybe 9%, 10% reduction in the share count. You did a big buyback in Q4. It seems like you have the capacity to go a lot higher than that. I know it's kind of dependent on what comes out on the M&A market. But until we hear something on M&A, how should we think about just really framing what you're going to look to do in the share repurchase market in the near-term? Thank you.

Christopher S. Ripley -- President and Chief Executive Officer

So we have -- since we announced the $1 billion buyback, we've almost done one-third of that in terms of total dollars and we've done so at an average price of around $29. So we're very happy with the results so far. We really took advantage of the weakness in Q1 to buy a lot of shares at a very attractive price. And so going forward, we're going to run it pretty similarly, in terms of looking to have an algorithm or the lower the share price goes the more gets bought. And we of course balance that as we always do with what's in the M&A pipeline. But as Lucy said, we have an incredibly strong balance sheet right now, so we have great flexibility.

Steven Cahall -- Royal Bank of Canada -- Analyst

Thank you.

Operator

We will move next Dan Kurnos of Benchmark Company.

Daniel Kurnos -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst

Great, thanks. Maybe a little surprised you guys got FOX done so quickly. There was a lot of noise in the market. I don't know if you guys can share how that went, but it sounds like it was maybe smoother than it's been in the past. I don't know if they were asking for day parts or anything else since you guys already reaffirmed your net retrans trends. So any color there would be helpful. And then Chris, just kind of high level, obviously we talked about yesterday to a degree you guys had a lot of big announcements early this year on 3.0. You talked about getting 20 to 30 markets, but how much incremental beyond that are you investing toward monetization? How should we think about timing and timing -- potential timing around monetization, understanding that there's still a long way to go there?

Christopher S. Ripley -- President and Chief Executive Officer

So on FOX, I think maybe there was some noise, but the reality is, we had -- the stations that were renewed, we had effectively negotiated a market rate for only a year prior, or actually even less than a year prior. So they just came up again by virtue of Tribune not closing. So it was a relatively easy renewal, because we were already essentially at market via the previous agreement. So I think it's just sort of people speculating. And as we've always said, we go through this all the time with the networks, and the closer you are to market at the time of renewal, then the easier the discussion. The further away you are, then the harder the discussion. So that's why it got done relatively easily.

And I'm not sure what your comment is on day parts as it relates to the FOX, but nothing changed in terms of our standard deal that we have with them, in terms of what they supply. On 3.0 we had a big CES this year. Saankhya Labs debuted the first mobile chip, which as I mentioned in my comments is a global SKU. We had great meetings with potential OEMs to integrate that shift into a plethora of different products, and so that was very well received. We signed our joint venture with SK Telecom, which will start in earnest this year and start taking technology out of the Korean marketplace and commercializing it here in the U.S. market, which will create the network intelligence which is needed for this industry to operate as one network, as a wireless telecom company would operate. And SK is best-in-class in the world so we're just ecstatic to be officially partnered with them.

And then we also did an MOU with SK and Harman. And if you know anything about Harman, they are basically -- you drive a car, you probably are a Harman customer, and have their speakers and infotainment system in that car. And that's just an MOU at this point. We'll turn that -- we'll do some work and get that into a joint venture, so we can actually get going on an advanced automotive platform with those partners.

So the investment side of all this is not that significant. Of course it does show up in some of our spending this year. But overall, it's not a huge needle mover at this point. Mostly timing effort.

Daniel Kurnos -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst

Thanks.

We will go next to Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.

David Karnovsky -- JP Morgan -- Analyst

Hi, this is David Karnovsky on for Alexia. Just on the Marquee Sports Center, I know, tennis doesn't start till 2020, but can you talk at a high level your financial expectations for the JV and how this will get accounted for at Sinclair? And then, what's sort of the potential to create more partnerships like this with other sports teams?

Christopher S. Ripley -- President and Chief Executive Officer

So it will start in 2020 and on an annualized basis, we expect it to contribute about $40 million to $50 million of free cash flow, and it is a model for other partnerships going forward. That's definitely high on our mind, in terms of how we can create additional value. We love partnering directly with the teams and getting alignment of interest there, and in many regards, we're just -- we are a perfect match for any team who wants to do this, and so we'll certainly be looking for other opportunities and there will be some coming up in the years to come. They tend to come up as the contracts expire with the existing distributors. So it's something we're definitely keeping track of and looking forward to.

David Karnovsky -- JP Morgan -- Analyst

Okay. And then just at a larger and potentially earlier Democratic primary, how are you thinking about what the political contribution in 2019 might be, relative to past odd years? And then for 2020, please walk us through the various deals, President, Senate, etcetera, that gives you confidence this could be your big year for political? Thanks.

Lucy A. Rutishauser -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

I'll take the first one. Let me just give you the 2015 and 2017 -- 2015-2017 pro forma numbers. We did about-- a range of about $26 million to $32 million in both of those years, so we would expect that we should at least hit those numbers this year. Now just remember, because the Primaries don't start until the first quarter of 2020, any of that money is really going to be backloaded primarily into the fourth quarter.

Steven M. Marks -- Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer

I will tell you, we like our chances on the political dollars. All you got to do is take a look at what goes on everyday, and to become -- the best TV show on the planet is watching politics. Every other day there's somebody joining the race. It really bodes well for local broadcasters. It's going to be quite a robust, I believe, fourth quarter in spending. And I think 2020, we're not going to be able to get out of the way of the money. It's going to be literally hand over fist. But hard to put a dollar figure on it, but it's going to be enormous.

Lucy A. Rutishauser -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So let me frame 2020 for you. If you compare our biggest presidential year, which was 2012 pro forma, we did $266 million that year. So we do expect to beat our biggest presidential year. And remember, there's a lot of big national issues that are out there. We've got a lot of people running already for the Democratic side a year in advance of the first Primary. And then remember, we are in all the key swing states in a big way, as well as we're in a lot of the state capitals.

David Smith -- Chairman Of The Board

It also speaks to our investment in our niche products and the 350 awards that Chris mentioned in the beginning of the call. So we're able to capitalize on those investments into our news hours.

David Karnovsky -- JP Morgan -- Analyst

Great. Thank you.

We'll go next to David Joyce at Evercore.

David Joyce -- Evercore Group LLC -- Analyst

If you could just provide some more color on the advanced advertising initiatives, where are you in the industry on the TIP initiative at this point? And are you going to continue working with the other station partners in the 3.0 rollout in those 20 to 30 markets? Is that part of the agreement for the consortium you're with? And are you using some partners for advertising and for testing as well? Thank you.

Christopher S. Ripley -- President and Chief Executive Officer

So on the TIP initiative, we founded that along with Nexstar and Tribune, it's really going great. We've picked up a lot of momentum. Other broadcasters have joined most recently, NBC, U (ph) and Telemundo joined. And also, we launched the first APIs between broadcasters and vendors for log times and several key vendors implemented those APIs. So the real promise here, is to be able to take the friction out of the system. We've been suffering under a structural problem in this industry, where it just -- the labor cost to buy our stations is way too high and TIP is aimed squarely at that. And it has that objective and it also has the objective of making sure that this is an open system, and we don't have to create a gatekeeper that essentially could charge outsized rents on the industry because that could also be an issue.

So we're very pleased with TIP. We're pleased with how it's grown from the start from three broadcasters to most of the industry at this point to the vendor participation and the progress we're making in terms of getting the APIs implemented.

On 3.0 we are -- we have an initial number of markets, as we mentioned 20 to 30, which have -- we have reached out to other broadcasters or rather Spectrum Co has done that to include as many as possible in those markets to transition, because the more the merrier in terms of doing a transition. Those are -- from a cooperation standpoint are pretty much ready to go. There is some delay coming out of the FCC around just getting the documents if you can believe that, to be able to file properly and move this forward. The FCC, I think will have those ready in Q2, which hopefully that will happen and then we can actually hit our target of rolling those markets out in 2019.

We move next to Zack Silver with B. Riley FBR.

Zack Silver -- B.Riley FBR -- Analyst

Okay, great. Thank you for taking the question. First on the Cubs side JV, just what's different about Marquee versus something like, I guess now, Charter, Sportsnet L.A. which had I think similar publicized trouble getting distribution deals done out of the gate? And then related to that, did you say that you guys are going to consolidate the JV?

Christopher S. Ripley -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes. I think it is going to end up being consolidated. The number I gave you before the $40 million to $50 million really is sort of a net benefit to us. But it will end up being consolidated, which will make the financials a little bit more complicated. But I want to just -- to give you folks the net benefit to us. And then in terms of comparing and contrasting to Sportsnet L.A., there's really I think three main points that I would highlight there. One is that, there was a very-very high sub-fee ask associated with Sportsnet L.A. that was essentially needed to make the financing work for the purchase of the Dodgers. So it was sort of a leveraged play. We don't have that situation here. We're not buying a team. We are not -- we don't have a huge ask on the table.

And then also the Cubs fan base is incredibly strong. Chicago, is a Cubs town. When you take a look at where they live right now, which is on a multisport RSN, they comprise well over half of the total ratings of that RSN, even though that RSN has four teams in total. So it just gives you an idea of the strength of the Cubs. And then furthermore, the fan base is not as diffused as it is in L.A. for the Dodgers. L.A. is a little bit more of a transient city. And then last but not least, there was no partner involved in L.A. Sportsnet with good distribution relationships. So that -- those are the three things I would highlight as to why this will be different.

Zack Silver -- B.Riley FBR -- Analyst

Got it. That's really helpful. And then just one follow-up if I could, sports related I guess. The sports betting category, I think some of your stations are in states where that is now legal. Do you guys -- is that baked into your guidance for core being up this year? And when might we see that becoming a more meaningful part of core advertising?

Christopher S. Ripley -- President and Chief Executive Officer

So it's not baked into our guidance at all. We haven't seen significant dollars -- we already do get dollars from casinos and the like, and it's not a huge category for us, but we do expect that categories to start to grow meaningfully. It just -- it hasn't really lined up on our portfolio yet. The estimates for the industry is, this is going to be an additional $1.5 billion to $2 billion category, which is a huge category for us in addition to what we already get from casinos. It is going to be a cave-by-cave or state-by-state, and the industry is not backing up the truck right now on advertising and just sort of slowly waiting their way in, but we do expect it to be a significant category, as this industry develops.

Zack Silver -- B.Riley FBR -- Analyst

Got it. Thank you very much.

Marci Ryvicker -- Wolfe Research LLC -- Analyst

Thank you. I am a very lonely White Sox fan, born and bred.

Christopher S. Ripley -- President and Chief Executive Officer

That's fine. We won't hold anything against you, Marci.

Marci Ryvicker -- Wolfe Research LLC -- Analyst

Thank you. So I just want to confirm the FOX deal. That includes the incremental NFL Thursday night, right? You're not paying a separate fee to them for that?

Christopher S. Ripley -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes, that's all included.

Marci Ryvicker -- Wolfe Research LLC -- Analyst

Okay. And then, it sounds like embedded in your full year free cash flow guide, I know there's a lot of missing pieces that we sort of still need to go up to the revenue line. But from what Steve remarked, it sounds like you expect the core to be up and that's embedded in your guide. Or is the range assuming that it may be down slightly to up slightly?

Lucy A. Rutishauser -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

So in the free cash flow guide for the full year, it assumes that -- in that full range, that the core is up for the year.

Marci Ryvicker -- Wolfe Research LLC -- Analyst

Okay, OK. And then Q4 distribution revenue, it came in I think a little bit lower than your guide. Was that a true-up? Or is there something going on with the subs or can you just give a little bit of color?

Lucy A. Rutishauser -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Marci, there's a few things going on in that number, none of which by themselves are significant in any way. But we had -- there was one MVPD that had promotional discounts roll-off, and that caused their subs to decline, which then in turn causes everybody's subs to decline. There was another MVPD of that had multiple blackouts with other companies and again, as they lost subs, everybody loses them. And so then what happens is, because there is a lag on the reporting of all the sub numbers from these MVPDs, we haven't quite seen where those sub losses -- where they've migrated to and landed. We expect that we will have more intel, as the fourth quarter reports start coming in.

Marci Ryvicker -- Wolfe Research LLC -- Analyst

Got it. And then can you remind us what percent of revenue and EBITDA may be attributable to your SLAs?

Lucy A. Rutishauser -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

So we have -- that information is all disclosed in the 10-K, the various financial points of the income statement. And we'll have the 10-K out March 1st.

Kyle Evans -- Stephens -- Analyst

Hi, thanks. A little follow-up on the distribution from 4Q. Could you give sub count for the quarter, 2018, and kind of what's built into your assumption for the guide?

Lucy A. Rutishauser -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

So the sub count, I'll give you off-line. I don't have that here in front of me. But I think what you're trying to get to is really, what did we see in sub count change. So for the year, we saw sub counts decline low single-digit and a lot of that was due to the fourth quarter for the reasons that I just talked about, with the couple of the MVPDs, with the blackouts that they had, with others and promotional discounts roll-offs.

Kyle Evans -- Stephens -- Analyst

Okay. Will do that offline. On the 2012-2016 numbers that you were talking about for political, how much did presidential ad spend account for as a percent of total in 2012 and 2016?

Lucy A. Rutishauser -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

That one, we're going to probably have to take offline. That one I don't have it here with me. But we do have it though.

Kyle Evans -- Stephens -- Analyst

Okay. And then lastly, and I know you probably won't answer this one, but I was wondering if you guys would care to put some size brackets or growth brackets around the Compulse product? Thank you.

Christopher S. Ripley -- President and Chief Executive Officer

We're not going to disclose specifics around products. But it has been our fastest-growing digital vertical. So we are -- the targeted advertising space that will be a core part of ATSC 3.0 and STIRR and a number of our other digital initiatives is proving to be a quite robust market at very high CPM. So I think is the punchline for us. But we're not -- for competitive reasons, not going to disclose the specific number.

Kyle Evans -- Stephens -- Analyst

Okay. Thank you.

We'll go next to Clay Griffin at Deutsche Bank.

Clay Griffin -- Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc -- Analyst

Hey guys, good morning. Just a quick one. I just noticed the $140 million of repack CapEx for the year. I'm just curious though, your total CapEx guide, what is -- is there an amount above and beyond the $140 million that's embedded in your full year, that's related to ATSC 3.0? And I guess the question being, as you look out after this transition, what does the outlook look like in terms of capital intensity for the core broadcast business? Thanks.

Lucy A. Rutishauser -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So embedded in the non-repack CapEx for 2019, there's about $10 million to $15 million related to the deployment of 3.0 in the 20 to 30 markets that we spoke about. And as I think about 2020 CapEx guide for the full year, non-repack, I think if you're in that sort of $100 million to $110 million range for non-repack CapEx, that should capture all the various items that we're doing.

Clay Griffin -- Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc -- Analyst

Okay, great. And then just, In terms of the $115 million in expenses related to revenue-generating initiatives, do you have a comparable number for full year 2018, or is that all incremental?

Lucy A. Rutishauser -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Can you repeat that one again?

Clay Griffin -- Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc -- Analyst

Right. The $115 million of full year media expense related to revenue-generating initiatives, do you have a comparable figure for full year 2018, just so we can see the growth in kind of those initiatives?

Lucy A. Rutishauser -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yes. But just give me a minute. I don't know if you have another question that you want to move on to.

Clay Griffin -- Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc -- Analyst

It's OK. We can take it offline.

Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple for me; on the RSNs, I'm not sure what you can say on this, but I know you've talked about potentially using a partner, a financial partner in bidding for those channels. What would you say the probability of that is today versus using your own balance sheet?

Christopher S. Ripley -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Look, I think for lots of different reasons, I'm not going to handicap that for you. But it is certainly a possibility and part of active discussions.

Davis Hebert -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Okay. And then secondly, I apologize if I missed it. But Lucy, do you have any sort of guidelines of year end net leverage, knowing that M&A could obviously impact that? But just curious if you had any number there?

Lucy A. Rutishauser -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

So net leverage, we would expect to be a little bit lower than where we ended 2018. So it's still with a three handle on it. But a little bit lower.

Davis Hebert -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

And that's net leverage, correct? On a LAQ (ph) basis?

Lucy A. Rutishauser -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

That's on an eight quarter basis.

The United States, Chin…","NEW DELHI/SRINAGAR: United States President Donald Trump said on Thursday (Feb 28) there would be some ""reasonably decent news"" on the ongoing conflict between India and Pakistan, a day after the two nuclear powers both downed enemy jets and Pakistan captured an Indian pilot.

The pilot, identified by Islamabad as Wing Commander Abhi Nandan, became the human face of the latest flare-up following the release of videos showing him being captured and later held in custody.

""We are willing to return the captured Indian pilot if it leads to de-escalation,"" Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi told Geo TV.

Qureshi also said the Saudi foreign minister was expected to visit Pakistan with a special message from Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, who visited both Pakistan and India earlier this month.



Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan has already called for talks with India to prevent the risk of a ""miscalculation"" between their nuclear-armed militaries.

The Pakistani foreign minister's remarks came shortly after Trump said he expected ""reasonably decent news"" regarding the conflict between India and Pakistan.

The US, China and other world powers have urged restraint from the two nations as tensions escalate following tit-for-tat airstrikes in the wake of a suicide car bombing that killed at least 40 Indian paramilitary police in Indian-controlled Kashmir on Feb 14.

Indian and Pakistani troops traded fire along the contested border in Kashmir on Thursday, but speaking at a press conference, Trump said the US had been mediating between the two sides.

""They have been going at it and we have been involved in trying to have them stop,"" Trump said in Hanoi, where he was attending a summit with North Korea's leader.

""We have been in the middle trying to help them both out.""

Earlier on Thursday, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who faces a general election in a matter of months, told a rally of supporters that India would unite against its enemies.

""The world is observing our collective will. It is necessary that we shouldn't do anything that allows our enemy to raise a finger at us,"" he said, in his first remarks since the downing of planes on Wednesday.

FIRING CONTINUES

Pakistan and India have fought three wars since independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two over Kashmir, and went to the brink of a fourth in 2002 after a Pakistani militant attack on India's parliament.

Pakistan has shut its airspace, forcing commercial airlines to reroute. Thai Airways International announced on Thursday that it had cancelled flights to Pakistan and Europe, which left thousands of passengers stranded in Bangkok.

As Trump was speaking, India said that Pakistan had fired mortars into Indian-occuptied territory at around 1pm (0730 GMT).

Troops from India and Pakistan also exchanged fire for over an hour in the Poonch district at 6 a.m., according to a statement from the Indian army.

""The Indian army retaliated strongly and effectively,"" said Lieutenant Colonel Devender Anand, a defence ministry spokesman.

The firing was significantly less elevated than the artillery fire exchanged by the two sides on Wednesday.

Pakistan said the firing began overnight.

""The firing continued in intervals throughout the night. It was moderate,"" said Shaukat Yusufzai, an administration official in the Pakistan-controlled part of Poonch.

One man was hospitalised after being hit by shrapnel, he added.

India is building more than 14,000 bunkers for families in Jammu and Kashmir state living close to the border, hoping to keep them safe near their homes rather than evacuate them.

On Wednesday evening India's foreign ministry handed a dossier to Pakistan that it claimed detailed camps of the Paskistan-based militant group that carried out the Feb 14 attack.

With a general election due in India by May, an upsurge in nationalism from any conflict with Pakistan could become a key factor, potentially favoring Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

Late on Wednesday B S Yeddyurappa, a BJP leader in the southern state of Karnataka, said India's strike inside Pakistani territory would help the party to win back power in the state - the first such comment from a member of the ruling party.

""This has brought a pro-Modi wave all through the country,"" he told reporters. ""The effect of this will be seen in the elections.""



INTERNATIONAL CONCERN

The latest escalation marks a sudden deterioration in relations between the two countries. As recently as November, Pakistan's leader Khan spoke of ""mending ties"" with India.

The White House urged ""both sides to take immediate steps to de-escalate the situation.""

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement he had spoken separately with the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan and urged them to ""prioritise direct communication and avoid further military activity"".

Pakistan's envoy to the United States, Asad Majeed Khan, said Islamabad would like to see the Trump administration play a more active role in easing the crisis.

At the same time, he said the lack of U.S. condemnation of India's strike on Pakistan was ""construed and understood as an endorsement of the Indian position, and that is what emboldened them even more”.

China, the European Union and other countries also called for restraint. Japan's foreign minister said on Thursday the country was concerned about the ""deteriorating situation"".

The Chinese government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, spoke by telephone with Qureshi and expressed ""deep concern"", China's foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday.

The United States, Britain and France proposed the United Nations Security Council blacklist Masood Azhar, the head of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad, the group that claimed responsibility for the Feb. 14 attack. China is likely to be oppose the move.



FLIGHTS CANCELLED

Thai Airways said it had cancelled more than a dozen flights to Europe due to Pakistan's move, along with all flights to and from the country.

Several airlines including Emirates and Qatar Airways, suspended flights to Pakistan on Wednesday, while others such as Singapore Airlines and British Airways were forced to reroute flights.



Singapore Airlines said on Thursday all of its Europe-bound flights would continue as planned, avoiding the affected airspace as necessary.

Pakistan and India have fought three wars since independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two over Kashmir, and went to the brink of a fourth in 2002 after a Pakistani militant attack on India’s parliament.

Pakistan has shut its airspace, forcing commercial airlines to reroute. Thai Airways International announced on Thursday that it had cancelled flights to Pakistan and Europe, which left thousands of passengers stranded in Bangkok. As Trump was speaking, India said that Pakistan had fired mortars into Indian-occupied territory at around 1 pm.

Troops from India and Pakistan also exchanged fire for over an hour in the Poonch district at 6 am, according to a statement from the Indian army. “The Indian army retaliated strongly and effectively,” said Lieutenant Colonel Devender Anand, a defence ministry spokesman.

The firing was significantly less elevated than the artillery fire exchanged by the two sides on Wednesday. Pakistan said the firing began overnight. “The firing continued in intervals throughout the night. It was moderate,” said Shaukat Yusufzai, an administration official in the Pakistan-controlled part of Poonch.

One man was hospitalised after being hit by shrapnel, he added.

India is building more than 14,000 bunkers for families in Jammu and Kashmir state living close to the border, hoping to keep them safe near their homes rather than evacuate them.

On Wednesday evening India’s foreign ministry handed a dossier to Pakistan that it claimed detailed camps of the Pakistan-based militant group that carried out the 14 February attack.

With a general election due in India by May, an upsurge in nationalism from any conflict with Pakistan could become a key factor, potentially favouring Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

Late on Wednesday, Karnataka BJP chief BS Yeddyurappa, said India’s strike inside Pakistani territory would help the party to win back power in the state — the first such comment from a member of the ruling party. “This has brought a pro-Modi wave all through the country,” he told reporters. “The effect of this will be seen in the elections.”

International concern

The latest escalation marks a sudden deterioration in relations between the two countries. As recently as November, Pakistan’s leader Khan spoke of “mending ties” with India.

The White House urged “both sides to take immediate steps to de-escalate the situation.” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement he had spoken separately with the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan and urged them to “prioritise direct communication and avoid further military activity”.

Pakistan’s envoy to the United States, Asad Majeed Khan, said Islamabad would like to see the Trump administration play a more active role in easing the crisis. At the same time, he said the lack of US condemnation of India’s strike on Pakistan was “construed and understood as an endorsement of the Indian position, and that is what emboldened them even more”.

China, the European Union and other countries also called for restraint. Japan’s foreign minister said on Thursday the country was concerned about the “deteriorating situation”.

The Chinese government’s top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, spoke by telephone with Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and expressed “deep concern”, China’s foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday.

The United States, Britain and France proposed the United Nations Security Council blacklist Masood Azhar, the head of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad, the group that claimed responsibility for the 14 February attack. China is likely to oppose the move.

Flights cancelled

Thai Airways said it had cancelled more than a dozen flights to Europe due to Pakistan’s move, along with all flights to and from the country. Several airlines including Emirates and Qatar Airways, suspended flights to Pakistan on Wednesday, while others such as Singapore Airlines and British Airways were forced to reroute flights.

Singapore Airlines said on Thursday all of its Europe-bound flights would continue as planned, avoiding the affected airspace as necessary.

Flights from West Asia and India were also affected. Air Canada said on Wednesday it has temporarily suspended service to India.

The post H1B spouses’ H4 work permits are being walked off the cli…,"New York: The Donald Trump government’s process of slow-walking H1B spouses' H4 visa work permit off the cliff is on its last mile and anxiety is peaking across the community of H1B spouses in the United States. The proposed rule to do away with H4 work permits (which came into effect in Barack Obama's second term) was sent to the Trump administration’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review last week. Headlines like ""Game over for H4EAD"" are floating around as families are torn between decisions about work and life in the US and the endless skewering.

""The squeeze is real and it's very effective from the administration's point of view. H1B extensions are getting very hard. Our families are getting hit. Spouses are upset that they may be denied working rights and to top to all, recruiters are going cold when they hear the word H1B. It's coming at us from all sides and frankly, we can't take it any more"", an ex-H1B worker who has moved to Canada barely a month ago, told Firstpost, in a phone conversation.

The H4 EAD is a work permit for spouses of H1B workers who have been approved for green cards and are yet to get those in hand. The Trump administration first announced its intent to scrap the H4 EAD in early 2017. The pushback against these work permits predates the Trump era and takes the form of a lawsuit launched against the program within days of its announcement by the Barack Obama government in 2015.

Charts extrapolating how quickly or slowly the H4 revocation could happen speak to the many pressures working on legal immigrant spouses over a prolonged period of many years now of which the last 2 years have been the most fraught.

""Let’s do everything collectively in our power to prevent the revocation of H-4 EAD"", says Cyrus Mehta, a high name recognition immigration attorney based in New York.

In government filings, the proposed changes are listed as “economically significant” and with “international impact”. At least 45% of all pending rule changes are in the “proposed rule” stage. You can see the high level overview here. If OMB moves at top speed and wraps up comments period within 30 days, we are looking at Spring 2019 when the comments review may begin. On the same sliding scale, a slower pace could push it all out by a few months. Either way, a constant gnawing remains for H1B families.

Once OMB reviews the proposed rule, it will be published in the Federal Register and opened for comments - the typical rubric for rule changes. Those who are following this can check for DHS pending rules and look for 1615-AC15. The same link also summarises the 'official' DHS lens on the issue.

Framed against the backdrop of the wider political scene in the country, the brief history of the H4 EAD in the Trump era fits neatly within the US president’s all-base, all-the-time strategy. But, like anything else, the White House’s chief occupant is the final wild card in this game and could always (in theory) step off the gas at any time. The motivations to soften the blow could come from multiple flanks and are emergent in nature, not all of which are overt at this moment.

At this time, the biggest of the #MAGA themed decisions - Trump's emergency declaration - is also on thin ice. Nearly two dozen former Republican members of Congress are urging GOP lawmakers to reject President Donald Trump’s national emergency declaration to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Whichever way that goes, it's an anthem for shifting sands and chaos well into the 2020 campaign season and all the way till the November 2020 elections.

Anirban Das, who came to the US on an F1 student visa to study for an Engineering Master's degree and has been a leading advocate for skilled immigrants here, explains how the numbers stack up, in a tweet: “As per USCIS stats, 100k #H4EAD are issued, out of which 30k were renewals. Which means only 70K are original applicants. USCIS has no idea how many are ACTUALLY working. US labor force is approx. 155 million. And they want to pull out 70k people from the workforce?”

This is how DHS explains the upside for citizens: “DHS anticipates that there would be two primary impacts that DHS can estimate and quantify: the cost-savings accruing to forgone future filings by certain H-4 dependent spouses, and labor turnover costs that employers of H-4 workers could incur when their employees’ EADs are terminated. Some U.S. workers would benefit from this proposed rule by having a better chance at obtaining jobs that some of the population of the H-4 workers currently hold, as the proposed rule would no longer allow H-4 workers to enter the labor market early.”

Das, quoted above, refutes that idea as a “lump of labor” theory. ""USCIS claims #H4EAD takes away American jobs. If an #H4EAD takes a job, it means a corresponding job loss for a citizen. This is ""lump of labor"" fallacy. No. of jobs in US economy are not set in stone. Studies show when more people join workforce, more jobs are created"".

Prominent US politicians have been at the forefront of the pushback; now even more so. Kamala Harris, the Indian American running for 2020 has called the effort “outrageous”. She tweeted that it “will force immigrant women who are doctors, nurses, scientists & academics, among others, to abandon their professional careers. I called on DHS last year to withdraw this proposal & will continue to fight this.”

Officials are silent on the fine print. What wasn’t clear earlier remains that way. We don’t know whether the proposed rule change will have retrospective effect or not. If say, an H1B spouse has an H4 EAD that is stamped till 2021 and the rule changes this year, does it mean the H4EAD holder must stop work for pay immediately? The lion’s share of H4 EADs are held by Indians, mostly women. A small percentage of H4 visa holders are men.

The closest we have come to an official/ bureaucratic view on this are USCIS chief Francis Cissna's quotes to Bloomberg Law. Cissna said there are “very good reasons why you might want to have H-1B spouses be able to work,” and that many of those spouses are “very highly skilled.” “If the spouse can’t work, that might prevent that person from wanting to come over or stay,” but that’s something Congress should fix, he told reporter Laura D Francis.

“The reason why we’re proposing rescinding it is not because we don’t desire these people to have employment authorization...It’s because, amongst other reasons, it doesn’t appear to have been the intent of Congress to grant them work authorization,” Cissna said, in the same Bloomberg interview.

The replies on this Twitter thread below give us a good sense of how many directions the H4 or even the H1B debate can take when it goes beyond the legal framework and instead becomes a flashpoint between a dominant group and a new subculture that gains currency in an economy, like the H1B has come to be understood over three decades of its presence in the US.

76,Empty,2019-02-26T12:00:52Z,"Jared Kushner reveals vague details of his administration's perennially approaching peace plan, which political rivals use as an opportunity for infighting","1. Not-so friendly fire: US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law/senior adviser Jared Kusher has revealed details of his country’s perennially approaching peace plan, though Israel’s top two dailies focus more on the right-wing infighting the vague outline has caused.

New Right co-chair Naftali Bennett — whose party is polling just above the electoral threshold — picks a fight with the big tuna, Likud, saying Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s party will cave to pressure from the Americans and invite the “disastrous” reality of a Palestinian state

Bennett goes full-on alarmist in an interview with Israel Radio, asserting that only the New Right will be able to prevent “the deaths of thousands of Israelis,” which he suggested would be the result of Trump’s “Deal of the Century.” He was comparing the current peace proposal to the Oslo Accords of the mid-90s which were followed by the deadly Second Intifada.

While the Likud party does indeed respond to its right-wing rival, it focuses less on its anti-Palestinian state credentials and more on chastising Bennett for friendly fire within the right-wing camp after he had promised to play nice:

“When Bennett and Shaked established the New Right they said they were doing it in order to pull votes from Lapid and Gantz to enlarge the right-wing bloc, and that they wouldn’t subject us to friendly fire. Now they are making false charges against Likud with the goal of pulling votes from Likud, which will bring about the rise of the left-wing government of Lapid and Gantz, whose party will be bigger than Likud.”

2. State-minus? As for the peace plan itself, Kushner tells Sky News Arabic that it will offer “realistic solutions for the issues of 2019” and will require a unified Palestinian leadership in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.

While the PA has been barely talking to Hamas as of late, let alone the White House, Kushner likely was able to unify rival Palestinian factions over his failure to mention a sovereign Palestinian state in the Sky New interview.

Analysis on the plan is limited but Yedioth’s Sever Plotzker makes clear that he’s not buying any of it, calling the initiative “another doomed statement by an American president who can’t control his mouth.”

Plotzker points to previous Trump initiatives that were introduced with gusto, but have since not gone exactly as planned: the cancellation of trade deals with Canada and the EU, the quick and complete pullout of US forces from Syria, and the “big, beautiful” Mexico border wall.

He argues that Kushner’s belief in “economic peace” places him squarely in a camp with Netanyahu and a minority of late former prime ministers (he cites Shamir and Meir) who argue that Israel can still thrive despite its military control over the Palestinians.

3. Skin in the game: Hebrew media basks in the glory of Sunday night’s Oscar win for Israeli filmmaker Guy Nattiv and his short film “Skin,” which was awarded after papers already had gone to press the day prior.

Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up

Israel Hayom quotes President Reuven Rivlin characterizing the victory as “a gift for our children.”

Nattiv tells the Hebrew daily, “My grandparents were Holocaust survivors and this film is Israeli every way; it educates against racism.” To be clear, the 20-minute movie, about a gang war that breaks out in a small town after a black man smiles at a white child, was shot in the US.

Reviewing “Skin,” Yedioth’s Benjamin Tobias says, “It flows, it ignites, it leaves you with a pit in your stomach, but it mainly shows what talented people have grown out of the Israeli film industry in the last twenty years — the same industry that so many people in Israel insist on correcting or canceling.”

Yedioth points out that Nattiv is just the second Israeli filmmaker to win an Oscar. He shares the rare honor with Moshe Mizrachi, who won an Oscar in 1977 for his movie “Madame Rosa.”

4. Don’t let the door hit you on your way out: Most of the Israeli press does not seem interested in shedding a tear in its reporting of Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif’s abrupt resignation.

Yedioth refers to Zarif as “the smiles diplomat” and says he will now be able to return to Tehran University where he can teach international relations courses based on all that he learned during his time in the US.

“Zarif is gone. Good riddance,” Netanyahu tweets of the lead negotiator of Iran’s landmark 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers that he had bitterly opposed. “As long as I am here, Iran will never acquire nuclear weapons,”

But Haaretz’s Tzvi Barel calls the resignation a “gift” to hardliners in Iran, with whom Zarif sparred more often than not in his push for the nuclear deal.

Barel says Zarif was the first domino to fall as a result of Iranian frustration with the country’s spiraling economy following the renewal of American sanctions. Whether the resignation will stop the bleeding of President Hassan Rouhani’s administration remains to be seen, but Barel predicts Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei will use the opportunity to appoint someone of his own choosing, ensuring greater influence in foreign policy matters moving forward.

5. He loves you, he loves you not: The brouhaha surrounding the entry of the long-tabooed party of Kahanists into the political arena appears to show no signs of letting up, with New Right co-leader Naftali Bennett telling Israel Radio that the Otzma Yehudit party is beyond the pale.

“I do not accept their positions at all. People who see (Jewish supremacist Meir) Kahane as a model are not fit to sit in the Knesset.”

But Bezalel Smotrich, whose Jewish Home party merged with Otzma Yehudit at the prime minister’s behest, is having none of Bennett’s criticism and tweets an article from earlier this month in which the New Right leader called the far-right alliance “essential.”

When Bennett and Shaked left the Jewish Home, they argued that their new party would allow the right-wing bloc to expand, with them attracting more secular voters, leaving the national religious party more free to go after the hardline Orthodox Israelis supportive of Otzma Yehudit.

6. Enemies at both gates: Haaretz leads its front page with a report quoting senior Palestinian officials in the West Bank and Gaza who warn that a confrontation with the Jewish state will ensue if the Israeli government does not take steps to ease pressure on the Palestinian leadership.

Senior Palestinian officials tell Haaretz’s Jacki Khoury that Israeli cuts in PA tax revenues in an effort to cease Ramallah’s payments to the families of security prisoners are turning the West Bank into a pressure cooker.

“Nobody knows when the camel’s back will break but all the elements required for an explosion already exist, and (the Israelis) are constantly adding oil to the fire,” Kadura Fares says.

A Hamas official tells Khoury that while the terror group is not interested in a confrontation with Israel at the moment — an evergreen line recycled by both Israelis and Palestinians — an Israeli strike on Gaza could lead to a dangerous renewal of violence

7. Before, during and after: New allegations are made against alleged sexual predator Malka Leifer. The 51-year-old has made headlines as she faces extradition to Australia, where she is charged with 74 counts of sexual abuse. Earlier this year, a man in the Emmanuel settlement, where she lived after fleeing from Melbourne, accused Leifer of trying to molest his daughter. Now, two woman have come forward saying the former principal made inappropriate advances to them when she taught at Bnei Brak before moving to Australia.

“She would take me for private conversation, one on one… down in the bomb shelter. We would sit there and she would stroke my leg,” the woman, who declined to disclose her identity, tells the Kan public broadcaster.

ToI confirms that there is a second former student of Leifer’s from her time in Bnei Brak who has accused the former principal of having made inappropriate sexual advances to her nearly two decades ago.

A former education official in Bnei Brak said she believed that rather than reporting her, community leaders sent Leifer to Australia after they learned of her transgressions.

8. So long, we hardly knew you?: The Central Elections Committee informs Labor’s shiny new ex-general Tal Russo that he may not be eligible to run, given a recent position he took on in the IDF reserves after his active duty was finished, which calls into question whether he completed his legally required post-army “cooling off” period before entering politics.",Give peace a chance? 8 things to know for February 26,Timesofisrael.com,https://www.timesofisrael.com/give-peace-a-chance-8-things-to-know-for-february-26/

It is fantastic to contemplate such a thing in the United States, which is fundamentally prouder of nothing than of its Constitution and the immense place that the system created by that Constitution and maintained these 230 years by recourse to interpretation and reassertion of it has played in the unprecedented rise of America from a loosely connected group of colonists numbering only a few million at independence to the overwhelming preeminence of the U.S.A. at the end of the Second World War. That preeminence has been substantially maintained since.

For at least 60 years I have heard high American officials announce that the United Sates is not a “banana republic.” Of course it is not, and never was. But there is a complacency about America’s status as a society of laws that is both unbecoming and unjustified. As many judges, lawyers, and commentators have noted, the level of prosecution success in criminal cases is over 95 percent, 97 percent of those without a trial; these, and the proportion of the population that is incarcerated, are totalitarian numbers. Congressional investigations where there is no lawyer–client privilege, the ease of alleging and gaining convictions on charges of dishonest responses to the police, as well as media trials long before a defense has even been filed (as in the Jussie Smollett case, where the chief of police of Chicago has been garrulously babbling out the prosecution evidence); all of this is a Star Chamber. None of it would be admissible in any other serious common-law country, such as Great Britain, Canada, Australia, or Ireland.

Every nomination to the Supreme Court is now a pitched battle replete with paid demonstrators at hearings and extensive campaigns of character assassination, but that court has sat inert as practically all the Bill of Rights’ constitutional assurances of due process, prompt and impartial justice, and the avoidance of capricious prosecutions have been abandoned. It is in this, as other civilized jurisdictions would consider it, tenuous state of the rule of law that the antics of the Comey-McCabe FBI and Brennan-Clapper intelligence direction, and their partisan effort to bend the law to install Hillary Clinton as president and sandbag Donald Trump, should be considered.

Celebrated as Thomas Jefferson rightly is for his seminal role in the creation of the country’s initial texts and its early governance, one achievement for which he has received insufficient credit is the founding of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1802. While this began as a corps of engineers limited to 20 men at first (led by Benjamin Franklin’s nephew, Jonathan Williams), the objective was to assure a non-political class of officers. The focus on engineering was, at this early stage, the young nation’s chief military requirement.

Jefferson’s initiative assured the United States of a nonpolitical military. The country has had twelve presidents who were celebrated combat military officers, from Washington to Eisenhower, including citizen generals such as Jackson, Hayes, and Garfield. And it has had a number of presidents who were distinguished middle or junior officers, including Presidents Truman, Kennedy, Nixon, Ford, Carter, and George H. W. Bush, and six high-ranking military officers who were unsuccessful presidential candidates, including the first Republican candidate, Colonel John C. Frémont; a general fired by Abraham Lincoln as commander of the Army of the Potomac, George B. McClellan, who had the effrontery to run against Lincoln in 1864; and a hero POW, John McCain.

The point of this recitation is that none of these people dabbled in politics while they were in the armed forces. The only serious figure who did so was General Douglas MacArthur, who, in response to a freshet of Republican-delegate enthusiasm from a midwestern state while he was preparing to liberate the Philippines, wrote to a supporter for public circulation a letter stating that he would accept the Republican nomination in 1944, but would be unable to campaign (as if his commander-in-chief, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, would tolerate such a thing from a serving theater commander). When General Dwight D. Eisenhower was nominated as the Republican candidate for president in 1952, and was asked when he became Republican, he replied: “Today.” No soldier has led Great Britain since Oliver Cromwell in the 17th century, except the Duke of Wellington, for two years.",G-Men Out of Control,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/g-men-control-160222663.html

The citizens of Caracas face unpleasant choices.

What’s Next for Venezuela?

Scenes of destruction and despair were on full display worldwide over the weekend as the Maduro regime used force to deny entry into Venezuela of desperately needed humanitarian assistance, leading to increasing speculation about what comes next. Or, rather, will the United States invade Venezuela to topple the despotic regime that has ruined Latin America’s once-wealthiest economy and created Latin America’s worst humanitarian crisis in many years.

The threat of invasion has increasingly been implied, with senior U.S. administration officials suggesting routinely that “all options are on the table.” Indeed, they are, as they always are in the conduct of foreign affairs. But the implication is clearly that if Maduro and his inner circle refuse to depart, then the use of force may be employed.

Maduro plainly needs to go. His mandate as president expired on January 10, 2019, at which point he re-inaugurated himself based on the results of a clearly fraudulent election in May 2018. According to Venezuela’s constitution—a document instituted under Hugo Chavez, the founder of the so-called Bolivarian Revolution and Maduro’s political godfather—in the absence of a president the head of the National Assembly becomes the interim president and is then obligated to call for new elections. Under this scenario, Juan Guaido, the newly-installed, thirty-five-year-old head of the National Assembly, became the constitutional leader of Venezuela. The United States, the Lima Group of Latin American nations and Canada, European nations, Japan, and numerous others have now recognized Guaido as the legitimate, albeit interim, leader of Venezuela.

Over the past six years of Maduro’s misrule, Venezuela has become a humanitarian disaster. Fully 10 percent of the population has fled due to lack of food and healthcare, hyperinflation, and out of control crime. National oil company PDVSA, the life-blood of the economy, has been politicized and corrupted, and production is falling rapidly. The educational system has been fully coopted by Chavismo, and every institution of the state except the National Assembly has been bent to the will of the executive. Venezuela’s sovereignty has been sold cheaply to Cuba, which has thoroughly infiltrated the security services and state functions, and sweetheart deals have been cut to provide Venezuela’s national patrimony—oil—to China, Russia, and others in exchange for short term financing and support. In short, Chavismo has mortgaged Venezuela’s future. Interim president Guiado himself has obliquely called for an armed international response.

As bad as the situation continues to get in Venezuela, however, an armed response is unlikely. First of all, there is no casus belli that would justify a U.S.-led invasion. Nor is there a mandate from the United Nations or OAS. The doctrine of Responsibility to Protect is not sufficiently developed or accepted at this point, and circumstances do not yet justify its application to Venezuela in any event. Latin American nations, including those that support strong actions against Maduro, have publicly indicated little support for armed intervention, and, despite the rhetoric, there does not appear to be much enthusiasm in Washington for such a step.

In particular, while the U.S. military would be able to decapitate the Maduro regime and install Guaido in the Miraflores Palace without significant exertion, the aftermath of such action would be messy. Venezuela is a large country, much of it rural or jungled, and numerous non-state actors occupy large portions of the nation, from regime-sponsored goon squads, to FARC and ELN guerrillas seeking safe haven from Colombia, to illegal goldminers and wildcatters, to drug traffickers and common criminals and highwaymen. Invasion would be relatively easy; pacification could be complicated. Of course, with invasion would also come the responsibility to lead recovery efforts and shoulder the blame if such efforts did not lead to desired results. Within the context of administration efforts to deal with China and North Korea and Iran, pass the trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, address domestic issues including the economy, border enforcement, and the activities of the Special Counsel, an invasion of Venezuela is not necessarily high on the priorities list.",What’s Next for Venezuela?,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/next-venezuela-144400468.html

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

Feb. 28, 2019, 7:54 PM GMT By Ken Dilanian

WASHINGTON — The Iranian-backed hackers who stole personal data on Australian lawmakers earlier this year are the same group that attacked the British Parliament in 2017, according to new research by a cybersecurity firm that sheds light on Iran's campaign of cyberespionage against its adversaries.

A report by Los Angeles-based Resecurity, obtained exclusively by NBC News, says the Feb. 8 hack of the Australian Parliament ""is a part of a multi-year cyberespionage campaign"" by an Iranian-backed hacking group they call Iridium.

""This actor targets sensitive government, diplomatic and military resources"" in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K. and the U.S., the firm says.

Australia has not formally attributed the attack to Iran, but the Iran connection was first reported this month by The Wall Street Journal.

The BBC attributed the 2017 British parliament attack to Iran, but Resecurity for the first time connected the two events, said Charles Yoo, Resecurity's president.

Using brute force attacks that guessed passwords, the hackers obtained thousands of records from both parliaments containing names, email addresses, birthdates and other information on lawmakers and their staff.

""We don't believe they are really trying to influence elections but we know that they are collecting so-called strategic intelligence,"" Yoo said.

Resecurity obtained some of the data stolen in the hacks and showed it to NBC News.

In the 2017 U.K. attack, the email accounts of 90 Parliament members were compromised.

The same Iranian-backed group compromised a database belonging to the Liberal Democratic Party of London, Resecurity says.

U.S. officials say Iranian cyber-spying is a growing concern. Earlier this month, federal prosecutors charged former U.S. counterintelligence agent Monica Elfriede Witt with espionage on behalf of Iran. They also charged four Iranians — Behzad Mesri, Mojtaba Masoumpour, Hossein Parva, and Mohamad Paryar — with allegedly using information she had provided to help them target her former colleagues and conduct other cyberespionage. Witt is believed to be in Iran.

Mesri had previously been charged in 2017 with hacking HBO's computer network, stealing unaired episodes of hit shows and demanding millions in Bitcoin as ransom.","Iran-backed hackers hit both UK, Australian parliaments, says report",NBC News,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/iran-backed-hackers-hit-both-uk-australian-parliaments-says-report-n977651

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin on Wednesday said that U.S. territory was constantly being used to launch cyber attacks against Russia, but said it was unable to confirm a U.S. media report that the U.S. military had disrupted the internet access of a Russian troll farm.

The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that the U.S. military had disrupted the internet access of a Russian troll farm accused of trying to influence American voters on Nov. 6, 2018, the day of the congressional elections.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters he did not know how much truth there was to that media report.

""But in general I can say that U.S. territory is constantly being used to organize a huge number of cyber attacks against various Russian organizations. That's the reality with which we live.""

Recent reports from Microsoft revealed that the attackers are focusing specifically on electoral integrity, public policy and democracy groups.

AccountGuard cybersecurity service will enter 12 new European markets including Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Lithuania. Estonia, Slovakia, Latvia, Estonia, Spain and Portugal.

As compared to the past, now users are more aware of the domestic and international electoral malfeasance and cyber attacks that are targeting users all over the world.

The tech giant has included around 14 countries from Europe along with the US and Canada in the Defending Democracy Program as of February 20th.

AccountGuard’s main features

The tool offers a handful of important features such as training and briefings on the latest trends, detection of threats across various email addresses and accounts.

Furthermore, large enterprise and government customers can enjoy early access to the latest security features offered by Microsoft. Few of them are enabling two-factor authentication, implementing access controls and installing updates.

AccountGuard has gained huge popularity in a short span of time, following its release last year. It is available to the users in Canada, the U.S., UK, and Ireland. Office 365 users can use it free of cost.

Microsoft also revealed that the service would be available to other European countries in the next few months.

In case you want to be secure while surfing the internet, you will need to get a full-dedicated tool to secure your network. Install now Cyberghost VPN and secure yourself. It protects your PC from attacks while browsing, masks your IP address and blocks all unwanted access.

Attackers made their first move

As we all know, the 2017 French Presidential Elections were reportedly influenced by cyber attacks. Moreover, European leaders are currently fearing that history is about to repeat itself. They might manipulate video and audio recording using ‘deep fake’ techniques.

The content is manipulated in a way that makes someone says something that he/she has never said or done before.

It seems like hackers have already made their first move as they tried to access 104 accounts that belong to users from different democratic institutions. These users are mainly located in France, Belgium, Serbia, Germany, Romania, and Poland.

As a matter of fact, Microsoft is aiming to protect customers and secure their systems by notifying the organizations regarding recent attempts.

The attackers followed the same technique that was used last year during U.S. mid-terms. They spoofed legitimate looking email addresses and created malicious URLs in order to get access to employee credentials and inject malware.

However, it is just a matter of time to see the history repeat itself. Do you see that prediction turning in to reality?

A specter is haunting the Conservative Political Action Conference: the specter of socialism.

At the nation's largest annual gathering of conservatives, speaker after speaker warned that the nation was one election away from a socialist takeover. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow asked conservatives to “put socialism on trial.” Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) pined for a day “when we can celebrate capitalism.”

And Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, sketched out how Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), a member of Democratic Socialists of America, could become the focus of a successful 2020 campaign, if the GOP was smart about it.

“We can't take her for granted,” McDaniel said. “We can't think that the American people understand what socialism is. We have to go out and educate people. We need to talk about Venezuela.”

CPAC, which has evolved from a boisterous showcase for conservative debate into an event largely about supporting the Trump administration, outlined a 2020 strategy in which swing voters were just one or two conversations away from their own MAGA hats. They just needed to hear all the good that the administration was doing, then think about the alternative: the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.

“We serve with some of these new members, and they're not Democrats; they're socialists,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said at a Wednesday “boot camp” for conservative activists. “This election is not going to be about Republican or Democrat. It's going to be about socialism and the free market.”

Fox News personalities talked up the Trump administration’s wins: low unemployment numbers, the move of the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Elected Republicans talked up repealed regulations, the introduction of less-regulated health plans and a foreign policy that they saw as humiliating American enemies.

“Why is the caliphate destroyed? Because Trump let the military do its job,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). “Why is Iran on the run? Because Trump knows a bad deal when he sees one.”

The focus on socialism at CPAC wasn't surprising. A key applause line in Trump's State of the Union address, promising that America would “never be a socialist country,” was spliced into Republican messaging almost instantly.

But for a longtime observer of CPAC, that vow, or warning, was a reflection of a longtime worry. Ten years ago, from the stage of CPAC, South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint called Barack Obama “the world's best salesman of socialism”; Mike Pence, then a congressman from Indiana, accused Democrats of embracing “European-style socialism”; and Rush Limbaugh denounced “this collectivism socialism stuff.”

That was right after the closing weeks of an election that found the Republican ticket condemning Obama's “socialism,” which, they argued, was revealed when he told a voter that he wanted to “spread the wealth around.” By the summer before the 2010 midterms, at least one poll found a majority of voters agreeing with the concept: Barack Obama was a socialist.

Since then, Republicans have won total control of government — and then lost the House. The Democratic Party has moved left on taxes and health care with no obvious electoral harm, while electing more self-identified socialists than any time since the beginning of World War I. As CPAC gathered, Bernie Sanders was polling higher than any other declared candidate for the Democratic nomination.

Had Republicans cried wolf? Jason Pye, a vice president at FreedomWorks, said that accusing Democrats or even liberal Republicans of “socialism” had sometimes been a joke and that it wasn't any longer.

“Socialism in the Democratic Party has grown and grown to the point where this is very real,” Pye said. “Obamacare itself was not a socialist program; it was a government-managed solution that wasn’t really a solution, at the end of the day. But it was a gradual step toward single payer.”

The fate of the Affordable Care Act, still facing lawsuits in federal courts, was barely discussed in CPAC's first two days. The threat posed by Democrats was instead framed as a complete, quasi-fascist erasure of American freedom.

“They want to take your pickup truck. They want to take away your hamburger,” said former White House adviser Sebastian Gorka. “This is what Stalin dreamed about but never achieved.”

Gorka was referring to the Green New Deal — specifically, to a fact sheet released alongside Ocasio-Cortez’s resolution, which suggested that there was no way to ban “farting cows or air travel” in the 10-year frame they were working in. One big thing missing from CPAC was a discussion of how the new democratic socialists actually define their agenda, envisioning a welfare state closer to Canada than to Venezuela. But campaign rhetoric isn’t supposed to be nice.

AD WATCH

Pennsylvania state Senate. There's an April 2 election coming for a Republican-leaning seat near Pittsburgh, in exactly the sort of territory where Democrats made their midterm gains. The party's nominee, Pam Iovino, ran for the congressional nomination that went to Rep. Conor Lamb (D); her current campaign follows the same themes, highlighting her life in the military.

That makes the first negative ad from D. Raja, the Republican nominee, an interesting preview of how 2019 and 2020 could shake out. In “Vision,” Raja is seen talking to workers on shop floors, a contrast with a Democrat who “wants to stop our growth by teaming up with extremists who want billions of dollars in energy taxes.” Images of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) flash on-screen; their link to Iovino isn't explained, nor are the energy taxes, but Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are taking their spots in the Mount Rushmore of attack ads.

2020. In digital ads, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) has begun highlighting a decision that has haunted her for more than a year: her call for Al Franken to leave the Senate over accusations of sexual misconduct. A Facebook ad now in circulation asks readers to “stand up to sexism” and donate to her campaign.

“When I called on Al Franken to resign, I paid a price,” the ad reads, illustrated by a photo of Gillibrand at this year's Women's March. “I made a lot of establishment Democratic donors angry, and they started withholding support and launching sexist attacks. I will tell you: There were eight credible and corroborated allegations against Al Franken, and we all had the same facts. I don’t regret speaking out. My values aren’t for sale and they never will be.”

POLL WATCH

New Hampshire Democratic primary (UNH, 240 likely Democratic voters)



Bernie Sanders — 26%

Joe Biden — 22%

Kamala Harris — 10%

Elizabeth Warren — 7%

Beto O’Rourke — 5%

Amy Klobuchar — 4%

Cory Booker — 3%

Pete Buttigieg — 1%

Tulsi Gabbard — 1%

Mike Bloomberg — 1%

Kirsten Gillibrand — 1%

Sherrod Brown — 1%



This is the rare state pollster that’s been in the field multiple times, enough to find a few trends. The hardest trend to miss: Warren, who has dealt with monthly blowups over her old claim of Native American heritage, is polling at her lowest level ever, with 13 percent of Democrats ruling out voting for her, for now. Booker, too, has polled higher in the past. Support for the theoretical Biden candidacy and the now-real Sanders candidacy have remained steady; support for Kamala Harris has surged.

The x-factor hasn’t changed: We don’t know how voters will interpret “electability” once the entire field is set. By a 10-point margin, voters consider Biden the most electable candidate; just 5 percent say that of Harris and 3 percent say it of Warren.

IN THE STATES

Republicans were shut out in the week's two highest-profile elections, with Democrats in big cities continuing to move left and win. But Republicans also had their best electoral result since the midterms. A quick recap:

New York City. The left and the Working Families Party gained further ground Tuesday when Jumaane Williams, a city councilman who narrowly lost a 2018 race for lieutenant governor, blew away 16 other candidates to become the city's next public advocate.

“Most people thought he was going to damage his career by challenging the state Democratic Party,” said Maurice Mitchell, the leader of the WFP, which has supported Williams in his rise through city politics.

Williams, who won the New York Times endorsement in both his 2018 and 2019 runs, ran an unapologetically left-wing campaign. He called for divesting the city's pension funds from fossil fuels, making it easier to obtain police disciplinary records, and creating more affordable housing; after initially lobbying for Amazon to come to New York, he turned against the state's funding deal and celebrated when the company pulled out.

Chicago. The next mayor of America's third-largest city will be a black woman. Two very different candidates made it through Tuesday's primary: Toni Preckwinkle, a 71-year-old Cook County commissioner who ran her first race in 1983; and Lori Lightfoot, a 56-year-old former federal prosecutor making her first run for office.

Both ran as the candidates who would break from eight years of Rahm Emanuel, whose powerful national profile obscured the vitriol many Democrats felt for him in Chicago. And both swept away candidates who were seen, at one point or another, as stars who were lined up for the job — former White House chief of staff Bill Daley and State Comptroller Susana Mendoza.

Down the ballot, democratic socialists also had a breakthrough night. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, a socialist alderman, easily held off a challenge, and four more socialists either won outright or advanced to the April 2 runoffs, when Lightfoot and Preckwinkle will face off.

Connecticut. Last year's razor-thin victory for Gov. Ned Lamont locked Republicans out of power here, with Democrats expanding their majority in the state legislature. On Tuesday, Republicans reversed some of the damage, flipping a state House seat and a state Senate seat after Lamont had pulled the Democratic incumbents into his administration.

It didn't put Republicans in control of the state, but it was a major reversal for Democrats. Two years ago, still rattled from its 2016 defeats, the party vastly overperformed in a run of special Connecticut elections. On Tuesday, Democratic turnout tumbled in places where the party had struggled before. Republicans flipped the East Haven-based 99th House District, which Democrats had won by just a handful of votes in 2016; they did the same in the 6th Senate District, around New Britain, where the most vote-rich Democratic areas didn't turn out.

Republicans celebrated the results as a breakthrough in a state where Democrats have presided over slow economic growth since 2011. “While Democrats continue to embrace the failed socialist ideal of a government spending its way to prosperity, Republicans [will] continue to flip seats in the deepest of blue states to protect freedom and capitalism,” the Republican State Leadership Committee said in a statement.

2020

Jay Inslee. The governor of Washington is holding a climate change event Friday that is widely expected to be his presidential campaign announcement, coming after he made national staff hires.

Julián Castro. On Tuesday he became the first 2020 candidate to visit Idaho, a relatively early voting state that will hold a primary next year instead of its traditional caucuses.

Sherrod Brown. He's making the final rounds on his Dignity of Work tour, spending Friday and Saturday in South Carolina; he has suggested that any presidential announcement would come in March.

Beto O'Rourke. Per the Dallas Morning News, he is telling supporters that he will not make another run for Senate in 2020 but will make another announcement, probably about the presidential race, in March.

John Delaney. He tapped John Davis, a veteran of former Iowa congressman Bruce Braley's office, to be his national campaign manager.

Eric Swalwell. He's heading to Iowa to campaign for Eric Giddens, the Democratic nominee in a state Senate race; he also told local media that he will leave his safe House seat, which he won by ousting a longtime incumbent Democrat, if he seeks the presidency.

WHAT I'M WATCHING

North Carolina's endless election year. We now know something about when this state will start to fill its two vacant House seats: April 30. That's when voters in the coastal 3rd Congressional District will vote in a primary to replace the late Walter Jones. Pending a meeting of the election board, it may also be when voters in the 9th Congressional District will pick a nominee for the seat left open by ongoing charges of electoral fraud.

Democrats are cautiously optimistic about the 9th District, where disgraced GOP nominee Mark Harris will not run again and 2018 nominee Dan McCready has continued to pile up money since the election board declined to certify the midterm result. McCready, who defeated a left-wing challenger in 2018, has no primary foe; a Republican primary seems inevitable after former governor Pat McCrory passed on the race, Harris endorsed county commissioner Stony Rushing, and six other Republicans made noises about running.

The early jockeying in the 3rd District, which President Trump carried by 24 points, is very different. Jones, who ended his career as an opponent of foreign military intervention and deficit spending, fended off a series of challenges by ambitious Republicans; Phil Law, who made two runs against Jones, is running, and two other also-rans are still looking at the race. Three state legislators are running, as is Michele Nix, a vice chair of the state party. Democrats are most intrigued by retired Marine Col. Richard Bew and former Greenville mayor Allen Thomas, both of whom they think would be able to break through voter stereotypes about the party.

Barnier called for decisions, rather than extra time.","Any delay to the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union ""must serve not to put off the problem but to resolve the problem"" in the British parliament, EU negotiator Michel Barnier said Thursday.

""Today, above all we need decisions, much more than extra time,"" he added.

After a meeting with Barnier in Vienna, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said he would also like to see Brexit resolved before European elections in May. It would ""seem more than absurd"" for a country wanting to leave the bloc to be able to vote for its legislature, he said.

On Wednesday, more than 500 MPs in the 650-seat parliament backed a plan to vote on British Prime Minister's Brexit deal on March 12. If lawmakers reject the deal, the plan foresees another parliamentary vote on whether the UK should leave the EU without a deal or delay it's March 29 exit date.

UK approach

May has been struggling to gain enough support from hard-line pro-Brexit MPs within her Conservative Party and Northern Ireland's DUP party, which props up her government, for the existing withdrawal agreement.

Prime Minister Theresa May speaking in the House of Commons

In recent weeks, her government has tried to convince EU leaders to accept legal guarantees that would make the deal's so-called Irish backstop temporary. Critics fear the backstop could force the UK to follow EU rules indefinitely.

But EU leaders have repeatedly said they would not agree to any legal changes to the existing deal.

Barnier reiterated that position in Vienna, telling reporters that the EU was ""not going to reopen the withdrawal agreement.""

Another one bites the dust

On Thursday, George Eustice, a junior minister in the UK's agriculture ministry, resigned from his post in protest of May's three-step plan.

The decision to offer parliament the power to delay Brexit would ""lead to a sequence of events culminating in the EU dictating the terms of any extension requested and the final humiliation of our country,"" he said.

This septic isle It never rains A delay by UK Prime Minister Theresa May to allow Parliament to vote on her Brexit deal has increased the chances Britain will leave the bloc without a deal in March. The odds on a no-deal Brexit have shortened to 2/1, according to oddschecker.com, while Steve Eisman, the trader whose prediction of the 2008 crisis was dramatized in the film The Big Short, is betting against UK banks.

This septic isle Money where your mouth is The IMF says that while some sectors like agriculture and mining might benefit, the majority of sectors would shrink by between about 1 percent and 33 percent. The Bank of England said no-deal would wipe between 4.75 percent and 7.75 percent off what the UK would have produced by 2024 and the pound would fall by 25 percent.

This septic isle Not waving, but drowning The EU has said the UK would have ""third country"" status under a no-deal scenario, giving it the same status as China, Russia and Pakistan. All goods crossing EU borders would be subject to tariffs of up to 38 percent. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said additional paperwork attached to trading under WTO rules would act as an extra tariff of up to an average of 6.5 percent.

This septic isle Love's labor lost Britain’s farmers and manufacturers face the largest shortage of skilled workers since 1989 due to a fall in the numbers of EU27 nationals coming to work since the Brexit vote. A no deal would likely accelerate that process.

This septic isle A road to nowhere The financial industry and British regulators say a hard Brexit poses a threat to trillions of euros worth of derivative and insurance contracts London could lose up to to €800 billion to Frankfurt, lobby group Frankfurt Main Finance has said. Some 30 banks and financial firms have already chosen the city as the site of their new EU headquarters, with others opting for Dublin or Paris.

This septic isle Movers and shakers left in limbo No-deal would have significant implications for people's ability to go where they want. A €7 charge for visiting the EU's Schengen Area would kick in in 2021, after the UK's transition period ends. British expats would face uncertainty, as many foreign governments have not yet established their rules for residency under no-deal.

This septic isle Can't beat a good queue The UK Road Haulage Association has said a lack of planning over no-deal would mean the manufacturing sector would be put under ""severe pressure"" and hauliers would go out of business. European airports have warned that no-deal would cause ""major disruption and heightened safety risks"" to the air network. Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary has warned planes could be grounded.

This septic isle All in it together The biggest impact of no deal could be felt in Ireland, which exports 12 percent of its goods and 40 percent of its food to the UK, and two-thirds of its other exports travel through the UK. The IMF believes the Netherlands, Denmark, the Czech Republic and Belgium also face taking moderate hits to their economies of between 0.5 percent and 0.7 percent.

This septic isle Where there is harmony, May brings discord The Police Federation has said it was worried about ""widescale disruption and dangers for the general public."" Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has said 3,500 troops are on standby to cope with the fallout of no deal. The government is preparing for potential shortages of key items in the wake of a no-deal Brexit. But May refused to guarantee the health service (NHS) would have enough medicines.

This septic isle Christmas-voting turkeys play chicken in Ireland The border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would remain unresolved with no deal. The main sticking point has been the Irish 'backstop' — the insurance scheme for avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland. One solution has been a Canada-style agreement that would remove most EU restrictions but would not abolish the need for a hard border. But uncertainty breeds fear. Author: Jo Harper



Meanwhile, the opposition Labour party has said it would put forward an amendment calling for a second EU referendum when the next ""meaningful vote"" is held. However, opposition to a second public vote within Labour and the Conservative Party makes its chances of success slim.

No-deal fears

With 29 days to go before the UK is scheduled to leave the EU, businesses are starting to scramble to prepare themselves for a potentially chaotic ""no-deal"" exit.

Drivers in the Republic of Ireland were told Thursday that they would need an insurance document to cross the border into Northern Ireland if both sides failed to reach a deal.

CÚCUTA, Colombia—Venezuela’s opposition called for the first time on the international community to consider the use of military force against President Nicolás Maduro, escalating a standoff after a weekend showdown over humanitarian aid ended in violence.

Violence erupted at the Venezuela-Colombia border over the delivery of humanitarian aid to Venezuela, killing four people and injuring 24 on Feb. 22.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro that his “days are numbered,” and Trump officials reiterated that the U.S. is considering all options, including military action, to address Venezuela’s crisis.

Almost 80 percent of Venezuelans disapprove of Maduro, who was reinaugurated for a second six-year term in January after an election widely seen as fraudulent. Since taking power in 2013, he has led Venezuela into a deep economic crisis.

In late January, opposition leader Juan Guaidó declared Maduro a “usurper” and swore himself in as the country’s rightful president. More than 50 countries – including the United States, Europe and most of Latin America – want to replace Maduro’s regime with a Guaidó-led government.

Despite near global condemnation of Maduro, any U.S. intervention in Venezuela would be controversial. The United States’ long history of interfering in Latin American politics suggests that its military operations generally usher in dictatorship and civil war – not democracy.

The Cuban-US Cold War

Cuba, the focus of my history research, is a prime example of this pattern.

U.S.-Cuban relations have never recovered from President William McKinley’s intervention in Cuba’s war for independence over a century ago.

Before waging what in the U.S. is known as the Spanish-American War in 1898, McKinley promised that “the people of the island of Cuba” would be “free and independent” from Spain and that his government had no “intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction or control over said Island.”

In the end, however, Cuba’s independence from Spain meant domination by the United States.

For 60 years after the Spanish-American War, the White House made repeated military and diplomatic interventions in Cuba, supporting politicians who protected U.S. economic interests in sugar, utilities, banks or tourism and who backed American foreign policy in the Caribbean.

By 1952, when the U.S.-backed Fulgencio Batista overthrew President Carlos Prío Socarrás, Cuba’s government had effectively become protectors of American businesses, according to my research. Batista had a warm relationship with both Washington, D.C. and the American organized crime groups that used to control Havana’s tourist industry.

A communist revolution led by Fidel Castro overthrew Batista’s military junta in 1959. Castro decried the “imperialist government of the United States” for turning Cuba into an “American colony.”

The Kennedy administration’s trade embargo against Cuba and the disastrous 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion – in which the U.S. military trained Cuban dissidents in an attempt to unseat Castro – only pushed Cuba further into the orbit of Soviet Russia.

For the past six decades, the U.S. and Cuba have remained locked in a Cold War, with a brief thaw under President Barack Obama.

Anti-communist coups

Fearing that communism would spread across the hemisphere, the U.S. government repeatedly interfered in the politics of Latin American nations during the Cold War.

In 1954 the CIA worked with elements of the Guatemalan military to overthrow elected President Jacobo Árbenz, whom U.S. policymakers considered dangerously left-wing. Decades of dictatorship and civil war followed, killing an estimated 200,000 people.

A peace agreement in 1996 restored democracy, but Guatemala has yet to recover economically, politically or psychologically from the bloodshed.

Then there is Chile’s U.S.-supported coup d'etat. In 1973, the U.S. government covertly assisted right-wing elements of the Chilean military in overthrowing the socialist president Salvador Allende.

General Augusto Pinochet took power with the quiet financial and political support of the United States. His dictatorship, which lasted until 1990, killed tens of thousands of Chileans.

The Dominican Republic and Panama

U.S. intervention in Latin America did not start or end with the Cold War.

During World War I, the United States was concerned that Germany could use the Dominican Republic as a base of military operations. So American troops occupied the Caribbean island from 1916 to 1924.

Though the American-led administration improved the finances and infrastructure of the Dominican Republic, it also created the national guard that helped to propel Gen. Rafael Trujillo into power. His 30-year reign was savage.

President George H. W. Bush’s 1989 invasion of Panama is the rare exception when U.S. intervention in Latin American affairs actually created stability.

Most Panamanians appear to have supported the 1989 U.S. military operation to remove the corrupt and brutal military strongman Manuel Noriega.

In the years since, Panama has enjoyed comparatively peaceful elections and transfers of power.

Anti-Americanism in Latin America

On balance, though, U.S. military operations in Latin America have rarely brought democracy.

But they have created strong anti-American sentiment in the region, which leftist leaders from Fidel Castro to Hugo Chávez have adeptly harnessed to vilify their political opponents as mere U.S. puppets.

Support for the U.S. government is lower now than it has been in decades. Just 35 percent of Argentines, 39 percent of Chileans and 45 percent of Venezuelans view the U.S. favorably, according to the Pew Research Center.

President Maduro, too, has used anti-imperialist rhetoric. He denounces U.S. sanctions and other efforts to isolate his regime as a “gringo plot.”

A safer way to restore democracy

This history explains why a U.S. intervention in Venezuela would be viewed with skepticism. Though Maduro is unpopular, 65 percent of Venezuelans oppose any foreign military operation to remove Maduro, according to recent polling.

Rather than plan yet another coup d'etat, I believe U.S. efforts in Venezuela should support the work of the Lima Group, a coalition of 12 Latin American countries, including Mexico, Guatemala and Brazil, plus Canada.

The Lima Group has ruled out military force in Venezuela. Its pressure campaign to force him out peacefully has included diplomatically isolating his regime and asking Venezuela’s soldiers to pledge loyalty to Guaidó.

86,Empty,2019-02-26T21:38:12Z,"Jagmeet Singh won Burnaby South through hope and hard work, but it masked crushing defeat and poor shows elsewhere","The morning after three federal byelections was like an elementary school sports day, with all the party leaders wearing their participation medals — “If you had fun, you won” — and claiming victory.

In the B.C. riding of Burnaby South, the NDP’s Jagmeet Singh celebrated a win that paves his way, after 16 months as leader, to a seat in the House of Commons.

To be fair to him, he won the prize through hope and hard work, and no one can ever take his newly won legitimacy away from him (at least not until October).

But the festivities did rather mask a crushing defeat in Outremont where the NDP lost the Quebec seat held by Tom Mulcair in three successive general elections. It also ignored a poor performance in the York-Simcoe byelection in the commuter belt north of Toronto, where the party recorded just 7.5 per cent of the vote.

The Liberals claimed the win in Outremont, taking an opposition seat for the third time in this Parliament — a feat not matched since 1908. It seems that Quebecers do appreciate the Herculean efforts being made by this Prime Minister to place their interests ahead of the rest of the country, on issues ranging from pipelines to the current SNC-Lavalin saga.

If the 18 point drop in support for the NDP in Outremont is repeated across the province in October, the Liberals could add another 10 to 15 seats to their tally. Yet there was a notable enthusiasm gap between 2015 and now that bodes ill for the party. In York-Simcoe, the Liberal vote share slipped significantly (to 29 per cent from 38 per cent) even though the candidate, Shaun Tanaka, was the same.

The Conservatives earned themselves a victory lap in York-Simcoe with Scot Davidson’s win. They will be delighted that Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party earned just 2 per cent of the vote in that riding and in Outremont.

If the 18 point drop in support for the NDP in Outremont is repeated across the province in October, the Liberals could add another 10 to 15 seats to their tally

But they will be disconcerted by the 11 per cent of the vote won by the PPC’s Laura-Lynn Thompson, a former Christian talk show host, in Burnaby. The average People’s Party vote across the three by-elections was 5.6 per cent — potentially the difference between victory and defeat for Andrew Scheer, if replicated in a general election.

Bernier professed himself “disappointed” with the results in Ontario and Quebec but said overall there were signs of progress for his five-month-old party. “This is the beginning of our journey. We are in it for the long haul,” he said.

That would be a fair prediction were it not for the fundamental contradiction at the core of Bernier’s populist party: it is led by a libertarian free-marketer and supported by anti-globalists. One day soon, his followers may realize they don’t share the same agenda as their leader.

Even the Greens could afford to be triumphant. Their candidate in Outremont, Daniel Green (bien sur), picked up 12.5 per cent of the vote, indicating an openness to trying something new among voters tired of a Liberal Party that has broken too many promises, a Conservative Party that is apathetic about climate change and an NDP that has appeared to be in disarray.

While all parties (except the Bloc) had something to cheer about, the real loser was Canadian democracy.

The York-Simcoe byelection is the first I can find on the Elections Canada website where voter turnout dipped below 20 per cent. Fewer than one in five eligible voters bothered to go to the polls, which is a pretty miserable state of affairs.

Outremont was only marginally better, at 21.4 per cent. Rachel Bendayan is now a member of the Canadian parliament having won just 6,086 votes. Every single councillor but one on Toronto city council received more votes in the 2018 municipal election.

The York-Simcoe byelection is the first I can find on the Elections Canada website where voter turnout dipped below 20 per cent

This reflects a level of disillusionment apparent among voters since the sunny ways of 2015, when turnout in the general election reached 68.5 per cent, 10 points up on the record low of 2008.

There is a debate among academics about the declining support for democracy among millennials.

One disconcerting graph that appeared in the Journal of Democracy in 2016 suggested that young people in Western countries like the U.S. and Great Britain are losing faith in democracy, with only one in four Americans born in the 1980s believing that “it is essential to live in a democracy.” That survey has been criticized for its methodology but even the critics agree that, on average, younger people assign lower value to democracy than the generation who lived, or whose parents lived, through the Second World War.

Canada wasn’t included in that study — and the 57 per cent turnout of 18-24 year olds in the 2015 election (up from 39 per cent in 2011) suggested it might be a beacon of hope.

But there has been decline in voter turnout since then, even judging by the historically low rate seen in byelections. One suspects the Liberals’ failure to deliver on specific promises like electoral reform and the more general pledge to “do politics differently” have not enamoured them to younger voters. Neither has the Conservative Party’s apparent disinterest in climate change inspired millennials to head to the polls.

Elections are determined by the people who show up. Studies done after the 2015 election suggest the Conservatives had — and likely still have — an advantage among voters older than 60.

Those people voted in large numbers in 2015 (78.8 per cent of 65-74 years olds voted) and electoral history suggests they will do so again this year.

That prospect may cheer Conservatives. But nobody should be upbeat about the fact that enthusiasm for government of the people, by the people, for the people is waning, and putting our democracy in peril.

The pilot, identified by Islamabad as Wing Commander Abhi Nandan, became the human face of the latest flare-up following the release of videos showing him being captured and later held in custody.

Khan said the pilot would be released on Friday, even as his military reported that four Pakistani civilians had been killed by Indian firing across the disputed border in Kashmir.

""As a peace gesture we will be releasing him tomorrow,"" Khan told parliament.

Khan's decision came after several other countries offered diplomatic assistance to de-escalate the confrontation between two countries that have almost went to war in 2002 for fourth time since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947.

Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said his counterpart from Saudi Arabia was expected to visit Pakistan with a special message from Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman who visited both Pakistan and India earlier this month.

Khan (below) has already called for talks with India to prevent the risk of a ""miscalculation"" between their nuclear-armed militaries.

Earlier, US President Trump said he expected ""reasonably decent news"" regarding the conflict between India and Pakistan, adding that the United States was trying to mediate.

""They have been going at it and we have been involved in trying to have them stop,"" Trump said in Hanoi, where he was attending a summit with North Korea's leader.

""We have been in the middle trying to help them both out."" Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also offered to facilitate talks between the two sides.

The US, China, European Union and other world powers have urged restraint from the two nations as tensions escalate following tit-for-tat airstrikes in the wake of a suicide car bombing that killed at least 40 Indian paramilitary police in Indian-controlled Kashmir on Feb. 14.

Both countries downed enemy jets on Wednesday, and each accused the other of breaching cease fire agreements on Thursday.

Indian and Pakistani troops traded fire along the contested border in Kashmir on at least three occasions on Thursday, with the firing instigated by Pakistan every time, according to New Delhi.

Pakistan's military said four civilians had been killed and two wounded in what it called a ""deliberate"" attack by India during the past 48 hours.

Earlier on Thursday, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who faces a general election in a matter of months, told a rally of supporters that India would unite against its enemies.

""The world is observing our collective will. It is necessary that we shouldn't do anything that allows our enemy to raise a finger at us,"" he said, in his first remarks since the downing of planes on Wednesday.

Firing continues

As a precaution amid the increased military activity, Pakistan has shut its airspace, forcing commercial airlines to reroute.

Troops from India and Pakistan first exchanged fire on Thursday in the Poonch district for over and hour at 6am, according to a statement from the Indian army.

""The Indian army retaliated strongly and effectively,"" said Lieutenant Colonel Devender Anand, a defence ministry spokesman.

Aijaz Ahmad, a resident in the Indian-controlled portion of the district, said he was still hearing heavy firing on Thursday afternoon.

""Loud sounds of mortar shells are being heard from a distance. Shops... are open but there is a lot of tension,"" he said.

Pakistan said the firing began overnight.

""The firing continued in intervals throughout the night. It was moderate,"" said Shaukat Yusufzai, an administration official in the Pakistan-controlled part of Poonch.

India is building more than 14,000 bunkers for families in Jammu and Kashmir state living close to the border, hoping to keep them safe near their homes rather than evacuate them.

On Wednesday evening India's foreign ministry handed a dossier to Pakistan that it claimed detailed camps of the Pakistan-based militant group that carried out the Feb 14 attack.

With a general election due in India by May, an upsurge in nationalism from any conflict with Pakistan could become a key factor, potentially favoring Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

""This has brought a pro-Modi wave all through the country,"" B.S. Yeddyurappa, a BJP leader in the southern state of Karnataka, told reporters. ""The effect of this will be seen in the elections.""

International concern

The latest escalation marks a sudden deterioration in relations between the two countries. As recently as November, Pakistan's leader Khan spoke of ""mending ties"" with India.

The White House urged ""both sides to take immediate steps to de-escalate the situation.""

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement he had spoken separately with the Indian and Pakistani foreign ministers and had urged them to ""prioritise direct communication and avoid further military activity"".

Pakistan's envoy to the United States, Asad Majeed Khan, said Islamabad would like to see the Trump administration play a more active role in easing the crisis.

At the same time, he said the lack of US condemnation of India's strike on Pakistan was ""construed and understood as an endorsement of the Indian position, and that is what emboldened them even more”.

The Chinese government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, spoke by telephone with Pakistan's foreign minister and expressed ""deep concern"".

The United States, Britain and France proposed the United Nations Security Council blacklist Masood Azhar, the head of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad, the group that claimed responsibility for the Feb 14 attack. China is likely to be oppose the move.

Flights cancelled

Thai Airways said it had cancelled more than a dozen flights to Europe due to Pakistan's move, along with all flights to and from the country.

Several airlines including Emirates and Qatar Airways, suspended flights to Pakistan on Wednesday, while others such as Singapore Airlines and British Airways were forced to reroute flights.

Singapore Airlines said on Thursday all of its Europe-bound flights would continue as planned, avoiding the affected airspace as necessary.

Flights from the Middle East and India were also affected. Air Canada said on Wednesday it has temporarily suspended service to India.

“Natural born citizens are naturally citizens because they have only ONE nationality and cannot possibly be anything else.” Not exactly. It is REAL easy to understand. A “natural born citizen” means... Born in the country by TWO citizen parentS. Article II, Section 1, Clause 5: No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States. Article XII (the last sentence) “But no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.” SIMPLE.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement he had spoken separately with the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan and urged them to ""prioritise direct communication and avoid further military activity"".

Pakistan's envoy to the United States, Asad Majeed Khan, said Islamabad would like to see the Trump administration play a more active role in easing the crisis.

At the same time, he said the lack of U.S. condemnation of India's strike on Pakistan was ""construed and understood as an endorsement of the Indian position, and that is what emboldened them even more”.

China, the European Union and other countries also called for restraint. Japan's foreign minister said on Thursday the country was concerned about the ""deteriorating situation"".

The Chinese government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, spoke by telephone with Qureshi and expressed ""deep concern"", China's foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday.

The United States, Britain and France proposed the United Nations Security Council blacklist Masood Azhar, the head of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad, the group that claimed responsibility for the Feb. 14 attack. China is likely to be oppose the move.

Thai Airways said it had cancelled more than a dozen flights to Europe due to Pakistan's move, along with all flights to and from the country.

Several airlines including Emirates and Qatar Airways, suspended flights to Pakistan on Wednesday, while others such as Singapore Airlines and British Airways were forced to reroute flights.



Singapore Airlines said on Thursday all of its Europe-bound flights would continue as planned, avoiding the affected airspace as necessary.

Flights from the Middle East and India were also affected.

""Softwood lumber wasn't something that was being discussed a lot,"" Higgs told reporters when he landed at the Fredericton airport on Monday after three days in the U.S. capital.

The winter meeting of the governors takes place with hundreds of guests, including leaders from business, non-profits and governments around the world.

Before Higgs left for the meeting, he said he would be willing to give way on the province's forestry policy to help ease some of the punishing tariffs on softwood lumber coming from New Brunswick.

New Brunswick was the only Atlantic province not exempt from softwood lumber tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.

Support closer to home

While softwood lumber tariffs were not high on the radar of most people at the Washington meeting, the New England governors were more receptive to the province's plight, Higgs said.

He singled out Janet Mills, the Democratic governor of Maine, who assumed office after last year's mid-term elections.

""She recognizes the sensitivities on both sides of the border,"" said Higgs.

This is what else Premier Blaine Higgs had to say to reporters after his return from Washington on Monday. 0:59

He said the lumber industry in Maine and New Brunswick are heavily integrated and there's a lot of trade between them.

""We as Atlantic Canada, and the eastern U.S., you know kind of always had a market and a business here that needs to be protected.""

National focus needed

Higgs said he felt the issue has now been raised but he wished Canadians at the Washington meetings had come up with a more national focus for the issue.

""I think B.C. has the large portion of the business, and so it's getting more of a focus and we're being drug into it,"" said Higgs.

In Washington, Higgs planned to meet with David Wilkins, a former U.S. ambassador to Canada and now a lobbyist being paid $40,000 a month by the province to lobby the Trump administration on softwood lumber tariffs.

Higgs said he would decide after meeting with Wilkins whether the province would keep him on, but after returning didn't commit to Wilkins one way or the other.

""[Wilkins] was very helpful, he gave me good information,"" Higgs said.

""He offered obviously to continue his assistance in that regard. I said 'We'll talk more about that.'""",Higgs's softwood lumber pitch falls on indifferent ears in U.S.,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/higgs-returns-from-washington-1.5032579

The rupee has gone from being the best-performing Asian currency last quarter to the worst this year, sovereign bonds are set for a second month of declines and equities have sat out the rally that’s driven Asian stocks to a four-month high.

The nervousness ratcheted up Wednesday after Pakistani fighter jets struck at targets inside Indian-controlled Kashmir, prompting both nations to close down large swathes of airspace as tensions between them reached their highest point since a 1971 war. The conflict came a day after India bombed a major terror camp inside Pakistan.

“Further geopolitical tensions will increase the premium in the rupee assets,” said Eugene Leow, a rates strategist at DBS Bank Ltd. in Singapore said. “This is already reflected in the increasingly divergent forex and bond performance between the two high-yielders in Asia -- Indonesia and India.”

The rupee lost 0.3 percent to 71.2475 dollar at the close and the yield on most-traded 2028 bonds surged nine basis points to 7.68 percent. The S&P BSE Sensex index of stocks erased almost all of its intraday gain of 1.1 percent to end marginally in the red. Across the border, Pakistan’s main equities gauge fell 0.3 percent to the lowest level since Jan. 7.

The modest reaction prompted some analysts to say that markets are underestimating the impact of a further flare up.

Optimism about the US-China trade talks and the Brexit delay are “distracting traders and investors from the broader point that military escalation between two nuclear powers has huge implications,” said Sue Trinh, head of Asia FX strategy at Royal Bank of Canada.

This week’s skirmish represents the worst escalation since 2001, when the countries moved ballistic missiles and troops to their border following an attack on parliament in New Delhi that was also blamed on Jaish-e-Mohammad. The two nations have fought three major wars since partition and independence in 1947.

“If India responds again there will a problem in the short term,” said Aneesh Srivastava, chief investment officer at IDBI Federal Life Insurance Co. “This issue may continue to simmer until elections.”

Poll Prospects

Facing a general election due by May, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is under pressure after blaming Pakistan for the worst attack on security forces in Kashmir in decades earlier this month. There’s a possibility for this event to unite the nation behind Modi at the polls, which could help support markets, analysts including Saktiandi Supaat at Maybank wrote in a note, advising clients to buy the rupee on declines.

Maybank’s not alone in recommending the buy-the-dips strategy. Global funds bought a net $487.5 million of shares so far this week, taking the month’s purchases to $2.3 billion. That’s set to be the biggest inflow since November 2017, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

Jorge Arreaza used his speech to float the idea of talks between President Nicolas Maduro and U.S. President Donald Trump - even as he blasted alleged U.S. 'aggression' against his country.

He told the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva that the two leaders could seek 'common ground' over Venezuela's escalating crisis.

Venezuela Minister of Foreign Affairs Jorge Arreaza addresses the 40th session of the Human Rights Council at the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland on February 27, after European and Latin American diplomats walked out in protest

'We're calling for dialogue, dialogue with the United States - why not between Presidents Maduro and Trump?' Arreaza said.

'Why shouldn't they meet so that they could try to find common ground and explain their differences?'

He also called for 'dialogue between Venezuelan citizens.'

More than 50 other countries have recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as the South American country's interim president, including Canada, the UK and Venezuela's neighbours Colombia and Brazil.

Jorge Arreaza suggested that President Trump (pictured) meet with President Nicolas Maduro (right) to try and 'find common ground and explain their differences'

Many of their low-level diplomats stormed out of the room just as Arreaza arrived to speak to the 47-member council.

Arreaza also said in his address that the U.S. was trying to overthrow the Maduro government and that Venezuela had lost $30 billion in assets 'confiscated' since Nov. 2017, including from the state oil company Citgo.

He then renewed an invitation to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, to visit Venezuela to evaluate the impact of what he described as a US-led 'blockade'.

The United States is among the countries that have recognized Guaido, but no U.S. diplomats were present for the walkout on Wednesday: The Trump administration quit the council last summer over its alleged anti-Israel bias.

Vice presi…","The US has announced new sanctions on Caracas and insisted that all options were on the table to oust Nicolas Maduro, as a Republican senator tweeted images showing the death throes of Muammar Gaddafi in an apparent threat to the Venezuelan leader.

Vice president Mike Pence said four Venezuelan state governors allied to Mr Maduro were the target of the new sanctions, while he urged the international community to freeze assets of the nation's state-run oil company. The US also asked the United Nations Security Council to hold an urgent meeting on the crisis.

“I want to assure you, President Guaidó, that the tragic events of the past weekend have only steeled the resolve of the United States of America,” Mr Pence said at a meeting of the Lima Group in Colombia.

The meeting was attended by opposition leader Juan Guaido, who last month declared himself Venezuela's president.

According to the Associated Press, Mr Pence added. “We are with you 100 per cent.”

Also in Colombia at the weekend, where he visited efforts to transport US aid across the border into Venezuela – an effort that resulted in violence and several deaths – was Republican senator Marco Rubio, who has been highly influential on Donald Trump’s Latin American policy and whom the New York Times has termed the “ouster in chief”.

On Sunday, he tweeted several messages attacking Mr Maduro’s government before then posting three images of ousted dictators – Libya’s Gaddafi, Panama’s Manuel Noriega and Romania’s Nicolae Ceausescu. The gruesome, blood-laced image of the Libyan leader was taken as he was bayoneted to death by rebels in the city of Sirte in October 2011. Nato had earlier engaged in a devastating bombing campaign against Gadafi's forces.

Mr Rubio’s tweet of the image contained no text, but quickly sparked outcry on social media. A number of commentators said he was tweeting the equivalent of stills from a “snuff movie”.

In Colombia at the meeting of nations from the Americas, Mr Pence spoke with Mr Guaido, who Washington had encouraged to declare himself the country’s “legitimate” president and who it quickly regonised as such after he did so. The UK, Canada and up to 50 other nations quickly followed, while China, Russia and Mexico still recognise Mr Maduo.

Mr Pence accused Mr Maduro’s forces of burning several trucks containing medical supplies over the weekend as the opposition tried to deliver US aid, even though it was unclear how they were set alight.

“As the world watched, the tyrant in Caracas danced as his henchmen murdered civilians and burned truckloads of food and medicine destined for the people of Venezuela,” Mr Pence claimed. “These men worked to block aid for people in need and suppress peaceful protests – and their actions will not go unpunished.

“In the days ahead, the US will announce even stronger sanctions on the regime's corrupt financial networks. We will find every last dollar they have stolen and return that money to the Venezuelan people.

“As we continue to bring economic and diplomatic pressure to bear on the Maduro regime, we hope for a peaceful transition to democracy, but as President Trump has made clear, all options are on the table.”

But others - including several European nations - voiced caution. Hamilton Mourão, vice president of Brazil, one of the nations that has recegnised Mr Guaido, said under no circumstances would his country allow the US to intervene militarily in Venezuela from Brazilian territory.





Mr Maduro has denied claims that he is refusing to accept aid. Indeed, the UN has stepped up distribution of humanitarian supplies in the country. His supporters point out the US has previously used shipments of aid in Latin America to smuggle weapons to rebels. Three decades ago, Elliott Abrams, currently Mr Trump’s point person on Venezuela, oversaw such an operation against the democratically elected government of Nicaragua.

Mr Maduro on Monday tweeted that the “empire and its lackey” must understand that in “Venezuela the self-determination of our people reigns. We will solve the problems in a national union, with the Bolivarian government that I preside over. Together for Venezuela!”.

Meanwhile, the US asked the UN Security Council to discuss the Venezuela situation on Tuesday. Reuters said Washington wanted the 15-member council to formally call for free, fair and credible presidential elections in Venezuela with international observers, a move that prompted Russia to propose a rival draft resolution.",US announces new Venezuela sanctions as Rubio shares 'snuff movie' pictures of Colonel Gaddafi in threat to Maduro,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/us-announces-venezuela-sanctions-rubio-204529328.html

When future historians write the Internet’s history, Spring 2018 will mark the turning point when regulators stopped giving a fuck about the Internet’s potential as a dynamic, open & innovative platform #FOSTA #GDPR #CCPA 😢😢😢 — Eric Goldman (@ericgoldman) June 29, 2018



If you can’t read it:

When future historians write the Internet’s history, Spring 2018 will mark the turning point when regulators stopped giving a fuck about the Internet’s potential as a dynamic, open & innovative platform #FOSTA #GDPR #CCPA 😢😢😢

This broad dynamic in Internet law didn’t make my top 10 list explicitly (though FOSTA, GDPR and CCPA all rank highly), but it’s a sign of 2018’s historical significance.

#10: Politicians blocking constituents on social media. Politicians love the unfiltered broadcast capability of social media, but some of them hate getting unfiltered constituent feedback. So politicians keep blocking their constituents on social media, and courts keep declaring the blocks unconstitutional. If your job is to represent constituents that you don’t actually want to hear from, find a new line of work.

#9: Competitive keyword lawsuits are stupid…and possibly illegal. Each year I want to declare this topic dead, only to find it keeps cropping up again. Perhaps 2018 will drive the final nail in the coffin due to the FTC’s determination that 1-800 Contacts engaged in anti-competitive practices by systematically restricting its competitors’ ability to bid on its trademarks. Lawsuits over competitive keyword advertising have always been a bad business decision. Now, they are also legally ill-advised.

#8: Internet taxes. In the South Dakota v. Wayfair case, the Supreme Court opened up the door to states taxing online sales by non-residents. If Congress doesn’t intervene, expect a taxation tsunami.

#7: Failure of the lawsuits claiming that social media services support terrorism. Social media providers are not liable for the fact that terrorists use their tools. Nine different courts have confirmed that.

#6: EU Copyright Directive. The EU Copyright Directive has had more dramatic twists than a soap opera. You know the cliche: the good-looking but perpetually self-destructive character who consistently makes poor choices that prompts the audience to scream at the screen, “NOOOO…don’t do it!”

It’s a slight overstatement to say that the EU Copyright Directive’s mandatory filter and link tax would be the death of the Internet. More accurately, the directive would likely only cause the death of the European Internet. The mandatory filter requirement would likely eliminate most user-generated content in Europe. In its place, Europe will actualize the dystopian counterfactual vision of the Internet from the 1990s, when many people expected the Internet to replicate the 1990s cable system, with a few large content owners broadcasting paywalled content to passive viewers. The Internet has evolved into something greater than that, but can it stay that way? Has Europe already planted enough regulatory seeds that the European Internet will inevitably devolve in a cable-style collection of a few large walled gardens, even if the EU Copyright Directive is defeated?

#5: USMCA and Internet Immunity. Section 230 has always been an idiosyncratic American thing, a natural extension of our idiosyncratic First Amendment. So it was remarkable that NAFTA 2.0, the USMCA, embraced Section 230 and exported its pro-free speech policy to Mexico and Canada. Though we’re years away (at best) from Canada or Mexico actually doing anything different, it’s a small glimmer of hope that a user-powered Internet might survive a little longer, even if only in the North American region.

#4: GDPR. The passage of the California Consumer Privacy Act implicitly burnished the GDPR’s reputation as a privacy regulation. As bad as the GDPR is—and it’s bad—the GDPR sometimes looks attractive when compared to the even-more-terrible CCPA. But let’s not over-romanticize the GDPR. It is unquestionably an innovation-killer. It raises significant entry barriers and imposes significant ongoing compliance costs. It ossifies the business environment and privileges existing incumbents over stifled start-ups. I expect we’ll see a steady stream of empirical studies confirming that dynamic. The GDPR has also accelerated the splinternet phenomenon, as businesses outside the EU “opt out” of the GPDR by blocking EU-based users, creating geographically divergent Internets–and realities.

#3: FOSTA. FOSTA is heart-breaking policy because it doesn’t appear to benefit anyone. In ways that were entirely predictable—and predicted—to Congress in advance, FOSTA appears to hurt, rather than help, sex trafficking victims and commercial sex workers, and it shrunk the Internet and undermined free speech. A truly sad outcome for everyone.

#2: California Consumer Privacy Act. The CCPA is the first comprehensive privacy law in the US, but it was produced by a terrible process that resulted in a predictably terrible law that will hurt the California economy and much more. It never ceases to amaze me how many California privacy lawyers really hate the law—even though they should be the law’s natural allies because they already survived GDPR compliance, plus the CCPA will benefit them financially. The CCPA won’t be fixed because the legislature doesn’t have the capacity or appetite to give it the necessary attention, and some privacy advocates have embraced the law despite its many flaws. Instead, the only remaining way to “fix” the CCPA is with a preemptive federal law, which shouldn’t give you much optimism given Congress’ dysfunction.

#1: Perceived online service bias against “conservatives.” In a “normal” year, the GDPR, FOSTA, and CCPA all would have been strong contenders for #1 on this list. But they were upstaged this year by an even more pernicious regulatory dynamic. Many conservatives believe that Internet services are “biased” against them, and they are fighting back vigorously on multiple fronts, including the courts, legislatures, and Trump’s Twitter timeline. Lawsuits in this genre include Mezey v. Twitter, Dehen v. Doe, Prager U v. Google, Brittain v. Twitter, and Kimbrell v. Twitter. Legislation in this genre include Arkansas Bill HB1028 and a federal bill from Rep. Gohmert, plus numerous confidence-undermining legislative hearings. The perceptions of anti-conservative bias are usually based on a combination of cherry-picked anecdotes and paranoia, so they are dangerously afactual. Furthermore, the Internet services are routinely asked to make sometimes-fine distinctions between “legitimate” “conservative” views that add to the discourse from “illegitimate” discriminatory hate speech that corrode the entire community and should be squelched. Yet, the pity-me persecution complex has the capacity to destroy the Internet. Internet services are already overreacting by treading more cautiously with respect to content that conservatives might support. It’s also accelerating support for legally requiring “neutrality” or “must carry” obligations, which would take away the Internet services’ ability to manage the crazies and thereby destroy the Internet. The Internet needs curation and filtration, but those efforts inevitably lead to accusations of “bias” by someone. We can’t let those accusations win.

Honorable mentions

* The Trump Administration’s terrible information security practices. Hillary Clinton’s alleged bad infosec practices were a signature and likely dispositive issue of the 2016 presidential elections. Yet, Trump and his affiliates have consistently appalling infosec practices, including the use of insecure email servers and insecure cellphones. It’s almost like Hillary was subjected to a double standard.

* End of Net Neutrality. Net Neutrality has had nearly as many dramatic twists as the EU Copyright Directive. I’m not sure what the future holds, but I do know that telcos will act like monopolistic pigs if given the chance.

* Daniel v. Armslist. A goofy Wisconsin appellate ruling indicated that Section 230 only applied to defamation cases. The case is now pending before the Wisconsin Supreme Court. I hope they get it right.

* Spanski v TV Polska. One way of reading this case is that online publishers must use geoblocking if they want to avoid copyright liability in foreign countries. Another splinternets case.

* Fox v TVEyes. Copyright owners can shut down online archives if they don’t like being subject to critical scrutiny. A good example of how courts may underappreciate the value and complexity of content aggregation.

* ABS v. CBS. Remastering songs doesn’t reset copyright protection.

* Eichenwald v. Rivello. Perhaps the most interesting case of the year. Can software code sent over the Internet cause a battery? Maybe.

* Music Modernization Act. Most of it was inside baseball, but the law contains an interesting if limited attempt to statutorily accommodate orphan works.

* Goldman v. Breitbart. If this case stands, in-line linking may be doomed.

* Hassell v. Bird. A good Section 230 result rendered inscrutable by Justice Kruger’s swing-vote opinion.

Nova Scotia Proud is a registered non-profit that lists its directors as Devin Drover, Hugh McNamara and Reagan Seidler. The robocall asks recipients if they are concerned about long wait times for health care.

""Our concern is not red or blue or orange — our concern is with politicians that implement bad policies,"" Drover said via email.

Targeting Trudeau, McNeil

Drover said the group was created to raise awareness about ""the bad governance we are experiencing in Nova Scotia"" and to provide a voice for people concerned about the health-care system, high taxes and government waste.

""Our goal is to help shift public discourse so that politicians are better listening to everyday Nova Scotians, and to make sure we have a government we can be proud of,"" he said.

Devin Drover is a director of Nova Scotia Proud. (Facebook)

Drover has volunteered with the Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador, but he said Nova Scotia Proud is not affiliated with any political party.

The majority of political posts on its Facebook page relate to defeating the Liberal governments of Premier Stephen McNeil and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. People who've commented on posts indicate a strong preference for Progressive Conservative and Conservative alternatives.

As with other provincial Proud groups and the Canada Proud group, the Nova Scotia organization's Facebook page shares various news stories, predominantly related to health care and the justice system, often from the Conservative news website, The Nectarine. It also cross-posts from other Proud pages, although Drover said they are separate organizations.

In December, CBC reported Ontario Proud received almost $460,000 in corporate donations to help with efforts in support of Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford's election campaign. The group first gained notice in 2017 as its Facebook page targeted then-Liberal premier Kathleen Wynne.

Election rules are different for Nova Scotia, in that registered third parties can only receive contributions from individuals and spending limits are capped at $10,000 for a general election and $2,000 for a byelection.

Ontario Proud's Facebook page has 428,000 likes, while that of Nova Scotia Proud — which was created much more recently — has 3,500.

Looking at upcoming elections

Drover said it's the organization's policy not to disclose findings or details of its research surveys, and he declined to say how the robocalls were paid for or how the group is funded.

""We will accept donations from any entity that shares our values, whether that is a sole individual or an organization,"" he said.

As for whether Nova Scotia Proud would attempt to become involved in upcoming elections, Drover said the group is ""actively exploring how we can get our message out during any election campaign, while maintaining compliance with all election rules and regulations.""

Nine candidates are vying to replace Peter Van Loan as the new federal Member of Parliament for the riding and all eyes will be on the PPC to see how many votes they take away from the Conservatives, and whether it would be enough to tip the riding toward the Liberals or NDP.

Van Loan, a member of the Conservative Party, announced his retirement in September after 14 years as the representative of the riding — long considered a Tory stronghold.

Scot Davidson, the new Conservative Party candidate, said he's feeling confident.

""This is really a referendum on the Liberal government,"" said Davidson, a local entrepreneur from the town of Georgina.

Today, byelections will be held in ridings across the country including York–Simcoe in Ontario, Outremont in Quebec and Burnaby South in B.C. (CBC)

The York-Simcoe riding was one of three federal byelections called by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Jan. 9.

Davidson has positioned himself as a businessman looking to apply his skills in helping industries grow, with a keen interest in supporting agriculture.

""Let's face it, this riding being so close to Toronto is a place where farmers themselves want to expand and look at even food processing. It's something that I can bring to the table and help facilitate,"" Davidson said.

He says he's not worried about being new to politics but rather sees it as an asset, insisting that he has ""young legs, I'm ready to run.""

Liberal candidate Shaun Tanaka went head-to-head against Van Loan in the last federal election but fell short.

This time, the mother of two says she's back and has a better chance than ever.

""We increased the Liberal voter turnout by 400 per cent,"" she told CBC News, referring to the last federal election.

""When I asked the family whether I should take this on again because it's a big ask of the entire family, the boys said to me, 'You totally should, because this time you're going to win.'""

Shaun Tanaka is hopeful the headway she made in 2015's federal election will result in a Liberal upset this time around. (CBC)

Reports of hacks dominate the news. The security of elections processes is increasingly questioned, and almost weekly, it seems, another company announces a data breach in which personal data of customers is exposed. Is this what we can expect going forward?It might seem like it, but increasingly, there is growing awareness of the magnitude of the threat. Even in an age when gaining and sustaining a competitive advantage is of paramount importance for businesses, the idea that companies should work together to share information and expertise is gaining traction. As more businesses adopt this attitude, they will reap the benefits of improved defenses.

What is threat intelligence?

Threat intelligence is the systematic analysis of all threats facing an organization. These include both internal and external threats. Threat intelligence considers security incidents that result when organizational vulnerabilities are exploited by attackers, and provides information derived from analysis of a variety of data, including the goals of the hacker, the known variants of the threat, and possible defenses against the threat. It can be used in the short term (for example, developing a response to a specific attack) as well as in the long term (formulating responses based on strategic assessment of the plans that attackers may be considering).

Why should organizations work together?

Organizations that collaborate to generate understanding of how cyber attackers operate have an opportunity to pool their knowledge and experience. By learning about attacks against others in their industry, an organization can plan more effective defenses against future attacks. Cyber criminals often use specific attack vectors repeatedly until they become ineffective, so sharing information and best practices about threats and attacks is one of the best possible defensive strategies.

Awareness of the benefits of collaborative work and information sharing is growing. In Canada, the Canadian Cyber Threat Exchange (CCTX) was founded in 2015 to facilitate information sharing and provide a neutral forum where organizations can work together to defend against cybersecurity threats.

Cybersecurity affects everyone

Breaches at major corporations make the news, but that doesn’t mean that individuals can’t be targeted. Ransomware makes information inaccessible until a ransom is paid, and perpetrators of ransomware attacks can target any information. If data is important enough to be preserved — even if it has no obvious commercial or intellectual value — it can be targeted in a ransomware attack. How much would you pay to restore access to your personal photos?

Solid corporate cybersecurity brings many benefits

In addition to providing a defense against hacks and data breaches, organizations can approach cybersecurity in a way that brings significant business advantages. A strong cybersecurity culture creates paths for companies to develop better relationships with their employees regarding cybersecurity. As cybersecurity habits improve at work, employees will also take this knowledge and expertise into their private online lives. Given the proliferation of IOT devices and BYOD in the office, this cooperative approach can only minimize organizational risk.

Strong cybersecurity procedures can also present an opportunity for organizations to differentiate themselves. From a consumer perspective, a company’s response to a cybersecurity incident can have a lasting impact: Under Armour has been widely praised both for its prompt disclosure of a February 2018 breach, and for its success in protecting user information such as birth dates and credit card numbers (though some passwords were left vulnerable). Internally, recruiting employees with the requisite skill set can be a challenge for many companies. Proactive attitudes towards cybersecurity education can be leveraged as organizations search for the best possible employees.

Cybersecurity for the public good

As more and more aspects of our daily lives are conducted online, and as organizations increasingly conduct business online, cybersecurity is coming to be a social imperative. Just as businesses have used community involvement to increase their public exposure, organizations that embrace cybersecurity sharing will be able to use this to differentiate themselves from their competitors. There is a business opportunity here. By sharing knowledge and experiences, organizations not only improve their own defenses, they also strengthen societal defenses against cyber crime. This is a goal that everyone can support.

Scheer told reporters Wednesday that Trudeau has ""lost the moral authority to govern"" and called on the RCMP to open an investigation into the controversy.

The Conservative leader said he was ""sickened and appalled"" by Jody Wilson-Raybould's testimony before the justice committee, which detailed the political interference she claimed to have experienced as the former attorney general.

Watch: Wilson-Raybould says she faced pressure, 'veiled threats' over SNC-Lavalin

In more than three hours of testimony, Wilson-Raybould alleged that she faced ""consistent and sustained pressure"" for four months from Trudeau, his senior staff, Canada's top public servant and the finance minister's office to halt the criminal prosecution of the Montreal engineering giant.

Wilson-Raybould told MPs was repeatedly pressed to overturn a decision not to negotiate a remediation agreement, also known as a deferred prosecution agreement, with SNC-Lavalin. Such a deal would have allowed the company, facing fraud and bribery charges from its dealings in Libya, to avoid a trial that could damage the company and spur layoffs.

Scheer said it is clear now that Wilson-Raybould was being bullied to ""bend the law"" for a well-connected corporation. He accused Trudeau of allowing a ""systemic culture of corruption to take root in his office"" and said the episode marked the final stages of his government.

""Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this country now that Canadians know what he has done,"" Scheer said. ""That is why I'm calling on Mr. Trudeau to do the right thing and resign.""

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh did not echo Scheer's call for the prime minister's resignation. He said the testimony heard at justice committee reaffirms his party's call for an independent inquiry.

""He may need to resign because of this,"" Singh said.

Wilson-Raybould testified that between Sept. 4 and Dec. 19, there were at least 10 different phone calls and 10 meetings about the SNC-Lavalin case between her or key members of her staff and 11 people in the Prime Minister's Office and other departments. Emails and text messages were also exchanged, she added.

Wilson-Raybould said that in a meeting with Trudeau on Sept. 17, the prime minister said SNC-Lavalin could cut many jobs and possibly move from Montreal without a remediation deal. She said Trudeau also stressed there was a provincial election in Quebec at the time and that he was an MP for the Quebec riding of Papineau.

Wilson-Raybould said she was ""taken aback"" and asked the prime minister if he was politically interfering in her independent role and decision as the attorney general, and that she would ""strongly advise"" against that.

""The prime minister said, 'No, no, no, we just need to find a solution,'"" she said.

The Canadian Press Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould appears at the House of Commons Justice Committee on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Feb. 27, 2019.

She also accused Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick of issuing ""veiled threats"" during a phone call on Dec. 19, in which she alleges he referenced how Trudeau wanted to know why a remediation deal wasn't being pursued. Wilson-Raybould said Wernick told her Trudeau would ""find a way to get it done one way or another.""

In a January cabinet shuffle, Wilson-Raybould was demoted to veterans affairs minister and replaced as attorney general and justice minister by David Lametti. She resigned from cabinet earlier this month.

Wilson-Raybould also testified the pressure she felt did not cross the line, in her opinion, from ""inappropriate"" to illegal.

PM 'completely disagrees' with Wilson-Raybould's account

Speaking to reporters in Montreal, Trudeau said he ""completely disagrees"" with his former attorney general's version of events.

""Our government will always focus on jobs and our economy. We,of course, had discussions of the potential loss of 9,000 jobs in communities across the country, including the possibly impact on pensions,"" he said in reference to SNC-Lavalin's woes.

""My job as prime minister has always been to stand up for Canadians and Canadian workers.""

Trudeau distanced himself from Wilson-Raybould's claim that he politically interfered in the prosecution case against SNC-Lavalin. He said the decision about a deferred prosecution agreement related to Quebec company ""was Ms. Wilson-Raybould's and hers alone.""

""I strongly maintain as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,"" the prime minister said.

Ryan Remiorz/CP Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks at a media availability in Montreal on Feb. 27, 2019.

He responded to Scheer's call for his resignation by mentioning the upcoming election, saying Canadians will have a ""clear choice"" to make in a few months. He pointed to his government's economic record as a reason for Canadians to re-elect a Liberal government.

The Conservative party, Trudeau said, remains ""the party of Stephen Harper that continues to attack, to divide, to play politics with big issues.""

Trudeau sidestepped a question when asked if he would allow Wilson-Raybould, currently the MP for Vancouver Granville, to run under the Liberal banner this fall. He said that he has yet to listen to the entirety of his former attorney general's testimony.

""I will do that before making any further decisions,"" he said.

Wilson-Raybould asked if she has confidence in PM

Wilson-Raybould, meanwhile, will likely face questions about whether she can stay in the Liberal caucus in light of her explosive testimony.

At the committee, Liberal MP Randy Boissonnault asked his caucus colleague if she still has confidence in the prime minister.

""I'm not going to get into any conversations about why I resigned other than to say this. I resigned from cabinet because I did not have confidence to sit around the cabinet table,"" Wilson-Raybould said.

A new poll puts Andrew Scheer's Conservatives seven points ahead of the Liberals, gaining the favour of 38 per cent of voters, putting them in majority government territory, compared to 31 per cent for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's party, according to an Angus Reid Institute report.

The majority of Canadians, 66 per cent, believe the SNC-Lavalin affair points to a deeper scandal in the Prime Minister's Office, the poll found. And two-thirds of Canadians believe SNC-Lavalin should be prosecuted, potentially resulting in a 10-year ban on the Quebec-based engineering company receiving public contracts.

""It's about perceived and real lack of transparency that the Trudeau government has been scrambling, unsuccessfully, to fix,"" said Angus Reid executive director Shachi Kurl. ""The lack of detail enables people's speculation.""

Trudeau has faced ongoing political backlash for his role in the SNC-Lavalin affair since late last week, when the online poll was conducted. Sixty per cent of Canadians have an unfavourable opinion of him and over the last month, 59 per cent of respondents said their opinion of Trudeau has worsened.

But it appears no party leader is particularly popular. Fifty-four per cent of Canadians think Scheer is unfavourable, and 64 per cent think the NDP's Jagmeet Singh is unfavourable. It is standard for party leaders not to be very well known or popular until weeks before the election, Kurl said.

Over the past month, how Canadians view Scheer and Singh has not drastically changed — 55 per cent and 64 per cent of respondents, respectively, feel the same way about each leader.

""What we see now is Scheer has been able to make swings that hit Trudeau but that hasn't translated to his own gains,"" Kurl said. ""Six months is eons in an election, and the question becomes can Scheer translate the general anger and dissatisfaction towards Trudeau into successfully offering himself up as an alternative to the prime minister-ship?""

Highlights

Free to speak for the first time about the SNC-Lavalin affair, Jody Wilson-Raybould delivered dramatic testimony in Ottawa on Wednesday, alleging “inappropriate” and sustained pressure from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his office to save the engineering firm from a trial that could damage the Liberals’ political future in Quebec.

In her lengthy opening statement and three hours of questioning by the House justice committee, she gave a detailed timeline of contentious conversations between her, her staff, the Prime Minister’s Office and other officials. In some of those exchanges, she says she faced “veiled threats” that an SNC trial would allow the firm’s headquarters to leave Quebec, costing thousands of jobs.

Afterward, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau – who left Ottawa for Montreal shortly before the testimony began – faced calls from the opposition to resign or face a public inquiry. On Thursday, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer wrote to RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki asking for an investigation, citing a provision of the Criminal Code making it illegal to “provoke a state of fear” to impede the criminal justice system.

Mr. Trudeau said Wednesday that he “completely disagreed” with Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s version of events and denied any wrongdoing. Asked about the issue again on Thursday, Mr. Trudeau said neither he nor the RCMP had contacted him about SNC.

What we knew before Wednesday

On Feb. 7, The Globe and Mail reported for the first time that Jody Wilson-Raybould had faced pressure in her previous job as justice minister to intervene in the federal corruption case against SNC-Lavalin, a Quebec engineering firm accused of bribing Libyan officials to win construction contracts. That first Globe report was based on information from confidential sources, who said the Prime Minister’s Office sought to avoid a costly trial last fall by reaching an out-of-court settlement with SNC. But Ms. Wilson-Raybould refused. Months later, she was shuffled into the Veterans Affairs portfolio.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau denied he had “directed” Ms. Wilson-Raybould on the matter, but dodged questions on whether he had pressed her. He later acknowledged that they had discussed SNC’s case, and that when she asked in September whether he was ordering her to make a particular decision, he told her no. But Ms. Wilson-Raybould, who quit as veterans minister on Feb. 12, didn’t have a chance to tell her side of the story because she said she was bound by solicitor-client privilege. Mr. Trudeau partly waived that privilege on Feb. 25, but only for matters relating to her time as justice minister. That set the stage for Wednesday’s hearings at the House justice committee, which is looking into the SNC issue in general.

‘Veiled threats’ to 'politically interfere’

Open this photo in gallery Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks to supporters in Montreal on Feb. 27, 2019. Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press

In her opening statement, which ran more than 5,000 words, Ms. Wilson-Raybould described “consistent and sustained” political pressure from Mr. Trudeau and top officials urging her to settle the SNC case quietly by urging the Director of Public Prosecutions to reach a deferred prosecution agreement, or DPA, so that SNC could admit wrongdoing and pay compensation without a more costly trial:

Story continues below advertisement

For a period of approximately four months between September and December 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the Attorney General of Canada in an inappropriate effort to secure a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with SNC-Lavalin. These events involved 11 people (excluding myself and my political staff) – from the Prime Minister’s Office, the Privy Council Office, and the Office of the Minister of Finance.

On several occasions, she says, “veiled threats” were invoked that SNC would move its head office out of Quebec if its legal woes continued, losing thousands of jobs in the province. She cited several times when Mr. Trudeau or other officials brought up the then-upcoming Quebec provincial election, which the provincial Liberals ultimately lost on Oct. 1 to the Coalition Avenir Québec.

Here’s what she said about one such meeting, where she spoke with Mr. Trudeau and Michael Wernick, Clerk of the Privy Council, on Sept. 17. At this point, the Director of Public Prosecutions had already informed SNC that there would be no DPA, according to court documents obtained by The Globe:

The Prime Minister asks me to help out – to find a solution here for SNC – citing that if there was no DPA there would be many jobs lost and that SNC will move from Montreal. In response, I explained to him the law ... I told him that I had done my due diligence and made up my mind on SNC and that I was not going to interfere with the decision of the DPP.

... At that point the PM jumped in stressing that there is an election in Quebec and that “and I am an MP in Quebec – the member for Papineau.” My response – and I remember this vividly – was to ask the PM a direct question while looking him in the eye – I asked: “Are you politically interfering with my role / my decision as the AG? I would strongly advise against it.” The Prime Minister said “No, No, No – we just need to find a solution.”

The names named

Michael Wernick

Michael Wernick is head of the Privy Council Office, a wing of the public service that supports the PMO and cabinet. He was present at Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s Sept. 17 meeting with Mr. Trudeau. She describes him supporting Mr. Trudeau’s argument that job losses in Quebec were a sufficient reason to intervene in the SNC case:

Then to my surprise – the Clerk started to make the case for the need to have a DPA – he said “there is a board meeting on Thursday (Sept 20) with stock holders” ... “they will likely be moving to London if this happens” ... “and there is an election in Quebec soon” ...

On Dec. 19, after more conversations between Mr. Wernick and her staff, Ms. Wilson-Raybould had a phone call with him:

The Clerk said that the PM is quite determined, quite firm but he wants to know why the DPA route which Parliament provided for isn’t being used. He said “I think he is gonna find a way to get it done one way or another. So, he is in that kinda mood and I wanted you to be aware of that.” I warned the Clerk that we were treading on dangerous ground here – and I issued a stern warning because as the AG, I cannot act in a manner and the prosecution cannot act in a manner that is not objective, that isn’t independent, I cannot act in a partisan way and I cannot be politically motivated. And all of this screams of that.

Gerald Butts and Katie Telford

Gerald Butts, the Prime Minister’s best friend, spent more than three years at his side as principal secretary. But on Feb. 18 he quit, saying the accusations of PMO meddling were a distraction from the government’s work. That left Katie Telford, Mr. Trudeau’s chief of staff, as the most senior person in the PMO.

In her testimony, Ms. Wilson-Raybould described both of them playing a key role in the SNC discussions. On Dec. 18, she says he challenged her chief of staff, Jessica Prince, to get an external legal opinion of the DPP’s decision not to reach a DPA:

Gerry said “Jess, there is no solution here that doesn’t involve some interference.” At least they are finally being honest about what they are asking you to do! Don’t care about the PPSC’s independence. Katie was like “we don’t want to debate legalities anymore.” … They kept being like “we aren’t lawyers, but there has to be some solution here”.’

Bill Morneau

Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s testimony also added some new characters to the SNC drama: Bill Morneau, the Finance Minister, and his chief of staff Ben Chin. Ms. Prince talked with Mr. Chin on Sept. 6, two days after SNC was notified there would be no DPA. He, too, pressed on the issue of jobs and the Quebec election:

He wanted to talk about SNC and what we could do, if anything, to address this. He said to her that if they don’t get a DPA, they will leave Montreal, and it’s the Quebec election right now, so we can’t have that happen. He said that they have a big meeting coming up on Tuesday and that this bad news may go public.

David Lametti

When Ms. Wilson-Raybould was shuffled out of her job in January, Mr. Trudeau chose MP David Lametti to replace her as justice minister. Days before the shuffle, discussions were set in motion to make the SNC file a priority for Mr. Lametti, Ms. Wilson-Raybould said, citing directives given to the deputy justice minister by Mr. Wernick:

My former Deputy Minister is called by the Clerk and told that the shuffle is happening, and that she will be getting a new Minister. As part of this conversation, the Clerk tells the Deputy that one of the first conversations that the new Minister will be expected to have with the PM will be on SNC Lavalin. In other words, that the new Minister will need to be prepared to speak to the PM on this file. The Deputy recounts this to my Chief of Staff who tells me about the comment.

The spectre of Nixon

One of the biggest corruption scandals in U.S. history, Watergate, got an unexpected cameo in Wednesday’s hearings when Ms. Wilson-Raybould mentioned the Saturday Night Massacre, when president Richard Nixon’s attorney-general quit in 1973 rather than fire the Watergate special prosecutor. She brought up the comparison in her Dec. 19 conversation with Mr. Wernick, when he pressed her again on reaching a settlement with SNC:

The Clerk acknowledged that, but said that the PM does not have the power to do what he wants… all the tools are in my hands, he said. I said that I was having thoughts of the Saturday Night Massacre – but that I was confident that I had given the Prime Minister my best advice to protect him and to protect the constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence. The Clerk said that he was worried about a collision because the PM is pretty firm about this…He told me that he had seen the PM a few hours ago and that this is really important to him.

Here’s a primer from The Globe’s Washington correspondent, Adrian Morrow, on the legacy of Mr. Nixon’s Saturday Night Massacre.

What wasn’t said

For all her candour on Wednesday, Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s reprieve from solicitor-client privilege only went so far. Mr. Trudeau’s order-in-council only covered her time as justice minister, so her timeline of events ends with her exit from the job. Ahead of her testimony, she wrote to the justice committee’s chair, Anthony Housefather, saying she was disappointed that she couldn’t address events after that:

[The order-in-council] addresses only my time as attorney-general of Canada and therefore does nothing to release me from any restrictions that apply to communications while I served as minister of veterans affairs and in relation to my resignation from that post or my presentation to cabinet after I had resigned.

How Trudeau responded

Open this photo in gallery Mr. Trudeau speaks at a media availability in Montreal on Feb. 27, 2019. Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press

Mr. Trudeau wasn’t in Ottawa during Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s committee hearing, instead going to Montreal soon after an appearance in Question Period. Afterward, Mr. Trudeau told a late news conference that he “completely disagreed” with Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s version of events, that neither he nor his staff had done anything wrong and that he had faith in an investigation of the matter by the Ethics Commissioner. Asked if he would resign, he said Canadians would get a choice in October’s federal election about who should lead the nation.

How the opposition responded

After Wednesday’s hearing, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said Mr. Trudeau had lost moral authority to govern and should step down. On Thursday he wrote to the head of the RCMP asking for an investigation. Meanwhile, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh called for a public inquiry and condemned the Prime Minister for appearing to side with “rich corporations who need favours.”

How Indigenous people responded

Ms. Wilson-Raybould – whose traditional name, Puglaas, means “a woman born to noble people” in the Kwak’wala language – is descended from the Musgamagw Tsawataineuk and Laich-Kwil-Tach peoples of British Columbia. When she got the justice minister job in 2015, she was the first Indigenous woman to hold the post, and identified with a traditional role – Hiligaxste, or One Who Corrects the Chiefs’ Path – in her career as a lawyer and politician. She acknowledged that cultural heritage again in the conclusion to her Wednesday testimony:

I come from a long line of matriarchs and I am a truth teller in accordance with the laws and traditions of our Big House – this is who I am and who I will always be. Gilakas’la / Thank you.

Afterward, Indigenous leaders across the country expressed support for her and anger at the Trudeau government. Here’s what Grand Chief Stewart Phillip of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs said:

It makes one more angry about how terribly she was treated, how she was coerced, how she was browbeaten. But at the same time, we’re elated that she’s been vindicated and has had an opportunity to speak her truth.

105,Empty,2019-02-28T14:49:47Z,His former attorney general detailed a campaign by Trudeau's office to quietly end a legal problem for an iconic Quebec construction firm.,"Justin Trudeau is facing the most explosive crisis of his administration after his former attorney general detailed a months-long campaign by the Canadian prime minister’s office to quietly end a legal problem for an iconic Quebec construction firm.

In dramatic testimony that lasted nearly four hours, Jody Wilson-Raybould broke her silence with a detailed account of efforts by Trudeau and top aides to persuade her to step in and end prosecution of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. She argues it amounted to interference in the judicial system, though concedes it wasn’t illegal, while Trudeau says he was trying to prevent job losses in his home province of Quebec.

“I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere,” the former attorney general said Wednesday afternoon. Wilson-Raybould, who quit cabinet this month, also said she faced “veiled threats” about what might happen if she refused to order an out-of-court settlement.

Her testimony shook the core of the Trudeau’s team, naming him, his finance chief and his most senior aides. The Conservative leader trying to unseat Trudeau in this fall’s election called for his resignation, but the prime minister stood his ground and rejected Wilson-Raybould’s version of events.

The public airing of grievances will inflame the scandal, which has driven the governing Liberals lower in national polls. The ordeal dredges up ghosts of the party’s past, which is marked by hand-in-glove ties with corporate Canada — particularly in Quebec. The political fallout, however, is difficult to predict. Trudeau’s path to re-election runs through the largely French-speaking province, where his defense of SNC-Lavalin is being applauded.

“I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,” Trudeau said Wednesday night in Montreal, where he was celebrating a Liberal Party by-election victory. “Our government will always focus on jobs and our economy.”

SNC-Lavalin had been pushing for what’s known as a deferred prosecution agreement to end a criminal case dating back more than a decade, related to corruption charges. The company’s stock plunged the most in six years Oct. 10 when it revealed that the Public Prosecution Service of Canada ruled out a negotiated settlement that would have staved off a trial. Settling out of court would also help the company, which employs about 9,000 people in Canada, avoid a ban on bidding for federal government contracts.

Wilson-Raybould pulled back the curtain on the effort to change that decision and help the company, in testimony that was aired on national television in its entirety. She spoke to lawmakers only after Trudeau waived privilege to allow her to do so, and believes she wasn’t even legally able to intervene.

She said the prime minister and his aides wanted to end the case in part to prevent the company’s relocation — and also to avoid electoral fallout for both the federal Liberals and the party’s provincial wing. Wilson-Raybould said she resisted intervening because she wanted to uphold the principle of judicial independence and the rule of law, but officials ignored her repeated instructions to stop raising the issue.

The former attorney-general identified a series of phone calls and meetings between her or her staff, and Trudeau or several of his top advisers. They include chief of staff Katie Telford; former principal secretary Gerald Butts, who resigned this month; and senior aides Mathieu Bouchard and Elder Marques. She also cited communications with Finance Minister Bill Morneau and his chief of staff Ben Chin.

One of the meetings was with Trudeau himself, in September. “The prime minister raised the issue immediately. The prime minister asked me to help out, to find a solution here for SNC,” Wilson-Raybould said. She said she’d told him she had made up her mind.

“The prime minister again cited the potential loss of jobs and SNC moving,” while also stressing that he represents an electoral district in Quebec. She said Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, the country’s top bureaucrat, also warned her the company “will likely be moving to London” without her intervention.

Discussions continued. Wilson-Raybould said Bouchard at one point said bluntly: “We can have the best policy in the world but we need to get re-elected.”

She met Butts in December in Ottawa, and was already frustrated by what she called “the barrage of people hounding me and my staff.” She pushed back. “I raised how I needed everybody to stop talking to me about SNC, as I had made up my mind and that the engagements were inappropriate.”

She read a text-message conversation with her chief of staff, Jessica Prince, who was relaying a conversation with Butts and Telford. Wilson-Raybould said Prince was told by Butts “there is no solution here that does not involve some interference.” She said Prince told her Telford said: “We don’t want to debate legalities anymore.”

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, who is Trudeau’s top rival, demanded the prime minister step down over the revelations. Jagmeet Singh, leader of the third-place New Democratic Party, called for a full public inquiry.

Wilson-Raybould was ultimately moved in a cabinet shuffle last month, before the scandal broke. Trudeau at first sought to downplay it by saying Wilson-Raybould’s presence in cabinet should speak for itself. She resigned the next day.

To be sure, she said she didn’t believe Trudeau or his aides broke the law, but that their interventions were inappropriate. Wilson-Raybould also said no one ever flatly directed her to intervene. Trudeau has echoed that. The former attorney general said she didn’t think it was inappropriate to discuss the potential of job losses early on, but became inappropriate to continually do it, and to raise the political ramifications of the situation.

SNC-Lavalin has said it’s no longer focused on getting a remediation agreement, but instead on fighting the case. It’s also facing legal proceedings that allege it delayed disclosing that it would not get an offer of a deferred prosecution agreement, from Sept. 4 to Oct. 10. SNC-Lavalin said Wednesday the prosecutor’s “final decision” was only made Oct. 9.

The party, founded last fall by former Conservative leadership contender Maxime Bernier, captured some 11 per cent of the vote in the Vancouver-area riding of Burnaby South but failed to make much of a splash among voters in the rural Ontario riding of York—Simcoe or the urban Montreal-area riding of Outremont where the party had less than 2 per cent of the final tally.

Bernier tweeted early Tuesday that the poor Ontario and Quebec numbers were ""disappointing"" and said he ""expected more"" from those ridings while praising the more favourable Burnaby result as ""great.""

""Our party was born only 5 months ago!"" Bernier wrote. ""This is only the beginning of our journey. We are in it for the long haul ... Let's work even harder now to find the best candidates and be ready for the general election.""

3/ We are addressing crucial issues the other parties won’t touch.<br><br>We have the clearest principles and the best platform. <br><br>There is no alternative. <br><br>CANADA NEEDS US.<br><br>Let’s work even harder now to find the best candidates and be ready for the general election. —@MaximeBernier

Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson, a former Christian talk show host who had some name recognition before launching her candidacy, was tapped by Bernier to represent the People's Party in Burnaby South. She delivered the best result of the night for the new political outfit.

While she was a source of controversy because of some past remarks, Thompson peeled away enough votes from the more established parties to place fourth overall.

Thompson, whose slogan was of ""Canada for Canadians,"" ran a decidedly populist campaign for Parliament. Thompson has said her base was heavily comprised of evangelical Chinese-Canadian churchgoers in the diverse B.C. riding.

The comparatively strong showing by Thompson — in a riding ultimately won by NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh — appeared to cut in to the Conservative party's results in that riding.

Conservative Burnaby candidate, Jay Shin, captured about 23 per cent of the vote — five points less than what the previous Conservative candidate there managed to achieve in the 2015 federal election. Shin placed third behind Singh and Liberal candidate Richard T. Lee.

In central Canada, meanwhile, the People's Party proved to be a marginal political force.

For example, in York—Simcoe, Ont., People's Party candidate Robert Geurts, a criminal defence lawyer, placed a distant sixth out of nine candidates.

Geurts, best known for his past role as a prosecutor during the Paul Bernardo trial, was even outpaced by Dorian Baxter a candidate for the minor centre-right PC Party, an entity with a name similar to the now-defunct Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.

Scot Davidson ultimately held the rural seat for the Conservative party with a 20-point margin over Liberal Shaun Tanaka.

Fewer than 20 per cent of registered voters in York—Simcoe bothered to vote in Monday's contest.

Even before the results were finalized, Bernier tweeted Monday that volunteers should be proud of what they accomplished so soon after the party was founded.

""The hundreds of volunteers who helped our candidates in Burnaby South, York–Simcoe and Outremont can be proud of what they achieved. They blazed a trail that thousands of others will follow across the country in October,"" he said.

In Outremont, People's Party candidate James Seale, a Canadian Army veteran, also failed to post a result better than 2 per cent of the vote.

Seale was a member of the armed forces for more than 30 years, and served overseas stints in Israel, Germany, Haiti and Bosnia before later becoming a military instructor and civil servant.

He said he was attracted to the party because of Bernier's promise to increase investment in Canada's defence.

While Bernier's party disappointed in the Quebec riding, Green party candidate Daniel Green placed third — among the party's best ever showing in la belle province.

Green, the deputy leader of the Green Party of Canada, posted better numbers than Bloc Québécois candidate Michel Duchesne and Conservative candidate Jasmine Louras who placed fourth and fifth respectively in the riding that was last held by former NDP leader Tom Mulcair.

""The GPC has always been underestimated. But just watch us in October,"" Green tweeted Monday in reference to the forthcoming federal election.

While Mulcair won the riding by more than 11 points in the 2015 federal election, Liberal Rachel Bendayan easily captured the seat Monday outpacing NDP candidate Julia Sánchez by more than 15 points.",People's Party posts mixed-bag results after its first byelection test,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/people-s-party-mixed-bag-results-1.5033489

Now he’s trying to contain damage from his former justice minister’s accusations of improper pressure in a criminal case.,"OTTAWA — If Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had any thought that a burgeoning political scandal could be quietly contained, that hope vanished on Thursday, as Canadians dissected the explosive testimony from his former justice minister before a parliamentary committee.

“I don’t think I’ve ever seen a minister strafe her own government like this,” said Andrew MacDougall, who was the spokesman for Stephen Harper, the Conservative prime minister Mr. Trudeau replaced in 2015. “It just reinforces people’s perception that all politicians are kind of bent.”

During nearly four hours of testimony before the House of Commons justice committee on Wednesday evening, the former minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, repeatedly contradicted and undermined Mr. Trudeau’s assertions that neither he nor his staff acted improperly in trying to settle a criminal case against SNC-Lavalin, a multinational construction and engineering company based in Montreal.

The allegations by Jody Wilson-Raybould dramatically deepened the biggest crisis of Trudeau’s tenure just months ahead of an October election in which his Liberals face a tough fight.

Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee that she had confronted Trudeau over what she called inappropriate pressure to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc evade a corruption trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials.

Andrew Scheer, leader of the official opposition Conservative Party, demanded the resignation of what he called a disgraced prime minister. “He can no longer, with a clear conscience, continue to lead this nation,” Scheer told reporters, calling for police to immediately probe the matter. Trudeau is due to address reporters later on Wednesday.

Wilson-Raybould said officials imposed “consistent and sustained pressure” on her from September to December last year to ensure SNC-Lavalin pay a large fine rather than go to trial.

“In my view, these events constituted pressure to intervene in a matter and that this pressure, or political interference to intervene, was not appropriate,” she told the committee.

Wilson-Raybould, who named several senior officials in the offices of Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau, said under questioning from Liberal legislators that she did not feel the pressure on her had been illegal.

A Morneau spokesman denied the minister or his staff had ever pressured Wilson-Raybould when she was justice minister. Trudeau and other officials deny inappropriate pressure was put on Wilson-Raybould. But the case forced the resignation of Trudeau’s principal private secretary, Gerald Butts, earlier this month.

109,Empty,2019-02-27T11:00:00Z,It depends on the spectrum that voters use to assess his candidacy.,"Now consider a third framework for analyzing U.S. politics: a spectrum that runs from “most establishment” on one end to “most anti-establishment” on the other. For some Democrats, it will seem obvious that Sanders inhabits the latter pole, back on the left flank of the Democratic field, where he is seeking to rein in billionaires, corporations, and a hawkish military-industrial complex, via a mass movement funded by small donations from a big donor pool. Some of his supporters perceive him as the only credible reformist outsider.

But other Democrats more prone to judging individuals based on their immutable traits see Sanders as yet another old, straight, cisgender white man seeking an office held by similarly privileged sorts for most of U.S. history.

That renders him more “establishment” in their view than a black woman like Kamala Harris, who represents progress in terms of diversity and representation, even if she substantively exacerbated the injustices that the carceral state inflicts on the wrongly accused, arguably harming people at the bottom of socioeconomic and racial hierarchies more than any other candidate.

In sum, one cannot draw any easy conclusions about how Democrats will understand Sanders’s candidacy—or assess his chances of beating President Donald Trump—merely by knowing whether they want a more centrist or leftist party.

While I’m an independent, not a Democrat, I don’t know where I personally stand on Sanders. Perhaps my uncertainty can further illuminate relevant complications.

I value Sanders’s opposition to corporate rent-seeking, his anti-war credentials, and his universalist approach to our wonderfully diverse democracy, while I dislike the ideological socialism that caused a younger, hopefully more naive Sanders to praise murderous regimes in Cuba and Nicaragua and to spin Sandinista bread lines as a sign of economic health, as Michael Moynihan documents. (“Vermont could set an example to the rest of the nation similar to the type of example Nicaragua is setting for the rest of Latin America,” Sanders once declared.)

The most indefensible of his bygone comments didn’t stop me from preferring an older, hopefully wiser Sanders to Hillary Clinton in 2016—the least defensible parts of her record included support for catastrophic wars in Iraq and Libya. While the next president will be unnervingly free to start wars of choice abroad without securing the lawfully required permission from Congress, he or she has no chance of imposing anything close to “democratic socialism.”

Still, I want to see Sanders grapple with the occasions when he has prioritized his commitment to socialism above his commitment to civil liberties. And I want him pressed on what Kmele Foster smartly flagged as the most interesting line in the speech when he announced his 2020 candidacy: “We are the wealthiest nation in the history of the world,” Sanders declared in order to highlight the unacceptability of U.S. failures to provide for the least well-off.",Is Bernie Sanders a Leftist or a Moderate?,Theatlantic.com,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/sanders-democrats/583519/

That’s the kind of leader Canada needs, he told Star Vancouver.

Maxime Bernier, leader of the new People’s Party of Canada, meets supporters on Thursday at an event prior to Monday’s federal byelection in Burnaby, B.C. ( Jesse Winter / Star Metro )

Bernier announced the “death of political correctness” via a Tweet last fall to his then 65,000 followers and launched the People’s Party of Canada, which has been gaining rapid traction. Widely viewed as aiming further right of the Conservative party, the PPC has been criticized for being anti-immigrant and espousing anti-globalist values and rhetoric. But Pak, a first-generation immigrant from China, dispels those critiques as myths. “Some people accuse the PPC of being a white people’s party of Canada, but for myself ... I learned to speak English here. I’ve been here 22 years,” he said on Thursday, holding up PPC signs waiting for Bernier to make his first appearance in Burnaby South since Monday’s byelection was called in the riding.

“PPC welcomes people like me to be part of their party as long as we share the same Canadian values.” But experts say core Canadian values are now divided and there’s very little common ground. Michael Valpy is a senior fellow in public policy at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy and a former Globe and Mail journalist who has been tracking the rise of ordered populism in Canada — or what economists refer to as “drawbridge-up” thinking.

Allen, a former member of the BC Liberals, says he was disillusioned with politics for years until Maxime Bernier's party came along. ( Jesse Winter / Star Vancouver )

Its proponents are often hostile toward immigration, deeply pessimistic about their economic future, mostly male and mainly white, he said. At Bernier’s event on Thursday in Burnaby South, this demographic was also present. Nathaniel Allen, 30, told the Star he was a BC Liberal — the provincial party widely known to embrace conservative policies — 12 years ago until he lost interest. It wasn’t until the PPC came along that he found himself civically engaged.

“It just felt like the most pragmatic decision I could make,” he explained. Read more:

How Canadian populism is playing out in the Burnaby South byelection Burnaby South People’s Party of Canada candidate alleges Conservative Party is ‘smearing’ her Liberal candidate’s WeChat post draws criticism for singling out race of byelection opponent Jagmeet Singh A Star investigation found that far-right supporters have called on their members to infiltrate the PPC, whether the party is willing or not. As the extreme right has done elsewhere, they hope to move on a new party, bit by bit, to bring the political extreme toward the mainstream. Meanwhile, the yellow vest faction — which started as a labour movement in France but has expanded in Canada beyond economic concerns, delving into anti-globalism, nationalism, anti-government sentiment and xenophobia — looks like it’s here to stay. Bernier was there to greet the United We Roll convoy when it arrived in Ottawa last Tuesday. The former federal Conservative cabinet minister, standing beside a man in a yellow vest, told the crowd he was there to promote Canadian unity. Canadians are increasingly opposed to more immigration — and it remains to be seen how that will play out in October’s federal election, Valpy said. Anti-immigrant sentiments often depend on the makeup of neighbourhoods, he added, pointing to the suburban area surrounding Toronto, known as the 905 because of its area code, which is “quite strongly” anti-immigrant despite not being a white majority community. That’s because if communities are homogenous — for instance, predominantly white, brown or Asian — anti-immigrant views can emerge. However, Valpy said, if neighbourhoods are mixed, anti-immigrant views are unlikely. “Ethnic attachment is declining and has declined quite rapidly,” he explained in an interview, citing data from Ottawa-based pollster EKOS Research Associates. “It’s no longer important to us that all our friends are all white, or we live in a brown community.” Valpy said unless there is some shift in inequality or people’s sense that progress is lost, ordered populism is here for the long haul. According to Ivan Pak and the PPC, the principles guiding Canadian values are freedom, personal responsibility, respect and fairness. Pak was a vocal opponent of the provincial education inclusion program for sexual identity and gender fluidity. He ran unsuccessfully on that platform for school trustee in Richmond in last fall’s municipal election. As president of the PPC Richmond Centre EDA, he isn’t eligible to vote in Monday’s byelection. The PPC has promised to lower taxes, abolish corporate welfare and stop supply management. On Thursday, Bernier also said he would privatize Canada Post and abolish the CRTC. The party has formed electoral district associations in all of Canada’s 338 ridings and Bernier has said he will run a full slate of candidates in October’s general election.

Pak said he was no longer keen on the Conservatives because the party has a “lack of leadership ability” (referring to its leader, Andrew Scheer) and “no clean platform.” He also slammed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. “When you ask a question in the House of Commons, he never answers it. Is the question period just a joke? It looks like drama,” he said. “Our country is in debt and that debt has to be paid somehow. It will be my children and grandchildren suffering.” Pak was one of many other Chinese-Canadians greeting Bernier when he visited his Burnaby South byelection candidate — and one of his first picks under the new PPC banner — Laura-Lynn Thompson. She is a former Christian radio host, anti-abortion activist and a vocal opponent of B.C.’s student education plan on sexual orientation and gender fluidity, with ties to several community churches. Thompson told the Star last week she’s been able to mobilize the socially conservative Chinese-Canadian vote — and those ties may explain why. During each byelection debate, Thompson directly appealed to prevalent anxieties in the riding about public safety as she repeatedly brought up the case of Marrisa Shen, a 13-year-old girl killed in a Burnaby South park in July 2017. A Syrian refugee has been charged with murder in her death.

Meanwhile, several PPC supporters at the event on Thursday told the Star they were “sick” of identity politics at play in Canada. Sherolinnah Eang said she became a full-fledged PPC supporter after hearing the messaging about “family values and free speech.” “This is the first time I’ve come out for something like this, and I’ve lived in Canada for 45 years,” she said. Burnaby has four distinct town “centres,” a long working-class history and a population density triple that of the region. Its demographics are increasingly young and non-white, according to the 2016 census, and the average age is several years below B.C.’s average, while 64 per cent of its population identifies as a visible minority. On Thursday, Bernier argued diversity is not Canada’s strength — it’s unity. Asked how that message would land in such an ethnically diverse riding, he responded: “Yes, but they are Canadians first.” The response prompted cheers from PPC supporters, with several shouting: “I’m an immigrant.” Thompson, who uttered “Canadians first” at every byelection debate, will face off against federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh — vying for his first seat in the House of Commons — Liberal Richard Lee, Conservative Jay Shin and independents Valentine Wu and Terry Grimwood on Monday in Burnaby South. Byelections will also be held that day in York—Simcoe, Ont. and in Outremont, Que. David Moscrop, author of the new book Too Dumb for Democracy? Why We Make Bad Political Decisions and How We Can Make Better Ones, and a post-doctoral fellow in the University of Ottawa’s communications department, told the Star that while feelings of anti-globalism and xenophobia have always existed, they haven’t always had an electoral home. Moscrop said this is the perfect time for the PPC to do well because it can focus on locking down a smaller segment of the electorate. And there’s enough disaffection, which could express itself as support for the right-wing party. “This party didn’t even exist 15 minutes ago, so if (Laura-Lynn Thompson) can nab even 10 per cent, Bernier will be crowing for months,” he said. “I wouldn’t be surprised if there are more likely PPC voters than would self-report ... because sometimes people won’t admit something to a pollster. But behind the privacy of the voting screen? Many may mark an X for that candidate.” Melanie Green is a Vancouver-based reporter covering food, culture and policy.

The remarks by Jody Wilson-Raybould, made during almost four hours of sometimes dramatic testimony to the House of Commons justice committee, deepened the worst crisis of Trudeau’s tenure months before an October election.

Wilson-Raybould said she had confronted Trudeau over what she said were persistent efforts by officials to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc evade trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials.

“I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,” Trudeau told a televised news conference in Montreal.

“I therefore completely disagree with (Wilson-Raybould’s) characterization of events,” he added, brushing off a demand from Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer that he step down.

The case forced the resignation of Trudeau’s principal private secretary, Gerald Butts, earlier this month.

Wilson-Raybould said officials imposed “consistent and sustained pressure” on her from September to December last year to ensure SNC-Lavalin pay a large fine rather than go to trial.

“This pressure, or political interference to intervene, was not appropriate,” she said, adding that some officials had made veiled threats unless she cooperated.

The head of the federal civil service, she said, told her that Trudeau would “find a way to get it done one way or another. So, he is in that kind (of) mood and I wanted you to be aware of that.”

Wilson-Raybould said those exchanges prompted her to think of the so-called Saturday Night Massacre of 1973, when the U.S. attorney general and his top deputy quit rather than obey an order from President Richard Nixon to fire an investigator probing the Watergate scandal.

She added, however, under questioning from Liberal legislators that she did not feel the pressure on her had been illegal.

Wilson-Raybould was unexpectedly demoted in January and resigned from the Cabinet this month. She said she was convinced the SNC-Lavalin case had prompted her demotion.

‘NEED TO FIND A SOLUTION’

SNC-Lavalin was seeking a so-called deferred prosecution agreement to allow the firm to escape with a fine. Wilson-Raybould had the power to scrap the decision to go to trial but decided against it. A trial is pending for the company.

SNC-Lavalin has said it had sought to avoid a trial because the executives accused of wrongdoing had left the company and it had overhauled its ethics and compliance systems.

SNC-Lavalin is based in the province of Quebec, where the Liberals have said they need to pick up seats to stand a chance of retaining a majority government.

Wilson-Raybould said officials cited the danger that the firm might cut jobs or move its headquarters out of Quebec if found guilty.

She cited several senior officials in the offices of Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau as among those weighing in. A Morneau spokesman denied the minister or his staff had ever pressured Wilson-Raybould.

Wilson-Raybould said that during a Sept. 17 meeting with Trudeau, he asked her “to find a solution” for SNC-Lavalin.

“I asked: ‘Are you politically interfering with my role? ... I would strongly advise against it.’ The prime minister said: ‘No, no, no, we just need to find a solution.’”

Trudeau told the news conference that “our government will always focus on jobs” and said officials had discussed the implications of SNC-Lavalin cutting its workforce.

Two United Steelworkers Union (USW) locals issued a news release Wednesday saying some steelworkers went to Bratina's Ottawa office to talk about worker benefits and pensions.

They say, in a letter sent to Bratina, that he shouted ""f--k the steelworkers"" and ""f--k those Stelco pensioners"" before ""demanding they leave [his] office"" and ""violently"" slamming the door behind them.

The union is demanding an apology from Bratina, a former mayor of Hamilton.

The Hamilton East-Stoney Creek MP didn't address the specific details, but he acknowledged the Tuesday meeting was tense.

In an emailed statement, Bratina said he met with the Canadian Labour Congress Tuesday, including members of the steelworker locals.

""During the course of this meeting, the conversation became personal,"" said Bratina, who chairs an all-party steel caucus.

""It was clear that a productive conversation was not going to take place and I ended the meeting. As they were leaving, I assured them that we would continue to work hard for steelworkers and their employers despite this meeting.""

USW Local 1005 president Gary Howe said the members questioned Bratina about bankruptcy and insolvency laws.

""When they asked him why he hasn't kept his promise to advocate on behalf of Hamilton steelworkers to get the laws changed, he lost his temper and started shouting obscenities and saying very nasty things about steelworkers,"" Howe said in a news release.

Tony Ciaramella, president of Local 5328, said in the release that the steelworkers asked ""a legitimate question.""

""Not once has he stood in the house and said anything about changing the laws and protecting current or retired steelworkers,"" Ciaramella said.

​In an email, Howe and Ciaramella demand that Bratina ""do the right thing and publicly apologize immediately and unreservedly.""

Current and retired steelworkers have faced a wave of uncertainty in recent years. That wave has included recent tariffs imposed by the Trump administration in the U.S. that had some fearing for their jobs. In 2016, U.S. Steel Canada went into Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) protection, and steelworker pensioners' health-care benefits were temporarily paused.

Bratina, like other Hamilton MPs, campaigned on helping steelworkers, and has attended rallies both as an MP and when he was mayor of Hamilton.

Bratina said in the email that he respects unions, which ""play a key role in upholding the rights and protections of Canadian workers.""

""Canada's labour movement has led the way on work-life balance, safe working conditions and employment equity and diversity. Our government shares many of the same values and beliefs as the labour movement, and we need to continue working together to build on the success of the past three years.""

Scott Duvall, NDP MP for Hamilton Mountain, also serves on the all-party steel caucus. He's also a retired steelworker who recently introduced Bill 384, which would see pensioners become secure creditors when a company liquidates.

Duvall said news of the clash between Bratina and the steelworkers rippled through a Canadian Labour Congress social he attended.

""When I heard it, I was shocked,"" he said.

Duvall served on Hamilton city council when Bratina was mayor, he said, and ""he's had a few outbursts before.""

David Sweet, Conservative MP for Flamborough-Glanbrook, is vice-chair of the caucus.

He agrees more needs to be done for steelworkers and pensioners, although he wants to see a ""full hearing"" into the three acts that impact pensions.

He declined to comment on the incident. ""I'll let Mr. Bratina defend himself on that.""

The former federal justice minister told the Commons justice committee yesterday that she faced ""veiled threats"" from the Prime Minister's Office this fall to ensure the Montreal-based company avoided prosecution on bribery and corruption charges.

In her testimony, Wilson-Raybould said officials repeatedly invoked potential job losses, and the context of the recent Quebec election, as reasons for offering a deferred prosecution agreement to SNC-Lavalin.

Premier François Legault, whose Coalition Avenir Québec party swept to power in that election, reiterated Thursday his support for an out-of-court settlement.

Legault campaigned on a promise to do more to keep Quebec companies from leaving the province. Since the election, he has said repeatedly that a protracted court case could make SNC-Lavalin vulnerable to a foreign takeover.

""There was already a risk. Is the risk heightened now? Yes,"" Legault told reporters in Quebec City. ""The company currently has no controlling shareholder.""

Premier François Legault reiterated on Thursday his support for an out-of-court settlement. (Jacques Boissinot/Canadian Press)

But Legault's own justice minister, former anti-corruption prosecutor Sonia Lebel, said her main concern was Wilson-Raybould's allegations of political interference.

""If what was said is true, it's troubling because we have to put our institutions [first], to protect them, and make sure there is no undue pressure,"" Lebel said.

""What is troubling is that it may have happened.""

Lebel pledged to never interfere with the decisions of the provincial prosecutors working under her. Court documents indicate they too could be called upon soon to decide whether to prosecute SNC-Lavalin.

The RCMP is working with the Quebec Crown in an ongoing investigation into a bribery scandal at the Federal Bridge Corporation.

Michel Fournier, the former head of the bridge corporation, pleaded guilty in 2017 to receiving $2.3 million from an SNC subsidiary between 2001 and 2003. Fournier admitted that, in exchange, he helped SNC-Lavalin secure a $127-million contract to refurbish Montreal's Jacques Cartier Bridge.

""I have no intention whatsoever to intervene in this matter,"" Lebel said. ""The rule of law is very important and we all live under it.""

'Why should I not believe her​?'

Wilson-Raybould's testimony also elicited mixed reactions on the other side of the aisle. At least two Liberal MNAs pointed out that the federal Liberal Party is a separate entity from its provincial namesake.

""Why should I not believe her,"" said Marwah Rizqy, who represents the Montreal riding of Saint-Laurent and who ran unsuccessfully for the federal Liberals in the 2015 election.

""If she said she faced pressure, then now the prime minister of Canada has to answer for that.""

Her colleague Gaétan Barrette, though, sounded more sympathetic to Justin Trudeau's position.

""I can say one thing: If I would have been in his place, the issue of maintaining those jobs would have been very significant for me,"" said Barrette, a cabinet minister in the last Liberal government.

He also pointed out that Wilson-Raybould herself said nothing illegal had been done, a detail he felt was being lost amid the controversy.

Trudeau, who disputed Wilson-Raybould’s allegations and rejected an opposition call that he resign, got the support on Thursday of a top ally inside his Cabinet, indicating there was no immediate pressure inside his Liberal Party to oust him over the scandal.

SNC-Lavalin has about 9,000 employees in Canada, including about 3,400 in the province of Quebec, where the Liberals say they need to pick up seats in a federal election this October to stand a chance of retaining a majority government.

Here are some key facts about the case and the company at the center of the controversy.

WHAT IS SNC-LAVALIN’S INVOLVEMENT?

Montreal-based construction and engineering firm SNC-Lavalin was charged in 2015 by the Public Prosecution Service of Canada with bribing Libyan officials to influence the awarding of contracts between 2001 and 2011.

The company had tried unsuccessfully to avoid trial, arguing instead for a negotiated settlement since it had cleaned shop by changing executives and overhauling its ethics and compliance systems in recent years. The preliminary hearings in the case are ongoing, SNC-Lavalin spokeswoman Daniela Pizzuto said on Thursday.

Neil Bruce, who took over as SNC-Lavalin’s chief executive in 2015 and led its C$3.6 billion ($2.7 billion) acquisition of British engineering and consultancy WS Atkins two years later, said the firm had done “nothing wrong” in the political crisis. and that “we have never asked for charges to be dropped.”

WHAT IS AT STAKE?

Canadian government officials said they were concerned about the potential for job losses, especially in the predominantly French-speaking province of Quebec.

“The consequences for the economy are always very important and my staff are always talking to other people in government to ensure that we consider the need to protect jobs,” Finance Minister Bill Morneau told reporters on Thursday.

Wilson-Raybould told a hearing on Wednesday that officials in the offices of Trudeau and Morneau had cited the risk of SNC-Lavalin cutting jobs or moving its headquarters out of Quebec if found guilty. The company faces being barred from bidding on Canadian contracts for 10 years.

In 2016, SNC-Lavalin admitted that some former executives had illegally arranged donations of more than C$80,000 to the Liberals from 2004 to 2011.

The company is also facing pressures on its bottom line as an August 2018 dispute between Canada and Saudi Arabia weighs on its contracts in the Middle East kingdom. SNC-Lavalin also wrote down C$1.2 billion in oil and gas assets, which resulted in a C$1.6 billion fourth-quarter loss.

COMPANY SNAPSHOT

The company generated total revenue of C$10 billion ($7.6 billion) in 2018. About 10 percent of total revenues came from Saudi Arabia. It employed 52,435 at the end of December, with over 15 percent working in Saudi Arabia.

As of year’s end 2018, SNC-Lavalin reported a total backlog of C$14.9 billion and had $634.1 million of cash and cash equivalents.",Factbox: Political storm engulfing Canada's Trudeau puts SNC-Lavalin in focus,Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-politics-snc-lavalin-factbox-idUSKCN1QH2ZT
115,Empty,2019-02-26T09:00:00Z,"Scheer ought to have made a distinction between his support for Canadian oil workers, and support for the racism and violence that has been associated with United We Roll.","Many of the participants in last week's United We Roll convoy said they were there to unite Canadians around a pipeline. Others had more specific goals: to see the Liberal government cancel bills C-69 and C-48, which critics charge will act as enormous industry obstacles.

But as several observers noted watching the convoy make its way to Ottawa from Alberta, United We Roll had also become a space for far-right groups to spew racism and xenophobia. Signs denouncing open borders, protesting Canada signing on to the global migration pact and accusing the prime minister of treason hung alongside signs supporting pipelines. Some convoy participants wore hats that said ""Make Canada Great Again,"" a nod to U.S. President Donald Trump's slogan that has become associated with denigrating Mexicans, asylum seekers and banning Muslims from entering the U.S.

Because the convoy has become affiliated with such unsettling rhetoric, unwavering support from high-profile Conservative politicians — such as Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, who addressed the group last week — is troubling, and could potentially hurt the party's chances in the upcoming fall election.

Tapping into frustration

It's clear why Conservative politicians would want to support the rally. With seemingly endless controversy swirling around Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his role in pressuring (or not) former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould over SNC-Lavalin, the Conservatives surely want to seize the opportunity to marry new political scandal with longstanding frustration over pipeline inertia. And with Maxime Bernier trying to make inroads with the further right areas of the party's base, Conservatives need to show unwavering support for western Canada, pipelines and the oil and gas industry.

But Scheer ought to have made a distinction between his support for Canadian oil workers, and support for the racism and violence that has been associated with United We Roll. Conservative Senator David Tkachuk even told the crowd to ""roll over"" Liberals across the country, and he has since refused to apologize.

The rally has also been associated with Yellow Vests Canada, a group whose Facebook page is rife with racist and xenophobic views, particularly towards Muslims and immigrants. In fact, the United We Roll convoy was originally named the Yellow Vest Convoy, but was changed due to the obviously problematic association.

Members of the Yellow Vests Canada Facebook group have advocated for MP Iqra Khalid to be deported, called visible minorities sub-human and scum, and made death threats against the prime minister. Despite that, United We Roll lead organizer Glen Carritt implied that everyone would be welcome to attend (""It doesn't matter — you can wear a yellow vest, or blue coveralls or black hardhat or suit and tie,"" he said) and Yellow Vest organizer Mark Friesen was indeed in attendance.

One of the speakers at the rally was Faith Goldy, who was fired from Rebel Media after appearing on a neo-Nazi podcast, and who regularly bemoans the erosion of ""white identity."" Scheer spoke on the same platform that she did, ignoring what should be a toxic association.

On Tuesday a convoy of trucks arrived in Ottawa. The rolling protest is driven by Canadians who want pipelines, hate carbon taxes and are calling for more help for the Alberta economy. But there is another element: some in the group have also been protesting immigration and using hateful, racist, language. Today on Front Burner, CBC's David Common and Rosemary Barton explain the complicated politics around this protest. 25:58

With recent polls showing the Conservatives are in a position to form government, the party needs to start clarifying what, exactly, it stands for.

Before the last federal election in 2015, Conservatives were riding high in the polls and a renewed government was within reach. But in late September and early October, the Conservatives doubled-down on their previous decision to ban the niqab in citizenship ceremonies and pledged to implement a tip line for ""barbaric cultural practices."" Almost a week after this announcement, Conservatives declined in the polls and never recovered.

The unwillingness to address — or even acknowledge — these racist and xenophobic undercurrents in United We Roll plays right into progressive messaging that the party is too cozy with the far-right. It also puts the party at risk of alienating centrists in swing ridings who would otherwise be open to voting for Conservatives, but are hesitant to align themselves with a party that refuses to even acknowledge (never mind denounce) hateful views.

Scheer could have spoken at the United We Roll rally by telling protestors he supports their efforts with regards to the oil and gas industry, while simultaneously chastising the bigoted rhetoric. (Chris Wattie/Reuters)

It could also point to an absence of political courage. During the presidential election in 2008, Republican John McCain defended Barack Obama against racist questions from audience members during a town hall event. Scheer could just as easily have spoken at the United We Roll rally by telling protestors he supports their efforts with regards to the oil and gas industry, while simultaneously chastising the racist and xenophobic rhetoric that was circulating.

Instead, Scheer simply stated: ""We're standing with you.""

That made it easy for critics to paint Conservatives as bowing to pressures of the far-right. The question for Canadians now becomes, are the Conservatives out of touch, or willfully ignoring this rhetoric? And if elected prime minister, would Scheer remain silent if people continue to publicly spew this hate?

The Conservatives' failure to draw a line in the sand between legitimate grievances about the oil and gas industry and illegitimate grievances about immigrants, Muslims and minorities will ultimately hamper the party's ability to reconnect with voters in diverse urban and suburban communities across the country. Voters they will desperately need to win October's election.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The leader of Canada's main opposition party demanded on Wednesday that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau quit after a former justice minister said government officials inappropriately pressured her to help a major firm avoid a bribery trial.

The allegations by Jody Wilson-Raybould dramatically deepened the biggest crisis of Trudeau's tenure just months ahead of an October election in which his Liberals face a tough fight.

Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee that she had confronted Trudeau over what she called inappropriate pressure to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc evade a corruption trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials.

Andrew Scheer, leader of the official opposition Conservative Party, demanded the resignation of what he called a disgraced prime minister.

""He can no longer, with a clear conscience, continue to lead this nation,"" Scheer told reporters, calling for police to immediately probe the matter. Trudeau is due to address reporters later on Wednesday.

Wilson-Raybould said officials imposed ""consistent and sustained pressure"" on her from September to December last year to ensure SNC-Lavalin pay a large fine rather than go to trial.

""In my view, these events constituted pressure to intervene in a matter and that this pressure, or political interference to intervene, was not appropriate,"" she told the committee.

Wilson-Raybould, who named several senior officials in the offices of Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau, said under questioning from Liberal legislators that she did not feel the pressure on her had been illegal.

A Morneau spokesman denied the minister or his staff had ever pressured Wilson-Raybould when she was justice minister.

Trudeau and other officials deny inappropriate pressure was put on Wilson-Raybould. But the case forced the resignation of Trudeau's principal private secretary, Gerald Butts, earlier this month.

Opinion polls show the affair is starting to hurt the Liberals ahead of what looks set to be a tightly contested federal election in October.

Ex-justice minister and ex-attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould called it ""incredibly inappropriate"" but said she didn't think it was illegal because she wasn't instructed to seek a settlement. She said 11 people tried to interfere in her prosecutorial discretion including Trudeau.

In a meeting with Trudeau, the prime minister raised the issue and asked her to ""help out"" with the case, she said.

Wilson-Raybould said she asked Trudeau if he was politically interfering with her role as attorney general and told him she would strongly advise against it.

""No, no, no. We just need to find a solution,"" she said Trudeau responded.

She said Trudeau told her that if Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin didn't get a deferred prosecution there would be jobs lost and the company would move its headquarters from Montreal to London and noted he was a lawmaker from Quebec. Wilson-Raybould said she was ""barraged"" and subjected to ""hounding"" by members of the government.

Trudeau disputed her view of events.

""I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally, and therefore I completely disagree with the characterization of the former attorney general about these events,"" he said at a news conference.

Trudeau said the decision on whether to forgo prosecution and enter a plea agreement with the company was hers and hers alone.

He also welcomed the investigation of the ethics commissioner while he rejected calls by the leader of the opposition Conservative Party to resign, saying Canadians will have a choice later this year in parliamentary elections.

""My job as prime minister is to stand up for jobs. I have done that and will continue to do that. That is a fundamental role of a Canadian prime minister,"" Trudeau said.

Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer also said police should investigate and called Trudeau a disgraced prime minister. Jagmeet Singh, leader of the opposition NDP, said there should be a public inquiry but stopped short of calling for Trudeau to step down.

""He may need to resign because of this,"" he said. ""What we heard today was explosive.""

Trudeau's government has been on the defensive since the Globe and Mail newspaper reported Feb. 7 that Trudeau or his staff pressured her to try to avoid a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin over allegations of corruption involving government contracts in Libya. Critics say that would be improper political meddling in a legal case.

""For a period of approximately four months, between September and December of 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the attorney general of Canada,"" she told a Parliament justice committee.

The scandal has been a significant blow to Trudeau, who is facing an election this year.

Gerald Butts, Trudeau's closet adviser, resigned last week but denied that he or anyone else pressured Wilson-Raybould. Michael Wernick, the top civil servant in the government, has also said that no inappropriate pressure was put on Wilson-Raybould.

Wilson-Raybould resigned from the Cabinet on Feb. 12 as veteran affairs minister but gave no reasons. She had been unexpectedly demoted from justice minister last month, and was furious, releasing a 2,000-word statement after that.

""I was concerned I was shuffled because of a decision I would not take with SNC, I raised those concerns with the PM,"" she said. ""Those concerns were denied.""

Wilson-Raybould compared the situation to President Richard Nixon's ""Saturday Night Massacre"" firing of the independent special prosecutor overseeing the Watergate investigation in 1973.

The Globe and Mail's report this month said Trudeau's office pressured her to instruct the director of public prosecutions to negotiate a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin. The agreement would have allowed the company to pay reparations but avoid a criminal trial on charges of corruption and bribery.

With the sound defeat of his five opponents, the New Democratic Party leader put to rest murmurs within his party that a defeat at the polls could throw the NDP into a leadership crisis scant months from the next federal election.

“My friends, it’s a new day. It’s a new day,” Singh told jubilant supporters at a Hilton hotel in Burnaby during his victory speech.

“Guess what? We just told a lot of kids out there that yes, you can.”

Singh, a former lawyer who had served as a provincial politician in Ontario, became the first member of a visible minority to lead a national political party in Canada when he won the NDP leadership in 2017, but Monday’s byelection gives him his first seat in the House of Commons.

Singh’s victory was marred by the NDP’s loss in Outremont, the Montreal riding that served as a launching pad for the orange wave that swept Quebec in 2011.

Lawyer Rachel Bendayan reclaimed the riding for the Liberals with 42 per cent of the vote, even as the governing party struggles with the fallout from allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office improperly pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to halt criminal proceedings against Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

In a third byelection Monday, the Conservatives handily hung on to the Ontario riding of York-Simcoe, which had been held since 2004 by former Conservative cabinet minister Peter Van Loan. Scot Davidson took 53 per cent of the vote for the Tories, well ahead of Liberal Shaun Tanaka with 30 per cent.

Singh jumped out to an early lead and never looked back, finishing with about 39 per cent of the vote, beating Liberal candidate Richard T. Lee who finished second with about 26 per cent. Conservative Jay Shin finished in third place with roughly 23 per cent, while Laura-Lynn Thompson finished fourth with about 11 per cent, running with the People’s Party of Canada, the nascent party launched last year by failed federal Conservative leadership candidate Maxime Bernier. A pair of independent candidates, Terry Grimwood and Valentine Wu, rounded out the ballot.

Singh thanked his competitors for contributing to the democratic process.

Lee, speaking after his concession speech, said he didn’t think the SNC-Lavalin controversy had a major impact on the Burnaby byelection.

“I didn’t hear anything (about SNC-Lavalin) on the doorsteps,” Lee said. “All we heard was the local issues, and transportation, and how to support our young people so they can stay and work in our community. Those are the local issues, I believe, that are in people’s minds.”

Lee was a longtime MLA representing Burnaby North for the B.C. Liberals for four consecutive terms until he was defeated soundly in the 2017 provincial election, by the NDP’s Janet Routledge. He took over as the Liberal candidate from day-care operator and political hopeful Karen Wang, who bowed out after writing an online post that singled out Singh’s ethnicity.

Stakes were high for Singh and the NDP. Former NDP leader Thomas Mulcair said in a television interview on CTV last month that it would be “extremely difficult” for Singh to stay on as leader if he lost in Burnaby.

The Burnaby South seat had been vacated by former MP and now Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart. Stewart told Postmedia last Friday that he had been out door-knocking with Singh last week, and “it felt really good on the ground.”

“I feel good that he’ll win there, and I think having him in the House of Commons will be not just good for the NDP but good for the country,” Stewart said.

Harjit Sajjan, the Liberal MP for Vancouver South and the Minister of National Defence, was at Lee’s event Monday night. Sajjan said he was happy to support Lee, who he described as a “humble, great person.”

“I’ve had the opportunity to go door-knocking with him as well,” Sajjan told Postmedia. “His compassion that he has for his community, that’s what really, I think, sets him apart.”

The by-election fell as the federal Liberals are dealing with fallout from a scandal around allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office may have inappropriately pressured Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the criminal prosecution of Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin. After the controversy, Wilson-Raybould resigned her position in cabinet, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s principal secretary Gerald Butts resigned his position.

Singh referenced oil and gas extraction, pharmaceutical profits and the ongoing SNC-Lavalin scandal in his victory speech. “People should be angry,” he said.

Peter Julian, MP for New Westminster-Burnaby, said voters who put Singh in office “were saying they want a fighter … someone who will stand up when the government makes bad choices.”

Justin Trudeau's right-hand-man says the prime minister did nothing improper as a deepening political crisis threatens the government's re-election chances. Here's what you need to know.

In a nutshell

Mr Trudeau has been accused of pressuring his former attorney general to cut a deal with a company facing corruption charges - and retaliating when she refused to play ball.

The revelations could cost Trudeau the October general election, some pundits say.

The former AG, Jody Wilson-Raybould, says Trudeau and his staff spent months trying to convince her that taking the company to trial would cost Canadians jobs, and their party votes.

She also says she was subject to ""veiled threats"", which she believes were made good when she was shuffled out of her department.

Now another minister, Jane Philpott, has quit saying it was ""untenable"" for her to continue due to ""serious concerns"" raised by the case.

But Gerald Butts, Mr Trudeau's former principal secretary, says there was no political pressure - only concerns for how the prosecution could affect local economies.

Who are the players?

The spurned ex-minister: Jody Wilson-Raybould was Canada's attorney general and justice minister. Unlike in the UK, the two roles are held by the same person.

She was also Canada's first indigenous justice minister and worked on a number of pieces of landmark legislation, including legalising cannabis and assisted dying.

In January, she was shuffled from the justice department to the department of veterans' affairs - a move many saw as a demotion.

The corporation: SNC-Lavalin is one of the world's largest engineering and construction companies.

The company faces fraud and corruption charges in relation to approximately C$48m ($36m; £28m) in bribes it is alleged to have offered to Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011, when Muammar Gaddafi was in power.

The firm has openly lobbied to be allowed to enter into a remediation agreement instead of going to trial, saying it has cleaned house and changed its ways.

The PM: Justin Trudeau is Canada's prime minister. He won a majority government in 2015 on a platform of transparency, gender equality and a commitment to reconciliation with Canada's indigenous peoples.

He faces a federal election in October 2019.

The Trudeau ally who quit: Jane Philpott is described as one of his most trusted ministers.

But her resignation statement explaining why she was quitting as Treasury Board president could not have been more pointed.

Citing the SNC-Lavallin affair, she said: ""I must abide by my core values, my ethical responsibilities, constitutional obligations. There can be a cost to acting on one's principles, but there is a bigger cost to abandoning them.""

Trudeau's right-hand man: Gerald Butts has been described as the ""most important Liberal in Canada today"" whose last name is not ""Trudeau"". But all that changed in February, when Mr Butts resigned amid rumours he had pressured the justice minister to cut a deal with SNC-Lavalin.

Mr Butts is one of Mr Trudeau's closest allies, and the two have been friends since their university days in Montreal.

He is credited with helping Mr Trudeau win the Liberal party leadership in 2013 and was a key architect in the Liberal party's sweeping 2015 electoral victory.

Why would Trudeau care about SNC-Lavalin?

SNC-Lavalin is based in Quebec, a swing province that has long been viewed as essential ground for the Liberal Party to win during an election - which is coming up in October.

When the Liberals win Quebec, they often win a majority of seats in parliament. When they lose, they lose badly.

At the time that Wilson-Raybould says she was being pressured to cut a deal, Quebec was also in the middle of a heated provincial election that eventually led to the ousting of Quebec Liberal premier Philippe Couillard.

Wilson-Raybould says the federal Liberal Party kept raising the Quebec election as one of the reasons why she should consider cutting a deal with SNC-Lavalin.

What does Trudeau say?

Trudeau has denied wrongdoing and says any lobbying by him or his inner circle for engineering giant SNC-Lavalin was done to protect jobs.

Speaking to reporters on Thursday morning, Mr Trudeau said he disagreed with her ""characterisation"" of events and maintained his staff followed the rules.

What could the fallout be?

Trudeau's longtime friend and principal secretary Gerald Butts has already resigned.

Many speculate that other top officials that Wilson-Raybould named may follow.

Canada's ethics commissioner is investigating Wilson-Raybould's accusations to see if any conflict-of-interest rules were broken. For her part, Wilson-Raybould says she believes no laws were broken, but that the prime minister's office acted improperly.

But the real question is what this could mean for Trudeau and his election in the fall.

Conservative leader of the opposition Andrew Scheer has already called for Trudeau's resignation, saying he no longer has the ""moral authority"" to lead.

That seems unlikely, but what is likely - at least according to columnist Chantal Hebert and other political pundits - is that ""the Liberals will likely go in the fall election campaign with the SNC-Lavalin albatross still hanging around their party's neck"".",Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould: The scandal that could unseat Canada's PM - BBC News,Bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47408239

The allegations by Jody Wilson-Raybould dramatically deepened the biggest crisis of Trudeau's tenure just months ahead of an October election in which his Liberals face a tough fight.

Andrew Scheer, leader of the official opposition Conservative Party, demanded the resignation of what he called a disgraced prime minister.

""He can no longer, with a clear conscience, continue to lead this nation,"" Scheer told reporters, calling for police to immediately probe the matter. Trudeau is due to address reporters later on Wednesday.

Wilson-Raybould said officials imposed ""consistent and sustained pressure"" on her from September to December last year to ensure SNC-Lavalin pay a large fine rather than go to trial.

""In my view, these events constituted pressure to intervene in a matter and that this pressure, or political interference to intervene, was not appropriate,"" she told the committee.

Wilson-Raybould, who named several senior officials in the offices of Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau, said under questioning from Liberal legislators that she did not feel the pressure on her had been illegal.

A Morneau spokesman denied the minister or his staff had ever pressured Wilson-Raybould when she was justice minister.

Trudeau and other officials deny inappropriate pressure was put on Wilson-Raybould. But the case forced the resignation of Trudeau's principal private secretary, Gerald Butts, earlier this month.

Opinion polls show the affair is starting to hurt the Liberals ahead of what looks set to be a tightly contested federal election in October.

122,Empty,2019-02-28T14:42:26Z,Former Canadian Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee on Wednesday about political interference for SNC-Lavalin.,"OTTAWA — Former Canadian Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee Wednesday that she was told to interfere in the prosecution of Quebec contractor, SNC-Lavalin. The Official Opposition says Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has no option but to resign.

The political interference from the Prime Minister’s Office was apparently all about getting corruption charges against the company deferred in order to shore up Liberal Party support in the province of Quebec.

“For a period of approximately four months between September and December 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the attorney general of Canada in an inappropriate effort to secure a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with SNC-Lavalin,” Wilson-Raybould told the committee. (RELATED: Trudeau Principal Secretary Gerald Butts Resigns In Wake Of Judicial Scandal)

Trudeau also participated in this “sustained effort,” according to Wilson-Raybould, and at one point he directly implied that Wilson-Raybould should consider the party’s political fortunes in Quebec. She described the incident when “the prime minister jumped in stressing that there is an election in Quebec and that ‘I am an MP in Quebec – the member for Papineau.'”

The former attorney general and justice minister says she was “taken aback” by the comment and posed “a direct question while looking him in the eye.”

“I asked: ‘Are you politically interfering with my role, my decision as the attorney general? I would strongly advise against it.'”

Trudeau’s response appeared to be both a denial and an affirmation: “The prime minister said, ‘No, no, no – we just need to find a solution.'”

Official Opposition Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is demanding that Trudeau resign for political interference and says the Royal Canadian Mounted Police must investigate Wilson-Raybould’s enormous claims. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Scheer said Trudeau has no moral authority to govern Canada. (RELATED: Former Canadian AG Jody Wilson-Raybould Quits As Trudeau Embroiled In Growing Scandal)

“I was sickened and appalled by [Wilson-Raybould’s] story of inappropriate and, frankly, borderline illegal pressure brought to bear on her by the highest levels of Justin Trudeau’s government,” he said.

Trudeau said Wednesday he won’t resign and has essentially dismissed his former minister’s testimony as a fabrication.

“I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,” he said during an event in Montreal late Wednesday. “And therefore I completely disagree with the characterization of the former attorney general about these events.”

While media continued to demand answers throughout Wednesday afternoon, the Liberal government tried to avoid the story. Canadian Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale announced on Twitter that the federal government would be pardoning Canadians who had been charged with possession of marijuana before the drug was legalized.

Later today, I will give notice to introduce a bill to provide no-cost, expedited pardons for simple possession of cannabis. — Ralph Goodale (@RalphGoodale) February 27, 2019

Wilson-Raybould’s revolt is unprecedented in a Liberal Party that has dominated the Canadian political landscape for over a century by keeping caucus malcontents silent and demanding its Members of Parliament (MP) speak in unison. Suspicions that something was amiss in the Trudeau government were aroused when Trudeau demoted Wilson-Raybould from attorney general to Veterans Affairs minister last month following a cabinet shuffle.

The former minister will continue to sit as a Liberal MP for the time being. Wilson-Raybould, who is aboriginal, was seen as an example of Trudeau’s efforts to reach “reconciliation” with Canada’s First Nations.

But on Thursday, we learned that the lifestyle guru is taking the next logical step in her friendship with Snoop Dogg—which involves a cooking show the two host together that gave us the line, “Snoop’s Cornish game hens were the best ever”—and getting into the increasingly lucrative weed business.

CNBC reports that Stewart has signed on as an adviser to Canopy Growth, one of the largest marijuana producers in the world, to develop a line of C.B.D. products for animals. (Stewart’s own pets, which are often featured on her Instagram account, include Chow Chows, French bulldogs, Persian cats, a Fell pony, and Friesian horses.) “I am delighted to establish this partnership with Canopy Growth and share with them the knowledge I have gained after years of experience in the subject of living,” Stewart said in a statement. “I’m especially looking forward to our first collaboration together, which will offer sensible products for people’s beloved pets.” While Stewart says she herself doesn’t smoke, she has no problem with others smoking around her, which makes sense considering she’s just joined a pot company. “So someone smokes marijuana? Big deal! People smoke cigarettes and die from cancer,” she told The Hollywood Reporter. “I haven’t heard of anybody dying from cannabis. I’m quite egalitarian and liberal when it comes to stuff like that.”

Canopy—whose subsidiary, Tweed, unveiled a partnership with Snoop Dogg in 2016 that included a brand of weed called “Leafs by Snoop”—was founded in 2013 and received a major boost last year with the decision by Canada to legalize recreational pot, leading to such demand that there were supply shortages across the country. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, it said it sold 10,102 kilograms (10.1 tons) of pot and pot equivalents from October through December, boosting revenue by 282 percent, so you can understand why Stewart would want to get a piece of that! In a statement, Canopy Chairman and co-C.E.O. Bruce Linton said he was excited to bring in a host of new customers through a household name like Stewart’s, who could be viewed as a gateway drug. “As soon as you hear the name Martha, you know exactly who we’re talking about,” Linton said. “Martha is one of a kind and I am so excited to be able to work alongside this icon to sharpen our C.B.D. product offerings across categories from human to animal.”

Larry Kudlow: forget what you’ve heard, trade talks with China are going great

Yesterday, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer appeared before Congress and uttered the words, regarding the trade war with China that has cost U.S. exporters $40 billion: “Let me be clear, much still needs to be done both before an agreement is reached and, more importantly, after it is reached, if one is reached.” In other words: slow your roll, Donald Trump. But according to National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, who has the distinction of never being right, Lighthizer is just being a stick in the mud:

“Last week was fantastic,” Kudlow told CNBC’s Squawk on the Street. “We’re making great headway on nontariff barriers and tariffs regarding various commodities such as soybeans and energy and beef. We have mechanisms with regard to enforcement, which is—I think—unparalleled.”

In recent decades, Russian and Chinese conglomerates have gained ever more global economic influence, making them powerful foreign-policy tools for their respective governments. But now Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping are learning that they are the tools.

NEW YORK – Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping have each championed a model of authoritarian capitalism (call it “development with a dictator’s face”). But what neither leader seems to have anticipated is that the Russian and Chinese commercial sectors are becoming political forces in their own right, increasingly bringing pressure to bear on policymaking.

Wojtek Radwanski/AFP/Getty Images Europe, Please Wake Up Feb 11, 2019 argues that the EU cannot be saved without transforming its political party systems. Previous Next

Over the past two decades, Russian and Chinese multinational corporations – many of them awash in cash – have become powerful foreign-policy tools for their respective regimes. But they were once seen as modernizing forces that would help open up business and society alike. With energy giants like Gazprom and Rosneft promising to bring commercial values to backward Russia and the newly independent former Soviet states, Anatoly Chubais, a key architect of Russia’s privatization program, touted them as the vanguard of a new “liberal empire.” (Insofar as these firms also bound the former Soviet republics closer to Russia, so much the better.)

Likewise, in China during the presidencies of Jiang Zemin (1993-2003) and Hu Jintao (2003-2013), the rise of banks like the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China, and of energy and heavy-industry firms like Sinopec, Sinochem, and the China Railway Construction Corporation, were seen as harbingers of modernization. Yet today, no one could mistake these firms for the equivalent of an ExxonMobil or a Microsoft. With top executives often parachuting directly into the boardroom from high political office, Chinese mega-corporations have long represented a merger of business and the state.

Moreover, as Gazprom, Rosneft, and the Chinese technology giants ZTE and Huawei have grown more essential to their respective governments, business and state interests have become even harder to disentangle. In the interest of their “national champions,” both the Russian and Chinese governments now seem to be pursuing policies they might not have chosen otherwise.

This dynamic is clearly on display in Venezuela. Through its affiliation with Venezuela’s state oil monopoly, Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), Rosneft has funneled upward of $17 billion in loans to the Chavist regime over the past decade. Meanwhile, Rosneft gained three million tons of oil in 2017 from its operations in Venezuela; more generally Russia has invested in many Venezuelan industries, from banking to bus assembly. At the same time, Venezuela has been one of the largest buyers of Russian weapons among Latin American countries.

Owing to these debts and other economic ties, Putin has little choice but to back the Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro’s crumbling regime, even as public support in Russia for the Kremlin’s foreign interventions declines. Rosneft’s interests in Venezuela are simply too deep for it to withdraw, especially now that Western sanctions have crippled the firm’s ability to secure financing in international markets.

Russia’s support for Maduro does not rise to the same level as its commitments in Syria, where its relationship with the Assad family goes back decades. Rather, its continued engagement in Venezuela reflects a cold, hard business calculation. According to Reuters, private security contractors with close ties to the Kremlin have been sent to defend Maduro. At the same time, there have been unverified (but plausible) reports of Russian planes departing Venezuela with shipments of gold, as payment for the country’s debts. Putin knows that if National Assembly President Juan Guaidó takes power, those who stood with Maduro will likely be ousted, and Russia’s privileged access to Venezuela’s oil fields revoked.

In monetary terms, Maduro’s fall could mean even larger losses for China, which has investments in Venezuela estimated to be worth around $60 billion – at least three times more than Russia’s. Like Russia, China got into bed with the Venezuelan regime in the 2000s, when the country was flourishing under former President Hugo Chávez. While China secured a sorely needed source of oil for its fast-growing economy, Chávez was able to reduce Venezuela’s reliance on the US as one of its leading export markets. In the meantime, Chinese tech giants have aided the Maduro regime in its domestic surveillance efforts, and (like Russia) China has sold Venezuela expensive weapons.

Still, should Maduro fall, China may be less exposed than Russia. The Chinese have been careful to cultivate contacts among various elements of Venezuelan society, including the opposition. And while China still supports Maduro officially, it has not followed Russia in accusing the US of an attempted coup.

This suggests that China wants to avoid the kind of radical steps that Russia is taking. The Kremlin is now actively competing with the US to influence the course of events in Venezuela, and has described the US attempt to deliver humanitarian aid across the Colombia-Venezuela border as a ruse to smuggle in weapons for the opposition.

China’s moderate behavior no doubt owes something to its ongoing trade negotiations with the US. Before extending his deadline for imposing higher tariffs on Chinese imports, US President Donald Trump indicated that Huawei and ZTE might be included in a final Sino-American trade deal. That would certainly please Xi, whose paramount interest is to protect both firms’ economic might.

With the ability to bar US companies from selling crucial inputs to Chinese firms, the Trump administration could inflict serious harm on both ZTE and Huawei. Huawei already stands accused of conspiring to violate US sanctions on Iran, leading to the arrest of its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, in Canada this past December. And ZTE has pled guilty to similar charges, paying penalties of $1.4 billion in 2017.

At the end of the day, Venezuela can’t hold a candle to the strategic importance of these two firms. And for the Kremlin, the calculus is the same: the prerogatives of business define the national interest. But, perhaps to Putin’s chagrin, in Venezuela that calculus has produced the opposite outcome.",Wag the Dictator,Project-syndicate.org,https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/russia-china-multinationals-setting-policy-by-nina-l--khrushcheva-2019-02

In dramatic testimony that lasted nearly four hours, Jody Wilson-Raybould broke her silence with a detailed account of efforts by Trudeau and top aides to persuade her to step in and end prosecution of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. She argues it amounted to interference in the judicial system, though concedes it wasn’t illegal, while Trudeau says he was trying to prevent job losses in his home province of Quebec.

“I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere,” the former attorney general said Wednesday afternoon. Wilson-Raybould, who quit cabinet this month, also said she faced “veiled threats” about what might happen if she refused to order an out-of-court settlement.

Her testimony shook the core of the Trudeau’s team, naming him, his finance chief and his most senior aides. The Conservative leader trying to unseat Trudeau in this fall’s election called for his resignation, but the prime minister stood his ground and rejected Wilson-Raybould’s version of events.

The public airing of grievances will inflame the scandal, which has driven the governing Liberals lower in national polls. The ordeal dredges up ghosts of the party’s past, which is marked by hand-in-glove ties with corporate Canada -- particularly in Quebec. The political fallout, however, is difficult to predict. Trudeau’s path to re-election runs through the largely French-speaking province, where his defense of SNC-Lavalin is being applauded.

Protecting Jobs

“I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,” Trudeau said Wednesday night in Montreal, where he was celebrating a Liberal Party by-election victory. “Our government will always focus on jobs and our economy.”

SNC-Lavalin had been pushing for what’s known as a deferred prosecution agreement to end a criminal case dating back more than a decade, related to corruption charges. The company’s stock plunged the most in six years Oct. 10 when it revealed that the Public Prosecution Service of Canada ruled out a negotiated settlement that would have staved off a trial. Settling out of court would also help the company, which employs about 9,000 people in Canada, avoid a ban on bidding for federal government contracts.

Wilson-Raybould pulled back the curtain on the effort to change that decision and help the company, in testimony that was aired on national television in its entirety. She spoke to lawmakers only after Trudeau waived privilege to allow her to do so, and believes she wasn’t even legally able to intervene.

Inner Circle

She said the prime minister and his aides wanted to end the case in part to prevent the company’s relocation -- and also to avoid electoral fallout for both the federal Liberals and the party’s provincial wing. Wilson-Raybould said she resisted intervening because she wanted to uphold the principle of judicial independence and the rule of law, but officials ignored her repeated instructions to stop raising the issue.

The former attorney-general identified a series of phone calls and meetings between her or her staff, and Trudeau or several of his top advisers. They include chief of staff Katie Telford; former principal secretary Gerald Butts, who resigned this month; and senior aides Mathieu Bouchard and Elder Marques. She also cited communications with Finance Minister Bill Morneau and his chief of staff Ben Chin.

One of the meetings was with Trudeau himself, in September. “The prime minister raised the issue immediately. The prime minister asked me to help out, to find a solution here for SNC,” Wilson-Raybould said. She said she’d told him she had made up her mind.

London Calling

“The prime minister again cited the potential loss of jobs and SNC moving,” while also stressing that he represents an electoral district in Quebec. She said Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, the country’s top bureaucrat, also warned her the company “will likely be moving to London” without her intervention.

Discussions continued. Wilson-Raybould said Bouchard at one point said bluntly: “We can have the best policy in the world but we need to get re-elected.”",Trudeau’s Former AG Alleges ‘Veiled Threats’ to Settle SNC Case,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/trudeau-former-ag-alleges-veiled-214856748.html

Trudeau, rejecting an opposition call for his resignation, disputed allegations on Wednesday by his former justice minister that government officials inappropriately pressured her to help the SNC-Lavalin construction firm avoid a corruption trial.

The testimony from Jody Wilson-Raybould threatens to badly damage the Liberals just months ahead of what polls suggest will be a hard-fought election.

In an unusual move, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland appeared on the Canadian Broadcasting Corp to say she fully backed Trudeau.

“Of course I support the prime minister 100 percent ... I am very clearly of the view that the prime minister would never apply improper pressure,” she said.

Freeland, one of the most prominent members of the Cabinet, is seen by some observers as a possible successor to Trudeau.

Andrew Scheer, leader of the official opposition Conservative Party, who on Wednesday called on Trudeau to quit, formally asked the head of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to probe the matter. Scheer said in a letter that it was illegal “to attempt to obstruct or defeat the course of justice.”

Wilson-Raybould, who complained about pressure from Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s then-principal secretary, said she did not consider the officials had broken any laws. Trudeau said the police had not contacted anyone in his office.

Butts, who quit earlier this month while proclaiming his innocence, asked on Thursday to speak to the justice committee to address Wilson-Raybould’s remarks.

One top Liberal official said there was no talk for now of a challenge to Trudeau’s leadership. In the Canadian political system, party leaders are elected at formal conventions and cannot be deposed by a simple vote of legislators, which means any move to push out Trudeau would be lengthy.

But another senior Liberal Party member said there was growing unhappiness among legislators about how Trudeau’s team had handled the SNC-Lavalin matter and that the prime minister needed to replace some of his staff.

“The level of concern over what has happened over the last few hours is unprecedented,” said the Liberal, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.

MAJOR EMPLOYER

SNC-Lavalin is a major employer in the province of Quebec, where the Liberals have said they need to pick up seats to stand a chance of retaining a majority government. Liberal officials said media coverage of the affair in Quebec had been generally favorable.

Trudeau told reporters on Thursday that “Canadians expect their government to look for ways to protect jobs, to grow the economy and that’s exactly what we have done ... we’ve also done it in a way that has respected our laws”.

Wilson-Raybould said she had confronted Trudeau in September over what she said were persistent efforts by officials to help SNC-Lavalin evade trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials. Wilson-Raybould said she made clear she was not prepared to help the company avoid a trial, which is now pending.

Wilson-Raybould said staff working for Finance Minister Bill Morneau had continued to press her to help the firm even after she asked them to stop.

Morneau told reporters that his officials had not behaved inappropriately and like Trudeau, stressed the importance of protecting jobs.

Wilson-Raybould was unexpectedly given a less prominent job in January and resigned from the Cabinet this month. She said she was convinced her refusal to give way on the SNC-Lavalin case had prompted her demotion.","Top ally supports embattled Canada PM, easing pressure for now",Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-politics-snc-lavalin-idUSKCN1QH215

Popular Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that “the prime minister would never apply improper pressure” and expressed “100 percent faith” in him.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau denied meddling, saying it was “entirely appropriate” for his staff to talk with the justice minister’s staff about the economic effects of their decisions.

Ex-Attorney General and Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould testified Wednesday that Trudeau, his staff and other officials imposed inappropriate pressure on her to avoid criminal prosecution of Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin in a case involving allegations of corruption in Libya. She said they pushed for an agreement that would let the company pay reparations but avoid a conviction.

If convicted criminally, the company would be banned from receiving any federal government business for a decade. SNC-Lavalin is a major employer in Quebec, with about 3,400 employees in the province, 9,000 employees in Canada and more than 50,000 worldwide.

Trudeau has acknowledged raising the issue with Wilson-Raybould, but said that was appropriate.

“Canadians expect their government to look for ways to protect jobs,” Trudeau said Thursday. “That’s exactly what we have done every step of the way.

“We have also done it in a way that has respected our laws and respected the independence of the judiciary,” he added. “There are no doubt disagreements in perspective on this but I can reassure Canadians that we were doing our job and we were doing in a way that respects and defends our institutions.”

Morneau said he never raised issue with Wilson-Raybould, but said she had “approached me in the House of Commons to inform me that my staff was speaking to her staff, which I think is entirely appropriate.”

Wilson-Raybould herself said she didn’t think the pressure had been illegal; she had not directly instructed to avoid prosecuting.

But she said Trudeau warned that a prosecution would drive the company and its jobs out of Canada, and she said she was “barraged” and subjected to “hounding” by Trudeau and senior members of his government, including Morneau and his chief of staff.

The opposition Conservative leader Andrew Scheer is calling on Trudeau to resign, and Wilson-Raybould’s testimony to Parliament has increased the uproar against Trudeau, who is facing an election this fall. Trudeau has already lost his closet adviser, Gerald Butts, who resigned last week. Butts denied he or anyone in Trudeau’s office pressured Wilson-Raybould and he is now asking Parliament’s justice committee to testify.

“I believe my evidence will be of assistance,” Butts said in a statement.

The latest Angus Reid Institute poll shows the Liberals falling behind the Conservatives in popular support, the PM’s approval rating dipping to Trump territory and Canadians engaging on the SNC-Lavalin affair.

According to the poll released Tuesday, Canadians are more engaged on this issue than on NAFTA talks, on China, even the Me Too movement. The poll shows that 66% agree with the statement that “There is a deeper scandal in the Prime Minister’s Office and more information will emerge.”

That view goes across the country and across all age groups, something that should frighten the Liberal campaign team.

Already the party is down in voter support, the poll showing that the Conservatives are ahead by seven points.

When asked “who they would support if an election were held tomorrow,” 38% said the Conservatives, 31% the Liberals and 14% the NDP.

The Trudeau Liberals are down in support across the country while Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives are on the rise.

The Angus Reid survey, which was conducted between Feb. 21-24, shows the Conservatives leading in every region but Quebec and Atlantic Canada.

In Quebec, the Liberals and Conservatives are tied at 24% support.

The only region the Liberals still hold a lead is in Atlantic Canada.

It’s a far cry from Trudeaumania and proof that the PM and his party are in trouble over their handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair.

This is the fourth poll showing the Conservatives ahead since the story broke.

The scandal isn’t just hitting the Liberal Party’s numbers, it is hurting Trudeau’s reputation, as well. Asked if their opinion of the PM has worsened, improved or stayed the same in the past month, 59% of Canadians said worsened.

Justin Trudeau’s approval rating sits at just 40%.

Seems trash talking the woman who used to be your attorney general for almost three weeks while preventing her from speaking turns Canadians off.

Trudeau may need yet another communications strategy.

And as the PM stands up in the House of Commons day after day saying that he did nothing wrong and is only supporting “good jobs” at SNC-Lavalin, he is showing that he is offside with the view of most Canadians.

Asked if the company should be prosecuted on the bribery and corruption charges they are facing, 63% said they agreed with the statement that, “ SNC-Lavalin should be fully prosecuted under the Criminal Code.”

Even in the company’s home province of Quebec, voters are split with 49% saying prosecute even if it means a 10-year ban on federal contracts and 51% saying the company should be allowed a remediation agreement.

On Wednesday, Jody Wilson-Raybould will speak to the House of Commons justice committee. If you’ve read the headlines, then you have likely heard that Trudeau says he has waived privilege and the former attorney general is free to speak.

How much she says could alter Trudeau’s fortunes in the future.

If she is upfront and forthcoming with Canadians, then the next poll could show even worse numbers for the Trudeau government.

Here is Scheer’s full statement.

Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this great nation now that Canadians know what he has done. That is why I am calling on Justin Trudeau to resign. Further, the RCMP must immediately open an investigation – if it has not already done so—into the numerous examples of obstruction of justice the former Attorney General detailed in her testimony.

The testimony Canadians have just heard from the former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould tells the story of a Prime Minister who has lost the moral authority to govern. A Prime Minister who allows his partisan political motivations to overrule his duty to uphold the rule of law. A Prime Minister who doesn’t know where the Liberal Party ends and where the Government of Canada begins. And a Prime Minister who has allowed a systemic culture of corruption to take root in his office and those of his most senior cabinet and public service colleagues.

I listened carefully to the testimony of the former Attorney General, and like Canadians, I was sickened and appalled by her story of inappropriate, and frankly illegal pressure brought to bear on her by the highest officials of Justin Trudeau’s government. All to let a Liberal-connected corporation off the hook on corruption charges.

Before Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, Canadians knew Justin Trudeau had engineered an unwanted, sustained, and co-ordinated attempt to get Ms. Wilson-Raybould to change her mind and stop the criminal trial of SNC-Lavalin. Today, thanks to Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, we now know just how intense those efforts were: ten meetings and ten phone calls involving eleven senior government officials relentlessly targeting Ms. Wilson-Raybould over a four month period—with the sole objective of bullying her into bending the law to benefit a well-connected corporation.

The details are as shocking as they are corrupt: multiple veiled threats to her job if she didn’t bow to their demands. Urgings to consider the consequences on election results and shareholder value above judicial due process. And reminders from Justin Trudeau to his Attorney General about his own electoral prospects should she allow SNC-Lavalin’s trial to proceed.

As Ms. Wilson-Raybould has so clearly articulated, the people Canadians entrusted to protect the integrity of our very nation were instead only protecting themselves and their friends.

Mr. Trudeau can no longer, in good standing and with a clear conscience, lead this great nation.

Canada should be a country where we are all equal under the law. Where nobody—regardless of wealth, status, or political connections – is above the law.

The NDP leader is running for a seat in the House of Commons in Burnaby South, one of three federal ridings holding byelections today.

Many New Democrats believe it’s a do-or-die contest – that Singh cannot lead his party in this fall’s general election if he can’t get himself a seat in Parliament.

READ MORE: Burnaby South byelection 2019 cheat sheet: A last-minute voter’s guide

Singh is hoping a victory tonight will give him much-needed visibility in the Commons in the run-up to the national vote in October, and put to rest grumbling within the NDP about his underwhelming performance since being chosen leader almost 18 months ago.

But Singh’s problems go well beyond his lack of visibility on the main stage of federal politics. The former Ontario provincial politician has faced criticism about his seeming unfamiliarity with federal issues and his handling of internal caucus matters – particularly his decision to kick Saskatchewan MP Erin Weir out of caucus for alleged misconduct, which has infuriated many NDP stalwarts in the province seen as the cradle of the party.

Under his leadership, the NDP has plunged to its lowest standings in public opinion polls since 2000, when it won just 13 seats. The party is mired in debt and its fundraising is sluggish. At least 11 of the 44 MPs who won seats for the party in 2015 have announced they won’t seek re-election this fall.

While many NDP eyes will be glued to Burnaby South tonight, an arguably better gauge of the party’s election-year viability will be going on in Outremont – the Montreal riding vacated last summer by Singh’s predecessor, Tom Mulcair.

The riding had been a Liberal stronghold until Mulcair scored an upset in a 2007 byelection. His victory turned Outremont into a beachhead for the NDP, which helped to launch the so-called orange wave that swept the province in 2011 and boosted the party to official Opposition status for the first time in its history. While the party held onto just 16 Quebec seats in 2015, Quebec MPs still make up more than a third of the NDP caucus.

The betting among political insiders is that the Liberals will retake Outremont, which would be a welcome boost for the governing party’s morale in the midst of the SNC-Lavalin controversy – and a particularly bitter loss for the NDP. The symbolism of losing their erstwhile beachhead would only reinforce polls suggesting New Democrats are in danger of being wiped out altogether in Quebec this fall.

But the blow would be softened, at least, if Singh is able to capture Burnaby South.

It’s no sure thing. The B.C. riding is not a natural home for Singh, who formerly represented Brampton in the Ontario legislature. Nor is it a safe NDP riding: New Democrat Kennedy Stewart, who resigned to become mayor of Vancouver, took the riding in 2015 with just over 600 votes more than his Liberal opponent, with the Conservative candidate not far behind.

While the byelection is thought to be a three-way race, being a party leader should give Singh an edge. The fact that the Green party has chosen not to run a candidate should also help.

Moreover, the Liberals did themselves no favours by dumping their original candidate amid controversy over her suggestion that Singh being of “Indian descent” could help her win. The current Liberal contender, Richard T. Lee, could face headwinds of a different kind, created by the ongoing furor over allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould – who represents a nearby Vancouver riding – to halt a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

WATCH: Unpacking the politics of the SNC-Lavalin affair

The third byelection is being held in the Ontario riding of York-Simcoe, left vacant by the retirement of Peter Van Loan, who had held the seat for the Conservatives since 2004. He won with a healthy 50 per cent of the votes in 2015, and the Tories are expected to easily hang on tonight.

All three contests will give the Conservatives a glimpse of what, if any damage, they might sustain from the advent of the breakaway People’s Party of Canada, formed by one-time Tory leadership contender Maxime Bernier.

While Americans were transfixed on Wednesday with the salacious, but not legally damning, testimony of Michael Cohen before Congress, a bombshell went off in the Canadian Parliament. Former Canadian Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould testified before the House Justice Committee alleging that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and others in his administration pressured her in “inappropriate” ways to reach a settlement with an engineering company that has been charged with crimes.

The company, SNC-Lavalin, is facing charges that it sent bribes to Libya, then under the rule of Gadhafi, in defiance of Canadian law. If found guilty, the Quebec-based company will face severe sanctions, including a ban on working with the Canadian government. This would be a severe economic blow, especially in Trudeau’s home province of Quebec.

According to Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, she faced “consistent and sustained,” efforts by the Trudeau administration, as well as “veiled threats,” in an attempt to influence her decision regarding Lavalin. Under Canadian law, this type of attempt at political influence is at best inappropriate, and at worst illegal.

Unlike the slow moving investigation into Trump, the Trudeau scandal has unfurled remarkably quickly. On February 7, the Globe and Mail ran a story citing anonymous sources that suggested inappropriate political meddling had occurred. In her testimony yesterday, Wilson-Raybould discussed meetings with Trudeau and others from late last year. Trudeau says he disagrees with her assessment that the meetings were not appropriate.

In January, Wilson-Raybould was relieved of her duties as attorney general and given a lesser cabinet position. Then this month, she suddenly stepped down from the cabinet entirely. Also stepping down was Gerald Butts, a long time Trudeau political adviser heavily involved with Lavalin situation.

Yesterday’s testimony from one of his former cabinet ministers and a member of his own party has flung the Trudeau administration into a full-fledged crisis. With a general election looming in October, Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer said that Trudeau has “lost the moral authority to lead,” and should resign.

The crux of the case––and perhaps the key to Trudeau’s future––is whether the discussions with Wilson-Raybould were simply a good faith effort to make her aware of the economic and political implications of the Lavalin case, or a more nefarious effort to put a thumb on the scale of justice.

For her part, the former attorney general said that the pressure was maintained even after she had made clear that she had made a decision not to cut a deal with Lavalin. In addition, some observers view her demotion in January as a punishment for having defied the administration’s wishes.

With an election this year, members of the Liberal Party will have to decide if Trudeau can weather these harsh allegations and successfully lead them to victory. For now, Trudeau insists he did nothing wrong and that he will be exonerated by the ethics committee. But even in the best-case scenario for him, in which his administration’s pressure on the justice ministry was legal and ethical, it still represents a broad overreach into what is supposed to be an independent agency.

Justin Trudeau is often viewed in both Canada and The United States as a kind of anti-Trump. Young, nice looking, liberal, the son of a former prime minister, and sufficiently woke in all the right ways, he has a hero status for some. It is remarkable that all of a sudden it is Trudeau, not Trump, who may be taken down by corruption.

It’s a good reminder that Donald Trump didn’t invent corruption or the breaking of political norms––such things predate him by a few centuries. That a “nice guy,” like Trudeau engaged in corruption will surprise many, but perhaps it shouldn’t. Abuse of government power has never been limited to the crude.

It will be an astounding irony if just as the Mueller probe returns a report with no smoking gun, Trump’s adversary in Canada is engulfed in a damaging scandal. It will be another example of something that “wasn’t supposed to go that way.” But here we are. Over two years after investigations into Trump began there has still been no finding of wrongdoing by him. Just three weeks into the Lavalin scandal, Trudeau has been badly damaged.

Whether Trudeau’s leadership survives this scandal or not, it is yet another reminder that things are not always what they seem.

A conservative nonprofit, led by the former head of the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, found that the ambitious climate change plan's federal jobs guarantee alone would cost an estimated $6.8 trillion at best.

The American Action Forum determined that a pledge to create 20 million jobs, directly and indirectly through the overhaul, could have a price tag as high as $44.6 trillion, however.

The American Action Forum determined that a pledge to create 20 million jobs, directly and indirectly, through the overhaul could have a price tag as high as $44.6 trillion

Universal health care alone would carry a $36 trillion price tag, the researchers said, although their study admits that it is impossible to come up with a true estimate based on the published Green New Deal framework

Universal health care alone would carry a $36 trillion price tag, the researchers said, although their study admits that it is impossible to come up with a true estimate based on the published Green New Deal framework.

Even without a Medicare-for-All provision or a federal jobs guarantee, the study finds that a 'Low-carbon Electricity Grid' would cost roughly $5.4 trillion and a 'Net Zero Emissions Transportation System' would range from $1.3 trillion to $2.7 trillion in taxpayer costs.

Add on 'Guaranteed Green Housing' at an estimated $1.6 trillion to $4.2 trillion, and the Green New Deal would still tack on $12.3 to the federal budget between 2020 and 2029, the researchers said.

A 'Food Security' promise would cost a mere $1.5 billion, or $10 per household, making it the only promise of the progressive plan that wouldn't cost taxpayers thousands annually.

The Green New Deal's costs have become a major point of contention as Democrats backing the resolution introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey have had to square their support for document that seeks to slow global warming with reality.

Few have been able to say how they'd pay for it, aside from rolling back the GOP tax cut on corporations. Democrats have also said they'd raise taxes on ultra-wealthy Americans.

The deal states plainly: 'We will need revenues between $700 billion to $1 trillion annually for the Green New Deal. $400 billion will be for the public jobs programs. Estimates for the transition to 100% clean energy start at $200 billion a year.'

Their estimate of $10 trillion a year tracks with American Action Forum's baseline, but only when the jobs provision and universal healthcare is not included.

The Green New Deal itself promises to take reallocate money from the Pentagon's hefty annual budget. It also proposes a carbon tax of $20 per ton that it claims would raise $120 billion a year, as well as a tax hike on the rich.

Green New Deal backers also believe health care costs will be decreased by $3 trillion when fossil fuels are retired.

'Using renewable energy instead of coal and gas will mean health care costs will go down because the foundations of a green economy – clean energy, healthy food, pollution prevention, and active transportation – are also the foundations of human health,' the deal's website says.

'The Green New Deal pays for itself through the prevention of chronic disease, which consumes a staggering 75% of $3 trillion in annual health care costs. All in all, this is an investment in our future that will pay off enormously as we build healthy, just, sustainable communities.'

While it promises to 'end unemployment in America once and for all by guaranteeing a job at a living wage for every American willing and able to work,' it does not say how it would pay for the salaries associated with the federal jobs it would be creating.

The provision merely states: 'A Full Employment Program will create up to 20 million jobs, both directly and indirectly, by implementing a nationally-funded, locally-controlled, direct employment initiative replacing unemployment offices with local employment offices.

'The government will be the employer of last resort, offering jobs meeting community-identified needs in the public and non-profit sectors to take up any slack in private for-profit sector employment.'

Jobs will primarily be introduced in the sustainable energy and energy efficiency retrofitting sectors, with mass transit, sustainable organic agriculture, clean manufacturing, infrastructure, and public services like education and child care services creating new opportunities, too.

While the Green New Deal doesn't explicitly lay out plans for a Medicare-for-All type program, it is adjacent to the liberal climate change wish list that dips into health care.

It would increase government health care spending by $32.6 trillion over 10 years, according to another study released over the summer by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.

Green New Deal co-author Ed Markey said Tuesday that it's clear that McConnell is trying to 'score political points' off his climate change resolution

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday that he'll force Democrats to vote on the Green New Deal before the long, August recess. The move will force them to put their support for the plan on the record.

'The only thing I would ask is if this is such a popular thing to do and so necessary, why would one to dodge the vote. This is an opportunity to go on record,' McConnell said Tuesday during a news conference. 'It's a debate we'll have in all likelihood sometime before the August break.'

Some Democratic senators such as Dianne Feinstein of California and Patty Murray of Washington have said they will vote present on the bill.

Murray accused McConnell of playing political games with the bill on Tuesday.

'I think it's very clear that this is a topic that people around the country are excited about,' she told DailyMail.com. 'Mitch is only bringing it up for political purposes. And I'm happy to vote present.'

Asked if she thought the resolution could pass, she said: 'He's not trying to make it pass, and I would ask what are Republicans doing to really deal with climate change.'

Markey, the co-author of the Senate resolution, also slammed McConnell's tactics.

'It's all Mitch McConnell, putting things on the floor, to divide Democrats. He promised he wouldn't put anything on the floor that President Trump wouldn't sign, he's already going back on his word.'

McConnell made those comments in the context of the government shutdown and a various spending bills that could pass the Senate but would be rejected by President Trump.

The Democratic senator said nonetheless that when it comes to the Green New Deal, it's clear that McConnell is trying to 'score political points' off the climate change resolution.

'He doesn't have any interest in moving anything legislative. It's just all theatrics for McConnell,' he charged.

Democratic presidential contender Kamala Harris dismissed the trillions of dollars liberal programs like the Green New Deal and Medicare-for-All could cost taxpayers

Democratic presidential contenders have all lined up to support the deal, including Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris.

Appearing on Fox News' 'Special Report' on Monday evening, Gillibrand, a New York senator with an exploratory committee, compared the proposal to John F. Kennedy's plans to send a man to the moon in 10 years.

'It will be a measure of our innovation, our entrepreneurialism, our excellence. Why not say to the American people, ""Global climate change is not only real, but the urgency of this moment requires a call to action to all of America’s engineers, all of our entrepreneurs, all of our innovators to ... solve the problems together?"" ' she said.

Gillibrand called climate change the 'the greatest threat to humanity we have' in in the interview.

California senator and Democratic presidential candidate Harris dismissed the trillions of dollars that the liberal program could cost taxpayers on Sunday, saying it wasn't about the amount of money spent but the investment.

'One of the things that I admire and respect is the measurement that is captured in three letters, ROI. What's the return on the investment?' she told CNN's 'Inside Politics' program. 'People in the private sector understand this really well. It's not about a cost. It's about an investment.'

Asked if the country could afford such costly programs like Medicare-for-All and the Green New Deal, Harris told CNN: 'Of course, we can afford it.'

The California senator said there were practical ways of implementing such policies.

'There's no question we have to be practical. But being practical also recognizes that climate change is an existential threat to us as human beings.

'Being practical recognizes that greenhouse gas emissions are threatening our air and threatening the planet, and that it is well within our capacity as human beings to change our behaviors in a way that we can reduce its effects.

Notley was in Ottawa Thursday giving the Senate her take on Bill C-69, the Impact Assessment Act, which overhauls the way energy projects are assessed for their effects on the environment as well as contributions to the country’s social and economic well-being.

When Environment Minister Catherine McKenna introduced the legislation a year ago, she said it was designed to attract new investment by giving the industry certainty about the criteria by which their proposed projects would be assessed and set timelines for reviews.

Notley says the bill does the opposite.

“I will give (the Liberal government) credit for stepping in to buy Trans Mountain, but I also think there is a high level of investor uncertainty that exists right now in the way in which it’s written,” she said in a press conference after the committee meeting.

“We cannot allow that uncertainty to continue. You can’t build trust by saying, ‘Trust us.’ You build trust by providing clarity.”

Other provincial governments of different political stripes have joined Notley in calls for changes to the bill before it becomes law.

On Thursday, the Senate committee studying the bill heard requests from Newfoundland Premier Dwight Ball and Saskatchewan Energy Minister Bronwyn Eyre. Ontario Energy Minister Greg Rickford presented to the Senate’s energy committee earlier this week.

Ball agreed with Notley that scrapping C-69 is not the way to go, but asked for amendments to exempt offshore oil exploration. He said the bill will drive capital investments elsewhere, to places where production doesn’t have the same environmental protections as Canada does.

Rickford told the committee C-69, as written, would make building new or replacing existing pipelines “impossible” and fears it will impede Ontario’s nuclear energy policies.

The federal government hasn’t yet published a list of project types that would be affected by the legislation.

The House of Commons made more than 130 amendments before it landed in the Senate. Tim McMillan, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, told the committee last week the changes from MPs made the bill more complicated and provided less clarity.

McMillan said the long, drawn-out legal challenges that have delayed the Trans Mountain pipeline will be the norm if the bill passes as-is. In particular, there is too much discretion given to cabinet to interfere in a project’s approval, he said.

McKenna’s spokeswoman Sabrina Kim said in a statement Thursday the government is open to considering additional amendments. She blames the environmental assessment policies of the former Conservatives for the legal challenges delaying energy projects, and said the Liberals are keen to ensure the system protects the environment while still getting Canadian resources to market.

Among the amendments Notley wants to see are a hard two-year deadline for the assessment and review process. She noted the proposal to expand Trans Mountain, which would triple an existing pipeline’s capacity between Edmonton and Burnaby, B.C., was first brought forward in 2013 and remains mired in legal battles.

Notley also wants most new Alberta energy projects, including in-situ oilsands developments and petrochemical refineries, exempted from the bill because of existing provincial review processes and her government’s climate-change policies.

She said the Alberta government has attracted $12 billion in investments for petrochemical and upgrading facilities. “We don’t want to see that caught up in duplicative regimes that scare away investors we’ve worked so hard to attract,” she said.

Notley told senators Alberta’s struggle to get its oil to market has become a national unity issue, noting her government forced oil companies in the fall to cut production because of a collapse in oil prices.

“Over in the Maritimes they are importing Saudi oil. Here in Ontario you are importing American oil, both at world prices, and meanwhile in Alberta we are cutting production,” she said. “I told (the Senate) very clearly this is not how you build a country.”

The proposed Energy East pipeline that would have carried Alberta crude to eastern Canadian refineries was abandoned in 2017 with TransCanada citing market changes and uncertainty created by federal government policies.

Notley said if C-69 passes, it will certainly discourage anyone from trying to get that pipeline back underway.","Makes no sense for Ottawa to buy pipeline, then pass Bill C-69, Notley tells Senate - Calgary Herald",Nationalpost.com,https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/notley-says-new-energy-assessment-bill-conflicts-with-purchase-of-pipeline

The post Canadian PM Justin Trudeau facing calls to resign because of a political influence scandal appeared first on Hot Air.","While everyone in the U.S. was watching the Cohen testimony Wednesday, some even more dramatic testimony was happening in Canada. Former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould testified that she had faced a sustained, political pressure campaign from the Prime Minister and others acting on his behalf to intervene in the prosecution of a Quebec-based engineering company called SNC-Lavalin.

Wilson-Raybould, her Deputy AG, and her Chief of Staff were contacted approximately 20 times (half in person, half by phone) over a period of four months to demand that she intervene in the case and allow for a deferred prosecution agreement which would essentially allow SNC to pay its way out of legal trouble. During many of those discussions, it became very clear the motive for the demands was nakedly political. The company had threatened to pack up its Montreal headquarters and move to London, potentially creating a job-losing spectacle just weeks before an election. The Prime Minister was worried his party would suffer unless the company was given a pass.

On Feb. 7, the Globe and Mail reported that Wilson-Raybould had been subject to a pressure campaign by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has been slowly admitting to more and more contact with AG Wilson-Raybould on the matter but she was not able to say anything because the conversations were covered by “solicitor-client privilege.” But under public pressure, PM Trudeau waived that privilege and so yesterday Wilson-Raybould gave a lengthy statement detailing the pressure campaign followed by three hours of questioning.

Wilson-Raybould’s recounting of every contact made with her about the SNC-Lavalin case is too long to excerpt in full, but here is her own summary from the start of her testimony:

For a period of approximately four months between September and December 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the Attorney General of Canada in an inappropriate effort to secure a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with SNC-Lavalin. These events involved 11 people (excluding myself and my political staff) – from the Prime Minister’s Office, the Privy Council Office, and the Office of the Minister of Finance. This included in-person conversations, telephone calls, emails, and text messages. There were approximately 10 phone calls and 10 meetings specifically about SNC-Lavalin that I and/or my staff was a part of. Within these conversations, there were express statements regarding the necessity for interference in the SNC-Lavalin matter, the potential for consequences, and veiled threats if a DPA was not made available to SNC. These conversations culminated on December 19, 2018, with a phone conversation I had with the Clerk of the Privy Council – a conversation for which I will provide some significant detail. A few weeks later, on January 7, 2019, I was informed by the Prime Minister that I was being shuffled out of the role of Minister of Justice and the Attorney General of Canada.

On Sep. 4, 2018 Wilson-Raybould was informed by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Kathleen Roussel, that there would be no deferred prosecution agreement in the SNC-Lavalin case. Two days later, the AG’s office began getting calls from other elements within the government asking that Wilson-Raybould intercede. On Sep. 17th Wilson-Raybould was scheduled to have a meeting with PM Trudeau on an unrelated issue. However, as soon as she entered his office he began talking about SNC-Lavalin:

The Prime Minister asks me to help out – to find a solution here for SNC – citing that if there was no DPA there would be many jobs lost and that SNC will move from Montreal. In response, I explained to him the law and what I have the ability to do and not do under the Director of Public Prosecutions Act around issuing Directives or Assuming Conduct of Prosecutions. I told him that I had done my due diligence and made up my mind on SNC and that I was not going to interfere with the decision of the DPP. In response the PM further reiterated his concerns. I then explained how this came about and that I had received the section 13 note from the DPP earlier in September and that I had considered the matter very closely. I further stated that I was very clear on my role as the AG – and I am not prepared to issue a directive in this case – that it was not appropriate. The PM again cited potential loss of jobs and SNC moving. Then to my surprise – the Clerk started to make the case for the need to have a DPA – he said “there is a board meeting on Thursday (Sept 20) with stock holders” … “they will likely be moving to London if this happens”… “and there is an election in Quebec soon”… At that point the PM jumped in stressing that there is an election in Quebec and that “and I am an MP in Quebec – the member for Papineau”. I was quite taken aback. My response – and I remember this vividly – was to ask the PM a direct question while looking him in the eye – I asked: “Are you politically interfering with my role / my decision as the AG? I would strongly advise against it.” The Prime Minister said “No, No, No – we just need to find a solution.”

That’s really a good summary of how the entire campaign went. People kept calling and claiming there had to be some “solution” while simultaneously pretending they were not involved in a pressure campaign to arrange politically motivated justice. On December 18th, Wilson-Raybould’s Chief of Staff was summoned for a meeting with Trudeau’s principal secretary, i.e. his top political adviser, Gerald Butts. After the meeting, the Chief of Staff texted a summary of what happened to Wilson-Raybould:

Basically, they want a solution. Nothing new. They want external counsel retained to give you an opinion on whether you can review the DPP’s decision here and whether you should in this case. … I told them that would be interference. Gerry said “Jess, there is no solution here that doesn’t involve some interference.” At least they are finally being honest about what they are asking you to do!

Last Monday, as the scandal was spreading, Gerald Butts resigned. From the NY Times:

In a statement announcing his departure, Gerald Butts, who has been a close friend of Mr. Trudeau’s since their university days, linked his leaving to the allegations that he, the prime minister and others improperly pressured Jody Wilson-Raybould, when she was the justice minister and attorney general, to quash the criminal prosecution of a major Canadian engineering and construction company. Mr. Butts repeatedly denied in his resignation letter that any such action took place. “Any accusation that I or the staff put pressure on the attorney general is simply not true,” Mr. Butts wrote. “But the fact is that this accusation exists. It cannot and should not take one moment away from the vital work the prime minister and his office is doing for all Canadians.”

Those denials ring pretty hollow in light of the text messages and other contemporaneous accounts which Wilson-Raybould made of the interference campaign. The final act of this disgrace came on January 7, 2019 when, having not succumbed to the pressure, Wilson-Raybould was abruptly removed from her job by the PM:

On January 7, I received a call from the PM and was informed I was being shuffled out of my role as MOJAG. I will not go into details of this call, or subsequent communications about the shuffle, but I will say that I stated I believed the reason was because of the SNC matter. They denied this to be the case. On January 11, 2019 – the Friday before the shuffle. My former Deputy Minister is called by the Clerk and told that the shuffle is happening, and that she will be getting a new Minister. As part of this conversation, the Clerk tells the Deputy that one of the first conversations that the new Minister will be expected to have with the PM will be on SNC Lavalin. In other words, that the new Minister will need to be prepared to speak to the PM on this file.

Could it be any more blatant? Yesterday, Paul Wells wrote a scathing opinion piece for Macleans about the scandal:

What the former attorney general described tonight is a sickeningly smug protection racket whose participants must have been astonished when she refused to play along. If a company can rewrite the Criminal Code to get out of a trial whose start date was set before the legislation was drafted, all because a doomed Quebec government has its appointment with the voter, then which excesses are not permitted, under the same justification? If a Clerk of the Privy Council can claim with a straight face that ten calls and meetings with the attorney general, during which massive job loss, an angry PM and a lost election are threatened, don’t constitute interference, then what on earth would interference look like?

In the wake of Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, opposition leader Andrew Scheer called on Trudeau to resign from office: “Like many of you I listened carefully to the testimony of the former attorney general and like many of you I was sickened and appalled by her story of inappropriate and, frankly, bordering on illegal pressure brought to bear on her by the highest officials of Justin Trudeau’s government, all to let a Liberal-connected corporation off the hook on serious corruption charges.”

But just this morning Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland went on CBC and said: “I have 100 percent faith in the prime minister.” So it looks like the liberals are not going to call for Trudeau’s ouster and are instead going to stick with the claim that this political pressure campaign was not a political pressure campaign.

In February 1989, audiences saw, for the first time, a young Keanu Reeves lean close to a young Alex Winter and declare, “Strange things are afoot at the Circle-K.”

It was a critical moment, not only in the plot of Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure, but in pop culture. As the movie posters had it, history was about to be rewritten by two guys who couldn’t spell. It was a goofy movie, and most of the critics didn’t get it. Teenagers did, though. For those of us who were young in 1989, Bill and Ted gave us exactly the time travel movie we needed.

Now they might be able to do it again.

A new Bill and Ted movie is in pre-production. There are reasons to be circumspect; people have been talking about a new Bill and Ted movie for years. And the franchise that followed Excellent Adventure—a second movie, animated series, video games—was uneven, to put it charitably.

It’s worth remembering, too, that the original movie has serious problems. There’s a homophobic slur played for humor, most of the female characters exist solely to satisfy a really gross male gaze, and the historical figures whose perspectives on modern life form the film’s MacGuffin are nearly uniformly white and male. To rewatch Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure is to smile, to groan, and to cringe.

But the movie did one thing very right: it made a time-travel movie about how history can be shaped by joy and friendship. And it made it at precisely the right moment.

Time travel as a genre is about cause and consequence, about the constant of change. It’s about how we got here, as individuals and as a civilization, and where we want to go. “We have to ask these questions, don’t we?” James Gleick writes in Time Travel: A History. “Is the world we have the only world possible? Could everything have turned out differently?”

In the mid-1980s, time-travel movies tended to be informed by regret, fear and nostalgia. In the United States, this was a period bookended by a recession and a stock market crash. Scientists had just confirmed that acid rain was a serious threat. Christopher Hitchens railed in The Nation in 1985 about “the rulers of our world, who subject us to lectures about the need to oppose terrorism while they prepare, daily and hourly, for the annihilation of us all.”

Yeah, it was a cheerful age.

In 1984’s Terminator, we learned that the future was trying to kill us. The following year, the past tried to take a piece of us too.

Back to the Future was the first time-travel movie I saw, and as fun as it was, it was also terrifying. There’s a minor chord running through it, from the gun-toting terrorists in the van, to the family photograph from which Marty McFly slowly disappears. Back to the Future was literally about the existential horror of living in a world determined by Baby Boomers’ choices. It was, in other words, peak 1985.

Then in 1986, we got Peggy Sue Got Married, about a woman who is transported back to 1960 to come to terms with her life choices. Again.

“Regret is the time traveler’s energy bar,” writes Gleick. And in the mid-1980s, there seemed to be no shortage of things to regret.

But by the end of that decade, something had shifted. There were signs that apartheid’s days were numbered in South Africa, perestroika was underway in the Soviet Union, and the Berlin Wall was soon to come down. People were using the phrase “new world order” without irony.

“What we may be witnessing is not just the end of the Cold War,” wrote Francis Fukuyama in 1989, “or the passing of a particular period of post-war history, but the end of history as such: that is, the end point of mankind’s ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.”

The end of history.

Into that moment stepped Bill S. Preston, Esq. (Winter) and Ted “Theodore” Logan (Reeves), two high-school kids in San Dimas, California, who are about to fail their history presentation. If they do, Ted’s father will send him away to military school, which means the two will never learn to play their guitars.

This matters, it turns out. Bill and Ted are about to learn that we humans can dare to ask for more than survival. The future can be awesome, with a little help from the past.

Time Travel: A History is a book mainly composed of questions and narrative told at a distance, but on one point, Gleick takes a stand. He discusses Ray Bradbury’s “A Sound of Thunder” and Isaac Asimov’s The End of Eternity and declares: “Bradbury was right and Asimov was wrong. If history is a dynamical system, it’s surely non-linear, and the butterfly effect must obtain. At some places, some times, a slight divergence can transform history… Nodal points must exist, just not necessarily where we think.”

Strange things are afoot at the Circle-K.

Bill and Ted are definitely not Great Men of history. But they matter. A man named Rufus (George Carlin) tells them that a future utopia is founded on the music of their band, Wyld Stallyns. If Ted goes to military school, none of that can happen. So they have to kick ass on their history presentation.

Which they do, of course, in charmingly earnest fashion.

The reviewers were confused. “The stars themselves are frisky and companionable, like unkempt ponies,” wrote Hal Hinson in the Washington Post. “If ignorance is bliss, these are the most blissed-out kids ever. But because the characters they’re playing and the lingo they spout are already out of date, the timing of the picture seems out of whack. It’s peddling last year’s hip.”

I was a 12-year-old living in rural Manitoba and I didn’t know last year’s hip from a flying phone booth. Like all my friends, I incorporated “whoa” and “dude” and “excellent” into my vocabulary. The movie taught kids how to navigate the 1990s.

And it helped audiences prepare for the comedy of the 1990s. The series of Wayne’s World sketches on Saturday Night Live, also featuring a couple of earnest and clueless dudes who say, “party on” a lot, began the day after Bill and Ted hit theaters (although the Wayne character had actually debuted on Canadian television in 1987).

It didn’t matter what the critics thought of these kinds of characters. We were young at the end of history. We wanted to believe we weren’t trapped. We wanted joy. And we wanted to be excellent to each other.

And now here we are, looking back at the putative end of history three decades later, looking into a future in which the consequences of climate change are and will be devastating, and that’s only the beginning of our worries. Could 50-something Bill and 50-something Ted bring us a movie with hope for the future and affection for past? A movie about time travel that celebrates friendship and goodwill—and that manages to do it without the toxic masculinity this time?

Or will it be an insipid nostalgia piece, a return to time travel as the genre of regret?

I’ll be first in line to find out.

Now that the NDP leader will have a seat in Parliament, can he still turn around the party's fortunes before this year's federal election?","With his win in the federal byelection in Burnaby South, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has an opportunity to put to rest some of his doubters both outside the NDP and, more importantly, within. Now that he has a seat in the House of Commons, Singh can reset his leadership and move on from a challenging beginning.

This byelection win also comes at a fortuitous time as the SNC-Lavalin controversy continues to undermine Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s credibility with progressive voters, while Conservative leader Andrew Scheer’s increasingly populist and anti-immigrant rhetoric potentially alienates members of Canada’s diaspora communities.

As any scholar of the Canadian left or long-suffering New Democrat can tell you, whenever the NDP shows weakness, pundits and Liberal commentators come out of the woodwork to herald the NDP’s inevitable demise and Canada’s return to two-party politics.

NDP has faced oblivion before

The federal NDP came closest to political oblivion in 1993, when its caucus was reduced to nine members in the face of Jean Chrétien’s Liberal wave. Even then, the NDP persevered and came back to fight another day. And even if Singh had lost the byelection, the NDP would have survived, but its time in the wilderness would likely have been extended and Singh’s leadership would have been threatened.

When Singh was decisively elected leader of the NDP in October 2017, New Democrats and progressive Canadians were right to be optimistic. Over the course of the leadership campaign, he galvanized supporters around a hopeful message reminiscent of Jack Layton’s leadership. His campaign also held out the promise that he could effect inroads into Canada’s diverse and vote-rich suburban communities.

Almost immediately after his election however, things seemed to turn sour for the new leader. Not only did Singh have to contend with multiple controversies within his caucus, NDP fundraising —already anemic in the aftermath of the disappointing results of the 2015 federal election —continued to decline. This was of particular concern because of the extra costs the party had to bear paying Singh’s salary and travel, costs that would have been covered by the House of Commons had he already held a seat.

A polarized electorate

Singh has also had to deal with the potential polarization of the election question as a choice between Trudeau’s progressive Canada and the increasingly divisive and nativist Canada envisioned by the Conservatives.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang

There is still every possibility that the coming federal election could again see the Liberals wrap themselves in a progressive banner and squeeze the NDP out of a two-party race, but now that Singh has a seat in Parliament, he will be better able to insert himself into that debate.

The importance of this byelection win is that it allows Singh to draw a hard line under the first 17 months of his leadership. Even before the byelection was called, Singh had already started to make changes in personnel and direction that bode well for his future.

In November, the NDP announced that Jennifer Howard would be taking over as Singh’s new chief of staff. Howard has held multiple cabinet appointments in the Manitoba governments of Gary Doer and Greg Selinger, at one point serving as finance minister, but, more importantly, has held staff and leadership positions at all levels of the NDP. She represents the experience and wealth of political knowledge that was seen as lacking.

It is also important to remember that Singh is still relatively new to the job and has time to recover. In this regard, the recent history of the NDP can provide some context.

Layton needed eight years

When he was elected leader of the NDP in January 2003, Jack Layton was a more experienced politician, having served as a Toronto City and Metro councillor for over 20 years. Yet it still took him eight years to create the conditions that allowed the NDP to make its breakthrough in the 2011 federal election.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck

Layton avoided some of Singh’s early mistakes, selecting leadership rival and veteran MP Bill Blaikie (whom I worked for at the time) as his parliamentary leader, for example, but he started with a much smaller caucus without a presence in Québec and with only a minimal presence in Ontario.

There’s no question that Singh’s first year did not go as planned. The momentum and excitement that surrounded his election as leader could have boosted fundraising, mobilized members and helped establish his presence on the national stage. And Singh’s slow start could ultimately end up affecting his ability to succeed in the future.

But this byelection win presents him with a chance to change the narrative and become a contender in the coming federal election.",Byelection win offers Singh an opportunity to reset his leadership,Theconversation.com,http://theconversation.com/byelection-win-offers-singh-an-opportunity-to-reset-his-leadership-112500

Will he one day be known as Prime Minister Singh after this fall’s federal election?

Singh got the first part out of the way, winning the byelection with 8,800 votes, or 39 per cent of the vote.

Liberal candidate Richard Lee (who replaced candidate Karen Wang partway through the campaign) came second with 5,930 votes, or 26 per cent of the vote.

Conservative candidate Jay Shin placed third with 5,133 votes, or about 22.5 per cent of the vote.

People’s Party of Canada candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson did better than some people expected with 2,420, about 10.6 per cent of the vote.

Independents Terry Grimwood had 1.1 per cent of the vote and Valentine Wu 0.7 per cent.

Overall voter turnout was just 30 per cent.

Singh took the stage and thanked the other candidates for their contribution to the democratic process. He also thanked the party’s volunteers and supporters.

“I am humbled by your belief in me,” he said.

“I will be your champion,” Singh also said. “I will take each and every one of you to Ottawa. I will fight for you in the House of Commons.”

Singh, the first visible minority leader of a major federal party, said that when he was growing up, he never imagined seeing someone who looked like him running to be the prime minister of Canada.

“We just showed a lot of kids out there that yes we can,” he said, borrowing a slogan from former U.S. President Barack Obama.

The campaign was marred by shouting matches at campaign debates over such issues as immigration and refugees. There was also plenty of questionable campaign material distributed by some candidates during the past few weeks.

Before results rolled in, Vancouver East MP Jenny Kwan said she was confident Singh would serve Burnaby South well and boost the party’s fortunes.

“Jagmeet has made a decision,” Kwan told the NOW. “He’s chosen Burnaby South as his home. He’s moved his family here. Absolutely, I believe he can represent the people of Burnaby South and bring their issues forward. He’s been out in those doorsteps every single night, talking to people about what matters to them, what’s concerning to them and to ensure that there voice is going to be heard.”

Kwan continued: “I’ve been out door-knocking with Jagmeet in the rain, in the sun, in the snow and so I’m very optimistic about tonight and I’m super, super excited to have Jagmeet in the House of Commons with the NDP caucus.”

Burnaby Mayor Mike Hurley said he was excited to the city represented by a party leader. He said he hopes Singh can help bring much-needed federal housing funds to Burnaby.

The night also saw the nascent People’s Party of Canada receive approximately 11 per cent of the vote. The local candidate, Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson, repeatedly brought up the murder of Burnaby teen Marrisa Shen during the election as a reason to screen refugees more stringently.

(The man accused in the murder is a Syrian refugee who has yet to have his charges tested in court.)

Hurley said he thinks the PPC tapped into “fear and misunderstanding in the community.”

At a hearing of the Commons justice committee, Wilson-Raybould described a “consistent and sustained effort” to prevent construction giant SNC-Lavalin from being prosecuted in a bribery case. The former justice minister accused senior ranks of the federal government, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, of targeting her with “veiled threats” as they tried to interfere.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called for Trudeau’s resignation, while Green party Leader Elizabeth May and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said they want a public inquiry into the allegations. Trudeau said Wednesday evening that he “completely” disagreed with Wilson-Raybould’s characterization of the events.

While Wilson-Raybould’s fellow Liberal members of parliament deferred to Trudeau, others said they believed her and offered her praise.

“I think she’s a hero,” said Peter Julian, NDP MP for New Westminster–Burnaby.

Julian said he was dismayed by Trudeau and his government’s alleged conduct, and said he believes Wilson-Raybould lost her job as justice minister as a direct result of her standing up for the integrity of Canada’s court system.

“I think she’s very courageous,” Julian said. “Pressure was put on her. She talked about veiled threats and consequences being repeatedly expressed to her.”

The testimony itself was unlike anything he has seen in his decades in Canadian politics, he added.

“I think it should raise flags for all Canadians about how this prime minister and how this government deals with fundamental issues of principals and our court system, and all the principals that, I think, for so many Canadians they hold dear,” he said.

LISTEN: This week on In The House, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw discuss NDP leader Jagmeet Singh’s victory in the federal Burnaby-South byelection, the NDP government’s response to threatened school closures in Vancouver, the latest in the legislature spending scandal and the province’s response to a measles outbreak.

Dan Albas, Conservative MP for Central Okanagan–Similkameen–Nicola, said he found Wilson-Raybould’s testimony detailed, specific and explosive. He was stunned when she described the pressure she had been put under.

“The prime minister, by the very act of the allegations and subsequent coverup, has lost the moral authority to lead this country,” Albas said.

“It’s the right of every Canadian to have equality under the law and Mr. Trudeau, by trying to grant a favour to friends in this company, jeopardized that by intervening in what is supposed to be an independent prosecution.”

Albas said Wilson-Raybould was in a cabinet position for good reason, and took the role seriously under intense pressure.

“The litany of people that put pressure on her is breathtaking, based on her testimony,” said Jenny Kwan, NDP MP for Vancouver East. “The prime minister maintained and continues to maintain that there was no inappropriate pressure put on Ms. Wilson-Raybould but clearly, based on her account, the pressure was there to see.”

Kwan, whose riding borders Wilson-Raybould’s in Vancouver Granville, said she often sees the former justice minister at public events. She admires the courage it has taken her to testify, she said.

“I’ve always had a lot of respect for Ms. Wilson-Raybould, even though we are on different sides of the political spectrum,” Kwan said. “This situation really has just reinforced that for me.”

Related

Green Leader May, who is MP for Saanich–Gulf Islands, said that while Wilson-Raybould was constrained in what she could say by solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidentially requirements, “she was entirely credible, she was so impressive and displayed such integrity.”

Wilson-Raybould made it clear that she had been subjected to a pattern of inappropriate pressure from politicians and, what May found most shocking, from the civil service, she said.

“What Jody Wilson-Raybould revealed today, Canadians would be forgiven for having this shake their confidence in our institutions,” May said. “To serve the interests of SNC-Lavalin over the interests of Canadians institutions and our constitution is deeply, deeply troubling.”

Mira Oreck, director of stakeholder relations for B.C. Premier John Horgan, ran against Wilson-Raybould in the Vancouver Granville riding in 2015. She declined to be interviewed but said she stood by a message she posted Wednesday on Twitter.

“The calm, strength and clarity of @Puglaas in this testimony is stunning and inspiring,” Oreck wrote, referring to Wilson-Raybould’s Twitter handle, Puglaas, which means “woman born to noble people” in the Kwak’wala language.

Wednesday morning at Wilson-Raybould’s Vancouver constituency office, staff didn’t want to comment ahead of her testimony but said they planned to watch it live in the office’s small lobby.

Dozens of passersby, asked whether they were following the testimony, said they were not keeping a close eye on federal politics. Some said they were preoccupied by events in the U.S., particularly the bombshell testimony of Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump’s former personal lawyer.

But a few said they either looked forward to reviewing Wilson-Raybould’s testimony later in the day, or had been tuning into broadcasts as often as possible.

“I was so impressed,” said Alan Rees, 77, of Richmond. “If anybody wants to know why there is such a disdain for politicians, I think this illustrated it. It’s been a long time since we’ve seen any politician open up honestly, show integrity, tell the truth, without any fear. A lifelong conservative may just change his mind.”

Rees lamented that any action on her testimony might be delayed by the federal election on Oct. 21, 2019. But how it is handled will show to the world what democracy means in Canada, he added.

“What should happen is a few people should be smacked on the knuckles and maybe fined, and perhaps even go to jail,” he said.

Scott Girling, 57, from South Surrey, said he was disappointed with the federal government, its “silence” and Trudeau’s attitude toward the situation.

“I just wanted her to be able to tell her story, tell the truth, whatever that is,” he said. “I’m sure people will be scrambling to try to save their name or the jobs, or save face for the particular party that they’re with.”

Barbara Onneken, 62, from Maple Ridge, said she wasn’t surprised by what Wilson-Raybould said in her testimony.

“We expected that and we’re really happy that she did get to speak, because it is her right to speak,” she said.

“He (Trudeau) needs to come clean.”

The Vancouver Granville Liberal riding association could not be reached for comment.

University of the Fraser Valley political scientist Hamish Telford told Postmedia News that he watched Wilson-Raybould’s testimony in class with students.

“My students thought that this would be damaging to the prime minister. That it’s hard to deny that there was a far amount of pressure being applied.”

Telford said Wilson-Raybould had indicated she would run again in her riding of Vancouver Granville in the October election.

“We think as a Liberal, but we aren’t entirely sure about that,” he said.

He said that the one important thing that Wilson-Raybould did not reveal was why it was decided in September that that the bribery charges against SNC Lavalin should go to criminal prosecution and not be dealt with through a remediation process as the prime minister apparently wanted.

Meanwhile, Premier Rachel Notley goes to Ottawa to convince senators that an entirely different bill is ruinous to western oil, gas and other resources.

On vivid display is the Trudeau government’s fierce loyalty to Quebec, and its destructive paternalism toward the West’s interests.

Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould riveted the nation on Wednesday with her tale of improper pressure to drop charges against SNC-Lavalin.

As that was happening, Montreal’s La Presse broke news of SNC-Lavalin apparently paying $30,000 in 2008 for “sexual services” for the son of the former Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi.

He was visiting Canada hoping to improve his English, apparently starting with “yes, yes!”

On Thursday, Notley was desperately trying to persuade senators to radically improve Bill C-69.

It was left to two women, both lawyers, to make calm and reasonable cases for fair law wisely applied.

The Liberals wanted Wilson-Raybould to bend the law so that SNC-Lavalin wouldn’t face criminal trial for charges of bribery and fraud in Libya.

Notley is trying to save the country from a law which is either astonishingly sloppy, or actively designed to drive Alberta’s main industry out of business.

Only days ago, we might have suspected simple incompetence. Now the sleaze of the SNC-Lavalin case suggests something more cunning and intentional.

It’s not as if Bill C-69 is anything new. It has passed five votes in the Commons and the Senate since last February. Even the dimmest Liberal legislator had time to see its dire implications.

But they keep on passing that thing.

Second Commons reading was March 19 last year. Then came third reading on June 20.

Off to the Senate it went, for passage on first reading the same day, and second reading Dec. 12.

It’s now one vote call from utter disaster.

Several provinces have sent urgent submissions to Ottawa, warning that the bill will delay projects endlessly while giving all the say to objectors, and no credit at all to positive economic impacts and job creation of any project.

The bill as it stands is a power grab of Canada’s resource sector by Catherine McKenna’s environment and climate change department. Unusually, it was sponsored by her, not the natural resources minister.

C-69 also challenges provincial ownership and development of natural resources, a constitutional guarantee.

The feds could step into Alberta, for instance, and re-regulate a refinery project or local pipeline already studied and approved by the province.

One of Notley’s arguments Thursday was that Ottawa should leave projects within a province to provincial regulators.

She pointed out, for possibly the 1,000th time, that Alberta has strict regulation and also a vigorous environmental and climate plan.

The premier got friendly attention from New Brunswick and Nova Scotia senators. Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Dwight Ball shared many of her concerns.

And everybody wonders, why would Ottawa want to regulate all these things?

The week’s events suggest what Notley clearly suspects: it’s all about control that would eventually be used to wind down oil and gas as a major national industry.

She demands a clear legal statement of what Bill C-69 would regulate, and what it would not. She says the minister should only be able to add a project to the review list if it clearly involved federal jurisdiction.

Federal officials have provided assurances all this will be done.

But Notley saved her best line for last:

“You’re not going to build trust in industry by saying ‘trust us.’ And there’s a lot of ‘trust us’ in the current version (of C-69).”

She wants the issues made clear in law. That would be better, although the Liberals have already shown what happens when they don’t like a clear law.

Trust them? This week, who could?

Trade

“Cautious optimism in Beijing for US-China trade deal” [South China Morning Post]. “China’s senior diplomat Wang Yi said on Monday that the latest round of trade talks with the US had provided “positive prospects” on Sino-American ties and the global economy, as state media reacted with cautious optimism. The talks between chief negotiators in Washington, described by Wang at a Beijing event as “achieving concrete progress”, yielded an immediate delay to US President Donald Trump’s planned extra tariffs on Chinese imports. Commentaries from top Communist Party mouthpieces like newspaper﻿ People’s Daily and state news agency Xinhua said that the just-concluded round of talks in Washington sent a cautiously positive sign for a settlement to the friction between the world’s two biggest economies, but also cautioned that any final deal would face criticism both within China and the US.”

“Trump delays tariff hike initially scheduled for March” [Supply Chain Dive]. “Tariffs on $200 billion worth of imports from China will remain at the current level of 10% for the time being, after President Donald Trump tweeted Sunday evening he would delay the scheduled increase to 25%. He did not specify the future date until which the tariff hike might be delayed…. The tweets from Trump come in contrast to Lighthizer’s repeated message that March 1 is a ‘hard deadline’ for the U.S. and China to hammer out a deal. The USTR had not released a statement on the tariff delay as of press time.”

“Wary of Trump’s Approach, Governors Seek to Forge Own Trade Agreements” [Governing]. “As the Trump administration seeks to renegotiate trade deals with countries around the world, governors have been stepping up their own efforts to promote their states abroad, acting as salesmen and women for home-state companies and trying to bring in foreign investment. Appearances by foreign leaders have become almost a standing feature of National Governors Association events. At the NGA’s winter meeting in Washington this weekend, governors met with provincial counterparts and trade officials from Canada, Mexico and Japan.”

Politics

“But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?” –James Madison, Federalist 51

“They had one weapon left and both knew it: treachery.” –Frank Herbert, Dune

2020

Trump: “Trump’s Secret to Victory in 2020: Hispanic Voters” [Politico]. “Many expected Hispanics to vote overwhelmingly against Trump in 2016. A Latino Decisions poll conducted just before the 2016 presidential election found Trump had the support of just 18 percent of Hispanics. But the actual figure was 28 percent, which—given Trump’s incendiary rhetoric about immigrants—some analysts and pundits refused to believe from exit polls until further studies confirmed it… A party that has staked its future on a belief that America’s demographic picture is changing decidedly in its favor could find itself losing to a man whose politics of fear should be driving precisely those voters into the Democrats’ waiting arms…. A party that has staked its future on a belief that America’s demographic picture is changing decidedly in its favor could find itself losing to a man whose politics of fear should be driving precisely those voters into the Democrats’ waiting arms.” • It’s occurred to me that the Venezuelan flap is more about irrendentist Latinx votes in Florida 2020 than anything else; remember that Florida Democrat fossil Donna Shalala, and the Democrats, tried to outdo Trump with anti-Maduro rhetoric (in effect giving him the green light) way back in January. Biden: Adding to this: Joe Biden has also made job offers in South Carolina, a source tells me. https://t.co/0V54h3Io27 — maxwell (@maxwellstrachan) February 26, 2019 Oh, good. Warren: “Elizabeth Warren opens door to reparations for Native Americans” [WaPo]. “Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Friday evening that Native Americans should be “part of the conversation” on reparations, showing a willingness to expand the debate over whether minority groups that have faced discrimination should be financially compensated by the federal government. Warren is one of four Democratic presidential hopefuls who have said in recent days that they are open to providing some type of reparations to African Americans who are descendants of people who were enslaved in the United States, although they have offered varying levels of details about how the goal would be achieved.” Sanders (1): There is still lingering bitterness among some HRC supporters from 2016; questions about his age and the practicality-or even wisdom-of his ideas. But, as he showed tonight, Bernie’s a feisty old bird, who isn’t going away. — David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) February 26, 2019 The responses are quite something, but (perhaps because) Axelrod is doing a very gentle form of reality therapy… Sanders (2): “Wait, are you saying that CNN stacked the audience?” (unrolled Twitter thread) [@FaerieWhings (ST)]. Some kind soul investigated the bios of CNN’s questioners: “Tara Ebersol, former biology professor. Let see just how complete that information is. Her LinkedIn… ‘Chair, Baltimore County Democratic Party.'” • It does seem to me that CNN should have disclosed affiliations like that. Since Sanders has to run the gauntlet of the institutional Democrat Party, this doesn’t bother me all that much — so far as I can tell, they didn’t lay a glove on him — but the pretense that these are ordinary citizens should really be discarded. Sanders should really be running his own town halls, and selecting questioners using some form of sortition (you’d have to give the questioners time to prepare and a chance to refuse; not all like to speak in public). I bet the questions would be more interesting, too. Sanders (3): “Bernie Sanders Raises $10 Million in Less Than a Week” [New York Times]. “By Monday, after less than a week as a presidential candidate, Mr. Sanders has collected $10 million from 359,914 donors, campaign officials said. But perhaps just as daunting a figure for his rivals is this: Nearly 39 percent of those donors used an email address that had never before been used to give to Mr. Sanders.” • Hopefully all those email addresses aren’t, er, burners… Sanders (4): “Manafort Argues for Lighter Sentence; Sanders Town Hall; Biden Running out of Time; Trump Shows Strength in Polls” [CNN]. “perhaps the most surprising statistic, on the first day of his campaign, 12,000 of those donors were Republicans. And, keep in mind, the Sanders 2020 campaign, Alisyn, now only one week old.” • Presumably the sort of suburban Republican to which the DCCC hopes to appeal?





Realignment and Legitimacy

“Getting Past the Door: How We Moved from Canvassing to Organizing Buildings” (PDF) [Metro DC DSA]. “For the past 18 months, volunteers from the Stomp Out Slumlords project have crisscrossed the District of Columbia, finding tenants facing eviction and talking to them about how they can defend themselves. We’ve knocked the doors of nearly 8,000 tenants being sued for eviction, we’ve spent hundreds of person-hours talking to tenants at landlord-tenant court, we’ve gotten to know militant tenants and worked alongside them to organize in their buildings. In the course of this work, we’ve learned a great deal about the dynamics of eviction and tenant struggle, and we’ve been forced to reevaluate core tenets of our project’s original strategy. We have struggled to execute the plan we started out with, but we have succeeded beyond our expectations in areas of work we had not planned to take on.” • This gives me hope for DSA. Imagine starting out with a theory of change, and then adjusting your theory based on experience! “Political science teachers explain why more than half of Americans would fail a civics test and why that’s not the end of the world” [Chicago Tribune (JB)]. “The Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation surveyed 41,000 Americans with basic questions about American history and government and only 40 percent passed. In Illinois, more than half failed, according to the foundation. Shameful? Or a reflection of how complex our government can be and how civics education often misses the mark?” • Broken by design, as programmers say. “New Virginia poll: Northam approval weak, but Virginians not demanding his resignation” [Larry Sabato’s Crystal Ball]. “A new University of Virginia Center for Politics/Ipsos poll of Virginia adults shows Gov. Ralph Northam (D) with weak approval numbers, but Virginians surveyed are not demanding his resignation and do not favor the state legislature removing him through impeachment. Meanwhile, a plurality of respondents say Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax (D) should resign, but another quarter say he should not and a third are not sure what he should do, and the public is ambivalent on impeachment. Attorney General Mark Herring (D) seems the best-positioned of all three to remain in office, with less than one in five respondents believing he should resign or be impeached.” “Few Americans Want Open Borders— Democrats Included” [Medium]. “Trump repeatedly claims that Democrats “want open borders.” But nobody in leadership on the left promotes open borders. Nobody. Let’s clarify: not one or two people. Zero percent of the elected leadership of Democrats or independents have suggested the U.S. should have open borders. And there’s certainly no policy of open borders embraced by the Democratic Party.” • Well, the Identitarian Industrial Complex, deeply integrated into the dense tangle of NGOs that also comprises the Democrat party, as well as some segments of the press, does. (It does seem odd that nobody in the Open Borders crowd is calling for Maduro to open the Venezuelan border to Bolton and Abrams. Perhaps borders are good for something after all?) UPDATE Sortition?! An important day in the history of #democracy! A regional parliament in Belgium has unanimously voted to set up two new #deliberative institutions with citizens chosen by lot. #OstbelgienModell #delibdem #demopart #futureofdemocracy #sortition https://t.co/V0DYH1Nlv0 — Claudia Chwalisz (@ClaudiaChwalisz) February 25, 2019 Yeah, well, they put mayonnaise on their french fries….

Stats Watch

Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index, February 2019: “The Philly Fed buckled in last week’s February report but the indications for manufacturing weakness are not being confirmed by this week’s regional reports, whether from the Dallas Fed yesterday or today’s Richmond Fed index which… easily beat the consensus” [Econoday]. And: “February 2019 Richmond Fed Manufacturing Survey Significantly Improves” [Econintersect]. “The important Richmond Fed subcategories growth improved but backlog remains in contraction. This survey was strong compared to last month.”

Consumer Confidence, February 2018: “The government shutdown had a dramatic effect on consumer confidence, pushing down the Conference Board’s measure sharply in January then pulling it back up after the reopening” [Econoday]. “The consumer confidence index has shown much more volatility than the rival consumer sentiment index but both are sending the same signal: a post-shutdown bounce to levels that are, however, low relative to the past couple of years.” And: “February 2019 Conference Board Consumer Confidence Improves” [Econintersect]. “Consumer confidence had been on a multi-year upswing. The current volatility is showing uncertainty by consumers.”

Housing Starts, December 2018: “Housing starts proved unexpectedly weak in December and will pull back residential investment in Thursday’s GDP report” [Econoday]. “Today’s report, a one that is truly mixed, points to trouble for immediate economic data — particularly fourth-quarter GDP — but also to building strength in coming data based on the strong showing for permits.” And but: “Comments on December Housing Starts” [Calculated Risk]. “Even with the year end weakness, total starts were up 3.6% in 2018 compared to 2017. The weakness at the end of 2018 has been blamed on higher mortgage rates (that have since come down to around 4.5%), the stock market volatility (since stabilized), trade and immigration policies (impacting foreign buyers), and the partial government shutdown (started in December, but mostly in January). My sense is starts will pick up in Q1 compared to Q4 2018.” And: “S and P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20 City Home Price Index December 2018 Year-over-Year Growth Unchanged” [Econintersect]. “I continue to see this a situation of supply and demand. It is the affordability of the homes which is becoming an issue for the lower segments of consumers.”

S&P Corelogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index, December 2018: “Like FHFA’s report issued this morning, Case-Shiller’s 20-city index is showing slowing rates of home-price appreciation” [Econoday]. “Case-Shiller data continue to show trouble for once high-flying names on the West Coast including San Francisco which has now posted three sharp monthly declines in a row…. Case-Shiller data continue to show trouble for once high-flying names on the West Coast including San Francisco which has now posted three sharp monthly declines in a row.” • I hate the whole concept of houses as wealth. For one thing, houses matter as homes (not assets). For another, a house is a money pit!

FHFA House Price Index, December 2018: “Sellers were looking uneasy late last year based on this morning’s home price data” [Econoday]. “Total year-on-year prices slowed to 5.6 percent growth which actually isn’t bad at all in a low inflation, low wage growth economy. But the pace is definitely slowing.”

Shipping: “Study: e-commerce trends are shrinking average length of truck trips” [DC Velocity]. “Emerging e-commerce shopping trends are changing the face of the trucking industry, with the growth of last-mile delivery cutting the average trucker’s trip length by 37 percent since 2000, according to an industry study released today. Just as the average trucking haul distance has shrunk, the number of truck trips and urban vehicle miles traveled have increased for much of the same 19-year period, thanks to an increase in more regionalized retail supply chains and the proliferation of urban last-mile deliveries.”

The Bezzle: “Let it go: Frozen Elizabeth Holmes wanders the snowy streets of NYC looking for a cab after ditching the private jets and personal drivers following the collapse of her billion-dollar Theranos blood testing empire” [Daily Mail] “It was a shocking sight to behold as Holmes desperately attempted to hail a cab while lugging her own suitcase…. She was seen exiting The Mark at around 4:30pm, where rooms start at just under $1,000 per night.” • Looks like she’s got some money stashed away somewhere….

The Bezzle: “Confessions of a location data exec: ‘It’s a Ponzi scheme'” [Digiday]. “I met with a programmatic leader at one of the agency networks recently who asked my firm to help him verify the location data in the bid stream because they believe up to 80 percent or more of the lat-long data available there is fake. No one has stopped to think about where that data has come from and why a publisher would choose to sell it all to a vendor who is going to build a business on top of their data. What’s actually happening is these ad tech vendors are trying to pad out the limited data they already own with other data sets from competitive vendors or other unknown sources. Most reputable publishers would rather use their data across their own business than sell it to ad tech vendors, as the revenue potential is greater against their own content.” • it would be pretty ironic if we destroyed the Fourth Amendment and the very notion of privacy, all to enable a Silicon Valley scam.

The Bezzle: “SEC wants Tesla CEO Elon Musk held in contempt for tweeting” [Associated Press]. “[T]he Securities and Exchange Commission asked a federal court in New York to hold Musk in contempt for violating a $40 million settlement he begrudgingly reached with the U.S. stock market’s chief regulatory agency five months ago. Allegations that Musk broke the agreement by tweeting without company approval could renew a debate about whether he has become too reckless to continue as Tesla’s CEO…. Contempt charges are typically brought against individuals who defy a court order. The SEC settlement was approved by a judge last fall, exposing Musk to potential fines or even jail time if he is found to be in contempt. ‘He is looking like a repeat offender and a bad actor,’ said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond. ‘The SEC is taking action because it has a responsibility to protect the interests of consumers, investors and the public.'” • Repeat offender? Silicon Valley squillionaire? What?

Tech: “The Value Chain Constraint” [Stratechery]. “It is understandable why the Internet giants in particular move into seemingly adjacent territories: the growth imperative is strong, both for financial and strategic reasons, and the technology seems easy enough, particularly given the resources these companies bring to bear. And yet, the truth is that those massive resources do not stem, at least in the long run, from technical excellence, but rather integration in specific value chains that produces positive feedback loops and outsize profits…. It follows, then, that without that integration, the positive feedback loops quickly disappear, along with the profits, which is the exact pattern we see again and again. Microsoft spent billions on phones and consumer Internet services, Amazon spent billions on Whole Foods, Google has spent billions on not just Google Cloud but a whole host of initiatives that have nothing to do with Search, Facebook has spent billions on Watch and VR, and now Apple is getting in the game with billions spent on Video, and the expected outcome of all these should be that they will fail… What does work are (1) forward and backwards integrations into the value chain and (2) acquisitions. This makes sense: further integrations simply absorb more of the value chain, while acquisitions acquire not simply technology but businesses that are built from the ground-up for different value chains. And, by extension, if society at large wants to limit just how large these companies can be, limiting these two strategies is the obvious place to start.” • Hmm. Maybe I should have filed this under concentration.

UPDATE Tech: “Facebook as an American geopolitical weapon” [Surveillance Valley]. “As I explain in my book, Facebook (and American Internet companies in general) have always been an instrument of American power. Yet for years, the company had tried to sell itself as a totally neutral platform devoid of any national and geopolitical interests. And for a while it succeeded. But these days it doesn’t try to hide it anymore. After 2016, the mask has come off. Facebook now openly functions like an extension of American imperial power. What made this so obvious was the glaring double standard that’s guiding Facebook’s takedown of Maffick. On prodding from a U.S. government-funded thinktank, it suddenly demanded transparency for Pages run by a media company funded by Russia (and then shut them down with no warning). Yet Facebook continues to allow the U.S. government and powerful U.S. corporations to operate their Pages without hinderance — even when these Pages are obviously set up by lobby groups and government initiatives to covertly manipulate people and influence democracy.” • Kinda like Google News using Polygraph.info, jointly sponsored by state organs Radio Free Europe and Voice of America, as a fact checker. It’s right out in the open, isn’t it?

Tech: “Algorithmic Justice Could Clear 250,000 Convictions in California” [Artificial Lawyer]. “‘California has decriminalized recreational cannabis use, but a marijuana conviction continues to serve as a barrier to employment, housing, student loans and more. Lack of access to employment and housing are two primary drivers of recidivism, so until we clear these records it’s government that is effectively holding these people back and impeding public safety. I’m hopeful that this partnership will inspire many prosecutors who have cited resource constraints to join this common sense effort and provide this relief,’ [District Attorney George Gascón] added. And, Jennifer Pahlka, Founder and Executive Director, Code for America, said: ‘At Code for America, we believe government can work dramatically better than it does today, and the criminal justice system is one of the areas where we are most failing the American people. By reimagining existing government systems through technology and user-centred design, we can help governments rethink incarceration, reduce recidivism, and restore opportunity.'” • The project automated filling out forms only (which I suppose is “justice”). Maybe this is OK?

The Biosphere

About Page [Youth Climate Strike]. Our Mission: “We, the youth of America, are striking because decades of inaction has left us with just 11 years to change the trajectory of the worst effects of climate change, according to the Oct 2018 UN IPCC Report. We are striking because our world leaders have yet to acknowledge, prioritize, or properly address our climate crisis. We are striking because marginalized communities across our nation —especially communities of color, disabled communities, and low- income communities— are already disproportionately impacted by climate change. We are striking because if the social order is disrupted by our refusal to attend school, then the system is forced to face the climate crisis and enact change. With our futures at stake, we call for radical legislative action to combat climate change and its countless detrimental effects on the American people. We are striking for the Green New Deal, for a fair and just transition to a 100% renewable economy, and for ending the creation of additional fossil fuel infrastructure. Additionally, we believe the climate crisis should be declared a national emergency because we are running out of time.” • Today is my day to be nice, but I’ll point out that these demands, too, do not put greenhouse gas reductions against policy proposals. (Yes, the numbers can be ballpark figures at most, but plenty of good projects go ahead on that basis.)

“Judge OKs $120 Million Deal Over Massive Methane Leak” [Courthouse News]. “A state court judge in Los Angeles approved a deal Monday in which Southern California Gas Company will pay $120 million to state and local agencies over the 2015 Aliso Canyon methane gas blowout that forced thousands of residents to flee their homes…. A portion of the $120 million agreement will go toward capturing methane expelled by dairy farms as mitigation of what was released during the blowout, but Earthjustice and other environmental groups argue this gives SoCal Gas a chance to take credit for reduction efforts that are paid in part by state funding.” • Seems low.

“The Water Resource Right Outside the Window” [Governing]. “Landscape irrigation is estimated to account for almost one-third of residential water use — nearly nine billion gallons a day. And as much as half of the water used outdoors is wasted due to evaporation, inefficient equipment and overwatering… Local decision-makers may wonder if residents are truly ready to alter their landscapes. Our survey of more than 3,000 North American homeowners indicates that the time is ripe to promote a new landscape ideal. While beauty and appearance was the most important aspect of their landscapes, nearly half of respondents also wanted their landscapes to be water-conscious. And contrary to popular belief, for most people a beautiful outdoor space doesn’t always conjure up visions of endless expanses of thirsty grass. More homeowners desired trees, flowers and functional spaces for entertaining.” • Also pollinators?

“An Inside Look at How the Varroa Mite’s True Diet Was Discovered” [Entomology Today]. The bottom line: “These discoveries provided the study with the very last line of evidence needed to say conclusively that Varroa are not blood-feeders but rather feed on fat.” • This is a neat piece of detective work!

Health Care

“Underwood worries about debt as she considers universal healthcare” [Daily Herald (JB)]. “Underwood answered several health care questions by an audience that seemed largely in favor of universal health care. The problem, Underwood said, is universal health care means something different to almost everyone she speaks to. Some people want Medicare for everyone 55 and older, or 40 and older, or even from birth” • So liberal Democrats leverage the brand confusion they themselves created. More: “Underwood explained she’s especially mindful of the costs given the growing federal debt. ‘This tax plan put us in the hole read bad,’ she said. ‘It is unsustainable. This level of deficit spending is one that should make us pause. To be honest, part of the challenge in our ability to do our jobs is finding these pay-fors. My commitment is to put forward policies that don’t make the situation worse.'” • Sigh…

We do need to reduce the cost growth in these areas so they are accessible to everyone.” • “Accessible.”

Class Warfare

“Listen to Ep. 92: Austerity and Class Agony: Writing the Crisis w/ Adam Rensch in Podcasts” (podcast) [Dead Pundits Society]. • I like this podcast a lot, and here they do cultural criticism: Friends (!) especially. And they really dislike Marie Kondo!

“The ‘Hidden Mechanisms’ That Help Those Born Rich to Excel in Elite Jobs” (interview) [The Atlantic]. “I think the image that we have—or the ideology, if you want to be political about it—is once you’re 18 or so, you make your own way and your class origin is not an important part of how your career goes from there. But what my co-author Sam and I found was, that’s not at all true. In the book, we talked about people pursuing acting, which is a very contingent, hard path to pursue. Most people, when they start, aren’t making most of their money from acting, and so people who are able to rely on their parents to help them are much more able to pursue acting fully, because they don’t have to worry about maintaining a regular, full-time job just to eat and live.” • Another Friends subtweet?

News of the Wired

“Different Kinds Of Loneliness – Having Poor Quality Relationships Is Associated With Greater Distress Than Having Too Few” [ResearchGate]. “The first class – which they called “low loneliness” – was characterised by low scores on both types of loneliness, social and emotional. Just over half the participants fell into this category. The second class – “social loneliness” – making up 8.2 per cent of the sample, comprised people low on emotional loneliness, but high on social loneliness. The third class – “emotional loneliness” – made up just over a quarter of the total sample and was characterised by the opposite pattern of high emotional loneliness but low levels of social loneliness. People in the fourth and final “social and emotional loneliness” class, accounting for 12.4 per cent of the sample, scored high for both types of loneliness. The researchers found a clear gradient of psychological distress across the classes. People in the low loneliness class were, predictably, least distressed, followed by people in the “social loneliness” class, then the “emotional loneliness” class, and finally the “social and emotional loneliness” class. In fact, people in both these last two classes had levels of symptoms of depression, anxiety and negative psychological wellbeing that were reflective of a psychiatric disorder.” • Another Friends subtweet?

142,Empty,2019-02-28T23:02:32Z,"An online petition is suggesting that the state of Montana should be sold to Canada for US$1 trillion, but we're not buying it. The post Most Canadians don’t want to spend $1 trillion to buy U.S. state of Montana appeared first on Vancouver Is Awesome.","We have all been exposed to online petitions in the past few years, but one that caught the eye of the media on both sides of the 49th parallel this month was unique. Someone identified as Ian Hammond is suggesting that the state of Montana should be sold to Canada for US$1 trillion.

The petition alleges that the money that Canada would pay for what is colloquially known as Big Sky Country would be used to eliminate America’s national debt. While US$1 trillion is a considerable amount of money, the United States would be required to sell 21 more states at the same price to actually erase its national debt, calculated late last year a US$21.97 trillion.

In any case, the idea has provided plenty of fodder for the media. At the time of this writing, more than 16,000 people have added their names to the petition. Research Co. asked Canadians about it last week. Across the country, a majority of respondents (56%) disagreed with the notion of purchasing Montana, but almost three in 10 (28%) were ready to welcome an American state into Confederation.

Canadian men are more likely to support the purchase than women (32% to 24% respectively). On a regional basis, residents of Alberta boasted the highest level of support for a “Canadian Montana” at 37%, followed closely by Saskatchewan and Manitoba at 34%.

There was little fluctuation across party lines, with very similar proportions of Canadians who voted Conservative (30%), Liberal (28%) and New Democratic (26%) in the 2015 federal election saying Canada should buy Montana.

The biggest variation is observed on age. Just 21% of Canadians aged 55 and over and 28% of those aged 35-to-54 would consent to the Montana purchase. But the proportion jumps dramatically among those aged 18 to 34 to 41%.

Montana borders three Canadian provinces: British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan. Its main economic activities are agriculture and ranching, which may suggest a perfect extension of Alberta into the south. However, Montana is landlocked, so its acquisition would not facilitate the process of getting Alberta’s oil to Asian markets, unless a pipeline somehow turned westward into Idaho and Oregon.

In some respects, Canada would be adding a distinctly multicultural province. Montana’s state motto, “Oro y Plata,” (“Silver and Gold”) is the only one in the entire United States to be penned in Spanish, instead of the most habitual Latin or English. The motto also enshrines the importance of mining, at a time when resource development projects have become more controversial than ever in Western Canada.

Montana’s state animal is the grizzly bear, the same species that was recently protected by the British Columbia government in the form of an extremely popular ban on trophy hunting. If Montana became a province, Canada would get a piece of the coveted Yellowstone National Park, as well as the second-largest ski resort in the United States – Big Sky.

There are also implications in the world of sport. Welcoming Montana into Confederation might help bring about tax incentives to refurbish the Centennial Ice Arena in Billings, in the hopes of bringing an eighth National Hockey League (NHL) team to Canada. Montana’s residents pay no sales tax, but that would change after the purchase. This should prompt the ownership group to christen the NHL franchise as the “GST Billings.”

The population of Montana is similar to those of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, so both should serve as starting points to figure out how to establish a legislature for the newest Canadian province. Saskatchewan’s legislative assembly has 61 seats, and Manitoba’s has 57. Let’s split the difference and award Montana a legislature with 59 members.

At this time, Montana has 100 members in the state House of Representatives and 50 in the state Senate. A process of primaries would reduce those 150 state lawmakers to 59, and a test would transfer existing Democrats and Republicans into Canada’s more traditional political parties.

Montana’s three representatives in the U.S. Congress – two senators and one congressman—would be immediately appointed to the Canadian Senate. If we allocate Montana the same six seats that other western provinces have in the Red Chamber, that leaves us with three vacancies.

Let’s take two nominees from the realm of entertainment. Missoula-born filmmaker David Lynch and actor Dana Carvey would be wonderful additions to the upper house. We could even find a way for Mike Myers to preside their citizenship ceremony.

The final Senate nominee from Montana is Phil Jackson, who coached teams to 11 National Basketball Association titles. We not only gain a capable negotiator, but an ideal option to coach Canada’s basketball team in the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics.

Unfortunately, Canadians rejected the purchase by a two-to-one margin. But we still can ponder what could be.",Most Canadians don’t want to spend $1 trillion to buy U.S. state of Montana,Vancouverisawesome.com,https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/2019/02/28/canadians-dont-want-1trillion-purchase-montana-us-state/
143,Empty,2019-02-27T16:00:22Z,African-Americans spent $63 billion on travel last year alone. The post The 6 best destinations for black travelers in 2019 appeared first on Matador Network.,"Navigating the world as a black person is not always easy and traveling while black is no different. While no destination is a complete utopia void of microaggressions or where the black experience exists in a vacuum, there are many places where black travelers have felt especially comfortable exploring, and others that are particularly exciting for black travelers this year. We tapped some of our favorite black travel bloggers and influencers to find out their favorite destinations of 2019. So whether you’re going abroad for the first time or you’re a seasoned traveler, here are six of the best places for black travelers to visit this year.

1. Ghana

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Afrochella (@afrochella) on Jan 7, 2019 at 2:46am PST

It’s been 400 years since the first slave ships departed from the shores of West Africa before arriving in the Americas. Ghanaian politicians have long been advocates of the pan-African movement. So in 2019, Ghana is welcoming people of African descent to visit with the promise of easier visa applications and a year-long calendar of culturally immersive events. As many are traveling to the country this year to connect with their ancestral roots, there has never been a better time for black travelers to visit Ghana.

First-time visitors should start their travels in the capital city, Accra. The city itself is a fusion of historical sights and modern culture. Kwame Nkrumah Memorial Park is a popular attraction to visit as it’s where the life of Ghana’s first president — a revered pan-Africanist — is celebrated. Nights in Accra are best spent dining al fresco or vibing to Afrobeats at the city’s many rooftop bars.

Rooftop parties aren’t the only thing to look forward to when visiting Ghana this year. 2019 will see a huge amount of cultural events happening to surround the Year of Return festivities. Many organized tour groups will be traveling to the country to celebrate, including the popular New Year’s Eve party in Ghana. Afrochella, the black millennial music festival, and PANAFEST, a festival celebrating the resilience and achievements of African people, should also not be missed.

After exploring Accra, travelers should get out of the capital city to see another side of Ghana. From Accra, it’s relatively easy to explore other parts of the country. A three-hour drive outside of the capital city takes travelers looking to connect with their ancestral roots to former slave dungeon, Elmina Castle. Ironically, these not-so-castle-like quarters housed enslaved Africans during what was the last stop for many before the tumultuous journey known as the middle passage or transatlantic slave trade. Also, in the region is Cape Coast, another former slave house, and Kakum National Park, an oasis in the middle of the rainforest famous known for its 350-meter-high canopy walkway.

With an exciting lineup of cultural events, important historical sites, and the welcoming spirit of the Ghanaian people, we have to believe President Akufo-Addo when he said “the time is right” for people of African descent to return home to Ghana this year.

2. Montreal, Canada

If you’ve been dreaming of going to Paris and haven’t made the leap yet, try Montreal instead. It’s the perfect destination for black East Coasters wanting to experience a new culture without the long flight or the microaggressions that often come when traveling while black around Europe.

“Montreal always gives me a little bit of everything that I need for a quick getaway. It has the beauty and charm of Paris but with less visible anti-black microaggressions than French society,” said Nasir Fleming, travel writer and content manager at Shut Up and Go.

With the highest number of restaurants per capita in Canada, the city is full of culinary delights. Using downtown as a starting point, foodies should eat their way through the city tasting classic dishes like poutine, a Fairmount bagel, or a smoked meat sandwich. If you’re craving some soul food, Nasir said, “It [Montreal] has prominent Caribbean and North African communities, so when strolling through the city, you’ll easily find a Haitian or a Moroccan restaurant to give you some spice in your life.”

Black African and Caribbean culture has a strong presence in Montreal. Every April Vues d’Afrique holds the Pan-Africa International Film Festival — a celebration of African and Creole culture through film. Music lovers should plan to visit in June for the annual Montreal Jazz Festival featuring famous black jazz artists like Dianne Reeves and Buddy Guy.

“[I’m not saying] that Montreal is the ultimate holy land for black people, but it’s a nice way to get away from the messiness of the states when you’re on a budget,” explained Nasir.

Many also come to Montreal for its arts scene and abundance of parks. If you’re on a budget but still need your art fix, Montreal’s Museum of Fine Arts is free for everyone under 30. And every year on a Sunday in May, over 30 museums open their doors for free on Montreal Museums Day. Montreal is proof that you don’t need to travel far to experience an interesting culture. What’s more, if you can get your cultural fix without having to carry around the heavy feelings that sometimes come with traveling while black in Europe, it’s a win-win.

3. Senegal

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jakiya | Brand Builder 🌍💻 (@travelingfro) on Feb 11, 2019 at 4:06pm PST

Senegal, the coastal West African country known for its beautiful beaches and hospitable culture is an ideal destination for black travelers. Jakiya Brown, traveler and Senegal expat said, “The culture, vibrancy, and teranga (meaning Senegalese hospitality in the local language, Wolof) is the perfect combination, especially for people of the diaspora.”

Dakar is a thriving city with art, fresh seafood, and paradise-like beaches. The city is known as the art epicenter of West Africa. The largest and oldest contemporary art show in Africa, Dakar Biennale, is held every two years and attracts visitors from all over the world. Not to mention, there are dozens of art galleries throughout the city where black travelers can purchase locally made African art.

Seafood lovers will not be disappointed in Dakar. A lot of its best dishes include freshly caught fish because the city is full of traditional Senegalese fish markets. Ceebu jën (thieboudienne in French), Senegal’s national dish, is made from fish, rice, and tomato sauce. Black Americans with southern roots might recognize the dish as it closely resembles Southern red rice, which is popular in states like Georgia and South Carolina.

Black travelers visiting Senegal may want to pay a visit to the quiet island of Gorée. The tiny island just off the coast of Dakar is dotted with pastel-painted homes which mask its horrific past. Millions of enslaved Africans passed through the island before being shipped to the Americas. Black travelers wanting to connect with their ancestors should visit the House of Slaves (Maison des Esclaves). “Senegal makes for one unforgettable cultural experience, especially for black travelers, that will make you want to return “home” again and again,” said Jakiya. Join Jakiya in Senegal this summer at this Teranga Retreat.

4. Belize

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Ciara (@hey_ciara) on Apr 21, 2017 at 10:51am PDT

If it’s Caribbean food, water adventures, and Creole culture that you want, look no further than Belize. Solo world travel blogger Ciara Johnson, of Hey Ciara, said, “Black travelers should consider visiting Caye Caulker. It’s a tiny island full of character off the coast of Belize.”

The allure of the small coastal island is its relaxing feel, crystal blue water, and afro-Belizean influences. It’s easy to get to Caye Caulker from the main island of Belize City. Take a one hour ferry from Belize City with Ocean Ferry Breeze or if you prefer to fly, a regional carrier, Maya Air, flies to the island in 25 minutes. You won’t have a hard time winding down here — its tourism slogan is “Go Slow” — with an endless amount of water activities and food that is sure to give you the itis. Water sports here include jet skiing, cliff jumping, diving, and kayaking. For a taste of traditional Afro-Belizean food, indulge in a “bile up” — a Belizean creole dish including boiled eggs, fish or pigtails with plantain, yams, and tomato sauce.

Black travelers wanting to experience afro-Belizean culture a bit deeper should head to Gulisi Garifuna Museum in Belize City for a look into the traditional culture of the indigenous Garífunaia people. Just two hours south of Belize City is Hopkins Village, a small fishing village. Laruni Hati Beyabu Diner in Hopkins Village is the perfect place to go to get a taste of traditional Garífunaia food like cassava, fish, coconut, and mashed plantains — no fork needed. The natural wonders and Creole culinary delights of Belize make it a paradise island that shouldn’t be overlooked.

5. United Arab Emirates

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Gloria Atanmo, The Blog Abroad (@glographics) on Feb 5, 2019 at 1:35pm PST

In 2015, there was an infamous Etihad Airways “error fare” from New York to Dubai for around $187 round trip. Many black travel communities on Instagram posted the flight deal encouraging travelers to book their tickets immediately. Since then, black travelers have looked to Dubai and Abu Dhabi for luxury vacations without the hefty price tag and for the community of black expats in the United Arab Emirates.

The allure of luxury experiences at an affordable price is what makes the UAE a popular destination. Lovers of luxury travel will want to indulge in the finer things like renting an all-inclusive yacht or jet skiing along Jumeirah Beach in Dubai. Brunch lovers should book a table at the elegant Rosewood Hotel in Abu Dhabi for their international garden brunch overlooking the waterfront. And then stick around after dining because the Rosewood turns into a party with a live DJ after 4:00 AM.

Those looking to dive into cultural experiences should head to the capital city, Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi is only a two-hour bus ride away from Dubai. It’s known for its famous site, the Sheikh Zayed Mosque. “Beauty and opulence mixed in one, it’s enchanting, magnetic, and awe-inspiring the way such perfection sits there in all its white glory,” said Gloria Amato, travel blogger from The Blog Abroad.

For the solo black traveler wanting to experience the United Arab Emirates with a group, there are a few black-owned travel companies like Wind Collective, who host trips to Dubai. Traveling with a like-minded group of black travelers is a great way to ease into a new culture.

Multicultural cities like Dubai and Abu Dhabi have attracted many black expats who often move there to lead simpler yet more fulfilling lives as compared to in the US. Sistas in Dubai is a social meetup group created for black women to bond over shared experiences living in the UAE. Gloria said, “I found the UAE to be a place where black travelers can thrive. I’ve met black entrepreneurs, engineers, and teachers through different emirates all living their best lives and I think it’s a place where you can indulge in the finer things in life without entirely breaking the bank.” So whether you’re visiting the region for a bit of culture or considering taking the leap to move abroad, there is a community of black travelers awaiting you.

6. Tunisia

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Eulanda+Omo👉Content creators (@dipyourtoesin) on Apr 27, 2018 at 10:24am PDT

Tunisia’s tourism numbers continue to recover from the 2015 terrorist attacks in the coastal city of Sousse and due to the temporary lack of mass tourism, this makes for an ideal time to explore the country.

Sub-Saharan African influences can be seen all throughout Tunis, the capital city of Tunisia. About 15 percent of Tunis’ population identifies as black. And in 1846, Tunisia was the first Arab Muslim country to abolish slavery and most recently, in 2018, it has passed legislation which criminalizes racist acts.

Black travelers wanting to connect with the black Tunisian culture should head to Jazz à Carthage in April. The festival is a celebration of international jazz that has been around since 2005, and features many black headlining artists such as Sabry Mosbah and more.

Visitors looking for some beach fun will find that traveling throughout the country to neighboring cities like Sidi Bou Said, the sun-drenched town perched on a cliff overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, is easily accessible. The cobblestone town is a perfect day escape — it’s only a 30-minute drive from the city center. For authentic shopping, head to the souks of the medina to barter with merchants over locally made goods like rugs or jewelry.

As lovers of Tunisia, Eulanda and Omo, travel bloggers at Hey Dip Your Toes In, said, “People of color can expect to be received with warmth and friendliness by the locals. Tunisia considers itself as one of the more liberal majority Muslim countries in the Arab world with democracy and reform both sources of national pride.” If you enjoy traveling somewhere that allows you to explore a completely new culture while still managing to feel like home, Tunisia should be on your list for 2019.",Destinations for black travelers,Matadornetwork.com,https://matadornetwork.com/read/best-destinations-black-travelers-2019/
144,Empty,2019-02-26T21:44:15Z,"Jagmeet Singh: lawyer, suit aficionado, NDP leader and now the MP for Burnaby South.","NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh won the Feb. 25, 2019 byelection and will now represent the riding of Burnaby South in Parliament.

He walked away with 39 per cent of the vote (8,884 votes), followed by Liberal candidate Richard T. Lee’s 26 per cent and Conservative Jay Shin’s 22.5 per cent.

Here’s five things to know about Singh.

In 2011, Singh lost his first attempt to enter politics.

Singh’s first attempt to enter politics in 2011 was not successful. The longtime Toronto-area resident had run for federal government in the Brampton, Ont. riding of Bramalea-Gore-Malton but lost to Conservative candidate Bal Gosal by 539 votes.

Later that same year, he ran for a provincial seat in the overlapping riding and was elected with 38 per cent of the vote. After he was announced the winner, Singh gave a victory speech in English, French and Punjabi.

In 2017, Singh stepped down from his provincial seat after winning the federal NDP leadership race. He became the first member of a visible minority to lead a national political party. In 2019, he won a byelection in the B.C. riding of Burnaby South to secure a seat in parliament.

Singh has been hailed a ‘personality to watch’, ‘the greatest showman’ and the ‘most stylish politician in Canada.’

In 2012, the Toronto Star named Singh one of its “12 to watch in 2012.” In a profile, Singh was described as “not your typical New Democrat” and “one of the youngest, most dynamic MPPs at Queen’s Park”, a “trailblazer in Ontario politics.”

A Toronto Life feature last year called Singh “the greatest showman,” with a following that “should make Justin Trudeau nervous”, while a 2017 piece called him the “king of politician Instagram,” thanks to his photographs from international trips and of his well-cut suits. Earlier in 2013, Singh was also named among “the new power set” by the outlet.

Even popular magazine GQ chatted with Singh in 2017, the product of which was a piece that hailed Singh as an “incredibly well-dressed rising star in Canadian politics.”

“Jagmeet Singh looks the way you hope a progressive politician would,” begins the GQ piece. It’s safe to say Singh captured some attention on his way up through the political sphere with his approach and style.

Singh’s work as a lawyer paved his way into politics.

Singh has a science degree from the University of Western Ontario and a law degree from York University’s Osgoode Law School. He was called to the bar in 2006 and has worked throughout the Greater Toronto area, later opening his own firm.

Much of his work revolved around advocating for charter rights. In an interview with GQ, Singh said his entry into politics was largely due in part to his work in law: “As a lawyer I continued to do human rights work with local organizations and cultural communities that felt their political representation was inadequate; that the elected officials we had were not tackling the issues that mattered to them.”

Singh’s younger brother Gurratan is also a lawyer by trade but was elected last year in the Ontario provincial election in the riding of Brampton East. He has also served as Singh’s advisor during his campaigns.

At my little brother's call to the bar ceremony, he's a lawyer today…. proud of you bro. #proudolderbrother — Jagmeet Singh (@theJagmeetSingh) September 21, 2011

Singh and wife Gurkiran Kaur recently celebrated their first wedding anniversary.

Singh and Kaur first met in 2010 when the former gave a presentation to Kaur’s class at York University. The pair went on a date in 2011 and kept things casual until 2017, when they went public with their relationship.

In January of 2018, Singh topped any photo-op Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had ever set up by inviting media to Toronto restaurant Vegetarian Haven – where the pair had their first date – to witness his proposal. The NDP leader got down one knee and proposed in front of family and friends as a quartet performed Ed Sheeran’s “Thinking Out Loud.” Kaur said yes.

The couple married the next month, with a ceremony in Toronto and more festivities in Mexico. They celebrated their one-year anniversary on Feb. 22, 2019.

Singh’s victory song is Post Malone’s “Congratulations.”

Singh has said that during his NDP leadership campaign, he listened to Post Malone’s “Congratulations” “literally everyday.”

“Something about the bravado laced confidence of the track touched on the spirit of our campaign,” he wrote in a Dec. 12, 2017 Instagram post. “We were setting out to achieve something that had not been achieved in the history of our country.

“It takes a little bravado to do that.”

“Congratulations” was released as the promotional single for the American rapper’s debut album Stoney. The track reached No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 11 and has been certified eight times platinum. Singh rapped along to the song at his Burnaby victory party following the Feb. 25 byelection.",Five things to know about Burnaby South MP Jagmeet Singh,Vancouversun.com,https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/five-things-to-know-about-burnaby-south-mp-jagmeet-singh
145,Empty,2019-02-27T12:35:00Z,Tensions have escalated between India and Pakistan after New Delhi launched air strikes in Pakistani territory. DW takes a look at the turbulent history between the nuclear-armed neighbors.,"Bloody partition (1947): The two neighbors have shared a tense relationship ever since the British divided the Indian subcontinent in a secular but mainly Hindu India and Muslim-majority state of Pakistan. The partition sparked riots and communal violence across the region and led to one of the largest human migrations in history.

The escalation of Kashmir conflict (1947-48): India and Pakistan contested Kashmir — a Muslim-majority kingdom ruled by a Hindu Maharaja — even before their independence from Britain. But the dispute escalated after Kashmir ruler Hari Singh acceded Kashmir to India in return for New Delhi's help to ward off attacks by an army of Pakistani tribesmen. The developments led to the first full-blown war over Kashmir between the two countries.

Partition of India: The way forward Birth of two nations In 1947, British India was divided into two countries - India and Pakistan. Pakistan's founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah and his All-India Muslim League party had first demanded autonomy for Muslim-majority areas in the undivided India, and only later a separate country for Muslims. Jinnah believed that Hindus and Muslims could not continue to live together, as they were distinctly different ""nations.""

Partition of India: The way forward The line of blood The partition of British India was extremely violent. Following the birth of India and Pakistan, violent communal riots began in many western areas, mostly in Punjab. Historians say that more than a million people died in clashes, and millions more migrated from Indian territory to Pakistan and from the Pakistani side to India.

Partition of India: The way forward The 1948 war India and Pakistan clashed over Kashmir soon after their independence. The Muslim-majority Kashmir region was ruled by a Hindu leader, but Jinnah wanted it to be part of Pakistani territory. Indian and Pakistani troops fought in Kashmir in 1948, with India taking control of most part of the valley, while Pakistan occupied a smaller area. India and Pakistan continue to clash over Kashmir.

Partition of India: The way forward Like US and Canada? Liberal historians say that Jinnah and Mahatma Gandhi wanted cordial ties between newly independent states. Jinnah, for instance, believed that ties between India and Pakistan should be similar to those between the US and Canada. But after his death in 1948, his successors followed a collision course with New Delhi.

Partition of India: The way forward The 'other' Indian and Pakistani governments present very different accounts of the partition. While India emphasizes the Indian National Congress' freedom movement against British rulers - with Gandhi as its main architect - Pakistani textbooks focus on a ""struggle"" against both British and Hindu ""oppression."" State propaganda in both countries paints each other as an ""enemy"" that cannot be trusted.

Partition of India: The way forward Worsening ties Diplomatic ties between India and Pakistan have remained acrimonious for the past seven decades. The issue of Islamist terrorism has marred relations in the last few years, with New Delhi accusing Islamabad of backing Islamist jihadists to wage a war in India-administered Kashmir. India also blames Pakistan-based groups for launching terror attacks on Indian soil. Islamabad denies these claims.

Partition of India: The way forward The way forward Many young people in both India and Pakistan are urging their governments to improve bilateral ties. Islamabad-based documentary filmmaker Wajahat Malik believes the best way for India and Pakistan to develop a closer relationship is through more interaction between their peoples. ""Trade and tourism are the way forward for us. When people come together, the states will follow suit,"" Malik told DW. Author: Shamil Shams



UN resolution (1948): India dragged the Kashmir dispute to the United Nations Security Council, which passed a resolution calling for a referendum to decide the status of Kashmir. But the Security Council made the referendum conditional to the withdrawal of Pakistani troops and reduction of Indian military presence to the minimum to maintain law and order in the region. The war ended with a UN-brokered ceasefire but Pakistan refused to withdraw its troops. A ceasefire line effectively partitioned Kashmir with both sides controlling parts of the erstwhile kingdom but claiming it in its entirety.

Indo-Pakistan War (1965): Despite several attempts to solve the Kashmir dispute and deescalate tensions, the two neighbors fought their second war over the contested region. The brief war ended with yet-another UN-mandated ceasefire. Both sides returned to their previous positions.

War over Bangladesh (1971): India and Pakistan fought their third war, this time over East Pakistan. The conflict ended in a defeat for Pakistan and the formation of Bangladesh.

Simla Agreement (1972): Following Pakistan's surrender in the 1971 war, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Pakistani leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto met and signed an agreement in the Indian hill town of Simla. The ceasefire line in Kashmir is designated as the Line of Control (LoC) and the two parties agree to resolve the dispute through negotiations.

Former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Pakistani leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto signed the Simla Agreement in 1972

Armed resistance in Kashmir (1989): A pro-independenceinsurgencygathered momentum in India-administered Kashmir following disputed stateelections. The insurgency escalated over the next decade, partly fanned by a violent crackdown by Indian troops. India accused Pakistan of supporting the insurgents by providing weapons and training. Pakistan denied this claim.

Kargil conflict (1999): The two neighbors, by now nuclear powers, entered into an armed conflict after militants from across the LoC took control of key strategic positions in India-administered Kashmir. India drove the militants out but blamed Pakistan for supporting the incursion. The diplomatic gains made after a historic meeting in Lahore between the prime ministers of the two countries were eroded and India broke off relations.

Indian Parliament attack (2001): Tensions between India and Pakistan reached a new high after a terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament. India blamed Pakistan-based terror outfits for the attack and deployed troops on its borders with Pakistan. Islamabad reciprocated. The standoff ended after an international mediation.

Ceasefire (2003): The two sides agreed to a ceasefire along the LoC. The ceasefire is still in force but the two countries have blamed each other for occasionally violating it.

India broke off all talks with Pakistan after attacks in Mumbai that New Delhi claimed was sanctioned by Pakistan's intelligence agency.

Mumbai attacks (2008): Armed gunmen launched several attacks in India's financial capital of Mumbai, killing more than 150 people. India blamed Pakistan for the attacks. But Islamabad vociferously denied the Indian assertion that Lashkar-e-Taiba, the terror outfit behind the attacks, was sanctioned by Pakistan's intelligence agency. India broke off all talks with Pakistan after the attacks. New Delhi continues to maintain that ""terror and talks"" can't go together.

Former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi tried to usher in a new era of peace.

Surgical strikes (2016): Efforts by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif to relaunch talks came to an abrupt halt after an attack on an Indian army base by a Pakistan-based terror outfit, Jaish-e-Mohammed. India retaliated to the killing of 19 soldiers by launching ""surgical strikes"" on alleged terror camps on the other side of the LoC. Pakistan denied India's claims.

India bombs targets in Pakistan (2019): India conducted airstrikes on an alleged Jaish-e-Mohammed terror camp in Pakistan's Balakot. The attack came just days after the terror outfit claimed responsibility for killing 40 Indian soldiers in a suicide attack in Kashmir. A day later, Pakistan said it downed two Indian jets in retaliation.

146,Empty,2019-02-28T13:03:44Z,"As the USA and North Korea meet in Vietnam to discuss the possibility of a peace treaty between the two after decades of hostility against North Korea from the USA, the governments of Russia and Japan are engaged in talks … The post Russia, Japan and the USA:…","As the USA and North Korea meet in Vietnam to discuss the possibility of a peace treaty between the two after decades of hostility against North Korea from the USA, the governments of Russia and Japan are engaged in talks about concluding a peace treaty to formally end the war between them that began during the Second World War. The two meetings are related since they concern peace and security in Asia and the Pacific and because the stumbling block to peace in both instances is the threat posed by the United States conventional and nuclear forces in the region.

North Korea has long sought a peace treaty with the USA along with a firm guarantee that the USA will not attack. North Korea’s requests for peace have been met, up until now, with nothing but false promises, unjust sanctions, attempts to isolate it from the world and threats of annihilation. The USA, on the other hand, has only one objective, the nuclear disarmament of North Korea, making it vulnerable to American attack while claiming the right to retain and develop its triad of nuclear forces and the right to use them whenever it sees fit. Since the word of the US leadership is not worth much, as the world has seen time and again as the US reneges on one international agreement after another, hopes of something positive coming out of the Korean-American meeting in Vietnam are slim. But we can hope.

The situation between Japan and Russia is also at an impasse and once again the basic cause for this is the USA. The key sticking point between them since the 1950’s has been, and remains, control over the Kuril Islands that lie north of the Japanese Island of Hokkaido and south of the Russian territories on the Kamchatka Peninsula. The islands have changed hands between them several times in history but with the defeat of Japan in 1945 the islands were given to the USSR by international agreement with Japan protesting that it should have ownership and control of the four southern islands in the chain. The islands have been in Russian hands ever since.

In 1956 the USSR and Japan entered into negotiations to try to conclude a peace treaty that resulted in a Joint Declaration paragraph 9 of which stated,

“9. Japan and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics agree to continue, after the restoration of normal diplomatic relations between Japan and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, negotiations for the conclusion of a peace treaty. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, desiring to meet the wishes of Japan and taking into consideration the interests of Japan, agrees to hand over to Japan the Habomai Islands and the island of Shikotan. However, the actual handing over these islands to Japan shall take place after the conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.”

A peace treaty has never been concluded and the main reason is the signing in 1960 of a military treaty between Japan and the USA, the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security, first signed in San Francisco in 1954, but amended in January 1960, which the USSR regarded as a hostile act. One of the key elements of the amended agreement, and which highlights Japan’s status as an occupied nation, provides for the continued presence of US military bases in Japan. The provisions of the treaty stipulate that it was to remain in force permanently unless one party gives a year’s notice that it wishes to terminate it. Since Japan is still, in reality, an occupied nation it is unlikely that any Japanese government will give such a notice unless it wants to draw down on itself the full measures of retaliation for which the USA is notorious.

The implications of the treaty were recognized by many in Japan at the time and the leftist opposition tried to prevent its ratification by the Japanese Diet. There were physical confrontations between members of the Japanese Socialist Party that opposed it and the Liberal Democratic Party deputies supporting it and this was followed by massive demonstrations and rioting by students and trade unions. A Peoples Council to stop the treaty was formed representing a cross section of Japanese society including labour unions, farmers, teachers, poetry circles theater groups, student and women’s organisations and groups affiliated with the Socialist and Communist Parties but they were unsuccessful.

They took issue with the treaty primarily because of Article 6 that contains a Status of Forces Agreement on the stationing of US forces in Japan that permits the US to make major changes in the placement and location of bases and the use of those bases for US combat operations other than in defence of Japan, that is for offensive operations against other nations, with Japan thrown the bone of being “consulted” on these issues. It was a confirmation to many at the time that Japan remained an occupied country even though the formal military occupation had been declared at an end.

The consequences of the treaty are still important today as the US bases on the Japanese island of Okinawa continue to meet resistance from the people while successive Japanese governments, controlled by reactionary forces, act in lock step with the US in enforcing the agreement against the peoples’ wishes. Just this week Prime Minister Abe ignored a referendum that opposed the presence of the largest Okinawa base and instead approved the US plans for its relocation on the island.

As a result of the amendment of the Japan–US treaty, the USSR in January 1960, issued a Memorandum which needs to be read in full:

“The Soviet Union certainly cannot ignore such a step as Japan’s conclusion of a new military treaty which undermines the basis for peace in the Far East and creates obstacles to the development of Soviet-Japanese relations. A new situation has formed in relation to the fact that this treaty actually deprives Japan of independence and that foreign troops stationed in Japan as a result of Japan’s surrender remain on Japanese territory. This situation makes it impossible for the Soviet Government to fulfill its promises to return the islands of Habomai and Shikotan to Japan. It is because the Soviet Government met Japan’s wishes and took into consideration the interests of Japan and the peace-loving intentions expressed by the Japanese Government during the Soviet-Japanese negotiations that it agreed to hand over such islands to Japan after the signing of a peace treaty. But since the new military treaty signed by the Japanese Government is directed against the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China, the Soviet Government cannot contribute to extending the territory available to foreign troops by handing over such islands to Japan. Thus, the Soviet Government finds it necessary to declare that the islands of Habomai and Shikotan will be handed over to Japan, as was stated in the Soviet-Japanese Joint Declaration of October 19, 1956, only if all foreign troops are withdrawn from Japan and a Soviet-Japanese peace treaty is signed.”

So, the USSR saw the Japan US treaty as a hostile act against both it and China, as a statement that Japan remained an occupied nation and was willing to conclude a peace treaty if, and only if, US forces were withdrawn from Japan.

The present Russian government states that this memorandum does not clarify conditions for handing over the islands and so further clarification is needed. What this language means is not clear but it is not a repudiation of the demand by the USSR that US forces be removed from Japan before a peace deal can be concluded. The dilemma for Russia is that the US forces in Japan are a threat to peace in the region and to Russia and China. Further, they fear that if they ignore the Soviet memorandum and go ahead with a peace treaty and hand over the designed islands to Japan the islands will be quickly occupied by US forces which will install their AEGIS missile systems there that can deploy nuclear armed missiles close to Russia in the Pacific and will allow them to threaten the large Russian naval base at Vladivostok. Yet the Japanese government, backed by the US, is pushing for the return of the islands as a precondition of a peace treaty. The Russians refuse to allow this.

In return the Russians can use the Memorandum as a lever to force the Japanese to kick the US forces out of Japan. So the impasse remains.

That these issues were discussed at a meeting on February 16 between Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov and the Japanese Foreign Minister Kono at the Munich Conference is indicated by the statement of the Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshida Suga at a press conference in Tokyo that “there was a frank, though sometimes heated, exchange of views’ between the two,” diplomatic language for a blazing row.

The Japanese have been in the process of signing military accommodation agreements with a number of Pacific Rim countries, including Canada, the past year, allowing for exchanges of military assistance, training, transfers of equipment and cooperation at the same time as it tries to wiggle out from the Japanese constitution imposed by the Americans that limits its military forces to defensive purposes. Japan wants to be a major power once again, not only economically, but also politically and militarily. It continues to rely on the American military umbrella as it does this and this also suits American immediate objectives since Japan can then become a powerful ally in the region. Japan seems to want to become more than an ally of the US. It wants to become again a power in the world in its own right. Until it has achieved its objective of again being a world power it can be expected to be a loyal ally to the USA and therefore a threat to Russia. It will not ask the US to withdraw its forces until it is ready; and the Russian government would face serious problems on the domestic front if it surrendered the islands to Japan under these conditions so it is unlikely that a peace treaty can be concluded between Russia and Japan in the near future.

So as North Korea, having suffered decades of Japanese military occupation, tries to deal with US militarism in the region, Russia has to contend with both US existing militarism and a rising Japanese militarism both of which constitute threats to its peace and security, a result of unfinished business from a world war that threatens a new world war.

Wilson-Raybould is due to testify to the House of Commons justice committee about a newspaper report which said she was pressured by senior officials last year to help SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid a corruption trial.

Polls show the allegation is starting to hurt the Liberals ahead of what looks set to be a tightly contested federal election against the official opposition Conservative Party in October.

Trudeau said on Tuesday the Liberal government would waive cabinet confidentiality to let Wilson-Raybould address most aspects of the case, but not all of them.

In a letter send to the justice committee late on Tuesday, Wilson-Raybould complained this “falls far short of what is required” for her to give a full account.

Trudeau told reporters on Wednesday the “justice committee is looking into the issue of whether or not (Wilson-Raybould) underwent pressure or inappropriate pressure and she will be able to speak fully.”

Opposition politicians accuse Trudeau of trying to cover up an attempt by officials to help SNC-Lavalin, which could be banned from bidding for federal contracts for a decade if found guilty on charges of bribing Libyan officials.

“Justin Trudeau can no longer hide the fact that he was at the center of an attempt to interfere in a criminal prosecution. He must come clean with Canadians,” Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said on Wednesday.

Wilson-Raybould’s testimony is due to start at about 4 p.m. ET (2100 GMT) and last for about two hours.

While officials say they spoke to Wilson-Raybould about the potential economic damage a trial could cause SNC-Lavalin, they insist they did not behave inappropriately.

Trudeau last week said he had been concerned about possible job losses at the firm. SNC-Lavalin is based in the province of Quebec, where the Liberals say they need to pick up more seats to stand a chance of retaining a majority government.

The Globe and Mail newspaper, which broke the story, said Wilson-Raybould had resisted pressure to let SNC-Lavalin off with a fine. She was unexpectedly demoted in January and resigned in February.

She danced herself to her death six days later, and soon thirty-four more villagers joined her. Then more. In a month more than 400 people had died from the mysterious dancing plague. In late-nineteenth-century England an eccentric gentleman founded the No Nose Club in his gracious townhome—a social club for those who had lost their noses, and other body parts, to the plague of syphilis for which there was then no cure.

There, in a public ceremony, the frightened but dignified child handed over to the British East India Company in a formal Act of Submission to Queen Victoria not only swathes of the richest land in India, but also arguably the single most valuable object in the subcontinent: the celebrated Koh-i Noor diamond. The Mountain of Light.The history of the Koh-i-Noor that was then commissioned by the British may have been one woven together from gossip of Delhi Bazaars, but it was to be become the accepted version. Only now is it finally challenged, freeing the diamond from the fog of mythology which has clung to it for so long. The resulting history is one of greed, murder, torture, colonialism and appropriation through an impressive slice of south and central Asian history. It ends with the jewel in its current controversial setting: in the crown of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother.Masterly, powerful and erudite, this is history at its most compelling and invigorating.It was a clear spring day, Monday, March 20, 1995, when five members of the religious cult Aum Shinrikyo conducted chemical warfare on the Tokyo subway system using sarin, a poison gas twenty-six times as deadly as cyanide. The unthinkable had happened, a major urban transit system had become the target of a terrorist attack.In an attempt to discover why, Haruki Murakami, internationally acclaimed author ofand arguably Japan’s most important contemporary novelist, talked to the people who lived through the catastrophe—from a Subway Authority employee with survivor guilt, to a fashion salesman with more venom for the media than for the perpetrators, to a young cult member who vehemently condemns the attack though he has not quit Aum. Through these and many other voices, Murakami exposes intriguing aspects of the Japanese psyche. And as he discerns the fundamental issues leading to the attack, we achieve a clear vision of an event that could occur anytime, anywhere.

But the song's international popularity is no passing fad. ""Gangnam Style"" is only one tool in South Korea's extraordinarily elaborate and effective strategy to become a major world superpower by first becoming the world's number one pop culture exporter.As a child, Euny Hong moved from America to the Gangnam neighbourhood in Seoul. She was a witness to the most accelerated part of South Korea's economic development, during which time it leapfrogged from third-world military dictatorship to first-world liberal democracy on the cutting edge of global technology.Euny Hong recounts how South Korea vaulted itself into the twenty-first century, becoming a global leader in business, technology, education, and pop culture. Featuring lively, in-depth reporting and numerous interviews with Koreans working in all areas of government and society,reveals how a really uncool country became cool, and how a nation that once banned miniskirts, long hair on men, and rock ‘n' roll could come to mass produce boy bands, soap operas, and the world's most important smart phone.Jon Krakauer’s literary reputation rests on insightful chronicles of lives conducted at the outer limits., he shifts his focus from extremes of physical adventure to extremes of religious belief within our own borders. At the core of his book is an appalling double murder committed by two Mormon Fundamentalist brothers, Ron and Dan Lafferty, who insist they received a revelation from God commanding them to kill their blameless victims. Beginning with a meticulously researched account of this ""divinely inspired"" crime, Krakauer constructs a multilayered, bone-chilling narrative of messianic delusion, savage violence, polygamy, and unyielding faith. Along the way, he uncovers a shadowy offshoot of America’s fastest-growing religion, and raises provocative questions about the nature of religious belief.Krakauer takes readers inside isolated communities in the American West, Canada, and Mexico, where some forty-thousand Mormon Fundamentalists believe the mainstream Mormon Church went unforgivably astray when it renounced polygamy. Defying both civil authorities and the Mormon establishment in Salt Lake City, the leaders of these outlaw sects are zealots who answer only to God. Marrying prodigiously and with virtual impunity (the leader of the largest fundamentalist church took seventy-five ""plural wives,"" several of whom were wed to him when they were fourteen or fifteen and he was in his eighties), fundamentalist prophets exercise absolute control over the lives of their followers, and preach that any day now the world will be swept clean in a hurricane of fire, sparing only their most obedient adherents.Weaving the story of the Lafferty brothers and their fanatical brethren with a clear-eyed look at Mormonism’s violent past, Krakauer examines the underbelly of the most successful homegrown faith in the United States, and finds a distinctly American brand of religious extremism. The result is vintage Krakauer, an utterly compelling work of nonfiction that illuminates an otherwise confounding realm of human behavior.""Who were they? Ordinary people like you or me—or monsters?” asks internationally acclaimed author Slavenka Drakulić as she sets out to understand the people behind the horrific crimes committed during the war that tore apart Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Drawing on firsthand observations of the trials, as well as on other sources, Drakulić portrays some of the individuals accused of murder, rape, torture, ordering executions, and more during one of the most brutal conflicts in Europe in the twentieth century, including former Serbian president Slobodan Milošević; Radislav Krstić, the first to be sentenced for genocide; Biljana Plavšić, the only woman accused of war crimes; and Ratko Mladić, now in hiding.With clarity and emotion, Drakulić paints a wrenching portrait of a country needlessly torn apart.The “dean of Cold War historians” (The New York Times) now presents the definitive account of the global confrontation that dominated the last half of the twentieth century.

149,Empty,2019-02-27T12:35:00Z,Tensions have escalated between India and Pakistan after New Delhi launched air strikes in Pakistani territory. DW takes a look at the turbulent history between the nuclear-armed neighbors.,"Bloody partition (1947): The two neighbors have shared a tense relationship ever since the British divided the Indian subcontinent in a secular but mainly Hindu India and Muslim-majority state of Pakistan. The partition sparked riots and communal violence across the region and led to one of the largest human migrations in history.

The escalation of Kashmir conflict (1947-48): India and Pakistan contested Kashmir — a Muslim-majority kingdom ruled by a Hindu Maharaja — even before their independence from Britain. But the dispute escalated after Kashmir ruler Hari Singh acceded Kashmir to India in return for New Delhi's help to ward off attacks by an army of Pakistani tribesmen. The developments led to the first full-blown war over Kashmir between the two countries.

Partition of India: The way forward Birth of two nations In 1947, British India was divided into two countries - India and Pakistan. Pakistan's founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah and his All-India Muslim League party had first demanded autonomy for Muslim-majority areas in the undivided India, and only later a separate country for Muslims. Jinnah believed that Hindus and Muslims could not continue to live together, as they were distinctly different ""nations.""

Partition of India: The way forward The line of blood The partition of British India was extremely violent. Following the birth of India and Pakistan, violent communal riots began in many western areas, mostly in Punjab. Historians say that more than a million people died in clashes, and millions more migrated from Indian territory to Pakistan and from the Pakistani side to India.

Partition of India: The way forward The 1948 war India and Pakistan clashed over Kashmir soon after their independence. The Muslim-majority Kashmir region was ruled by a Hindu leader, but Jinnah wanted it to be part of Pakistani territory. Indian and Pakistani troops fought in Kashmir in 1948, with India taking control of most part of the valley, while Pakistan occupied a smaller area. India and Pakistan continue to clash over Kashmir.

Partition of India: The way forward Like US and Canada? Liberal historians say that Jinnah and Mahatma Gandhi wanted cordial ties between newly independent states. Jinnah, for instance, believed that ties between India and Pakistan should be similar to those between the US and Canada. But after his death in 1948, his successors followed a collision course with New Delhi.

Partition of India: The way forward The 'other' Indian and Pakistani governments present very different accounts of the partition. While India emphasizes the Indian National Congress' freedom movement against British rulers - with Gandhi as its main architect - Pakistani textbooks focus on a ""struggle"" against both British and Hindu ""oppression."" State propaganda in both countries paints each other as an ""enemy"" that cannot be trusted.

Partition of India: The way forward Worsening ties Diplomatic ties between India and Pakistan have remained acrimonious for the past seven decades. The issue of Islamist terrorism has marred relations in the last few years, with New Delhi accusing Islamabad of backing Islamist jihadists to wage a war in India-administered Kashmir. India also blames Pakistan-based groups for launching terror attacks on Indian soil. Islamabad denies these claims.

Partition of India: The way forward The way forward Many young people in both India and Pakistan are urging their governments to improve bilateral ties. Islamabad-based documentary filmmaker Wajahat Malik believes the best way for India and Pakistan to develop a closer relationship is through more interaction between their peoples. ""Trade and tourism are the way forward for us. When people come together, the states will follow suit,"" Malik told DW. Author: Shamil Shams



UN resolution (1948): India dragged the Kashmir dispute to the United Nations Security Council, which passed a resolution calling for a referendum to decide the status of Kashmir. But the Security Council made the referendum conditional to the withdrawal of Pakistani troops and reduction of Indian military presence to the minimum to maintain law and order in the region. The war ended with a UN-brokered ceasefire but Pakistan refused to withdraw its troops. A ceasefire line effectively partitioned Kashmir with both sides controlling parts of the erstwhile kingdom but claiming it in its entirety.

Indo-Pakistan War (1965): Despite several attempts to solve the Kashmir dispute and deescalate tensions, the two neighbors fought their second war over the contested region. The brief war ended with yet-another UN-mandated ceasefire. Both sides returned to their previous positions.

War over Bangladesh (1971): India and Pakistan fought their third war, this time over East Pakistan. The conflict ended in a defeat for Pakistan and the formation of Bangladesh.

Simla Agreement (1972): Following Pakistan's surrender in the 1971 war, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Pakistani leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto met and signed an agreement in the Indian hill town of Simla. The ceasefire line in Kashmir is designated as the Line of Control (LoC) and the two parties agree to resolve the dispute through negotiations.

Former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Pakistani leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto signed the Simla Agreement in 1972

Armed resistance in Kashmir (1989): A pro-independenceinsurgencygathered momentum in India-administered Kashmir following disputed stateelections. The insurgency escalated over the next decade, partly fanned by a violent crackdown by Indian troops. India accused Pakistan of supporting the insurgents by providing weapons and training. Pakistan denied this claim.

Kargil conflict (1999): The two neighbors, by now nuclear powers, entered into an armed conflict after militants from across the LoC took control of key strategic positions in India-administered Kashmir. India drove the militants out but blamed Pakistan for supporting the incursion. The diplomatic gains made after a historic meeting in Lahore between the prime ministers of the two countries were eroded and India broke off relations.

Indian Parliament attack (2001): Tensions between India and Pakistan reached a new high after a terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament. India blamed Pakistan-based terror outfits for the attack and deployed troops on its borders with Pakistan. Islamabad reciprocated. The standoff ended after an international mediation.

Ceasefire (2003): The two sides agreed to a ceasefire along the LoC. The ceasefire is still in force but the two countries have blamed each other for occasionally violating it.

India broke off all talks with Pakistan after attacks in Mumbai that New Delhi claimed was sanctioned by Pakistan's intelligence agency.

Mumbai attacks (2008): Armed gunmen launched several attacks in India's financial capital of Mumbai, killing more than 150 people. India blamed Pakistan for the attacks. But Islamabad vociferously denied the Indian assertion that Lashkar-e-Taiba, the terror outfit behind the attacks, was sanctioned by Pakistan's intelligence agency. India broke off all talks with Pakistan after the attacks. New Delhi continues to maintain that ""terror and talks"" can't go together.

Former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi tried to usher in a new era of peace.

Surgical strikes (2016): Efforts by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif to relaunch talks came to an abrupt halt after an attack on an Indian army base by a Pakistan-based terror outfit, Jaish-e-Mohammed. India retaliated to the killing of 19 soldiers by launching ""surgical strikes"" on alleged terror camps on the other side of the LoC. Pakistan denied India's claims.

India bombs targets in Pakistan (2019): India conducted airstrikes on an alleged Jaish-e-Mohammed terror camp in Pakistan's Balakot. The attack came just days after the terror outfit claimed responsibility for killing 40 Indian soldiers in a suicide attack in Kashmir. A day later, Pakistan said it downed two Indian jets in retaliation.

Feb. 28 (UPI) -- Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau denied accusations Thursday that he attempted to intervene in a corruption investigation targeting a major Canadian contractor.

Trudeau's comments came a day after former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould said Trudeau pressured her, as Canada's top prosecutor, to abandon the investigation of SNC-Lavalin.

She said the intervention included threats from Trudeau and senior staff.

Thursday, Trudeau said he's trying to determine whether Wilson-Raybould will be allowed to remain in the Liberal caucus. She left the justice ministry in January to head the veterans affairs ministry. She resigned from that post earlier this month.

The company had lobbied for a ""remediation agreement"" to pay a fine and avoid trial. If convicted of charges, SNC-Lavalin would be banned for 10 years from bidding for federal contracts.

In dramatic testimony Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould said Trudeau called her a week before a cabinet shuffle last month and advised her that she would effectively be reassigned.

""I will not go into details of this call, or subsequent communications about the shuffle, but I will say that I stated I believed the reason was because of the SNC matter. They denied this to be the case,"" she said.

Trudeau said Thursday he disagreed Wilson-Raybould's account of events, adding that any lobbying he or his staff did in SNC-Lavalin's behalf was done to protect jobs.

""I have taken knowledge of her testimony and there are still reflections to have on next steps,"" he said, adding that her departure from the justice ministry had nothing to do with SNC-Lavalin.

""Had [former treasury board president] Scott Brison not stepped down, Jody Wilson-Raybould would still be minister of justice and attorney general of Canada,"" he said.

Trudeau said it will be up to ethics commissioner Mario Dion to determine who's telling the truth.

""Canadians need to know that we have an officer of Parliament who is tasked with a specific role to make sure that in questions where there are disagreements amongst politicians, amongst elected officials, there is an arbiter who is empowered to be like a judge,"" he said.

Some in Canada's Conservative Party have urged the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to investigate, and some called for Trudeau's resignation.

151,Empty,2019-02-26T11:30:13Z,"Examining his record on the economy, corruption, foreign policy, and the treatment of religious and ethnic minorities.","General Ulysses S. Grant during the Civil War at his headquarters in Cold Harbor, Va., June 1864 (Library of Congress)

Examining his record on the economy, corruption, foreign policy, and the treatment of religious and ethnic minorities

In Part One of this essay , I looked at why the presidency of Ulysses S. Grant received so little historical respect for so long, and why his record on Reconstruction — the defining issue of his time in office (1869–1876) — deserves to be honored, even though many of his accomplishments in that area failed to endure beyond his presidency.

As with any president, however, Grant had a lot else on his plate. Today, I’ll look at Grant’s record in three other areas: the economy and corruption, foreign policy, and the treatment of Native Americans and religious minorities.

The Gilded Age: President Grant’s economic record was decidedly mixed in the short run, but much better in the long run. The national economy boomed until it crashed in 1873, setting off a years-long depression that hit Europe as well as the U.S. Huge fortunes were made and lost during Grant’s presidency. The average American grew better off, but not nearly as much as the wealthiest “robber barons.” Ultimately, presidents in the 19th century had few levers to influence the economy besides building interstate infrastructure. But that was just as well, given the primitive state of economic thought at the time beyond the basics of supply and demand. Grant cut spending and debt in his first term, and cut tariffs as well, though he embraced a more protectionist view in his second term.

Grant, painfully aware of his limited business acumen, may have relied too much on the advice of plutocrats, but he was also free of ideology. In 1874, he stayed up all night alone preparing a message explaining his reasons for signing an inflationary bill authorizing new paper money; unpersuaded by his own arguments, he reversed course and vetoed the bill the next morning. For better and worse, it is hard to picture a modern president doing that.

In the long run, the laissez-faire economy of the 1860s and 1870s would lay the foundation for a massive expansion of American industry, transforming the country in the following decades into the world’s mightiest economic power. For all the criticisms of the inequalities of the Gilded Age in the roaring North and West of the country, the era was much kinder to those regions and their inhabitants than to the South, where industrialization lagged and black Americans in particular were left behind, with most toiling as subsistence sharecroppers.

Corruption was the watchword of the day, and scandals connected the highest levels of finance and industry (the gold market, the railroad business) with the highest levels of the federal government, reaching Grant’s own family and closest advisers. This was partly a feature of the times, but it was more than a coincidence that it happened on Grant’s watch. Grant throughout his life was an excellent judge of talent but a terrible judge of character, naïve about business and a frequent target of con men. His combination of loyalty to friends and family, magnanimity, and willingness to give the benefit of the doubt meant that he lacked the instinct to cut off ethically compromised people until the evidence against them was overwhelming. While Grant was sensitive to ethical conflicts of interest during the war, his finances were also chronically insecure, and he openly envied the gifts lavished by other grateful nations on their war heroes (e.g., the U.K.’s treatment of the Duke of Wellington). He seems never to have questioned why benefactors would ply him with favors. He also remained a foe of the civil-service reforms that were ultimately implemented after James Garfield’s assassination, partly out of loyalty to the spoils-system bosses who supported him.

If Grant was too tolerant of unethical people, he also presided over a new Justice Department that instituted the first large-scale prosecutions of federal-government corruption in U.S. history. The first special counsels date to the Grant years, and while Grant sacked one of them for impugning his own integrity in a closing argument to a jury, he generally let the chips fall where they may — even when corruption probes ensnared people close to him. Just as his Reconstruction policies created tools with which future presidents could attack America’s racial problems, his handling of the Justice Department created tools for future presidents to attack corruption.

Foreign policy: Taking the reins of a war-weary nation at the tail end of a turbulent period in international affairs, Grant’s chief concern was to still the waters. As general of the Army, he had pushed for an invasion of Mexico to dislodge the French and chase out ex-Confederate adventurers such as Jubal Early whom he suspected of further hostile intentions. Then–secretary of state William H. Seward, however, counseled patience, and three events in 1867 vindicated him: The French-backed regime in Mexico fell, Seward completed the Alaska purchase, and the British established the unified Dominion of Canada (in part a response to the realization in 1861 that Canada was unprepared to fend off a feared American invasion). By the time Grant took office, North America was quiet.

The great foreign-policy success of Grant’s tenure was the peaceable resolution of the CSS Alabama claims. America demanded damages from Great Britain, still the world’s most powerful empire, over “neutral” British provision of a warship to the Confederacy. Grant and his secretary of state, Hamilton Fish, managed an international arbitration that gave a substantial monetary award to the United States, reduced tensions with Britain so successfully as to set the two nations on the path to a long-term alliance, and established a new model for the resolution of international disputes. The Alabama precedent was so respected internationally that Grant was later asked to mediate a dispute between China and Japan.

Grant failed at his other major foreign-policy goal, the American annexation of Santo Domingo, the territory that would become the Dominican Republic. Haiti’s island neighbor, which had failed in its first try as an independent state and gone through a period of renewed Spanish control, was receptive to an American purchase, but tenacious opposition in the Senate shot down Grant’s plan. Where antebellum efforts to annex Latin American territory aimed at plowing new fields for human bondage, Grant had other purposes for seeking to annex the Dominican, which he envisioned as an American state: exploiting its natural resources, providing a domestic haven for African Americans fleeing southern repression, and building a naval base to control the approaches to a future Central American canal. (As it happened, it would be a generation before the canal would be built, but the Suez Canal had opened in 1869 and a canal across Panama or Nicaragua was already eagerly anticipated.)

A successful annexation may have been in America’s long-term interests as well as those of the Dominican and Haiti. For better or worse, it would have changed the shape of U.S.–Caribbean relations for generations. But Grant was unable to galvanize popular opinion or persuade influential senators — even ardent abolitionists such as Charles Sumner — who feared assuming responsibility for an island nation full of black, Spanish-speaking people.

Having measured the limits of popular appetite for expansion into the Caribbean, Grant backed down from an 1873 confrontation with Spain that found his administration on the opposite side of the Alabama precedent when an American ship was captured bringing aid to Cuban rebels. He was more successful in opening foreign markets to trade without annexation, as he did in Korea (using gunboat diplomacy) and Hawaii.

Despite the missed opportunity in Santo Domingo, Grant could claim one major long-term foreign-policy accomplishment with no foreign wars and no serious setbacks for the nation — a better record than those of many other presidents before and after him.

Sioux gold, Chinese women, and religious liberty: Aside from his valiant but often doomed efforts to secure African-American civil rights, Grant’s record on the rights of minority groups in America was checkered, to say the least.

The frontier was still a pressing concern. As with his Reconstruction policy, Grant tried to be magnanimous and pacific in his dealings with both Native Americans and western settlers, and found himself instead caught between two perpetually warring camps. In the most celebrated example, the discovery of gold in the Black Hills, the ancestral lands of the Sioux, led to the usual pressures from white settlers seeking to exploit valuable resources and remove the tribe to some place out of the way. Grant not only failed to hold back the tide, he also let himself be talked into keeping George Armstrong Custer on the mission to confront the Sioux, against his better judgment. The 1876 massacre of Custer’s men was a short-term humiliation for the U.S. Army. It was also a long-term disaster for Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, and the Sioux tribe, who found themselves in the unenviable position of having galvanized the American public to support a punitive military response.

The Sioux didn’t care much about gold; in purely economic terms, they would gladly have traded their lands for greener pastures. But they cared very much about the importance of the Black Hills to their religious traditions. Grant’s Native American policies were based on the view that the tribes would never be able to live in peace or prosperity until they assimilated into “white” civilization: Christianity, schooling, farming, trades. This was both a well-meaning and a coldly realistic point of view, vindicated by subsequent history, but it gave no weight to Native American religion or culture.

For Grant, a devout if undemonstrative Methodist, failures of empathy for religious minorities and a preference for assimilation into the institutions of mainstream Protestant America were recurring blind spots. The most infamous example was General Order No. 11, a hastily issued 1862 directive that expelled Jews from Grant’s military district. The order, swiftly rescinded at the insistence of a horrified President Lincoln, could be understood in context (Grant was furious at merchants trading with the enemy, including his own father’s Jewish business partners) but not justified. Grant simply gave in to anti-Semitic stereotypes. He repented soon afterward, and spent a good deal of his campaigns and presidency building bridges with American Jews in a sincere show of having learned from a prejudiced decision made with too little thought.

He did not rethink his approach toward Catholics or Mormons, however. Amid an openly anti-Catholic debate over “the School Question” with parallels to the contemporary Kulturkampf in Germany, Grant in an 1875 speech called for new laws on secular and religious schooling, as part of a legislative agenda he summarized in his penultimate State of the Union message in 1875, which warned of the subversion of intelligent self-government by “the demagogue or by priestcraft”:

First. That the States shall be required to afford the opportunity of a good common-school education to every child within their limits. Second. No sectarian tenets shall ever be taught in any school supported in whole or in part by the State, nation, or by the proceeds of any tax levied upon any community. Make education compulsory so far as to deprive all persons who can not read and write from becoming voters after the year 1890, disfranchising [sic] none, however, on grounds of illiteracy who may be voters at the time this amendment takes effect. Third. Declare church and state forever separate and distinct, but each free within their proper spheres; and that all church property shall bear its own proportion of taxation. Fourth. Drive out licensed immorality, such as polygamy and the importation of women for illegitimate purposes. To recur again to the centennial year, it would seem as though now, as we are about to begin the second century of our national existence, would be a most fitting time for these reforms.

Notably, in contrast to current policy, Grant proposed taxing church properties, excepting only churches and cemeteries. James G. Blaine, then speaker of the House, introduced a constitutional amendment, which was understood at the time to be aimed squarely at states such as New York that chose to support Catholic schooling out of their general-education budgets:

No State shall make any law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; and no money raised by taxation in any State for the support of public schools, or derived from any public fund therefor, nor any public lands devoted thereto, shall ever be under the control of any religious sect; nor shall any money so raised or lands so devoted be divided between religious sects or denominations.

The amendment passed the House overwhelmingly before falling four votes short in the Senate. Thirty-eight states would subsequently add “Blaine Amendments” to their own constitutions in the following decades — amendments that remain potent weapons in education-funding battles to this day. In 1884, Catholic backlash against Blaine in New York cost Republicans the White House for the first time since 1856.

Grant also pressed for a hard federal line against Mormon marriage practices, as he noted elsewhere in his 1875 State of the Union message:

In nearly every annual message that I have had the honor of transmitting to Congress I have called attention to the anomalous, not to say scandalous, condition of affairs existing in the Territory of Utah, and have asked for definite legislation to correct it. That polygamy should exist in a free, enlightened, and Christian country, without the power to punish so flagrant a crime against decency and morality, seems preposterous. True, there is no law to sustain this unnatural vice; but what is needed is a law to punish it as a crime, and at the same time to fix the status of the innocent children, the offspring of this system, and of the possibly innocent plural wives. But as an institution polygamy should be banished from the land.

Grant was following two decades of Republican rhetoric; the 1856 party platform had declared that “it is the duty of Congress to prohibit in the territories those twin relics of barbarism, polygamy and slavery.” Federal law banned bigamy in 1862, and in 1874, Grant signed the Poland Act, removing such prosecutions to federal court to prevent nullification by local Mormon-dominated courts. (Brigham Young himself was indicted in 1872.) In the end, after harsher federal action in the 1880s, the Church of Latter-day Saints renounced plural marriage, paving the way for Utah statehood and eventual Mormon acceptance into the American mainstream.

On immigration, Grant moved from the liberalizing Naturalization Act of 1870, which allowed black immigrants to be naturalized on the same terms as whites, to the Page Act of 1875, the nation’s first restrictive immigration law. The Page Act banned immigration by Chinese women, which Grant saw as necessary to prevent sex trafficking and de facto sex slavery: “I invite the attention of Congress to another, though perhaps no less an evil — the importation of Chinese women, but few of whom are brought to our shores to pursue honorable or useful occupations.” The ban would be followed, in 1882, by a broader ban on Chinese immigration.

Grant’s Mormon policy, Native American policy, and support for the Page Act were all part of a broader, Victorian-era view of public morality and humanitarianism that incorporated his opposition to slavery and the Klan. Grant supported and signed the 1873 “Comstock laws” that forbade use of the mails to promote abortion, contraception, or pornography, and appointed their proponent, Anthony Comstock, a special agent of the Postal Inspection Service with broad powers of enforcement.

Many of Grant’s collisions with religious practices came on issues that remain fraught to this day. In 2019’s political climate, Grant would be considered a conservative on traditional marriage, abortion, and international sex trafficking, and a liberal on education funding. His view of the path forward for Native Americans was, if jarring to modern eyes, more humane than those of Sherman and Sheridan, and prescient about the fate of the tribes of the Great Plains. Yet recent positive biographies have mostly ignored Grant’s record on a number of these issues. Ron Chernow, for example, spends a lot of time examining Grant’s relationship with American Jews, but ignores his record on Mormon polygamy and Chinese immigration, and essentially endorses his pro–Blaine Amendment stance.

Grant in full: On the strength of his military record, Ulysses S. Grant was one of our greatest Americans, and his presidency should be seen as an addition to that legacy, not an embarrassment. Grant’s flaws deserve to be remembered. He probably could not have done much more to build public support for continuing Reconstruction after 1876, but he could have done more to prevent corruption, respect religious liberties, win the debate over Dominican annexation, and avoid the catastrophe at Little Bighorn. The corruption scandals of Grant’s tenure were far less important in the long run than his policy record, which they should not be allowed to overshadow, but they did interfere with his ability to do the job by handicapping his Supreme Court nominations, his Reconstruction and Native American policies, and even his efforts to annex Santo Domingo.

In the end, though, Grant buried secession and slavery for good, kept the peace abroad, laid the building blocks for a long-term Anglo–American alliance, oversaw the nation’s turn down the path to economic-superpower status, and can claim both the Fifteenth Amendment and the modern Justice Department as important milestones in his legacy. That’s a record any president would be proud of.

152,Empty,2019-02-26T19:03:35Z,The three major parties all came out of last night's byelections with reasons to celebrate - and even more reasons to worry.,"Is the glass half full or half empty?

Liberals, Conservatives and New Democrats might all be asking themselves that question today after seeing the results from last night's three federal byelections.

On one hand, each party scored a win and made some gains in popular support — the NDP in Burnaby South, the Conservatives in York–Simcoe and the Liberals in Outremont.

On the other, each party also suffered a hit in support in electoral battlegrounds key to their hopes for success in October's federal vote.

Turnout was abysmal, even by byelection standards. It hit a new low in this session in York–Simcoe, where preliminary turnout figures stand at just 19.9 per cent.

Bad weather undoubtedly played a role in that, but neither Outremont nor Burnaby South had the same excuse. Turnout was just 21.4 per cent in Outremont and 29.9 per cent in Burnaby South — both below average levels for a byelection.

That makes it difficult to draw wider conclusions from the results but — notwithstanding the low turnout — the voting patterns still fit within the broader historical trends in each riding.

So what are the tea leaves saying?

Liberals can still bank on Quebec to offset losses elsewhere

The path to re-election for Justin Trudeau's Liberals in the fall is to win new seats in Quebec — largely at the expense of the NDP — to compensate for what appear to be inevitable losses in places like the Greater Toronto Area.

That strategy looks intact after Monday, with the Liberals gaining 6.9 percentage points in the Montreal riding of Outremont and taking the seat away from the NDP.

With 40.4 per cent of the vote, Rachel Bendayan put up the best result for the Liberals in Outremont since 2004. If the party can repeat these gains in other parts of Quebec, the New Democrats will be hard-pressed to hold any of the 16 seats they won in the province in 2015.

But the Liberals will struggle to hold or win suburban seats in the rest of Canada if they repeat the kind of losses they suffered in Burnaby South (a drop of 7.9 points from the previous vote) and York–Simcoe (a drop of 8.8 points).

Singh finally gets his win, but ...

The big winner on Monday has to be NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. He staked his political future on the voters of Burnaby South and his gamble paid off. This is the first win Singh can boast of since he became leader in October 2017 and it's only the second byelection of the 17 held in the current Parliament which saw the NDP increase its share of the vote.

Singh beat his nearest rival, Liberal candidate Richard T. Lee, by a margin of 13 points — far better than the 1.2-point margin the NDP managed in this seat in 2015. He gained 3.9 points over the NDP's performance in the riding here last time. The lack of a Green candidate on the ballot in Burnaby South might have helped Singh, but the jump in the NDP's performance there was bigger than the 2.9 per cent of the vote the Greens took in 2015.

New Democrats should worry about the 18-point drop in their support in Outremont, however. The result is in line with losses the party has suffered in other byelections in Quebec, so it isn't all due to the departure of former leader (and Outremont MP) Tom Mulcair.

Polls suggest the NDP has lost a lot of support in Quebec and every last one of its seats is vulnerable. The results in Outremont did nothing to change that perception.

With 26.1 per cent of the vote, however, the NDP's Julia Sanchez did better than the party's candidates did in Outremont in 2004 and 2006 — before Mulcair's breakthrough in 2007. That suggests the New Democrats have planted some roots in the province.

But those roots aren't deep enough to allow the NDP to breathe easily in Quebec, though it might offer hope to some of their higher-profile incumbents — people like Alexandre Boulerice, Ruth Ellen Brosseau and Guy Caron — that they can withstand the headwinds pushing against them.

A win is a win, but Conservative numbers flat

Of the three main parties, the Conservatives may have had the least at stake on Monday. York–Simcoe is a party stronghold where conservative candidates (of all stripes) have won the most votes in every election since 1979. But there's nothing in the results that should fill the Conservatives with enthusiasm — or dread, for that matter.

A win is a win, and Scot Davidson secured that for the party by a comfortable margin. But a gain of only 3.6 points in York–Simcoe is not what the Conservatives should be seeing if they're on track to oust the Liberals from power this year.

At 53.9 per cent, Davidson's share of the vote was well below the scores the party put up in York–Simcoe when it won government in 2008 and 2011. The win also pales in comparison to the 10.4-point gain the Conservatives saw in the Leeds-Grenville–Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes byelection in December.

Mixed results for Bernier, new high for Greens

People's Party Leader Maxime Bernier might be pleased with Laura-Lynn Thompson's 10.6 per cent result in Burnaby South, but Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is likely relieved that the PPC captured just two per cent of the vote in Outremont and York–Simcoe.

A party with national aspirations should expect to take more than two per cent of the vote in any riding; independent candidates combined for 1.8 per cent of the vote in Burnaby-South and the Progressive Canadian Party captured 3.8 per cent in York–Simcoe. Few seats will be decided by a margin of two points or less in the fall.

The Conservatives might be able to write off Thompson's performance as the result of her particular appeal for social conservative voters in that one riding. But if even half of that vote had gone to the Conservatives, they would have finished a strong second. If Bernier can find more candidates like Thompson, he might still have a spoiler role to play in the fall.

The Greens managing 12.5 per cent of the vote in Outremont — the party's best result in any federal election in any riding in Quebec — is notable, as the environment has emerged as a more pressing issue for voters in Quebec than in other parts of the country.

It makes for a crowded field in the province — the Bloc Québécois' new leader, Yves-François Blanchet, is a former environment minister and Singh has used the Liberal government's purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline as a wedge issue in Quebec. There might not be room for three parties in Quebec going hard on the environmental file.

But for now, there's something in these byelection results for just about everyone to be happy about. There's plenty of things there for them to worry about, too — and less than eight months left to worry about them.","Win, lose or draw?

Assad met with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani, as well as other top officials in Tehran. It was a rare foreign trip for Assad, who has visited Russia twice since the outbreak of the conflict eight years ago.

Khamenei praised Assad for strengthening the alliance between Iran, Syria and Hezbollah against US and Western plans for the region.

""The Islamic Republic of Iran sees helping Syria's government and nation as support for the resistance movement and is deeply proud of doing it,"" Khamenei said.

""The creation of the buffer that the Americans are seeking to create in Syria is an example of these dangerous conspiracies which must be strongly denounced and resisted,"" Khamenei added.

Syrian state TV reported that Assad ""thanked the Islamic Republic's leadership and people for what they have given to Syria during the war."" The presidency said ""both sides expressed their satisfaction with the strategic levels reached between the two countries in all fields.""

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on 'I feel nothing' On February 1, 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini returned to Tehran from exile in France. When a reporter asked him how he felt upon his return to Iran, Khomeini replied: ""Nothing — I feel nothing."" Some analysts interpreted his remarks as the Shiite leader's idea about embarking on a ""divine mission"" where emotions hardly mattered.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on The Shah ran out of time Two months before Khomeini's return to Iran, an estimated six to nine million people took to the streets in the country's major cities. The demonstrations were largely peaceful, compared to the violent September 8, 1978, protests. The Shah regime, headed by Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, had realized that its time in power was over and that they could not stop Khomeini's return.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on Even women rooted for Khomeini The revolutionary mood was so intense in Tehran that even many women celebrated Khomeini's return, ignoring the fact that Khomeini had slammed Shah's measures for women's emancipation in exile. In 1963, the Shah of Iran granted women the right to vote.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on A spectacle of exuberance In 1971, the Shah and his wife Farah Diba (seen in the picture) staged a lavish spectacle on the ancient site of Persepolis to mark the ""2,500th anniversary of the Iranian monarchy."" Many heads of state attended the event. Khomeini, in his message from exile, condemned the monarchy as ""cruel, evil and un-Islamic.""

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on Soldiers join the revolution Upon Khomeini's return to Iran in 1979, the military did not confront the protesters. On February 11, the army declared itself neutral. Despite that, the revolutionaries executed several generals in February and April.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on New government Soon after his return, Khomeini declared the monarchy, the previous government and parliament illegal, and said he would appoint a government ""because of the fact that this nation believes in me."" According to Iran experts, it was not self-deception but reality.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on The liberal face of the revolution Mehdi Bazargan, a scholar and pro-democracy activist, had campaigned against the Pahlavi dynasty, for which he had been incarcerated for several years. Khomeini appointed him as his first prime minister, although Bazargan was critical of him as well. Bazargan had called Khomeini a ""turbaned Shah"" after a meeting with the Ayatollah in Paris. He remained in office for only nine months.

Iran's Islamic Revolution 40 years on Occupation of the US Embassy In November 1979, radical Iranian students seized the US Embassy in Tehran and took the embassy staff hostage.

Khamenei, to this date, has the ultimate power over all state institutions. Although the 79-year-old does not have the same charisma as his predecessor, he represents the policies of Iranian hardliners who refuse to reform the system and continue to persecute dissidents.

Assad takes victory lap

Assad has retaken major cities and largely defeated rebels seeking to oust him with the support of Russia, Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah.

The regime now controls most of the population and about two-thirds of the country, excluding a jihadi-controlled enclave in Idlib, Turkish zones in the north and a part of the country controlled by US-backed Syrian Kurdish forces. Assad has vowed to bring all territory under the state's sovereignty.

Sitting in the room during Assad's meeting with Khamenei was General Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds Force — the overseas arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) which has provided the Syrian regime with military and financial support.

During their meeting, Rouhani assured Assad that ""Tehran will be alongside Damascus in the stabilization, return of refugees and internal political process.""

The two presidents also discussed efforts by Russia, Iran and Turkey to end the Syrian conflict.

Iranian-backed Shiite militias have carved out a major role in Syria's security apparatus, and Tehran and Damascus have in recent months signed a string of economic deals that are likely to further increase Iran's long-term presence in the country.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Rise of Hezbollah Hezbollah, or Party of God, was conceived by Muslim clerics in the 1980s in response to the Israeli invasion of South Lebanon in 1982. The Shiite group has a political and military wing.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization National support against Israel Hezbollah emerged in the 1980s as an amalgamation of Shiite militias and played a major role in the Lebanese civil war. It used guerrilla warfare to drive Israeli forces out of South Lebanon — Israel withdrew in 2000. Israel and Hezbollah fought another war in 2006. Its defense of Lebanon against Israel had won it cross-sectarian support and acceptance in Lebanese society.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Backed by Iran Since its creation, Hezbollah has received military, financial and political support from Iran and Syria. Today, Hezbollah's military wing is more powerful than Lebanon's own army and has become a major regional paramilitary force.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Political apparatus Hezbollah turned its focus to politics following the end of Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war. It represents a large section of the Lebanese Shiite population and is allied with other sectarian groups, including Christians. Their political development has mostly come under Hassan Nasrallah (pictured), who became the group's leader in 1992.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Armed wing Unlike other parties in Lebanon's multi-sided 1975-1990 civil war, Hezbollah did not disband its armed wing. Some Lebanese political groups, such as Prime Minister Saad Hariri's Future Movement, want Hezbollah to put down its arms. Hezbollah argues its militant wing is necessary to defend against Israel and other external threats.

A number of countries and bodies, including the United States, Israel, Canada and the Arab League, consider Hezbollah a terrorist organization. However, Australia and the European Union differentiate between its legitimate political activities and its militant wing.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Hezbollah enters Syria's civil war Hezbollah has been one of the main backers of Syrian President Bashar Assad in the country's civil war. Its entrance into the war helped save Assad, one of its chief patrons; secured weapons supply routes from Syria and formed a buffer zone around Lebanon against Sunni militant groups it feared would take over Syria. As a result it has won considerable support from Shiite communities in Lebanon.

Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-backed paramilitary organization Sectarianism Lebanon has long been at the center of regional power struggles, particularly between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

There is growing concern of another war between Hezbollah and Israel that could draw in Iran. Author: Chase Winter

Tensions with Israel, US

Iran's growing influence in Syria has increased the prospect of a conflict with Israel, which has carried out dozens of attacks on Iranian forces, Shiite militia and Hezbollah.

US President Donald Trump announced in December that all American forces would leave Syria, but US officials recently said between 200-400 troops would remain in the country to support US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces and prevent a resurgence of the ""Islamic State."" The US also has a base at al-Tanf, near the Iraqi border, where troops are expected to stay.

The decision to maintain a US troop presence is intended to prevent clashes between US-backed Syrian Kurdish forces and NATO ally Turkey. It is also viewed as an attempt to stop the Assad regime and Iran-backed militia from widening their grip over more of Syria's territory.

Grant received so little historical respect for so long, and why his record on Reconstruction — the defining issue of his time in office (1869–1876) — deserves to be honored, even though many of his accomplishments in that area failed to endure beyond his presidency.

As with any president, however, Grant had a lot else on his plate. Today, I’ll look at Grant’s record in three other areas: the economy and corruption, foreign policy, and the treatment of Native Americans and religious minorities.

The Gilded Age: President Grant’s economic record was decidedly mixed in the short run, but much better in the long run. The national economy boomed until it crashed in 1873, setting off a years-long depression that hit Europe as well as the U.S. Huge fortunes were made and lost during Grant’s presidency. The average American grew better off, but not nearly as much as the wealthiest “robber barons.” Ultimately, presidents in the 19th century had few levers to influence the economy besides building interstate infrastructure. But that was just as well, given the primitive state of economic thought at the time beyond the basics of supply and demand. Grant cut spending and debt in his first term, and cut tariffs as well, though he embraced a more protectionist view in his second term.

Grant, painfully aware of his limited business acumen, may have relied too much on the advice of plutocrats, but he was also free of ideology. In 1874, he stayed up all night alone preparing a message explaining his reasons for signing an inflationary bill authorizing new paper money; unpersuaded by his own arguments, he reversed course and vetoed the bill the next morning. For better and worse, it is hard to picture a modern president doing that.

In the long run, the laissez-faire economy of the 1860s and 1870s would lay the foundation for a massive expansion of American industry, transforming the country in the following decades into the world’s mightiest economic power. For all the criticisms of the inequalities of the Gilded Age in the roaring North and West of the country, the era was much kinder to those regions and their inhabitants than to the South, where industrialization lagged and black Americans in particular were left behind, with most toiling as subsistence sharecroppers.

Corruption was the watchword of the day, and scandals connected the highest levels of finance and industry (the gold market, the railroad business) with the highest levels of the federal government, reaching Grant’s own family and closest advisers. This was partly a feature of the times, but it was more than a coincidence that it happened on Grant’s watch. Grant throughout his life was an excellent judge of talent but a terrible judge of character, naïve about business and a frequent target of con men. His combination of loyalty to friends and family, magnanimity, and willingness to give the benefit of the doubt meant that he lacked the instinct to cut off ethically compromised people until the evidence against them was overwhelming. While Grant was sensitive to ethical conflicts of interest during the war, his finances were also chronically insecure, and he openly envied the gifts lavished by other grateful nations on their war heroes (e.g., the U.K.’s treatment of the Duke of Wellington). He seems never to have questioned why benefactors would ply him with favors. He also remained a foe of the civil-service reforms that were ultimately implemented after James Garfield’s assassination, partly out of loyalty to the spoils-system bosses who supported him.

If Grant was too tolerant of unethical people, he also presided over a new Justice Department that instituted the first large-scale prosecutions of federal-government corruption in U.S. history. The first special counsels date to the Grant years, and while Grant sacked one of them for impugning his own integrity in a closing argument to a jury, he generally let the chips fall where they may — even when corruption probes ensnared people close to him. Just as his Reconstruction policies created tools with which future presidents could attack America’s racial problems, his handling of the Justice Department created tools for future presidents to attack corruption.

Foreign policy: Taking the reins of a war-weary nation at the tail end of a turbulent period in international affairs, Grant’s chief concern was to still the waters. As general of the Army, he had pushed for an invasion of Mexico to dislodge the French and chase out ex-Confederate adventurers such as Jubal Early whom he suspected of further hostile intentions. Then–secretary of state William H. Seward, however, counseled patience, and three events in 1867 vindicated him: The French-backed regime in Mexico fell, Seward completed the Alaska purchase, and the British established the unified Dominion of Canada (in part a response to the realization in 1861 that Canada was unprepared to fend off a feared American invasion). By the time Grant took office, North America was quiet.

The great foreign-policy success of Grant’s tenure was the peaceable resolution of the CSS Alabama claims. America demanded damages from Great Britain, still the world’s most powerful empire, over “neutral” British provision of a warship to the Confederacy. Grant and his secretary of state, Hamilton Fish, managed an international arbitration that gave a substantial monetary award to the United States, reduced tensions with Britain so successfully as to set the two nations on the path to a long-term alliance, and established a new model for the resolution of international disputes. The Alabama precedent was so respected internationally that Grant was later asked to mediate a dispute between China and Japan.

Grant failed at his other major foreign-policy goal, the American annexation of Santo Domingo, the territory that would become the Dominican Republic. Haiti’s island neighbor, which had failed in its first try as an independent state and gone through a period of renewed Spanish control, was receptive to an American purchase, but tenacious opposition in the Senate shot down Grant’s plan. Where antebellum efforts to annex Latin American territory aimed at plowing new fields for human bondage, Grant had other purposes for seeking to annex the Dominican, which he envisioned as an American state: exploiting its natural resources, providing a domestic haven for African Americans fleeing southern repression, and building a naval base to control the approaches to a future Central American canal. (As it happened, it would be a generation before the canal would be built, but the Suez Canal had opened in 1869 and a canal across Panama or Nicaragua was already eagerly anticipated.)

A successful annexation may have been in America’s long-term interests as well as those of the Dominican and Haiti. For better or worse, it would have changed the shape of U.S.–Caribbean relations for generations. But Grant was unable to galvanize popular opinion or persuade influential senators — even ardent abolitionists such as Charles Sumner — who feared assuming responsibility for an island nation full of black, Spanish-speaking people.

Having measured the limits of popular appetite for expansion into the Caribbean, Grant backed down from an 1873 confrontation with Spain that found his administration on the opposite side of the Alabama precedent when an American ship was captured bringing aid to Cuban rebels. He was more successful in opening foreign markets to trade without annexation, as he did in Korea (using gunboat diplomacy) and Hawaii.

Despite the missed opportunity in Santo Domingo, Grant could claim one major long-term foreign-policy accomplishment with no foreign wars and no serious setbacks for the nation — a better record than those of many other presidents before and after him.

Sioux gold, Chinese women, and religious liberty: Aside from his valiant but often doomed efforts to secure African-American civil rights, Grant’s record on the rights of minority groups in America was checkered, to say the least.

The frontier was still a pressing concern. As with his Reconstruction policy, Grant tried to be magnanimous and pacific in his dealings with both Native Americans and western settlers, and found himself instead caught between two perpetually warring camps. In the most celebrated example, the discovery of gold in the Black Hills, the ancestral lands of the Sioux, led to the usual pressures from white settlers seeking to exploit valuable resources and remove the tribe to some place out of the way. Grant not only failed to hold back the tide, he also let himself be talked into keeping George Armstrong Custer on the mission to confront the Sioux, against his better judgment. The 1876 massacre of Custer’s men was a short-term humiliation for the U.S. Army. It was also a long-term disaster for Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, and the Sioux tribe, who found themselves in the unenviable position of having galvanized the American public to support a punitive military response.

The Sioux didn’t care much about gold; in purely economic terms, they would gladly have traded their lands for greener pastures. But they cared very much about the importance of the Black Hills to their religious traditions. Grant’s Native American policies were based on the view that the tribes would never be able to live in peace or prosperity until they assimilated into “white” civilization: Christianity, schooling, farming, trades. This was both a well-meaning and a coldly realistic point of view, vindicated by subsequent history, but it gave no weight to Native American religion or culture.

For Grant, a devout if undemonstrative Methodist, failures of empathy for religious minorities and a preference for assimilation into the institutions of mainstream Protestant America were recurring blind spots. The most infamous example was General Order No. 11, a hastily issued 1862 directive that expelled Jews from Grant’s military district. The order, swiftly rescinded at the insistence of a horrified President Lincoln, could be understood in context (Grant was furious at merchants trading with the enemy, including his own father’s Jewish business partners) but not justified. Grant simply gave in to anti-Semitic stereotypes. He repented soon afterward, and spent a good deal of his campaigns and presidency building bridges with American Jews in a sincere show of having learned from a prejudiced decision made with too little thought.

He did not rethink his approach toward Catholics or Mormons, however. Amid an openly anti-Catholic debate over “the School Question” with parallels to the contemporary Kulturkampf in Germany, Grant in an 1875 speech called for new laws on secular and religious schooling, as part of a legislative agenda he summarized in his penultimate State of the Union message in 1875, which warned of the subversion of intelligent self-government by “the demagogue or by priestcraft”:

First. That the States shall be required to afford the opportunity of a good common-school education to every child within their limits. Second. No sectarian tenets shall ever be taught in any school supported in whole or in part by the State, nation, or by the proceeds of any tax levied upon any community. Make education compulsory so far as to deprive all persons who can not read and write from becoming voters after the year 1890, disfranchising [sic] none, however, on grounds of illiteracy who may be voters at the time this amendment takes effect. Third. Declare church and state forever separate and distinct, but each free within their proper spheres; and that all church property shall bear its own proportion of taxation. Fourth. Drive out licensed immorality, such as polygamy and the importation of women for illegitimate purposes. To recur again to the centennial year, it would seem as though now, as we are about to begin the second century of our national existence, would be a most fitting time for these reforms.

Notably, in contrast to current policy, Grant proposed taxing church properties, excepting only churches and cemeteries. James G. Blaine, then speaker of the House, introduced a constitutional amendment, which was understood at the time to be aimed squarely at states such as New York that chose to support Catholic schooling out of their general-education budgets:

No State shall make any law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; and no money raised by taxation in any State for the support of public schools, or derived from any public fund therefor, nor any public lands devoted thereto, shall ever be under the control of any religious sect; nor shall any money so raised or lands so devoted be divided between religious sects or denominations.

The amendment passed the House overwhelmingly before falling four votes short in the Senate. Thirty-eight states would subsequently add “Blaine Amendments” to their own constitutions in the following decades — amendments that remain potent weapons in education-funding battles to this day. In 1884, Catholic backlash against Blaine in New York cost Republicans the White House for the first time since 1856.

Grant also pressed for a hard federal line against Mormon marriage practices, as he noted elsewhere in his 1875 State of the Union message:

In nearly every annual message that I have had the honor of transmitting to Congress I have called attention to the anomalous, not to say scandalous, condition of affairs existing in the Territory of Utah, and have asked for definite legislation to correct it. That polygamy should exist in a free, enlightened, and Christian country, without the power to punish so flagrant a crime against decency and morality, seems preposterous. True, there is no law to sustain this unnatural vice; but what is needed is a law to punish it as a crime, and at the same time to fix the status of the innocent children, the offspring of this system, and of the possibly innocent plural wives. But as an institution polygamy should be banished from the land.

Grant was following two decades of Republican rhetoric; the 1856 party platform had declared that “it is the duty of Congress to prohibit in the territories those twin relics of barbarism, polygamy and slavery.” Federal law banned bigamy in 1862, and in 1874, Grant signed the Poland Act, removing such prosecutions to federal court to prevent nullification by local Mormon-dominated courts. (Brigham Young himself was indicted in 1872.) In the end, after harsher federal action in the 1880s, the Church of Latter-day Saints renounced plural marriage, paving the way for Utah statehood and eventual Mormon acceptance into the American mainstream.

On immigration, Grant moved from the liberalizing Naturalization Act of 1870, which allowed black immigrants to be naturalized on the same terms as whites, to the Page Act of 1875, the nation’s first restrictive immigration law. The Page Act banned immigration by Chinese women, which Grant saw as necessary to prevent sex trafficking and de facto sex slavery: “I invite the attention of Congress to another, though perhaps no less an evil — the importation of Chinese women, but few of whom are brought to our shores to pursue honorable or useful occupations.” The ban would be followed, in 1882, by a broader ban on Chinese immigration.

Grant’s Mormon policy, Native American policy, and support for the Page Act were all part of a broader, Victorian-era view of public morality and humanitarianism that incorporated his opposition to slavery and the Klan. Grant supported and signed the 1873 “Comstock laws” that forbade use of the mails to promote abortion, contraception, or pornography, and appointed their proponent, Anthony Comstock, a special agent of the Postal Inspection Service with broad powers of enforcement.

Many of Grant’s collisions with religious practices came on issues that remain fraught to this day. In 2019’s political climate, Grant would be considered a conservative on traditional marriage, abortion, and international sex trafficking, and a liberal on education funding. His view of the path forward for Native Americans was, if jarring to modern eyes, more humane than those of Sherman and Sheridan, and prescient about the fate of the tribes of the Great Plains. Yet recent positive biographies have mostly ignored Grant’s record on a number of these issues. Ron Chernow, for example, spends a lot of time examining Grant’s relationship with American Jews, but ignores his record on Mormon polygamy and Chinese immigration, and essentially endorses his pro–Blaine Amendment stance.

Grant in full: On the strength of his military record, Ulysses S. Grant was one of our greatest Americans, and his presidency should be seen as an addition to that legacy, not an embarrassment. Grant’s flaws deserve to be remembered. He probably could not have done much more to build public support for continuing Reconstruction after 1876, but he could have done more to prevent corruption, respect religious liberties, win the debate over Dominican annexation, and avoid the catastrophe at Little Bighorn. The corruption scandals of Grant’s tenure were far less important in the long run than his policy record, which they should not be allowed to overshadow, but they did interfere with his ability to do the job by handicapping his Supreme Court nominations, his Reconstruction and Native American policies, and even his efforts to annex Santo Domingo.

In the end, though, Grant buried secession and slavery for good, kept the peace abroad, laid the building blocks for a long-term Anglo–American alliance, oversaw the nation’s turn down the path to economic-superpower status, and can claim both the Fifteenth Amendment and the modern Justice Department as important milestones in his legacy. That’s a record any president would be proud of.

In an age of collapsing public finances and an uncertain long-term economic future, the money needed to design new nuclear missile submarines is a huge cost commitment that could crowd out other needs. Then again, in an age of collapsing non-proliferation frameworks, clear hostility from ideologies that want nuclear weapons, and allies who are less capable and dependable, the downside of renouncing nuclear weapons is a huge risk commitment. Pick one, or the other. There is no free lunch. This article covers that momentous decision for Britain, and the contracts and debates associated with it.

Britain’s government took the first big steps in 2006-2007, a joint US-UK “Common Missile Compatment” (CMC) project was launched in 2008, and initial gate approval for Britain’s “Successor” project followed in 2011. Other contracts have followed, covering design, infrastructure, and even the new kind of nuclear reactor the submarines are expected to use. What hasn’t quite followed yet, is full approval to launch the build program.

Note that the CMC sub-program, which is financed by the USA and UK, is covered in its own article.

FY 2015 – 2019

RUSI

February 27/19: Maintenance Britain awarded Rolls-Royce a $307 million contract to maintain nuclear submarines. Until 2022, Rolls Royce will provide support and advice for systems on board the fleet of Trafalgar, Vanguard and Astute class submarines. The new deal, known as the Nuclear Propulsion Lifetime Management (NPLM) contract, forms part of a wider suite of contracts with Rolls-Royce to provide naval reactor plant design, support, advice and components to the submarine build program and provide enabling services such as infrastructure and IT. The British Defense Ministry also revealed the name of the third Dreadnought submarine, which will be called the HMS Warspite. The name Warspite goes back to 1595 and was the last “great ship” to be built during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. The newest submarine is expected to see service in the early 2030s, and will be the eighth Royal Navy ship to carry the name Warspite.

October 4/16: BAE Systems will commence work on the UK’s newest nuclear submarines following the release of nearly $1.7 billion in funds. The announcement was made by the Minister of Defence on Saturday after approval was given by MPs earlier this year. Known colloquially as the Trident system, the first of the Vanguard-class submarines will enter service in the early 2030s.

March 10/16: Britain’s Ministry of Defense has confirmed that it is to invest £642 million (US $908 million) in preparation for the production of its new fleet of Trident missile-armed nuclear submarines. The funding had initially been set out in the government’s 2015 strategic defense and security review (SDSR), and will be spent on upgrading production facilities at BAE Systems’ Barrow-in-Furness nuclear submarine yard, essential long lead items for the submarines, and the nuclear propulsion program being led by Rolls-Royce. In total, the Successor submarine program is estimated to cost around $44 billion, with a contingency fund of $13 billion set aside for any emergencies that arise.

December 15/15: The UK government may nationalize the nuclear submarine arm of Rolls-Royce as concerns grow that the company may be subject to a takeover bid by a foreign company. The news comes as Rolls-Royce has reported its fifth profit warning in 20 months as the company struggles to come to grips with its finances. While it’s not usually the Conservative Party’s style to nationalize, the company is integral to the development of the powering of the Trident nuclear deterrent system. Other alternatives may see a partial or full merger with BAE Systems, although this has already been mooted. Either way, David Cameron will be impatient to keep the firm within British control to protect UK interests and the security of the Trident program.

FY 2014

Aug 21/14: Industrial. BAE is starting to demolish certain disused buildings at their Barrow-in-Furness site, as the 1st major stage in a large-scale 8-year industrial program. An old foundry and boiler shop are the first to go, and construction will eventually include:

Refurbishment of the site’s main fabrication facility, together with its existing plant and machinery;



An extension to the Devonshire Dock Hall construction facility to include a new state-of-the-art manufacturing and installation facility;



An intent to build a 28,000 m2 off-site facility to store submarine parts and materials within the local area, for easier and faster access.

Sources: BAE Systems, “Demolition Begins To Transform Submarine Building”.

Feb 2/14: Politics. The buzz in Westminister is that Labour Party MPs are beginning to back away from their leader Ed Miliband’s support for the Successor Class. The erosion is serious enough that Conservative Party Defence Secretary Philip Hammond has told his junior ministers to lobby the shipbuilding unions and have them firm up Labour Party support.

The Liberal Democrats are openly against the project, but the Labour Party doesn’t want to head into the next election on a pledge to abandon Britain’s deterrent. Neither does the Conservative Party, despite reservations in some of its own quarters. Labour’s Miliband voiced his public displeasure over the perceived interference in his party’s affairs, but he has no way to block discussions with the shipbuilding unions. Sources: The Guardian, “Lobby ship unions over Trident, Philip Hammond tells ministers”.

Jan 31/14: RUSI Report. RUSI releases a report that looks at how a smaller or less active SSBN force would affect Britain’s deterrent, compared to the current arrangement of Continuous At-Sea Deterrence (CASD) that ensures at least 1 submarine ready at all times. A number of proposals are in play politically: “At lower readiness, the ‘preserved deterrence’ posture presented in the TAR and the ‘contingency’ posture proposed elsewhere by the Liberal Democrat Party would have no nuclear platforms deployed on a day-to-day basis, and would only have the ability to reconstitute a force over a limited period of time (in the case of ‘preserved deterrence’, a matter of years).19 At medium levels of readiness, the ‘sustained’ or ‘responsive’ postures presented in the TAR would have nuclear-armed submarines patrolling on a day-to-day basis, interrupted by voluntary periods of inactivity of varying length (the former permitting fewer and shorter interruptions than the latter). At higher levels of readiness, the ‘focused’ posture would maintain back-to-back patrols, interrupted only for periods of technical or personnel recuperation.” RUSI’s conclusion is that the lowest-readiness option, and proposals that would cut the submarine force to just 2 boats, are problematic because of the breadth of gaps and/or lag time they create. Medium levels of readiness, or a fleet of 3 boats, might work, but it means the UK has to change from deterrence as an undefined concept and invisible non-factor in crisis escalation. Instead, the need to activate the deterrent would require a very clear doctrine of deterrence and escalation that would play a significant role in future crises. This state of affairs also adds opportunities for British politicians to bungle things beforehand by ignoring vital signals, or create big problems during a crisis by managing their suddenly-public moves badly. Based on the historical record, RUSI is more complacent about future governments’ handling of such things than they ought to be. Britain will also have to worry about rushed moves causing a submarine-related accident, and about the morale and readiness rot that afflicts personnel who see themselves as a sideline. RUSI uses the USA’s ICBM missile force as a negative example. Sources: RUSI, “A Disturbance in the Force: Debating Continuous At-Sea Deterrence” (see Additional Readings). Key report

Dec 16/13: Procurement begins. GBP 79 million is a drop in the ocean for this program, but the UK MoD has begun the process of ordering known early-build items items like structural fittings, electrical equipment, castings and forgings, etc. The GBP 79 million in contracts are actually a set of 2, both awarded to BAE Systems Maritime – Submarines.

The Ministry of Defence also releases the 1st conceptual graphics of the Successor Class design, based on work done to date. At this stage, they don’t show much and shouldn’t be expected to. Sources: UK MoD, “News story: New investment in Successor submarines” | Royal Navy, “£79m investment in next generation nuclear submarines” | BAE, “First Successor procurement contracts awarded”.

Dec 15/13: Doubts. Former defense minister James Arbuthnot [Cons. – North East Hampshire], who chairs Parliament’s Defence Select Committee, tells the Guardian that he’s concerned about the UK armed forces, and is less sure that maintaining Britain’s nuclear deterrent is a good idea. He isn’t suddenly becoming a pacifist. Rather:

“Nuclear deterrence is essentially aimed at states, because it doesn’t work against terrorists. And you can only aim a nuclear weapon at a rational regime, and at rational states that are not already deterred by the US nuclear deterrent. So there is actually only a small set of targets. “With the defence budget shrinking, you have to wonder whether [replacing Trident] is an appropriate use of very scarce defence sources. You have to wonder whether nuclear deterrence is still as effective a concept as it used to be in the cold war…. [If Russia wanted to attack, they] would organise for a terrorist group to put a nuclear weapon on a container ship and sail it into Tilbury docks, with the signature of Pakistan on the nuclear device. And what would the UK do? Launch a missile at Islamabad? We could not be sure against what we are retaliating. Nuclear deterrence does not provide the certainty that it seemed to in the past. It’s not an insurance policy, it is a potential booby trap.”

On the other hand, can Britain assume that the US nuclear deterrent will remain reliable over the next 50 years? The last half decade has greatly frayed their relationship, and the USA faces significant financial challenges of its own. Arbuthnot says he would still vote in favor of renewing Trident, but the extent and content of his reservations suggest that a “Syria moment” over nuclear weapons remains a possibility in Parliament. Sources: The Guardian, “Tory ex-defence minister voices doubts over need for Trident replacement”.

Oct 6/13: Not good. The Independent newspaper reports that a 90-minute breakdown of all reactor coolant supply at Devonport dockyard’s Tidal X-Berths in Plymouth, UK nearly led to a major nuclear incident. Based on a heavily redacted report from the Ministry of Defence’s Site Event Report Committee (SERC), both the electrical power for coolant supply to docked nuclear submarines, and the diesel back-up generators, failed at the dockyard on July 29/12. That failure followed a similar failure involving HMS Talent in 2009, and a partial failure involving HMS Trafalgar in 2011. The newspaper adds that an internal Babcock investigation blamed the incident on the central nuclear switchboard, but added a note of concern about “inability to learn from previous incidents and to implement the recommendations from previous event reports.” This will not help existing uneasiness over the next generation of nuclear submarines, and “Nuclear scare at Navy submarine base after ‘unbelievable’ failures” adds that: “Its own “stress test” on Devonport safety, launched after the Fukushima disaster, said that in the event of the failure of both power supplies, heat levels in reactors could be controlled by emergency portable water pumps, and added that such a failure had occurred a “number of times” previously.” Dockyard failure

Oct 3/13: SSE. Babcock announces an unspecified contract from BAE Systems for the System Design phase of a new model of Submerged Signal Ejector (SSE Mk.12). It follows Babcock’s October 2012 system definition contract for the Successor Class’ WHLS (tactical weapons handling and launch) and SSE, thanks to a recent and successful concept review.

An SSE’s self-contained launch tubes sit in the submarine’s external under-casing, and are used for more than just communications beacons. Decoy devices, bathythermograph sensors, flares, and escape signals are all options for the SSE, hence Babcock’s description of it as a “first level system.” Babcock has extensive experience in SSE design and has been heavily involved in designing and making all UK SSE systems. Sources: Babcock International release, Oct 3/13.

March 19/13: Politics. With an SNP-sponsored debate on Trident set to take place in the Scottish Parliament this week, a Labour Party that depends on its advantage in Scotland needs to be clear on its policy. British media are reporting that the Labour Party is looking to backtrack slightly, and propose replacing the 4 Vanguard Class submarines with just 3 successors. Labour Shadow Defence Secretary Jim Murphy continues to support the idea of a Trident replacement, saying that:

“North Korea is trying to develop nuclear weapons, as is Iran. If they do, then Saudi Arabia and Turkey may do the same. The UK shouldn’t just give up our nuclear deterrent by ourselves…. The precise shape of the future deterrent will be based on capability and cost.”

See: UK BBC | Daily Record | The Guardian | The Telegraph | left-wing New Statesman magazine.

March 7/13: Scotland. With a 2014 referendum looming that could deprive the UK of its nuclear submarine base in Scotland, Britain’s House of Commons Scottish Affairs Committee weighs in. Bottom line? The SNP seems to have taken a leaf from their counterparts in Quebec, Canada, and decided to be extremely vague regarding their plans in a potentially controversial area. After all, 6,700 work at Falsane and Coulport now, which is expected to rise to 8,100 after they house all of Britain’s Astute and Trafalgar Class boats and other facilities. Parliament will be pressing the issue hard and publicly:

“Unfortunately, the Scottish Government has gone on evasive manoeuvres over the issue of what they will really do in the event of Separation. Their response dodges the central question, which is what they really mean by their stated policy of the ‘speediest safe transition’ of Trident from Scotland. As we said in our report, in reality, Trident can be deactivated within a matter of days and the warheads removed from Scotland within twenty four months. In the process, the UK would lose the ability to operate its nuclear deterrent. Alternatively, it would take approximately 25 years for new facilities to be created elsewhere in the UK. We believe the Scottish Government must be honest and open about their intentions. Tomorrow we will be taking evidence from the Convener and Shop Stewards at the Coulport and Faslane. They represent the workers who will bear the brunt of job loss…”

Really? 25 years? If so, the whole issue of the Successor Class could become moot very quickly. Which would be fine with the SNP, who want to eliminate the Trident program if Scotland does vote to stay in the UK. Expect to hear more of this sort of to-and-fro, what with another 5,000 jobs on the line in shipbuilding, 15,000 in the UK government 4 Army infantry battalions, 2 Royal Marine Commando units and 5 squadrons of Tornado and Typhoon fighter aircraft in Scotland. UK HoC | SNP | Aviation Week | The Scotsman.

Feb 13/13: Reactors. The UK MoD signs a 10-year, GBP 800 million (then about $1.2 billion) contract with Rolls Royce, financing the Submarines Enterprise Performance Programme (SEPP) envisioned in the 2010 SDSR. The goal is to consolidate costs under one contract with consistent incentives, and improve operational efficiency in the infrastructure that delivers and supports the UK’s naval nuclear propulsion systems. They’re hoping for a GBP 200 million saving over this 10 years. Time will tell.

SEPP isn’t technically part of any one program. Contracts for products and services to deliver and support the submarine programs themselves will continue in parallel. Royal Navy | Rolls Royce.

Jan 25/13: Electrical. HMS Vengeance’s GBP 350 million Long Overhaul Period and Refuel (LOP(R)) will feature a switch that’s likely to be a precursor for Britain’s next-generation SSBNs. Vengeance is replacing the maintenance-heavy rotating machinery of motor generators (MGs) with fixed solid-state Main Static Converters (MSCs), as a key component of the boat’s electrical system.

The new MSCs are derived from the system developed for Britain’s Astute Class SSNs, but adapted for the higher power requirements of an SSBN. They also had to be smaller, due to space limitations in the Vanguards. Finally, they had to successfully integrate into the Vanguard submarines’ existing electrical, control, and coolant systems. Installations have now begun, and a modified version is almost certain to to be part of Britain’s Successor Class. Its designers are likely to be watching the MSCs’ performance in the Vanguards closely. Babcock, via ASD.

Dec 18/12: The British Ministry of Defense submits its 2012 report to Parliament [PDF] on the future nuclear deterrent, noting the ramp up in public and private resources via an Integrated Programme Management Team (IPMT). A whole boat System Definition Review is scheduled to take place in 2013. With respect to the big items:

“Of the [GBP] 3Bn we plan to spend in the Assessment Phase, the expenditure to the end of Financial Year 2011/2012 has totalled [GBP] 315M. This is some [GBP] 30M lower than expected at the time of the Initial Gate approval, principally as a result of slower than expected manpower build-up in our Industrial partners… still expects to deliver the Assessment Phase within the approved cost of [GBP] 3Bn… Current forecast costs, including planned SEPP efficiency measures, indicate that we remain within the 2006 White Paper estimates of [GBP] 11-14Bn (at 2006/7 prices) for the Successor platform costs (assuming a four boat fleet). The 2006 White Paper also recognised that investment of [GBP] 4-6Bn (at 2006/7 prices) would be required for supporting infrastructure and a replacement warhead ([GBP] 2-3 Bn for each element). As set out in the 2011 report, the MOD plans to spend some [GBP] 8M between 2011 and 2013 assessing the requirement for additional infrastructure investment. The 2011 report also noted that a decision on whether to refurbish or replace the existing warhead design could be deferred until the next Parliament, as the current warhead design is now planned to continue in service until the 2030s.”

Oct 29/12: Design contracts. The UK commits GBP 350 million to design their next-generation SSBN submarine, which will incorporate CMC. The work will be divided GPB 315 million to BAE Systems, who already has over 1,000 people working on this program, and a further GBP 38 million to Babcock. This award is part of the GBP 3 billion design phase (vid. May 18/11 entry).

The current Vanguard Class submarines are scheduled for replacement from 2028, and Britain is busy moving its entire submarine force to Falsane in Scotland, which will grow to 8,000 jobs by 2017.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who leads Britain’s Liberal Democrat party, angrily denounced the way the move was presented by the government. The government presented it as another step toward renewing the submarine deterrent, but Clegg sees that as ‘jumping the gun.’ His party has set up a review that’s looking at options like shorter-range cruise missiles launched from the torpedo tubes of existing Astute Class fast attack submarines, or to air-launched nuclear missiles.

June 18/12: Reactors. Britain’s Ministry of Defense signs a GBP 1.1 billion contract with Rolls Royce for submarine nuclear reactor cores, (GBP 600 million) and industrial investment in the Raynesway plant that manufactures them (GBP 500 million). The contracts will secure 300 jobs at Rolls-Royce.

The nuclear reactor cores will be used to power the 7th and final SSN Astute Class fast attack submarine, and the 1st of the Royal Navy’s next generation of SSBN nuclear deterrent submarines, currently known as the Successor Class.

Rolls Royce is the sole Technical Authority for the UK Nuclear Steam Raising Plant, whose reactors have powered British nuclear-powered submarines for the past 50 years. The GBP 500 million infrastructure contract aims extend the operating life of the Rayneway plant in Derby, UK, by more than 40 years. Rolls-Royce will continue to maintain and operate its existing reactor core manufacturing facility, while undertaking a parallel phased rebuild and modernization of buildings on site. UK MoD | Rolls Royce | The Telegraph.

May 22/12: Design contracts. The UK MoD issues a series of design phase (vid. May 18/11 entry) contracts for its next-generation “Successor” Class SSBNs, while re-iterating that a decision on the final design and build contracts won’t be made until 2016. The design work has to be done, or it would be impossible to make an informed decision about costs.

BAE Systems Maritime – Submarines receives the main design contract, worth GBP 328 million.

Babcock receives a GBP 15 million contract to focus on designing parts of the in-service support program.

Rolls Royce receives over GBP 4 million to integrate a new reactor design into the submarine. The reactors themselves will be separate design/ build contracts.

May 15/12: 5 bn for AWE. The UK MoD announces a multi-billion pound agreement with the AWE Management Limited (AWEML) joint venture, which manages Britain’s Atomic Weapons Establishment. The AWEML joint venture includes Jacobs Engineering, Serco and Lockheed Martin, and they signed the current 25-year management contract in 2000.

Scientists at the AWE’s Berkshire sites are involved from the initial concept and design of British nuclear warheads, through manufacture and support, to their decommissioning and disposal. Under the agreement, the ministry will invest GBP 1 billion a year over the next 5 years in skills and facilities at the company’s Aldermaston and Burghfield sites in Berkshire, where more than 4,500 staff are based. Around 40% cent of this money will be invested in essential capital projects, including production and research facilities. The remainder will be spent on operating and maintaining the AWE.

(click to view full) May 19/11: Initial Gate. The British government approves the initial Successor Class assessment phase, known as Initial Gate. This allows a design phase to begin that could be worth up to GBP 3 billion. The new submarine class will retain the current Trident II D5 missiles, and introduce a PWR3-based passive cooling nuclear reactor design for the Royal Navy. The cost for 4 boats is estimated to be GBP 15-20 billion at 2006/7 prices, but the final decision to build 3 or 4 submarines will be taken in 2016. UK House of Commons, “Statement on the Nuclear Deterrent.” | UK MoD. Design Phase approved

March 23/11: New reactor? Britain is reportedly shifting toward the passive-cooling PWR3 nuclear reactor design for its future SSBN nuclear missile submarines. The PWR2 design used in its SSBN Vanguard Class, as well as the SSN Trafalgar, and new SSN Astute Class fast attack boats, reportedly shares unwelcome features with the Fukushima reactors, in that they entirely on back-up power supplies to provide emergency cooling in the event of an accident.

In contrast the PWR3, which is widely used in modern US nuclear submarines, uses “passive” cooling. That makes it less reliant on back-up power, and offers additional methods of injecting coolant into a reactor.

Oct 18/10: SDSR Britain’s new government releases its 2010 Strategic Defense and Strategy Review [PDF]. With respect to its future SSBNs, the government intends to move forward, but: “Under the 1958 UK-US Agreement for Cooperation on the Uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defence Purposes (the ‘Mutual Defence Agreement’) we have agreed on the future of the Trident D5 delivery system and determined that a replacement warhead is not required until at least the late 2030s. Decisions on replacing the warhead will not therefore be required in this Parliament. This will defer £500 million of spending from the next 10 years. We have also reached agreement with the US over the size of the missile tubes in the new submarines; this has enabled us to reduce the cost of the submarine missile compartment by up to [GBP] 250 million. As a result of our value for money review, we will reduce the number of operational launch tubes on the submarines from 12 to [8], and the number of warheads from 48 to 40, in line with our commitment vigorously to pursue multilateral global disarmament. This will help reduce costs by [GBP] 750 million over the period of the spending review, and by [GBP] 3.2 billion over the next ten years. ‘Initial Gate’ – a decision to move ahead with early stages of the work involved – will be approved and the next phase of the project will start by the end of this year. ‘Main Gate’ – the decision to start building the submarines – is required around 2016.” There is tension in the governing coalition between Conservative party members, who want to maintain the deterrent, and the Liberal-Democrat party members, who do not.

March 19/09: Report. Edward Leigh MP, Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, makes a statement as the committee publishes “The United Kingdom’s future nuclear deterrent capability” :

“The Department’s timetable for completing the design and build process for the replacement submarines is extremely tight. It has 17 years to do it, even though the Department itself accepts that such a process usually cannot be completed in under 18. The MOD’s track record in delivering major defence projects on time is not exemplary. The MOD must make absolutely fundamental decisions about the design of the new submarines by September of this year. These include the main design features; whether to develop a new type of nuclear reactor requiring substantial research and development; and, crucially, the design and size of the missile compartment.”

Oct 26/07: Concepts. BAE presents 2 SSBN concept designs at DSEi 2007, labelled Concept 35 and Advanced Hull Form (AHF). Concept 35 is an evolution of the SSBN Vanguard Class and SSN Astute Class. The Advanced Hull Form uses a broad y-shaped stern with twin propulsor shrouds, which reportedly houses much of the boat’s machinery outside of the pressure hull. See Beedall for pictures.

Oct 18/07: IPT opened. BAE Systems announces that Rear Admiral Paul Thomas CB, FREng chairman of the defence nuclear safety committee, has officially opened the Future Submarines (FSM) Integrated Project Team office at Barrow-in-Furness.

“This element of the Future Submarines IPT will be based on the BAE Systems Submarine Solutions site and will be manned by a collaboration of up to 128 personnel made up from the Ministry of Defence, BAE Systems, Rolls Royce and Babcock Marine. Working with the FSM IPT office in the MoD’s Abbey Wood offices, the team will, over the next two years, develop a concept design for the submarine component of the future deterrent programme.”

March 4/07: Vote. Britain’s Labour government wins a 409 – 161 vote to build a new SSBN successor the Vanguard Class. 95 Labour Party MPs vote “no,” but the motion passes with the support of most Labour Party MPs and Britain’s Conservative Party. Britain’s Liberal Democratic Party, Green Party, and Scottish National Party are all opposed as matters of party policy. BBC | The Guardian | The Telegraph. Commons vote

Donald Trump’s New Cold War with Beijing has caught Chinese foreign students at American universities in its crosshairs. His administration has tightened restrictions on their visas, accused them of spying for the Chinese state and its high tech giants, and in the process whipped up a climate of Anti-Asian racism.

Trump’s policies have yielded bitter fruit most recently at Duke University. The chair of the graduate program in biostatics, Megan Neely, in the wake of complaints from a couple of faculty members about Chinese grad students “speaking Chinese (in their words VERY LOUDLY)” in the student lounge and study areas, wrote an email scolding them for speaking their native language.

She told students to “commit to using English 100 percent of the time” while in department buildings or “any other professional setting.” Even worse she warned them that if they didn’t it might impact their ability to get internships and jobs. She told them “PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE keep these unintended consequences in mind when you choose to speak Chinese”.

This was not the first time that Neely had criticized students for speaking a language besides English in their private time. Last year she sent a message to all the biostatistics students saying, “I don’t like being the language police [but] … speaking in your native language in the department may give faculty the impression that you are not trying to improve your English skills and that you are not taking this opportunity seriously.”

She also warned of “potential downstream effects” that might compromise their professional advancement in the biostatics program and their employability.

These were no idle threats. The two professors whose complaints prompted her most recent email asked for and received photographs of the Chinese students from Neely with the expressed intent of discriminating against them.

Chinese students were shocked by this blatant racism. One PhD student in Chemistry, Chi Liu,said, “All of us are angry. We feel offended. You have this email to the Chinese students saying … if you speak Chinese you will be remembered and identified, and that will affect your performance. That is very serious”.

Duke’s Asian American Student Organization and International Association issued a joint statement that pointed out, “For international students, speaking in their mother tongue is a means of comfort and familiarity with a home and culture that is oftentimes suppressed within the United States. … Within the bounds of one’s personal conversations, people should wholeheartedly be able to speak any language they wish — to strip away this agency is demeaning, disrespectful, and wholly discriminatory”.

Neely’s shocking email provoked a wave of criticism at the university. A group of “concerned students” created a petition, which demanded the school investigate Neely and the two professors collected over 2,000 signatures from the campus community.

The uproar even spread to China. On the country’s equivalent of Twitter, Weibo, the hashtag “Duke University Bans Speaking Chinese” was viewed over 6.7 million times.

Caught in a spiraling scandal, Duke demoted Neely from her chair position and issued an apology. The dean of the medical school, Dr. Mary Klotman wrote, “To be clear: there is absolutely no restriction or limitation on the language you use to converse and communicate with each other. Your career opportunities and recommendations will not in any way be influenced by the language you use outside the classroom. And your privacy will always be protected”.

Duke may have resolved this crisis for now, but Trump’s New Cold War will only provoke more attacks on Chinese students. He has raised tariffs on China’s exports to the US, targeted its companies with sanctions, and has begun a military buildup to confront Beijing.

He is extending his economic nationalist program against China into the higher education system. Universities and colleges are what Hal Draper called knowledge factories that reproduce the ideas of the dominant class, generate scientific innovations for corporations, and also train different classes for their roles in ruling, managing, and working in American capitalism.

Universities and colleges are directly integrated into the American state through funding as well ties to the military industrial complex. As a result, the higher education system is tied to the interests of American capitalist class and its imperial domination of the world.

During the period of neoliberal globalization, however, the US higher education has undergone a transformation both in function and student composition. First, it became increasingly internationalized, creating connections with higher education systems of other countries.

Second, the increasing privatization of public universities has opened them to a growing number of foreign students, especially ones from China. States across the country have cut funding, universities have dramatically raised tuition, and students have gone into massive debt—now over $1.3 trillion—to afford a degree.

In the wake of the Great Recession, both public and private universities have suffered declining enrollment as American students balk at the enormous debt entailed in getting a degree. Higher education bosses have made up for that drop by luring foreign students who pay full tuition, room and board to attend their undergraduate and graduate programs.

This isn’t simply lucrative for some universities, it’s essential at a time when many, including prestigious institutions like Hampshire College, are struggling to keep their doors open.

As a result, the total foreign students in universities has doubled in the last two decades to over 1 million today. Chinese students have grown the fastest increasing by five fold since 2000 to over 360,000, about 35% of the total.

The overall value of this trade in students is estimated at $42.4 billion for the American economy, a sum greater than the $21.6 billion exports in soybeans and rivalling exports of $51 billion in pharmaceuticals and $53 billion in automobiles.

Duke is an example of the overall pattern. In their master’s program in biostatics heretofore overseen by Neely, Chinese students account for 36 out of a total of 55, and, in the whole graduate program, 1,300 out of 8,500.

Unsurprisingly, the Chinese ruling class and state have used this opening to advance their interests. The Chinese elite are now sending students to undergraduate and graduate programs.

These students overwhelmingly enter undergraduate and graduate programs in sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics (the so-called STEM disciplines) as well business administration.

After graduation, some stay and staff key sectors of American big business particularly in high tech while others return to China to bolster the competitiveness of the country’s corporations.

The Chinese state has encouraged their high tech national champions like Huawei to establish contracts with American research institutions to bolster their standing as world leaders in research and development.

At the same time, the Beijing is worried that their students might be influenced by liberal and radical ideas that might encourage them to challenge the Communist Party’s autocratic rule back home.

Therefore, Beijing has established about 150 chapters of the Chinese Students and Scholar Associations on campuses throughout the US. These both organize social activities for students as well as keep tabs on them.

China has established Confucian Institutes on over 100 campuses to promote Chinese language and culture, provide services for Chinese nationals teaching in the US, and facilitate cultural exchanges. They also use the institutes to influence American the universities, registering protest against speakers the state considers anti-Chinese like the exiled religious leader of Tibet, the Dalai Lama.

The Communist Party also attempts to influence American academics portrayals of China by threatening to deny them visas to visit and conduct research in the country. For example, Andrew Nathan and Perry Link, editors of The Tiananmen Papers about the Communist Party’s massacre student and workers to quell the uprising in 1989, have been denied visas ever since the publication of their book.

In response, Trump has initiated a campaign against the Chinese state and its corporations influence over universities as well as against Chinese foreign students, their rights and their organizations. Trump aims to discipline the nation’s higher education system to serve “America First.”

Trump’s lapdog Mike Pence’s announced this offensive against “the enemy within” American universities in his speech at the Hudson Institute (https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-administrations-policy-toward-china/). He warned, “The Chinese Communist Party is rewarding or coercing American businesses, movie studios, universities, think tanks, scholars, journalists, and local, state, and federal officials.”

He charged China with creating a “culture of censorship” in universities. He complained that “Beijing provides generous funding to universities, think tanks, and scholars, with the understanding that they will avoid ideas that the Communist Party finds dangerous or offensive. China experts in particular know that their visas will be delayed or denied if their research contradicts Beijing’s talking points.”

Then in formulations worthy of the poster “Is Your Washroom’s Breeding Bolsheviks?” he denounced “the Chinese Students and Scholars Association” for alerting “Chinese consulates and embassies when Chinese students, and American schools, stray from the Communist Party line.”

Of course, all of this reeks of hypocrisy. Trump and the right are enemies of academic freedom and scientific thought. They are conducting McCarthyite attacks against progressive academics as advocates of “cultural Marxism,” policing students and academics who are advocates of Palestinian liberation, waging war on the humanities, and are aiming to reduce the function of every level of education to the narrow interests of the American state and corporations in dominating the world system.

Double talk aside, Trump has already begun implementing his plan. He has issued an order instructing public universities to terminate all contracts with Huawei or federal funding would be cut.

And the schools have all obeyed. For example, the University of California at Berkeley has banned any further research projects with Huawei, which has donated $7.8 million to the school over the last two years.

Trump has extended the attack on corporation to Chinese students. The US intelligence agencies are warning universities that they are spying for Beijing and stealing intellectual property for its state corporations and national champions.

To put a stop to this supposed threat, he has denied and delayed issuing visas to Chinese students and threatened to reduce visas for those studying robotics, aviation, and high tech.

Trump’s racist advisor, Stephen Miller, almost convinced the administration to impose a total ban on Chinese nationals studying in the US.

Far from standing up against Trump’s China bashing and protectionism, the Democratic Party including its progressive and even socialist wing has joined his chorus. Elizabeth Warren, for example, has denounced against the neoliberal establishment for promising that open markets would bring about democracy in China.

She states, “Policymakers promised that open markets would lead to open societies. Instead, efforts to bring capitalism to the global stage unwittingly helped create the conditions for competitors to rise up and lash out. Russia became belligerent and resurgent.China weaponized its economy without ever loosening its domestic political constraints.”

Similarly, Bernie Sanders, who has become a spokesperson for progressive internationalism, has in fact long advocated an economic nationalist program against China.

In 2011, for example, he denounced the Smithsonian Museum for selling busts of American presidents made in China. He complained “that a museum owned by the people of the United States, celebrating the history of the United States, cannot find companies in this country employing American workers that are able to manufacture statues of our founding fathers, or our current president”.

More recently he supported Trump’s tariff war with China, writing “I strongly support imposing stiff penalties on countries like China, Russia, South Korea and Vietnam to prevent them from illegally dumping steel and aluminum into the U.S. and throughout the world”.

Such nationalism can only breed anti-Chinese and more generally anti-Asian racism. Barbara Ehrenreich plumbed the depths of such bigotry recently when she tweeted “I will be convinced that America is not in decline only when our de-cluttering Marie Kondo learns to speak English”.

This xenophobia is only the latest expression of the toxic history of anti-Asian prejudices and laws that began with the Chinese exclusion act and continued through the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, the racist demonization of the Vietnamese during the US war on their country, and the recent bigoted caricatures of Koreans during Trump’s stand-off with Kim Jung-un.

Unsurprisingly, the American political class’s China bashing has triggered a sharp increase in anti-Asian hate crimes and discrimination. NPR reports that “hate crimes against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders are rising exponentially. A report from the Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations found that crimes targeting Asian-Americans tripled in that county between 2014 and 2015”.

And since the Trump administration’s rise to power, they increased ever more. There was a 20 percent increase in hate crimes against Asian-Pacific Americans in 2017.

Trumps Islamophobia, immigrant bashing, and hostility to foreign students and specifically Chinese students drove down international enrollment by 3.3 percent in 2016 and by 6.6 percent in 2017 .

Indian graduate school applications dropped by 12% in 2017.. While Chinese student enrollment is still increasing it has begun to slow from an increase of 8.1 percent in 2014-15 to 6.8 percent in 2015-16 and 3.1 in 2017-2018.

Those that remain have soured on the US. One study by Purdue University found that the percentage of foreign students holding negative views of the US jumped from 29 percent in 2016 to 42 percent in 2018.

One anonymous student told the South China Post, “More students, including myself, have even considered returning to China as a plan B if we can’t find a job in the US, and some of them are searching for jobs in China simultaneously”.

But, as the Post notes, “the job market for new graduates on the other side of the globe is not much better, as Trump’s trade war begins to cause sweeping lay-offs and hiring freezes in China’s tech industry.” These students are thus caught between two powers struggling for dominance in a crisis ridden system.

With Trump tearing at the internationalized structure of American higher education and trying to push out Chinese students, some universities and high tech businesses have begun to worry about a possible drop in the pool of Chinese students they can recruit from.

The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign went so far as take out a $60 million insurance policy to protect against any sudden drop in Chinese enrollment.

The conflict between the US and China is also spilling into other countries with educational systems with large Chinese student populations. For example, when Trump forced Canada to detain Huawei’s the chief financial officer, Meng Whanzhou, on charges that the company violated sanctions on Iran, China responded by threatening to withdraw all its 77,000 students, if Ottawa sent Meng to the US to stand trial.

Chinese students account for a large share of the 40 percent increase in foreign students since 2013. These pay an average of $27, 159 a year in tuition—4 times what Canadian residents pay—and spend over $15 billion a year in Canada. Thus, they are an important part not just of the country’s big business in higher education but also the broader economy.

Moody’s Investors Services went so far as to warn “that the intensification of political tensions between the Government of Canada and the government of China poses credit risks for Canadian universities”.

Back in the US, university presidents became so concerned that 65 of them penned a letter supporting a legal challenge to Trump’s threat to ban international students for overstaying their visas.

Some high tech bosses have similarly protested about the loss of access to foreign students in American universities. They point to the fact that about a quarter of new companies worth a billion dollars were started by moguls who first came to the US as students.

Thomas Harnisch from the American Association of State Colleges and Universities notes that “international graduate students are pivotal to our economic system, these students go on, many of them earn master’s degrees and PhDs in many highly-needed fields. They’re incredibly important not only to our universities, but our economy as well” .

But the logic of the spiraling inter-imperial rivalry between the US and China will likely continue to pry apart the inter-penetration of their educational systems. The US is already trying to retool its own education system to yield more American talent in the STEM fields and China may redirect its students to its own rapidly improving higher education institutions and those of countries less hostile to it.

Amidst this intensifying conflict, socialists must take a clear stand against the political class’s China bashing no matter whether it comes from right wing Republicans like Trump or progressives like Warren and Sanders; it is rank American nationalism that binds workers to their exploiters against their fellow workers in China.

Instead we must unite just like the Duke students did against the racist attacks on Chinese students, defend their right to speak their language of choice, agitate against any restrictions on their visas, and build a movement among both native and foreign students and workers for our common interests against the university bosses, their capitalist masters, and their state overseers.

Such organizing will also open up opportunities to build the international workers movement. Some of these students are part of the developing new left on universities in China that has suffered government repression for organizing solidarity with workers on strike. They should be considered part of our emerging new socialist movement.

We should build this common struggle without in any way supporting the Chinese state, which is a rising imperialist power in the world system that oversees the exploitation of its own population, the oppression of subject nations like Tibet and national minorities like the Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang, and increasingly exploits third world countries in pursuit of raw materials and outlets for its surplus capital.

The slogan for our solidarity movement must therefore be “Neither Washington, Nor Beijing, But International Socialism.”

But a local politics professor says it's just the latest in a ""clash of ideologies"" between the provincial and federal governments.

Adam Vaughan, MP for Spadina-Fort York and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development, made the comments Sunday after calling into CBC Radio's Cross-Country Checkup.

When asked by host Duncan McCue what he would say to Canadians who are struggling to keep a roof over their heads, Vaughan said provinces need to work with the federal government.

He then singled out Manitoba for not yet agreeing to take the cash.

""We have a Manitoba government that is refusing to take federal dollars to house people, think about that,"" he said during the unplanned call to the national call-in radio program.

""You've got a provincial government that no matter how much money you put on the table, they want to teach us how to balance the budget instead of house people.""

Adam Vaughan, MP for Spadina-Fort York, made the comments during a call into CBC Radio’s Cross-Country Checkup. (CBC)

The federal government announced plans for the housing strategy in November 2017.

Len Catling with the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation said B.C., the Northwest Territories, Ontario, P.E.I. and New Brunswick have all signed agreements with the federal government. A CMHC spokesperson said another will be announced in the near future while others are expected to sign by April 1.

Catling wouldn't weigh in on whether Manitoba is refusing federal funds, though he noted the province continues to receive funding from Ottawa for other programs under the national housing strategy.

The 10-year strategy promises everything from tackling homelessness and the shortage of new housing units to enshrining the right to adequate housing as a fundamental human right in Canadian law.

The government is also preparing a separate Indigenous housing strategy tailored to the needs of the many Indigenous communities with inadequate housing where market-based solutions are often unfeasible.

Negotiations ongoing, says province

During his call Vaughan told McCue about $5.7 billion has been spent through the strategy so far, building around 15,000 new units, repairing roughly 150,000 units and delivering subsidies to more than 800,000 homes.

But none of that work is happening in Manitoba, where a spokesperson for Manitoba's Minister of Families confirmed late Sunday the provincial government is still negotiating a bilateral agreement with the federal government.

The spokesperson added that ""most provinces [and] territories continue to negotiate their bilateral agreements"" and said that process is ongoing between Manitoba and the federal government.

""Manitoba's expected allocation is an estimated $300 million over nine years, and further details are being finalized through our bilateral engagement,"" a spokesperson wrote in an email.

'Clash of ideologies'

Paul Thomas, professor emeritus of political studies at the University of Manitoba, said this is the latest salvo between two governments known for butting heads on health funding and other philosophical differences.

The Pallister government has implemented an austerity program and committed to balancing budgets and reducing the size of government, whereas the federal government is ""spending their way to prosperity,"" said Thomas.

""There's a clash of ideologies here, and then when you go against Premier Pallister you better know that you're in for a fight. He's a quite combative, competitive person,"" said Thomas.

""He won't take kindly to a Toronto-based MP from the Liberal Party telling him how he should spend Manitoba's money.""

About $15 billion of the $40 billion plan is dependant on provincial cost sharing, according to a report from the Social Planning Council Right to Housing Coalition released in March, which urged Manitoba to contribute its share.

The report suggested Manitoba would need to reverse cuts to its housing capital program.

'Crucial ingredient'

Thomas said there are a variety of demands on the public purse, particularly with respect to social services, health and education, but housing is a ""crucial ingredient"" to helping people lead more productive lives.

""You don't want to turn money down if it's on offer, especially if you don't accept the money for whatever reason: if you're hung up ideologically or constitutionally because you don't want Ottawa interfering in your provincial affairs,"" he said

""At some point I think you swallow your pride and you take the money and you say, ""Well, we're not happy about it,' and that's what they eventually did on the mental health.""

Jino Distasio, director of the Institute of Urban Studies, said he understands relations are ""frayed"" between the Trudeau and Pallister governments but that doesn't change the pressing need for housing.

""Manitobans are falling behind in affordable housing and we still have a crisis with respect to housing individuals who are homeless,"" he said.

""It is a bit frustrating because you would hope that we would have a bit more collaboration between the two levels of government to get these types of projects funded and supported.""

The list of promises includes:

Construction of 100,000 new affordable housing units.

Repairs on 300,000 affordable housing units.

Cutting chronic homelessness by 50 per cent.

Protecting 385,000 households from losing an affordable home.

Removing 530,000 households from housing need.

The strategy would also introduce a housing benefit for families that won't kick in until after the next federal election. The Canada Housing Benefit will help 300,000 families by providing an average rent subsidy of $2,500 annually, beginning in April 2020 and ending in 2028, the government has said.

'Have to take advantage'

Distasio said while the two governments hash out their differences, there are a number of community non-profit housing organizations caught in the middle, waiting on needed funds.

""Any time we have an opportunity to leverage significant federal interventions in housing — and over the last two decades they've been far and few between — we've got to take advantage,"" he said.

""We need a provincial housing strategy that takes advantage of what's available and also does so in a manner that makes sure that every Manitoban has access to quality affordable housing.""

Vaughan says the ongoing negotiations are leaving a pot of money for supportive housing initiatives untouched in the Keystone province.

""Yes the federal government has to be a leader in housing … but we need provincial governments and territorial governments to participate,"" he said during the call, describing housing the most important issue facing the country.

Pieter Cleppe looks at some of the questions raised by Germany’s decision.,"Many in Germany want to have their cake and eat it by scrapping nuclear power and avoiding coal at the same time. Pieter Cleppe looks at some of the questions raised by Germany’s decision.

Pieter Cleppe is head of Brussels office at Open Europe, a euro-critical think-tank focused on Britain’s new relationship with the EU and the rest of the world after Brexit.

After a long debate, Germany’s so-called “Coal Commission”, which includes representatives from political, industry, and environmental groups, has recommended the country end its use of coal power by 2038. This still needs to be approved by four German states that will be affected, as well as by the federal government, though Chancellor Angela Merkel has already voiced support.

With questions still surrounding the whole endeavor, here’s an overview of the five most pressing debates.

What will it cost?

The Coal Commission suggests spending at least €40 billion to aid coal-mining states affected by the phase-out, and at least €2 billion per year to limit increases in consumer power bills – already the highest in Europe. 5,000 government jobs would be relocated to the affected regions, carrying costs in itself.

The Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHK) estimates the real cost at closer to €170 billion, taking into account the effect on energy prices, possible damages, and the cost of extra investment into alternative energy sources such as natural gas plants. It warns price increases must be avoided, as German companies already face the highest power bills in the European Union.

These come in addition to the costs of Germany’s overall energy transition plan, which aims to almost completely shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy at an estimated price of €1.1 trillion by 2050.

Much of the potential economic damage will depend on the second major issue: energy security.

Will the phase-out plan endanger energy security?

If it weren’t for Angela Merkel’s decision to phase out nuclear energy following Fukushima, the challenge would be much less tricky.

Coal and brown coal now provide more than 42% of Germany’s power, according to the International Energy Agency. That proportion has been growing since the nuclear decision. As a result, Germany has admitted it is on track to miss its 2020 CO2 emissions targets.

Many in Germany want to have their cake and eat it, scrapping nuclear power and avoiding coal at the same time. The Coal Commission wants coal capacity reduced from 42 gigawatts of generation capacity to 30 gigawatts by the end of 2022, and 17 gigawatts by the end of 2030. German industry fears energy blackouts in a country more dependent on coal than the UK or Canada, who have decided to phase it out.

Almost no other country has tried to simultaneously phase out both nuclear and coal simultaneously. Sweden, for example, reversed its decision to phase out nuclear power in 2009.

One study has claimed renewable energy sources overtook coal as Germany’s main power source for the first time in 2018, but that’s not the whole story. As Rolf Schmitz, head of leading energy firm RWE, maintains: “there are days when renewables are covering 70% or more of energy needs, but there are also days when that share is only 5%, when the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine”.

Another challenge, acknowledged by the Coal Commission itself, is that major investments in Germany’s energy transport and storage infrastructure are needed to cope with an exit from coal, to transport wind energy created offshore in the North Sea to the south of the country, and to improve storage capacity.

Precisely because of such doubts, Ralph Brinkhaus, the faction leader of Merkel’s CDU in the German Parliament, has warned the coal exit could be delayed beyond 2038 if the deadline creates problems for the electricity supply: “energy supply security must be guaranteed… if it is endangered, we should be free to do another round and address that, without abandoning the path we’ve chosen. There’s no reason to be dogmatic about this.”

Isn’t it all a bit hypocritical?

As journalist Brigitte Fehrle argued in a comment for German public radio: “it would be fatal for the credibility of the whole initiative when instead of receiving energy from German brown coal-powered plants, brown coal from Poland or the Czech Republic would need to be imported”. Merkel herself has already commented that “we want to be out of coal in 2038. Then we need more gas”.

However, gas is no panacea for avoiding carbon emissions. Christian Lindner of German liberal opposition party FDP, who has dismissed the Commission’s recommendations as “pure ideology”, predicted that “in 2030, this game will be repeated with the energy source gas”.

The Dutch government was criticised in a similar way for shutting down gas exploration, with opponents pointing out it may open the door to more gas imports from Russia. Abandoning coal may leave Germany more dependent on Russian gas, with Merkel already under fire for allowing “Nord Stream 2”.

How environmentally friendly are alternative energy sources?

Hazardous materials are necessary to produce solar panels, and wind turbines have their own environmental downsides. But surely those drawbacks are worth it, given how renewables will replace every other energy source?

That’s questionable. On a global level, the role of wind and solar energy is still modest at best. According to the International Energy Agency’s 2016 Key Renewables Trends, wind provided 0.46% of global energy consumption in 2014, and solar and tide combined provided 0.35%. This is total energy, not just electricity, which accounts for less than a fifth of all final energy.

Even if 14% of the world’s energy is considered “renewable”, three quarters of that is biomass. Professor John Beddington, a former UK government chief scientific adviser, argues wood-burning in order to help countries reach renewable energy targets shouldn’t be the way forward; otherwise, Europe may soon need to burn an amount of wood greater than its total harvest – not exactly in line with green gospel.

Isn’t coal energy technology improving?

While progress in renewables makes headlines, fossil fuels have also been improving, with the development of “clean coal” technologies.

The current debate’s hysterical approach ignores the fact that 60% of primary energy will still come from fossil fuels by 2040, down from just 81% today.

If one cares about reducing CO2 emissions, completely phasing out coal is not only expensive but also ignores the role of technological progress in improving an indispensable energy source.",Five questions surrounding Germany’s coal phase-out plan,Euractiv.com,http://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/opinion/five-questions-surrounding-germanys-coal-phase-out-plan/

Solidarity is the foundation of building political power. When an elected official steps in and lends their voice to an issue that we care about, our voices are amplified. Elected officials are theoretically there to speak up on our behalf, fight for what we believe in, and to take positions that are risky.

The problem is that we ascribe the same amount of value to every statement that an elected official makes, no matter how calculated and self-serving it is. More often than not, elected officials are bound by message discipline that keeps them from the kind of nuanced judgments required by social issues.

When they speak up on issues that matter to us or they speak out against an issue that plagues us, they’re rarely taking an uncalculated risk. It takes very little work of reading between the lines when that message discipline helps them build power. If they’re repeating a position instead of responding to the actual content of an issue, they’re hoping to sell us a vehicle without us ever taking a peek under the hood.

When any public figure, especially elected officials, is anti-Semitic, homophobic, or accused of human rights abuses, we want others to speak up. However, as 84% of Americans think money has too much influence in politics, nearly the same number are afflicted with magical thinking when they assume elected officials are speaking from the heart.

How Many Benjamins To Screw In a Light Bulb?

Within moments of Ilhan Omar posting some fairly banal tweets about the role of money in politics via lobbying groups like AIPAC, she’s faced an aggressive backlash. Omar’s background and ethnicity have been linked to her comments ad nauseam. Islamophobes have cravenly relished these comments, coming from a Muslim woman, and presumptively taken their meaning to be anti-Semitic.

The fact that there’s a loose argument to be made for this lends it validity and attracts our attention away from the content of her statement. She’s questioning the role of money leading the way of policy and opinion. In questioning AIPAC, she revealed that the group is so good at lobbying that it’s a sin to claim that they’re lobbyists.

Many officials who’ve benefited from their association with AIPAC, which requires members to donate to elected officials, have tried to shame Omar. These electeds are nowhere to be found when real anti-Semitism arises in their own backyards.

Let’s take Carolyn Maloney’s response as an example, from a congresswoman who has taken several opportunities to call for Democratic party unity. Congresswoman Maloney stated that Omar’s “personal and anti-Semitic attacks” were unwelcome and disturbing. Let’s remind ourselves of Omar’s actual comments.

In response to Omar criticizing Israel’s national policies, GOP leader Kevin McCarthy likened her political criticism to Steve King’s claim that white supremacy has been stigmatized. There were no clear statements that McCarthy claimed Omar said to be offensive, certainly none claiming that anti-Semitism deserved the right to oxygen. The only real policy that could be pointed to was Omar’s support for BDS, a political position of boycotting products and services linked to the nation, was somehow offensive.

When we boycott products from Chik-Fil-A, we aren’t demonizing the people who work for Chik-Fil-A. We’re disputing the political positions of the people at the top. It’s believable that American consumers are sophisticated enough to critique a country without turning their thoughts to hate speech. Hate for injustice isn’t an injustice, though it’s a common swerve for those accused of injustice.

Elected officials critical of Omar are the ones who chose to plunge our politics into a state of cognitive dissonance where there’s no difference between criticizing the national policies of Israel and criticizing all Jews. In fact, the response has led to wild flights of fancy which have unleashed some toxic Islamophobia. No state with a lobbying influence over our elected officials should go unchecked, whether we’re talking about Russia, Canada, or Israel.

If elected officials like Carolyn Maloney are so concerned with anti-Semitism, why don’t they ever show up when it matters? Recently, a Manhattan GOP club had their membership packed by the likes of Milo Yiannopoulos and Gavin McInnes, only to elect as president a consultant for Alternativ Für Deutschland, the rising neo-Nazi party in Germany. A few people protested, but right under Maloney’s nose, neo-fascists gained real political power, with the ability to put people on the ballot in New York State and to run against her for Congress.

This rallying against anti-Semitism is nothing more than posturing to benefit a powerful lobby which brags about its hold over elected officials. They only take it seriously when it’s a rhetorical gesture and an escape hatch to avoid tough conversations.

The ferocity of the attacks in response to Ilhan Omar amounts to empty power-brokering because not one elected official has joined her criticism of AIPAC’s power. How juvenile are we to be sold and to buy an argument that criticizing the role of a country’s politics in the world can only mean that we hate its citizens? Islamophobes love this argument but most of us don’t live and die by that perspective.

The Enemy of my Enemy

In New York, an elected official very directly criticized an entire identity group, talking of their power over politics. Bronx Councilmember Ruben Diaz Sr. wasn’t talking about a group like AIPAC or a specific lobby when he said that homosexuals control New York City Council. If people embroiled in the Ilhan Omar statements were seeking an example of what it actually looks like when someone blames an identity group for conspiring to control politics, they have one.

Following the statements the Taxi Commission chair made on the taxi driver-focused show “El Desahogo” in NYC, Ruben Diaz Sr. has since doubled down. Corey Johnson, openly-gay city council speaker and mayoral hopeful, has asked for him to step down. He even punished Diaz Sr., by dissolving the Taxi subcommittee Johnson created to reward Diaz for his vote to help him become city council speaker.

Corey Johnson even visited an ill Diaz Sr. in the hospital to lobby him for that vote in early 2018. He did so despite the fact that the 74-year old Diaz has played the role of a homophobic minister for decades. His hate is well-documented, yet because political power was at stake, now-Speaker Johnson took a calculated risk by giving power to a homophobe.

Since Diaz Sr.’s homophobia is so well documented, it came up several times during his 2017 Democratic City Council primary in the Bronx. There were several viable and experienced candidates who ran in the primary that the many now-upset city council members refused to take a stand for in 2017. They feared retribution from the then-state senator and his son, the Bronx Borough president, who defended his father then and is calling for his resignation now.

Fear of losing a job is a powerful motivator for too many legislators. If we ever talk ourselves into thinking our ethics matter, we need to pump the brakes and remind ourselves of moments like this one. Our elected officials march side by side while power-brokering with our sworn enemies when we’re not looking.

The Hawks Circle Like Vultures

In late 2018, National Security Advisor John Bolton gave a speech about an axis of evil in Latin America. He decried Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua as a “sordid cradle of communism” in the Americas. He said that President Trump would be taking direct action against them.

In the early weeks of 2019, a member of National Assembly in Venezuela named Juan Guaidó declared himself interim president of the country. The problem is that Guaidó is facing the fact that there’s still a seated and democratically elected president named Nicolás Maduro. In the event that the president is deposed, the president of the National Assembly, a position Guaidó assumed in early January 2019, becomes president.

U.S. elected officials and the Trump administration have found common ground in supporting Guaidó, despite the Maduro’s constitutionally-grounded insistence that he is still the president.

Nancy Pelosi, who defends the standards of democracy that we should uphold in the U.S.A. by supporting investigations of Russian interference in 2016, is now fighting democracy abroad. Disagreements with a democratically elected president are one thing, but sparking a coup and supporting regime change is another.

This position puts her on the side of her sworn enemy, under the advisement of John Bolton, and interrupts the democratic process for the Venezuelan people.

Bolton is a vehement interventionist who believes that the U.S. can and should violate treaties, accords, and international law when necessary. Bolton, who has vehement disdain for the UN, is now supported by the liberal darling with the golf clap, Nancy Pelosi.

Since we won’t see any of these figures in front of a court of law for violating any treaties or subverting democracy, the court of public opinion is what matters. With the right-wing hawks happy to have a liberal hero on their side and the do-no-wrong halo Pelosi is wearing now, she’ll rally bipartisan support for a crime against democracy.

Where does her sudden interest in Venezuela’s politics come from? Pelosi told an NYU student a few years ago that Democrats are capitalists, in case we’re curious where her interests lie. Whether it’s the red-baiting or the pressure from the energy industry to support a president who wants to privatize Venezuela’s oil reserves, time will tell. Either way, her solidarity smells suspiciously of power-brokering that’s conditional on her own interests.

When is Solidarity Sincere?

Unconditional support, like unconditional love, leaves us with some strange and unsavory bedfellows. In a perfect world, we could elect people who have been honest about their values and then go about our business for the next few years until the next election. We would have strict term limits so that we would be electing people not to a lifelong job but to a temporary role in public service, as it was imagined at our founding.

When someone is on our side, we need to continue to scrutinize their motives. Trumpism has brought a lot of us together under a large and unexpected umbrella, but there’s a reason we didn’t know each other before.

We weren’t always on the same side of many important issues. When we see someone saying what we want them to say, our applause is dangerous and especially loud in the echo chamber of politics.

It’s hard to know when solidarity is sincere. As we dive into the next presidential cycle, we need to remain steadfast in watching the actions of the people who want our support, not merely their ability to perform that support.",Golf Claps and Clapbacks Are Not Solidarity,Counterpunch.org,https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/02/27/golf-claps-and-clapbacks-are-not-solidarity/

Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee that she had confronted Trudeau over what she called inappropriate pressure to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc evade a corruption trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials.

Andrew Scheer, leader of the official opposition Conservative Party, demanded the resignation of what he called a disgraced prime minister.

He can no longer, with a clear conscience, continue to lead this nation,” Scheer told reporters, calling for police to immediately probe the matter. Trudeau is due to address reporters later on Wednesday.

Wilson-Raybould said officials imposed “consistent and sustained pressure” on her from September to December last year to ensure SNC-Lavalin pay a large fine rather than go to trial.

“In my view, these events constituted pressure to intervene in a matter and that this pressure, or political interference to intervene, was not appropriate,” she told the committee.

Wilson-Raybould, who named several senior officials in the offices of Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau, said under questioning from Liberal legislators that she did not feel the pressure on her had been illegal.

A Morneau spokesman denied the minister or his staff had ever pressured Wilson-Raybould when she was justice minister.

Trudeau and other officials deny inappropriate pressure was put on Wilson-Raybould. But the case forced the resignation of Trudeau’s principal private secretary, Gerald Butts, earlier this month.

Wilson-Raybould accused Trudeau and his aides of improperly pressuring her to seek a financial settlement with SNC-Lavalin, The Globe and Mail first reported in early February. The construction and engineering giant holds multiple contracts with the Canadian government and employees approximately 9,000 Canadians.

In her Wednesday testimony before the House of Commons' Justice Committee, Wilson-Raybould said the government pressured the Justice Department to settle with SNC-Lavalin after prosecutors charged the company in 2015 with bribing the Libyan government during the reign of dictator Muammar al-Ghadaffi.

If found guilty of the charges, the company could be banned from doing business with the Canadian government for a decade, potentially leaving the 3,400 Quebec residents employed by SNC-Lavalin out of a job. One of Quebec's pension funds is also one of the largest shareholders in SNC-Lavalin, owning a 20% stake in the company, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Wilson-Raybould and other officials said the possible economic implications of the indictment were fair considerations. François Legault, Quebec's current premier, recommended a financial settlement over concerns that the indictment would push the company to leave Canada altogether, according to the Journal.

But some Justice officials suggested that Trudeau also had political motivations to interfere with prosecutorial proceedings in order to save jobs in Quebec, a province that will be crucial for the Trudeau and his Liberal Party to carry in order to maintain control over the government in this October's federal elections.

Wilson-Raybould testified that she ""experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion"" over the course of several meetings and conversations with Trudeau himself and his advisors, including top aide Michael Wernick.

Both Trudeau and Wernick have forcefully denied putting political pressure to drop the charges on Wilson-Raybould, who resigned from her position in Trudeau's cabinet after she was moved to a lower-level role in the veterans affairs' department amid the fallout of the scandal.

""I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally, therefore I completely disagree with the characterization of these events,"" Trudeau said of Wilson-Raybould's testimony on Wednesday, according to the New York Times.

Wernick also disputed Wilson-Raybould's testimony that he also applied pressure on her to drop the charges, but said that he communicated to her that ""a lot of her colleagues and the prime minister were quite anxious about what they were hearing and reading in the business press about the future of the company.""

While Canada's ethics commissioner is investigating the matter to formally determine whether Trudeau improperly interfered in the probe, the scandal may already be hurting his electoral prospects.

A recent Ipsos poll found Trudeau's approval rating declining, and the Conservative party pulling ahead of the Liberals on the generic ballot.

Pollster Darrell Bricker told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that the scandal ""hits at what gives the Liberal Party its appeal: the prime minister,"" and could be devastating if Trudeau doesn't re-claim control over the narrative soon.",Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing his first major scandal since taking office,Business Insider,https://www.businessinsider.com/justin-trudeau-accused-of-pressing-officials-to-drop-bribery-fraud-probe-snc-lavalin-2019-2

Firm bribed Gadhafi government

The scandal has rocked the Trudeau administration as the Liberal party leader prepares to run for re-election in October. It centers around allegations that SNC-Lavalin bribed officials in the Libyan government under strongman Muammar Gadhafi between 2001 and 2011.

The company was formally charged with corruption in 2015, with prosecutors saying that it had paid Gadhafi's regime 130 million Canadian dollars (US$99 million) for lucrative government contracts, including the Great Man-Made River Project, the biggest irrigation project in history.

SNC-Lavalin heavily lobbied the government to settle the corruption case out of court. The firm has repeatedly claimed that anyone responsible for the wrongdoing has since left the company.

'Serious red flags'

Wilson-Raybould testified that ""the prime minister asked me to help out, to find a solution for SNC, citing that if there is no DPA (deferred prosecution agreement), there would be many jobs lost and that SNC would move from Montreal.""

Jody Wilson-Raybould she was ""barraged"" and faced ""hounding"" over the case

She said 11 other top officials, including Finance Minister Bill Morneau, raised concerns that the firm would move to London if it did not face favorable legal conditions in Canada.

They ""urged me to take partisan political considerations into account, which was clearly improper,"" she said, adding that while ""not illegal,"" it had ""raised serious red flags.""

Wilson-Raybould resigned in January, along with Trudeau's longtime ally and principal secretary Gerry Butts, who has been vague about his reasons for leaving the government.

Freeland closes ranks with Trudeau

Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer said that the prime minister should step down over the scandal, claiming Trudeau ""can no longer and in good standing with a clear conscience lead this nation."" He also called for a federal investigation into the possibility that government officials obstructed justice.

""The matter at hand appears, on its face, to be a gross violation of the law,"" Scheer wrote in a letter to federal police.

Trudeau disputed the nature of the discussions in a news conference, saying that ""our government will always focus on jobs"" and that his administration was merely debating the impact the case could have on the company's Montreal workforce.

In an unusual move, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland appeared at Canada's CBC broadcaster to pledge her full support to the 47-year-old prime minister.

""Of course I support the prime minister 100 percent,"" said the popular minister, whom some see as a possible successor of Trudeau.

""I am very clearly of the view that the prime minister would never apply improper pressure,"" she added.

Wilson-Raybould described what she considered an inappropriate attempt by political staffers, and even the most senior bureaucrat in the country, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, to pressure her to overrule the director of public prosecutions and negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with SNC-Lavalin so it could avoid a trial over allegations it used bribery to secure government contracts in Libya.

The former justice minister told the committee that she believes the sustained pressure was inappropriate and amounted to ""political interference"" but that it wasn't illegal.

Here are some key moments from the former attorney general's committee appearance:

1. 'Sustained pressure' and 'veiled threats'

After Kathleen Roussel, the director of public prosecutions, decided in September 2018 that she would not make a deal and would proceed with a trial against SNC Lavalin, Wilson-Raybould said she reached a similar decision on the matter — and made it clear to all in government that she would not intervene in the PPSC process.

The former minister said despite that position, she still fielded 10 phone calls and sat for 10 in-person meetings with members of the PMO, including Mathieu Bouchard, Trudeau's adviser on Quebec issues, and special adviser Elder Marques, among others.

Despite attempts to convince her to reconsider her stance given the possible economic consequences, Wilson-Raybould said she was undaunted in her position and that she should take no further action.

She also said she faced pressure from Ben Chin, Finance Minister Bill Morneau's chief of staff, and Gerry Butts, the prime minister's former principal secretary, to consider the consequences. Butts resigned last week while saying he acted ethically.

Wilson-Raybould said she was reminded by these staffers of the political consequences for both the provincial and federal Liberal parties if SNC-Lavalin folded or laid off workers.

""I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the attorney general of Canada,"" she said.

""Within these conversations, there were express statements regarding the necessity for interference in the SNC-Lavalin matter, the potential for consequences, and veiled threats if a DPA was not made available to SNC,"" she said.

2. 'I am an MP in Quebec'

When Wilson-Raybould raised her discomfort with the pressure she said she faced with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a September meeting, she said Trudeau told her he, too, was worried about SNC-Lavalin layoffs and the company's continued viability if it were convicted of the criminal charges.

A conviction could bar the firm from bidding on federal contracts for up to 10 years, a key source of revenue for the company.

""At that point the PM jumped in stressing that there is an election in Quebec and that 'I am an MP in Quebec — the member for Papineau.'""

""I was quite taken aback,"" Wilson-Raybould said.

""My response — and I remember this vividly — was to ask the PM a direct question while looking him in the eye — I asked: 'Are you politically interfering with my role, my decision as the AG? I would strongly advise against it.' The prime minister said, 'No, No, No – we just need to find a solution,'"" Wilson-Raybould said Wednesday.

Speaking to reporters after her testimony, Trudeau denied any wrongdoing and said his government was principally concerned about job losses, namely for the 9,400 Canadians who work for SNC-Lavalin, when there were discussions about the DPA.

3. 'Partisan political considerations'

Wilson-Raybould said after she told the prime minister in September that she had made a decision on the matter, all lobbying efforts by his staff and others should have immediately stopped.

""Various officials urged me to take partisan political considerations into account — which it was clearly improper for me to do,"" she said, citing talk from PMO staffers about the upcoming Quebec provincial election where the Quebec Liberal Party was facing a strong challenge from the Coalition Avenir Quebec, the right-of-centre party that ultimately prevailed.

""We either have a system that is based on the rule of law, the independence of the prosecutorial functions, and respect for those charged to use their discretion and powers in particular ways – or we do not,"" she said.

Wilson-Raybould said she then met with Butts on Dec. 5, 2018, to discuss the ""barrage of people hounding me and my staff.""

4. 'Need to find a solution'

Wilson-Raybould said that Butts told her that, despite her misgivings, there needed to be some sort of ""solution on the SNC stuff.""

Butts is then said to have told her that he didn't like how the former Conservative government had created the Public Prosecution Service of Canada in the first place — a prosecutorial arm separate from other lawyers in the justice department.

After the meeting and amid her clear reluctance to ""find a solution,"" on Dec. 18, 2018, her chief of staff, Jessica Prince, was ""urgently summoned"" to meet with both Butts and the prime minister's chief of staff, Katie Telford, to discuss a DPA.

In a text message exchange said to have been sent immediately after that meeting, Prince told Wilson-Raybould about the conversation.

""Gerry said 'Jess, there is no solution here that doesn't involve some interference,' Wilson-Raybould said, reading the text message from Prince to the committee Wednesday.

5. 'Saturday Night Massacre'

Then, on a phone call with Wernick on Dec. 19, Wilson-Raybould said the clerk made it clear to her that the prime minister was ""quite determined, quite firm"" on the matter and that he wanted to know why the DPA route ""isn't being used.""

Wernick told her that Trudeau was ""a bit worried.""

Wilson-Raybould said Wernick told her that Trudeau is ""gonna find a way to get it done one way or another. So, he is in that kinda mood and I wanted you to be aware of that.""

The clerk said the prime minister was not asking her to do anything ""outside of the box of what is legal or proper.""

Wilson-Raybould said she was quite sure she was making the right decision and that Wernick's messages on the matter were ""treading on dangerous ground here.""

""And I issued a stern warning because as the AG ... I cannot act in a partisan way and I cannot be politically motivated. And all of this screams of that,"" she said.

When Wernick told her that Trudeau understood it was Wilson-Raybould's decision alone to make and she should be aware of what the prime minister wanted on this matter, the former minister said she had thought of the ""Saturday Night Massacre.""

Wilson-Raybould was referencing a series of events in 1973 when former U.S. president Richard Nixon, during the Watergate scandal, ordered justice department officials to fire the special prosecutor probing the matter.

The attorney general, and then the deputy attorney general, resigned when asked to take this action by the president.

Wilson-Raybould said she thought she, too, would have to resign instead of following through with a direct order from the prime minister to sign a DPA or else.

6. 'I did not consider resigning'

Asked why she didn't resign from her position as attorney general and justice minister during the time she said improper pressure was being applied, Wilson-Raybould said:

""I was, in my opinion, doing my job as the attorney general. I was protecting a fundamental constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence and the independence of our judiciary. That's my job. That was my job, rather, as the attorney general.

(Photo: LUDOVIC MARIN/AFP/Getty Images)

How far the international community’s approach towards Israel has reversed trajectory over the past half century can be gauged simply by studying the fate of one word: Zionism.

In 1975 much of the world broke ranks with the United States and Europe at the United Nations general assembly to declare that Zionism, Israel’s founding ideology, “is a form of racism and racial discrimination”.

Western publics were generally shocked. Zionism, they had been told, was a necessary liberation movement for the Jewish people after centuries of oppression and pogroms. Its creation, Israel, was simply the righting of terrible wrongs that had culminated in the horrors of the Holocaust.

But Zionism looked very different to those countries around the globe that had been exposed to centuries of European colonialism and the more recent advent of US imperialism.

The long history of crimes against Jews that led to Israel’s establishment took place mostly in Europe. And yet it was Europe and the US that had sponsored and aided the arrival of Jews in another people’s homeland, far from their own shores.

To the global south, the great purges of native Palestinians carried out by European Jews in 1948 and 1967 looked all too reminiscent of white Europeans cleansing indigenous peoples in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.

A colonial anachronism

By 1975, the time of the UN vote, it was clear that Israel had no intention either of handing back to the Palestinians the occupied territories it had seized eight years earlier. Rather, Israel was entrenching the occupation by illegally transferring its own civilian population into the Palestinian territories.

Across much of the globe, these Jewish settlers looked like an anachronism, a reminder of the white “pioneers” heading westwards across the supposedly empty lands of the US; the white farmers who seized vast tracts of South Africa and Rhodesia as their personal homesteads; and the white newcomers who herded the remnants of Australia’s Aboriginal peoples into reservations or turned them into a sideshow at its tourist sites.

The UN’s “Zionism is racism” resolution lasted 16 years – until the fall of the Soviet Union and the emergence of the US as the world’s sole superpower. After a lot of diplomatic arm-twisting by Washington, including promises that Israel would engage in a peace process with the Palestinians, Resolution 3379 was finally scrapped in 1991.

Decades later, the pendulum has swung decisively the other way.

US and European elites have moved on from their once-defensive posture that Zionism is not racism. Now, they are on the attack. Their presumption is that anti-Zionism – the position of much the international community 44 years ago – is synonymous with racism.

Or more specifically, it is increasingly being accepted that anti-Zionism and antisemitism are two sides of the same coin.

Apartheid-style system

That trend was consolidated last week when Emmanuel Macron, the centrist French president, went further than simply reiterating his repeated conflation of anti-Zionism and antisemitism. This time he threatened to outlaw anti-Zionism.

Macron’s confusion of anti-Zionism with antisemitism is patently nonsensical.

Antisemitism refers to the hatred of Jews. It is bigotry, plain and simple.

Anti-Zionism, on the other hand, is opposition to the political ideology of Zionism, a movement that has insisted in all its political guises on prioritising the rights of Jews to a homeland over those, the Palestinians, who were already living there.

Anti-Zionism is not racism against Jews; it is opposition to racism by Zionist Jews.

Of course, an anti-Zionist may also be antisemitic, but it is more likely that an anti-Zionist holds his or her position for entirely rational and ethical reasons.

That was made only clearer last summer when the Israeli parliament passed a basic law defining Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people (PDF). The law asserts that all Jews, even those with no connection to Israel, enjoy a right to self-determination there that all Palestinians are deprived of, including the fifth of Israel’s population who are Palestinian and formally citizens.

In other words, the law creates two statuses in Israel – and implicitly in the occupied territories too – based on an imposed ethno-religious classification system that entitles all Jews to superior rights over all Palestinians.

In constitutional terms, Israel is explicitly operating an apartheid-style legal and political system, one even more encompassing than South Africa’s. After all, the apartheid rulers of South Africa never claimed that theirs was the homeland of all white people.

Criminalizing BDS

Macron’s threat to outlaw anti-Zionism is the logical extension of existing moves across Europe and the US to penalise those who support BDS, the growing international solidarity movement with Palestinians that calls for boycott, divestment and sanctions against Israel.

Many members of the BDS movement, though not all, are anti-Zionists. A proportion are anti-Zionist Jews.

The movement not only leapfrogs western policy elites’ decades of complicity in Israel’s oppression of the Palestinians but highlights the extent of that complicity. That is one reason it is so reviled by those elites.

France has gone furthest so far in this direction, criminalizing BDS as a form of economic discrimination. It thereby conflates a state, Israel, with an ethnic group, Jews – precisely as antisemites do.

Such legislation makes as much sense as France outlawing a boycott of apartheid South Africa back in the 1980s on the grounds that it discriminated against whites.

Israel lobbyists in action

France, however, is simply at the head of the curve. In the US some 26 states have enacted laws to punish or sanction individuals and organisations that support a boycott. Similar legislation is pending in a further 13 states.

None seem concerned that they are violating Americans’ much-cherished First Amendment rights, and making an exception to the right to free speech in one case only – that of Israel.

This month the US Senate joined the fray by passing a bill to encourage states to inflict economic punishments on those who support a boycott of Israel.

These victories against the non-violent BDS movement are the result of vigorous and malevolent efforts behind the scenes by Israel lobbyists to confuse anti-Zionism with antisemitism.

As Israel’s standing among western publics has plummeted with the advent of social media, endless videos of violence by the Israeli army and settlers caught on phone cameras, and Israel’s starvation of Gaza, Israel’s lobbyists have moved to make it ever harder to speak out.

Redefinition of antisemitism

Their coup was the recent widespread acceptance in the west of a redefinition of antisemitism that intentionally confuses it with anti-Zionism.

Israel’s fingerprints are all over the work of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA). It is therefore hardly surprising that the lengthy and vague definition of antisemitism devised by the IHRA has been supplemented by 11 examples, seven of which refer to Israel.

One example, stating that Israel is a “racist endeavour”, suggests that the 72 UN member states that voted for 1975’s “Zionism is racism” resolution, as well as the 32 that abstained, were themselves espousing, or turning a blind eye to, antisemitism.

Western governments, local authorities, political parties and public bodies are now racing to adopt the IHRA definition.

The result has been a growing fear among western publics about what can be said any longer about Israel without eliciting accusations of antisemitism.

That is the goal. If people become afraid that others will think them antisemitic for criticising Israel, then they will keep quiet, giving Israel greater leeway to commit crimes against Palestinians.

‘Self-hating Jew’ trope

Were Macron and the IHRA right – that anti-Zionism and antisemitism are all but indistinguishable – then we would have to accept some very uncomfortable conclusions.

One would be that Palestinians should be uniformly damned as antisemites for demanding their own right to self-determination. Or put another way, it would be impossible for Palestinians to demand the same rights as Jews in their homeland without that being declared as racist. Welcome to Alice Through the Looking Glass.

Another conclusion would be that a significant proportion of Jews around the world, those who oppose Israel’s self-definition as a Jewish state, are also antisemites, infected with an irrational hatred of their fellow Jews. This is the “self-hating Jew” trope Israel has long relied on to discredit criticism from Jews.

On this view, those Jews who want Palestinians to enjoy the same rights as Jews claim for themselves in the Middle East are racist – and not only that, but racist against themselves.

And if Macron’s efforts to criminalise anti-Zionism prove fruitful, it would mean that Palestinians and Jews could be punished – maybe even jailed – for demanding equality between Palestinians and Jews in Israel.

Preposterous as this reasoning sounds when laid out so bluntly, similar approaches to dealing with antisemitism are being readily accepted by actors across Europe and the US.

The extent of this insanity was evident in the decision of Germany’s Bank für Sozialwirtschaft, or Bank for Social Economy, to shut the account of a Jewish anti-Zionist group, Jewish Voice for a Just Peace in the Middle East, over its support for a boycott of Israel. It was the first time a German bank had closed down a Jewish organization’s account since the Nazis were in power.

The bank took the action after complaints that Jewish Voice was antisemitic by the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a group that masks its fervent support for Israel behind campaigning for Jewish rights.

Eliding the left and far-right

Macron’s antipathy to anti-Zionism – shared by many others seeking to confuse it with antisemitism – has an explicit cause as well as a more veiled one. Both are related to the political crisis he faces. After two years in power, he is the most unpopular president in the republic’s history.

According to Macron, the rise of anti-Zionism, or more broadly growing opposition to Israel, is swelling the ranks of those who want to harm Jews in France, whether through attacks, the scrawling of swastikas on Jewish graves or the polluting of public discourse, especially on social media.

Two groups that he and French Jewish lobby groups have identified as at the core of the problem are French Muslims, often recent immigrants who are seen as importing with them supposed racist Middle Eastern attitudes to Jews, and secular leftists who have taken the lead in supporting BDS.

Although a small number of French Muslims have adopted extremist positions, most feel hostility towards Israel because of its role in displacing and oppressing Palestinians. That sentiment dominates among BDS activists too.

But the implication of Macron and the lobby is that these two anti-Zionist groups are actually closely aligned with the antisemitic far-right and neo-Nazi groups, whatever their obvious respective differences in ideology and attitude towards violence.

The blurring by Macron of anti-Zionism and antisemitism is meant to sow doubt about what should be obvious distinctions between these three very different ideological constituencies.

Macron’s sleight of hand

Macron’s sleight of hand has a related and more specifically self-serving agenda, however, as has become clear in the wider misuse – or weaponisation – of antisemitism slurs in Europe and the US.

Macron is faced with a popular revolt known as the Yellow Vests, or Gilets Jaunes, that has taken over high streets for many months. The protests are rocking his government.

Like other recent grassroots insurrections, such as the Occupy movement, the Yellow Vests is leaderless and its demands difficult to decipher. It represents more a mood, a spreading dissatisfaction with an out-of-touch political system that, since the financial meltdown a decade ago, has looked chronically broken and unreformable.

The Yellow Vests embody a grievance desperately searching to hitch its wagon to a new political star, a different and fairer vision of how our societies could be organised.

The movement’s very inarticulateness has been its power and its threat. Those frustrated with austerity policies, those angry at an arrogant, unresponsive political and financial elite, those craving a return to a clearer sense of Frenchness can all seek shelter under its banner.

But equally it has also allowed Macron and the French elite to project on to the Yellow Vests any kind of malevolent motive that best serves their efforts to demonize the movement. A charge spokespeople for the movement deny.

And given the rising tide of nativist, far-right movements across Europe, casting the Yellow Vests as antisemitic has proved difficult to resist for the embattled French president.

Just as Macron has presented leftwing and anti-racism activists supporting BDS as in cahoots with neo-Nazis, he has lumped together the Yellow Vests with far-right white nationalists. Much of the French media have happily recycled this mischief.

Centrists’ love of authority

For those who assume that centrist leaders like Macron are acting not out of naked political self-interest but from a concern to eradicate prejudice and protect a vulnerable community, it is worth pausing to consider recent research on global political attitudes.

Last year the New York Times published a commentary by David Adler showing that, contrary to popular wisdom, centrists were on average significantly less invested in democracy than the far left and far right. They were least supportive of civil rights and “free and fair elections”.

These trends were particularly pronounced in the US, Britain, France, Australia and New Zealand, but noticeable in many other western liberal democracies.

Additionally, in most western countries, including France, support for a strongman and for authoritarianism was much stronger among centrists than on the far-left. British and US centrists also outpolled the far-right in their love of authority figures.

Adler concluded: “Support for ‘free and fair’ elections drops at the center for every single country in the sample. The size of the centrist gap is striking. In the case of the United States, fewer than half of people in the political center view elections as essential. … Centrists …seem to prefer strong and efficient government over messy democratic politics.”

Lobbyists’ stranglehold

It is therefore perhaps not surprising that centrist leaders like Macron are among the most ready to disengage from fair and open debate, smear opponents and readily blur the ideological distinctions between those to their left and their right.

And similarly, supporters of centrism are most likely to lap up unfounded accusations of antisemitism in the service of maintaining a status quo they perceive as benefiting them.

That process has been starkly on show in Britain and the US of late.

For decades the centrists in Washington have dominated politics on both sides of a supposed political divide. And one issue that has enjoyed especially strong bipartisan support in the US is backing for Israel.

The reason for a narrow Washington consensus on a whole range of issues, including Israel, has been the stranglehold on the US political process of corporate money and paid lobbyists.

Lobbies prefer to operate in the dark, wielding influence out of public view. In the case of Israel, however, the lobby has become ever more visible to outsiders and its defences of Israel ever harder to sustain as abuses of Palestinians are readily displayed on social media.

That, in turn, has spurred the growth of the BDS movement and a new, if still small, wave of insurgency politicians.

Ilhan Omar attacked

Muslim Congresswoman Ilhan Omar showed how the established system seeks to tame wayward freshmen after she tweeted an obvious point that the pro-Israel lobby group AIPAC – like other lobbyists – uses its money to enforce political orthodoxy in Washington in its chosen field. Or as she expressed it, “It’s all about the Benjamins” – slang for $100 bills, which feature an image of Benjamin Franklin.

She was quickly submerged in an avalanche of claims that her comment was evidence of antisemitism. They came from across the so-called political spectrum, from the grandees of her own Democratic party to President Trump. Weighed down with the criticism, she apologized.

Omar justified her decision, saying it was up to Jews to decide what is antisemitic. In an age of rampant identity politics, this sounds superficially plausible. But it actually makes no sense at all.

Even if a clear majority of Jews do in fact think criticism of Israel or its lobbyists is antisemitic – a highly questionable assumption – they don’t enjoy some special or exclusive right to make that determination.

Israel victimises Palestinians, as has been endlessly documented. No one has the right to claim the moral high ground as a victim of racism when they are using that same high ground to obstruct scrutiny of Israel’s crimes against Palestinians. To think otherwise would be to prioritise the defense of Jews from a possible racism over the vast evidence of concrete racism by Israel against Palestinians.

But more to the point, Omar’s apology assumes that those Jews with the loudest voices – that is, those with the biggest platforms and the most money – represent all Jews. It makes organised American Jewry, whose vigorous support for Israel has proved unshakeable even as Israeli prime minster Benjamin Netanyahu has driven the country to the far right, the arbiter of what all Jews think.

In fact, it does more. It makes the Israel lobby itself the one to determine whether there is an Israel lobby. It gives the lobby permission to shield itself entirely from view, allowing its influence to become even more entrenched and opaque.

Omar is far from alone. Other prominent critics of Israel, often black, have found themselves singled out for accusations of antisemitism over the criticism of Israel, including recently Marc Lamont Hill and Angela Davis.

Through a drip-drip of accusations that Omar is expressing “antisemitic tropes” when she speaks out, the aim is to make sure she starts to self-censor, becomes as “moderate” as her fellow politicians, and joins the bipartisan consensus on leaving Israel to get on with abusing Palestinians.

If she doesn’t, it is assumed, she will be finished politically, kicked out either by her own party bureaucracy or by voters.

Corbyn on the back foot

That process is much further advanced in Britain with a concerted and long-running campaign to stigmatise Jeremy Corbyn with claims of antisemitism since he became leader of the Labour party more than three years ago.

Corbyn is both a throwback to a socialist tradition in Britain that was killed by Margaret Thatcher in the early 1980s and a staunch supporter of the Palestinian cause. In fact, he is a major anomaly: a European politician in sight of power who prioritises the right of Palestinians to justice over Israel’s policy of oppressing Palestinians.

The Israel lobby has a great deal to fear from him in changing the political climate in Europe towards Israel.

In the UK, the ruling Conservative party has moved relentlessly to the right in recent decades, leaving the Labour party in parliament to occupy the centrist ground carved out for it during Tony Blair’s leadership in the 1990s.

Although enjoying huge support among Labour members that propelled him into the leadership, Corbyn is at war with most of his MPs. The centrists there have happily weaponised antisemitism to damage Corbyn and the hundreds of thousands of members behind him, just as Macron has against his own political opponents.

Corbyn’s own MPs have publicly accused him of indulging an “institutional antisemitism” in Labour, or even of being antisemitic himself.

They have done so even though all evidence suggests that there is very little antisemitism among Labour members – and less than in the ruling Conservative party.] Labour members, however, have felt liberated by Corbyn to be much more outspoken in criticizing Israel.

Appeasement fails

This month a group of eight Labour MPs split from the party to set up a new faction, the Independent Group, citing Labour’s supposed “antisemitism problem” as one of the main reasons. Highlighting their centrist agenda, three “moderate” Conservative MPs joined them, opposed to prime minister Theresa May’s hardline on exiting the European Union, known as Brexit. More MPs from both sides may follow.

In response, Corbyn’s deputy, Tom Watson, another centrist, backed the defectors and scorned his own party members, reiterating claims of an antisemitism crisis in the party and saying it was time to root it out.

Corbyn has repeatedly tried to appease the centrists, as well as pro-Israel lobby groups in the UK – both those inside his party like Labour Friends of Israel and the Jewish Labour Movement, and those outside like the Board of Deputies, BICOM and the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism.

Over apparent opposition from members, the Labour party has even accepted the IHRA definition of antisemitism, including the examples meant to shield Israel from criticism – all to no effect.

In fact, the more Corbyn has conceded to critics, the more his critics have trumpeted a supposed antisemitism problem in Labour.

Corbyn is slowly learning, as others are in the US and Europe, that this is not a good-faith disagreement and that there is no middle ground.

The smear industry doesn’t want safeguards on antisemitism, they want a return to a political culture in which their power was left unchallenged and unscrutinised.

For the Israel lobby, that means the revival of a political climate that existed before the discrediting of the Oslo process, in which criticism of Israel was publicly shunned and the Palestinians were treated chiefly as terrorists.

For the centrists, it requires the entrenchment of a managerial, neoliberal politics in which major corporations and the financial industries have the freedom to dictate economic and social policies and their failures are unquestioningly bailed out by the public through austerity programmes.

It is an unholy pact, and one in which Jews are being used to oil the wheels of a failed, impotent and increasingly authoritarian politics of the center.",France’s Macron leads the way as western leaders malevolently confuse anti-Zionism with antisemitism,Mondoweiss.net,https://mondoweiss.net/2019/02/western-malevolently-antisemitism/

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is embroiled in his first major scandal since taking office.

His former Justice Minister and attorney general accused him in a recent hearing of improperly pressuring his officials to drop a major investigation into an influential construction company.

Officials said that Trudeau tried to block them from bringing bribery and fraud charges against SNC-Lavalin because of its economic importance.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing scrutiny after former Justice Minister and member of parliament Jody Wilson-Raybould publicly accused him of trying a squash a corruption and fraud investigation into an influential Canadian construction company.

Wilson-Raybould accused Trudeau and his aides of improperly pressuring her to seek a financial settlement with SNC-Lavalin,The Globe and Mail first reported in early February. The construction and engineering giant holds multiple contracts with the Canadian government and employees approximately 9,000 Canadians.

In her Wednesday testimony before the House of Commons’ Justice Committee, Wilson-Raybould said the government pressured the Justice Department to settle with SNC-Lavalin after prosecutors charged the company in 2015 with bribing the Libyan government during the reign of dictator Muammar al-Ghadaffi.

If found guilty of the charges, the company could be banned from doing business with the Canadian government for a decade, potentially leaving the 3,400 Quebec residents employed by SNC-Lavalin out of a job. One of Quebec’s pension funds is also one of the largest shareholders in SNC-Lavalin, owning a 20% stake in the company, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Wilson-Raybould and other officials said the possible economic implications of the indictment were fair considerations. François Legault, Quebec’s current premier, recommended a financial settlement over concerns that the indictment would push the company to leave Canada altogether, according to the Journal.

But some Justice officials suggested that Trudeau also had political motivations to interfere with prosecutorial proceedings in order to save jobs in Quebec, a province that will be crucial for the Trudeau and his Liberal Party to carry in order to maintain control over the government in this October’s federal elections.

Wilson-Raybould testified that she “experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion” over the course of several meetings and conversations with Trudeau himself and his advisors, including top aide Michael Wernick.

Both Trudeau and Wernick have forcefully denied putting political pressure to drop the charges on Wilson-Raybould, who resigned from her position in Trudeau’s cabinet after she was moved to a lower-level role in the veterans affairs’ department amid the fallout of the scandal.

“I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally, therefore I completely disagree with the characterization of these events,” Trudeau said of Wilson-Raybould’s testimony on Wednesday, according to the New York Times.

Wernick also disputed Wilson-Raybould’s testimony that he also applied pressure on her to drop the charges, but said that he communicated to her that “a lot of her colleagues and the prime minister were quite anxious about what they were hearing and reading in the business press about the future of the company.”

While Canada’s ethics commissioner is investigating the matter to formally determine whether Trudeau improperly interfered in the probe, the scandal may already be hurting his electoral prospects.

A recent Ipsos poll found Trudeau’s approval rating declining, and the Conservative party pulling ahead of the Liberals on the generic ballot.

Pollster Darrell Bricker told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that the scandal “hits at what gives the Liberal Party its appeal: the prime minister,” and could be devastating if Trudeau doesn’t re-claim control over the narrative soon.

In Toronto’s tight housing market, that doesn’t always happen, says one councillor. That worries tenants who receive notices to leave, fearing they’ll be pushed permanent…","From the outside there is nothing about the lowrise, brown brick apartment building at 394 Dovercourt Rd. that gives away the extent of the turmoil and anxiety within. But behind its walls a group of renters who barely knew each other have banded together to weather an uncertain future and brace for a fight they fear could end with them losing their deeply affordable homes.

Kiisti Matsuo is among a group of tenants at 394 Dovercourt Rd. who received notices to leave their apartments so the units can be rewired. ( Richard Lautens / Toronto Star )

“I can’t even wrap my head around what that would mean, not to mention taking down all the crazy stuff in my apartment,” said Kiisti Matsuo, a makeup artist for film and television who pays $758 for a bachelor unit. “Maybe I’ll have selling parties.” Their new landlord has said the building is unsafe and must be entirely rewired, work that could take half a year, and requested that everybody leave by the end of February — or risk being ordered out by the Landlord and Tenant Board (LTB). What concerns the Dovercourt tenants is the chance of a “renoviction,” when a landlord uses a legal process to remove long-term tenants during renovations but never intends to let them back in.

Article Continued Below

Matsuo’s neighbours include a painter and community organizer, an independent business owner and occasional extra for film, a sessional lecturer at York University, a tree-planter and musician, and the director of housing services for Dixon Hall Neighbourhood Services, a multi-service agency that serves marginalized people. Low rent, they told the Star, is what has made it possible for them to live and thrive in Toronto. They’ve posted flyers, engaged a lawyer and hope that speaking about their building will raise awareness around a process that if unchecked, they said, could severely change the landscape of the city.

The Residential Tenancies Act (RTA) states that tenants who want to return when work is done can claim their “right of first refusal” and pay about the same rent, as if they never left. Property owner AIPL Canada Holdings Inc., the landlord, has and will continue to follow the law and respect tenants rights, the Star was told. The tenants realize the units would go for higher rent if empty. Briarlane Rental Property Management Inc., which manages the building as well as neighbouring 382 Dovercourt, also owned by AIPL Canada, lists on its website one-bedrooms starting from $1,850 and studios from $1,650.

To most of the Dovercourt tenants, paying market prices is not an option — rather, it would be “game over” for their time in Toronto, as described by tenant Aleksandar Kulauzov. A recent “renovictions” case involving a nearby building at 795 College St. found that despite ruling the landlord for that building had blatantly disregarded the law — forcing tenants out, ignoring their requests to return, and finding new ones to pay more than three times the rent — the LTB doesn’t have the power to get the original tenants back in their homes. The board fined the landlord $75,000, but that’s money it can recoup from the higher rents in less than a year.

“What we are seeing is more and more of these in the city, which is extremely concerning,” said Ana Bailão, chair of Toronto’s planning and housing committee and councillor for Ward 9 (Davenport). Renovations need to happen, she said, but there must be better ways to make sure buildings don’t reach the point where a mass eviction for work is needed. “We know there is this loophole that exists,” Bailão said. “People are being pushed out of their community and it is something that needs to be addressed.” The Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing has consulted with landlords and tenant groups on potential changes to the RTA, a spokesperson for Minister Steve Clark told the Star in an email, and that input will be used to help develop a housing supply action plan expected in spring, with potential legislative changes in fall. “With any proposed changes brought forward, we will ensure the continued protection of tenants,” said Julie O’Driscoll. Matsuo said the current law paves the way for gentrification. “You are going to lose so much culture, and the culture makers, and all the teachers, artists, musicians, everybody, you are going to lose us all ... Then you don’t have a city. You have a cell of a city,” she said. “It is totally preventable what is happening, but what is happening is profound.” Their building was sold for $3.15 million in October 2017 to AIPL Canada, a company incorporated in B.C. with mailing and delivery addresses at a P.O. box in Vancouver and a commercial property called The Masterpiece in India. AIPL also purchased 382 Dovercourt Rd. for about $2.8 million, from the same owners. Both buildings have a history of safety issues. The previous owners were fined $96,000 in provincial offences court for numerous fire code violations about six months before the sale, Toronto Fire confirmed. Deputy Sgt. Jim Jessop told the Star that subsequent inspections resulted in both buildings being cleared before the properties changed hands. Two weeks after the sale tenants were told in writing that “a significant number of major issues” discovered after purchase and reiterated that the landlord did offer funds to people willing to end tenancies to help offset the costs of finding new places to live. The amount was, the landlord noted, “well above” what the landlord was required to offer tenants affected through the N13 process. An official notice, the N13, arrived two weeks later informing residents that knob and tube wiring had been used throughout and must be replaced. “We have been advised by our building insurance and electrical engineers that this wiring is problematic and dangerous and needs to be replaced,” it read. Some tenants left and construction began on empty units. But earlier this month a city inspector found that fire separation was removed “prior to obtaining a permit” and ordered work in and around four units to immediately cease, according to an Order to Comply dated Feb. 15 and posted at the building. If the landlord wants to remove the remaining tenants, the next step is filing an application with the LTB. By Wednesday afternoon nothing had been submitted.

Residents of 394 Dovercourt Rd. were told knob and tube wiring had been used throughout the building and ""this wiring is problematic and dangerous and needs to be replaced."" ( Toronto Star )

Property management company Briarlane did not respond to emails, calls and a hand-delivered letter containing questions about the property, the order from the city and a request to be connected with the owner. The Star was sent a statement from a Gmail account after emailing the corporate office of Advanced India Projects Ltd. in Haryana, India, and speaking with two men with Toronto phone numbers who were identified as the landlord’s representative in a notice to tenants and who declined to comment but took messages. The property owner, the statement read, “has and will continue to ensure” the building is managed and operated in accordance with the law, “will continue to respect the rights of all tenants” and “any comment, suggestion or insinuation to the contrary is simply untrue.” In a followup email, the author wrote there has been “absolutely no attempt” by the property owner to forcibly remove people and if tenants pursued the right of first refusal their wishes would be respected. In a city where the vacancy rates hovers at about 1 per cent and landlords can charge what they want for empty units, the Dovercourt tenants have little choice. Occupied one-bedroom units in purpose-built rental buildings in Toronto cost an average of $1,270 and bachelors $1,089, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CHMC) reports. Full units are subject to rent controls. Empty and new units go for whatever the market will bear. In the Greater Toronto Area, one-bedrooms go for closer to $2,024 and $1,793 for a studio, housing research firm Urbanation, reported. Beyond making a yearly profit there is another incentive to boost rent in purpose-built apartment buildings, albeit one rarely used. Buildings where all units rent at 1.5 times the CMHC average qualify to be converted to condominiums with city council approval. Three applications have come in and just one was approved in the past five years, city staff confirmed. New Democratic Party MPP Marit Stiles (Davenport) said flaws in existing housing law means at the end of the day tenants have very few rights. “We are going to end up being a city where only people who are very wealthy can afford to live in our communities,” said Stiles, noting the NDP sought to amend the law to address “renovictions” under the previous Liberal government. “My fear is we are going to see more of them not less,” Stiles said. “The fact is the provincial laws around this are too weak and there are too many loopholes.” With files from the Toronto Star Library Emily Mathieu is a Toronto-based reporter covering affordable and precarious housing.

168,Empty,2019-02-27T12:35:00Z,Tensions have escalated between India and Pakistan after New Delhi launched air strikes in Pakistani territory. DW takes a look at the turbulent history between the nuclear-armed neighbors. Bloody partition (1947): The two neighbors have shared a tensed relat…,"Bloody partition (1947): The two neighbors have shared a tense relationship ever since the British divided the Indian subcontinent in a secular but mainly Hindu India and Muslim-majority state of Pakistan. The partition sparked riots and communal violence across the region and led to one of the largest human migrations in history.

The escalation of Kashmir conflict (1947-48): India and Pakistan contested Kashmir — a Muslim-majority kingdom ruled by a Hindu Maharaja — even before their independence from Britain. But the dispute escalated after Kashmir ruler Hari Singh acceded Kashmir to India in return for New Delhi's help to ward off attacks by an army of Pakistani tribesmen. The developments led to the first full-blown war over Kashmir between the two countries.

Partition of India: The way forward Birth of two nations In 1947, British India was divided into two countries - India and Pakistan. Pakistan's founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah and his All-India Muslim League party had first demanded autonomy for Muslim-majority areas in the undivided India, and only later a separate country for Muslims. Jinnah believed that Hindus and Muslims could not continue to live together, as they were distinctly different ""nations.""

Partition of India: The way forward The line of blood The partition of British India was extremely violent. Following the birth of India and Pakistan, violent communal riots began in many western areas, mostly in Punjab. Historians say that more than a million people died in clashes, and millions more migrated from Indian territory to Pakistan and from the Pakistani side to India.

Partition of India: The way forward The 1948 war India and Pakistan clashed over Kashmir soon after their independence. The Muslim-majority Kashmir region was ruled by a Hindu leader, but Jinnah wanted it to be part of Pakistani territory. Indian and Pakistani troops fought in Kashmir in 1948, with India taking control of most part of the valley, while Pakistan occupied a smaller area. India and Pakistan continue to clash over Kashmir.

Partition of India: The way forward Like US and Canada? Liberal historians say that Jinnah and Mahatma Gandhi wanted cordial ties between newly independent states. Jinnah, for instance, believed that ties between India and Pakistan should be similar to those between the US and Canada. But after his death in 1948, his successors followed a collision course with New Delhi.

Partition of India: The way forward The 'other' Indian and Pakistani governments present very different accounts of the partition. While India emphasizes the Indian National Congress' freedom movement against British rulers - with Gandhi as its main architect - Pakistani textbooks focus on a ""struggle"" against both British and Hindu ""oppression."" State propaganda in both countries paints each other as an ""enemy"" that cannot be trusted.

Partition of India: The way forward Worsening ties Diplomatic ties between India and Pakistan have remained acrimonious for the past seven decades. The issue of Islamist terrorism has marred relations in the last few years, with New Delhi accusing Islamabad of backing Islamist jihadists to wage a war in India-administered Kashmir. India also blames Pakistan-based groups for launching terror attacks on Indian soil. Islamabad denies these claims.

Partition of India: The way forward The way forward Many young people in both India and Pakistan are urging their governments to improve bilateral ties. Islamabad-based documentary filmmaker Wajahat Malik believes the best way for India and Pakistan to develop a closer relationship is through more interaction between their peoples. ""Trade and tourism are the way forward for us. When people come together, the states will follow suit,"" Malik told DW. Author: Shamil Shams



UN resolution (1948): India dragged the Kashmir dispute to the United Nations Security Council, which passed a resolution calling for a referendum to decide the status of Kashmir. But the Security Council made the referendum conditional to the withdrawal of Pakistani troops and reduction of Indian military presence to the minimum to maintain law and order in the region. The war ended with a UN-brokered ceasefire but Pakistan refused to withdraw its troops. A ceasefire line effectively partitioned Kashmir with both sides controlling parts of the erstwhile kingdom but claiming it in its entirety.

Indo-Pakistan War (1965): Despite several attempts to solve the Kashmir dispute and deescalate tensions, the two neighbors fought their second war over the contested region. The brief war ended with yet-another UN-mandated ceasefire. Both sides returned to their previous positions.

War over Bangladesh (1971): India and Pakistan fought their third war, this time over East Pakistan. The conflict ended in a defeat for Pakistan and the formation of Bangladesh.

Simla Agreement (1972): Following Pakistan's surrender in the 1971 war, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Pakistani leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto met and signed an agreement in the Indian hill town of Simla. The ceasefire line in Kashmir is designated as the Line of Control (LoC) and the two parties agree to resolve the dispute through negotiations.

Former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Pakistani leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto signed the Simla Agreement in 1972

Armed resistance in Kashmir (1989): A pro-independenceinsurgencygathered momentum in India-administered Kashmir following disputed stateelections. The insurgency escalated over the next decade, partly fanned by a violent crackdown by Indian troops. India accused Pakistan of supporting the insurgents by providing weapons and training. Pakistan denied this claim.

Kargil conflict (1999): The two neighbors, by now nuclear powers, entered into an armed conflict after militants from across the LoC took control of key strategic positions in India-administered Kashmir. India drove the militants out but blamed Pakistan for supporting the incursion. The diplomatic gains made after a historic meeting in Lahore between the prime ministers of the two countries were eroded and India broke off relations.

Indian Parliament attack (2001): Tensions between India and Pakistan reached a new high after a terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament. India blamed Pakistan-based terror outfits for the attack and deployed troops on its borders with Pakistan. Islamabad reciprocated. The standoff ended after an international mediation.

Ceasefire (2003): The two sides agreed to a ceasefire along the LoC. The ceasefire is still in force but the two countries have blamed each other for occasionally violating it.

India broke off all talks with Pakistan after attacks in Mumbai that New Delhi claimed was sanctioned by Pakistan's intelligence agency.

Mumbai attacks (2008): Armed gunmen launched several attacks in India's financial capital of Mumbai, killing more than 150 people. India blamed Pakistan for the attacks. But Islamabad vociferously denied the Indian assertion that Lashkar-e-Taiba, the terror outfit behind the attacks, was sanctioned by Pakistan's intelligence agency. India broke off all talks with Pakistan after the attacks. New Delhi continues to maintain that ""terror and talks"" can't go together.

Former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi tried to usher in a new era of peace.

Surgical strikes (2016): Efforts by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif to relaunch talks came to an abrupt halt after an attack on an Indian army base by a Pakistan-based terror outfit, Jaish-e-Mohammed. India retaliated to the killing of 19 soldiers by launching ""surgical strikes"" on alleged terror camps on the other side of the LoC. Pakistan denied India's claims.

India bombs targets in Pakistan (2019): India conducted airstrikes on an alleged Jaish-e-Mohammed terror camp in Pakistan's Balakot. The attack came just days after the terror outfit claimed responsibility for killing 40 Indian soldiers in a suicide attack in Kashmir. A day later, Pakistan said it downed two Indian jets in retaliation.

The SNC-Lavalin matter already sounded like puff pastry when it first appeared and now it is a crumb, a particle. The allegation was that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his staff were concerned less about legal niceties than about huge job losses should SNC-Lavalin be prosecuted over dodgy money in Libya — is there any other kind? — and perhaps lose 10 years of federal contracts. Out of concern for the public good, they may have mentioned this to the justice minister/attorney-general, who can decide, if she chooses, to defer corporate prosecutions. This whole matter is down to whether they talked to her forcefully or gently. Did they hint or did they hammer? Who knows? More importantly, who cares?

This is not a scandal. It is not even an anecdote. It is the Ottawa equivalent of the Daily Mail’s claim of a national backlash against Meghan’s New York baby shower. It does not exist. Which brings me to the man who explained why it didn’t exist. He is Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, Canada’s top civil servant, who owned the room at the justice committee. He spoke without hesitancy, with clarity and candour, about a danger sensed by many Canadians.

“I worry about my country right now, I’m deeply concerned about my country right now and its politics and where it’s headed. I worry about foreign interference in the upcoming election and we’re working hard on that. I worry about the rising tide of incitements to violence, when people use terms like ‘treason’ and ‘traitor’ in open discourse. Those are the words that lead to assassination. I’m worried that someone is going to be shot in this country this year during the political campaign.” I too have worried about Trudeau’s town halls being a danger to him. I’d worry about Conservative leader Andrew Scheer’s if he had any. Scheer always looks like a man who has just put eyedrops in and is in that blinking transitory state. Pleasant enough, he is easily led into traps laid by the extreme far-right. Why else would he have appeared with the racist yellow vests on Parliament Hill? Wernick, who has served under many prime ministers, abhorred yellow-vest-style remarks by a Saskatchewan senator that would “incite people to drive trucks over people, after what happened in Toronto last summer” simply because they were Liberal. “I worry about the trolling from the vomitorium of social media entering the open media arena,” he said. We do too. Wernick said he most worries about Canadians “losing faith in the institutions of governance in this country” and doubting that Canada is still, as Chrystia Freeland has put it, a rule-of-law country. He then crisply explained the SNC-Lavalin matter. The rule of law is safe, he concluded. The discussions were appropriate and ethical. There is no two-tiered justice. Deferred prosecution agreements can be rationally applied. In other words, there is no there there. I agree. The SNC-Lavalin matter was a media creation in an election year, possibly done inadvertently to gin things up. It became a sly collective patchwork of insinuation. And now that Wernick has explained the complex role of the Deputy Minister of Fisheries, we Canadians can see that it just doesn’t hold up.

Questioning Islam and Muhammad has been effectively criminalized in Europe

Questioning Islam and Muhammad has been effectively criminalized in Europe

Here is background about Elisabeth Sabaditsch-Wolffs case, a case with extraordinarily important implications for the future of the freedom of speech and of the free world in general. Please visit her website here.

In 2009, Mrs. Elisabeth Sabaditsch-Wolff (ES) spoke at a series of seminars organized by the Austrian Freedom Party, which were advertised to and open to members of the public. At two such seminars, each attended by about 30 people, she made several statements about Islam and the Prophet Muhammad. The seminars were also attended by an undercover journalist, whose publisher made a criminal complaint against Mrs. ES for the statements she had made.

The public prosecutor lodged an indictment against Mrs. ES and accused her of violation of Article 283 of the Austrian Criminal Code, which criminalizes the incitement of hatred.

The Court of 1st instance (Regional Court of Vienna) dropped this specific allegation, but convicted her on 15 February 2011 for disparaging religious doctrines under Article 188 of the Austrian Criminal Code.

Her appeals against this judgment was dismissed in Austria by the Court of 2nd instance (Superior Court of Vienna) on 20 December 2011 and the Court of 3rd instance (Supreme Court) on 11 December 2013.

After that, Mrs. ES lodged an appeal with the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) in which, in particular, an infringement of Art. 10 of the European Convention of Human Rights (freedom of expression) was alleged.

By judgment of 25 October 2018, no. 38450/12, the Fifth Section of the ECtHR held that the appeal was admissible, but that there was no violation of Article 10 ECHR.

On 22 January 2019, Mrs. ES lodged a request for referral of the case to the Grand Chamber of the ECtHR (GC). The GC has not yet decided whether or not to accept the request for further consideration. We therefore do not yet know whether the case will be dealt with further and whether there will be an oral hearing.

In our view, the judgment of the ECtHR is in conflict with other decisions of the same Court which have given greater weight to the fundamental right to freedom of expression.

The case is so important because it concerns the core of the fundamental right to freedom of expression: criticism of religions is practically as important as criticism of politicians. If one suppresses the possibility of criticizing religions, this can lead to a chilling effect, which makes further discussion about religions more difficult.

Mohammed was Charlie Manson without the humanity, only with more money and less musical talent. Except that Charlie Manson, as far as we know, never raped any children. And to those who respond by saying ""violence has been committed in the name of all religions through the centuries,"" I ask: ""How many people did Jesus kill? How many slaves did Jesus own? How many women did Jesus rape?"" The Five Pillars of Islam:

she made several statements about Islam and the Prophet Muhammad. The writer is showing too much deference. He probably wouldn't write ""Jesus, the Son of God"" but he does write ""the Prophet Muhammad"", even capitalizing ""Prophet"". Also, news people usually use too much deference when referring to certain cities, i.e., they'll write ""in the Holy City of Qom"" when they would never write, ""in the Holy City of Bethlehem"".

171,Empty,2019-02-26T20:51:08Z,"If the NDP want to turn their fortunes around by October, their best (and maybe only) hope is to bring the bold vision of a Green New Deal to Canada.","Last night, Jagmeet Singh defied the doubters and critics, winning his seat in Burnaby South.

""If the NDP want to turn their fortunes around by October, their best (and maybe only) hope is to bring the bold vision of a Green New Deal to Canada.""

It’s a good result for Singh, and a breath of fresh air for a New Democratic Party that’s been struggling to raise money, floundering in the polls, and has seemed to be teetering on the edge of a very public internal civil war for the past few months. But, as Singh himself mentioned in his victory remarks, now the real campaign begins. If the NDP want to turn their fortunes around by October, their best (and maybe only) hope is to bring the bold vision of a Green New Deal to Canada.

If you haven’t heard of it yet, the Green New Deal is a political idea to tackle climate change with WWII-scale economic and social mobilization. Named for Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal agenda that pulled the United States out of the Great Depression, the Green New Deal has been rapidly picking up steam south of the border. Championed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and now supported by dozens of congressional representatives and senators (along with every major Democratic presidential hopeful), the Green New Deal has become a clarion call for action at the scale and pace of the climate crisis.

But the Green New Deal isn’t just a good idea. With the campaign and organizing savvy of the Sunrise Movement behind it, polling numbers show wide geographic and cross-partisan support (especially among youth). It’s become a winning platform for Democrats and, if they imported it in the right way, it could do the same for Jagmeet Singh and the NDP.

It’s no secret that, in 2015, Justin Trudeau’s success was due, in large measure, to his ability to outflank the NDP on critical progressive issues — including climate change. It’s also true that his majority victory was driven by a dramatic uptick in youth voter turnout — 57.1 percent of eligible 18-24 year olds voted in 2015 compared to 38.8 per cent in 2011 — that largely showed up for the Liberals.

It’s also clear that Canadians, especially young people, want to see more from our federal government when it comes to climate change.

A Mainstreet Research poll released last November found that 76.1 per cent of Canadians accept that climate change is real and caused by human activity, and that nearly 60 per cent of Canadians agree that the government has to solve the issue of climate change even if doing so impacts economic growth.

The good thing about a Green New Deal is that it would create jobs and support working families through a federal jobs guarantee program. Although we don’t have direct polling on such a proposal in Canada, a 2016 Iron & Earth poll found that nearly 70 per cent of energy workers support a time-bound transition to 100 per cent renewable energy in Canada. That same poll found that 80-95 per cent would support government programs to support workers through the transition. Among the general public, these numbers are even higher.

It’s also clear that Canadians are looking for more climate ambition from our government. A recent poll from Abacus Data found just over 50 per cent national support for the carbon tax, despite the fact that almost 60 per cent didn’t think it would lead to significant emissions reductions.

That same poll found that nearly 25 per cent of Canadians think that no federal party leader has the best plan to deal with climate change, and that only five per cent think that Jagmeet Singh’s plan measures up.

Compare this to polling around the Leap Manifesto, arguably the best Canadian blueprint for a Green New Deal. According to a 2016 Ekos poll, nearly 50 per cent of Canadians backed the Leap vision of tackling climate, social and economic justice. And those numbers are even higher among NDP and Liberal party faithful.

All of this adds up to a clear challenge to the NDP to put out a climate plan that acknowledges, as Vox writer David Roberts put it last week, “this is a fucking emergency.” A plan that actually prescribes the kind of massive economic and social mobilization necessary to rise to the challenge.

The good news is that some people within the party already seem to be getting the message. Citing last fall’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report — the one that warns us all that we have just over a decade to get our act together when it comes to climate change — Svend Robinson returned to politics to run against notable Trudeau pipeline apologist Terry Beech in the riding of Burnaby-North Seymour. The second tweet from his campaign account was about a Green New Deal for Canada.

Grassroots activists within the NDP are trying to make sure that Robinson is not alone. Across the country, nomination races are being challenged by young women with bold, ambitious, Green New Deal-esque platforms. In Alberta, Paige Gorsak came within a handful of votes of winning the nomination for Linda Duncan’s former seat. In Ottawa-Center, Graciela Hernandez-Cruz did the same. They may have lost their races, but not by much, and they’ve helped to inspire other candidates like Leah Gazan in Winnipeg-Center and Emma Norton in Dartmouth-Cole Harbour — to put their names forward to bring a bolder, climate and social justice vision to the NDP.

(Sherry Vivian/CBC)

Ches Crosbie is offering a warning for the people of Newfoundland and Labrador that the province will lose the principal beneficiary status of the Atlantic Accord under Premier Dwight Ball.

""Something suspicious is occurring. I am very much concerned that this present government under Mr. Ball is engaged in a project to give up our principal beneficiary rights under the Atlantic Accord, in return for some short-term cash to get them through the election,"" the leader of the Opposition said during a news conference Tuesday morning, evoking former premier Danny Williams' fight with Ottawa, which ended with a $2-billion cheque from the federal government.

Crosbie says there has been a change in language used by the provincial Liberals over the last several months. According to Crosbie, members of the Liberal party have begun referring to the province's deal in the Atlantic Accord as ""primary"" beneficiary, not ""principal"" beneficiary, he said, suggesting ""primary"" is a lesser term and the province is giving away its benefits.

""Why the change in language, to use a term that is found nowhere in the agreements that are being negotiated? Something very worrisome is occurring,"" Crosbie said.

""'Primary' beneficiary is not found in any of these fundamental documents, the Atlantic Accord being our most important piece of legislation since the terms of the union in 1949.""

However, when pressed by reporters for evidence there's something more out of line from the Liberal camp than a supposed word change, Crosbie simply gave vague answers.

Language interchangeable

In response, Ball said the words ""principal"" and ""primary"" have been used interchangeably over the past decades — and in the present.

""There's never been any discussion that we've had about changing the word 'principal' to 'primary.' That hasn't happened and it won't happen,"" Ball told the media Tuesday afternoon.

Ball says the words 'principal' and 'primary' beneficiaries have been interchangeable for decades and that nothing will change. (Katie Breen/CBC)

Ball said Crosbie is nervous the provincial Liberals will receive a positive outcome from discussions about the Atlantic Accord.

""That would be a good day for Newfoundlanders and Labradorians, but in Ches's world it would be a bad day for Ches Crosbie,"" Ball said.

""The last thing that Ches Crosbie wants is to see a successful discussion with the federal government. See, that doesn't fit his doom and gloom agenda.""

What happened?

The Atlantic Accord was signed in 1985 to give 100 per cent of the revenue from the province's offshore resources back to Newfoundland and Labrador. But in 2003 the Royal Commission on Renewing and Strengthening our Place in Canada revealed Newfoundland and Labrador was receiving only 15 to 20 per cent of the benefits.

The resulting renegotiation with the federal government lasted months and saw Williams order Canadian flags from provincial buildings.

""It is that agreement, the 2005 Accord fiscal arrangement, that contains the clause that Mr. Ball is utilizing to write a letter to the prime minister last year requesting that we revisit and review the provisions of that arrangement, and of the accord, to ensure that they are working as intended,"" said Crosbie.

""Mr. Ball would have you think that the negotiation must be complete by the end of March this year. Well, that's not so, when you look at the actual wording of the provision in the 2005 arrangement.""

Crosbie said the negotiations just have to begin by the end of March and can run until there is a ""just result.""

Ball argues the commitment was made in the letter he wrote to the prime minister, and March. 31 will be the end date.

Expecting the worst

Ball leaves for Ottawa Thursday to continue Atlantic Accord discussions, which Crosbie criticized as happening in ""complete secrecy.""

""We don't know what the objectives of the province are, we don't know what's at stake, we don't know whether they're talking about hundreds of millions, possibly of tens of billions. We don't have a clue,"" Crosbie said.

Ball said he will keep Newfoundlanders and Labradorians updated on the discussions with Ottawa as they draw closer to end of the negotiations on the Accord, and is not ruling out the possibility of going for equalization or offset payments.

173,Empty,2019-02-28T21:17:35Z,"Trudeau’s Liberals confuse not being Conservatives, not being led by Stephen Harper, with virtue. It's a massive, lethal blind spot","The choice for Canadians now seems as stark as the first question put to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at his Wednesday night press conference in Montreal: Should Canadians believe Jody Wilson-Raybould’s account of “a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the Attorney General of Canada in an inappropriate effort to secure a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with SNC-Lavalin,” or should they believe Trudeau’s insistence that he and his staff “always acted appropriately and professionally”?

If only because we have a hugely detailed account from Wilson-Raybould, and a perfunctory denial from Trudeau, not to mention the sudden resignation of his principal secretary Gerald Butts, it seems likely the former justice minister and attorney general — the first Indigenous woman to hold the positions, as we were so often told — will win that showdown. The question then becomes: Does it matter?

Many partisan Liberals publicly took note of Wilson-Raybould’s opinion that the pressure exerted upon her had not been illegal — just inappropriate. That’s nothing for Trudeau to hang his hat on. But if “appropriate and professional” was ever the minimum threshold for reelection in this country, “not guilty” long ago replaced it. Clearly there is some despair among partisan Liberals who actually bought Trudeau’s doing-politics-differently schtick. But veteran partisans had already downshifted their re-election pitch from “utopia awaits” to “it’s him or Andrew Scheer, who’s just Stephen Harper in disguise.”

Many partisan Liberals publicly took note of Wilson-Raybould’s opinion that the pressure exerted upon her had not been illegal — just inappropriate

One of Wilson-Raybould’s most telling recollections concerned Butts’ alleged efforts to get her on board with the DPA, in a meeting at the Château Laurier. She said she refused. It would be especially inappropriate, she said she argued, considering Lavalin had already applied for a judicial review of the independent Director of Public Prosecution’s (DPP) decision not to offer such an agreement.

At this point, she said, Butts changed course. “Gerry talked to me about how the statute was … passed by Harper and that he does not like the law,” said Wilson-Raybould, referring to the 2006 Director of Public Prosecutions Act. “I said something like ‘that is the law that we have.’”

It’s quite a picture: The PM’s principal secretary, increasingly exasperated by the attorney general’s quaint insistence upon prosecutorial independence, reminds her that the rules they’re playing under were designed by the dark lord himself — as if the mere invocation of Harper’s accursed name might change her mind.

Wilson-Raybould’s answer — the law is the law — was a pretty good one. She’s a lawyer, after all. Had she been inclined toward a more thorough analysis, she might have reminded Butts of how the DPP came into being. Harper first seems to have mooted the idea on the campaign trail in 2005, amidst the Liberals’ final meltdown. Jean Chrétien had asked the Federal Court to quash the Gomery Inquiry’s findings with respect to his role in the sponsorship scandal; Paul Martin was left gibbering, supporting Chrétien’s right to appeal while standing foursquare and contritely behind Gomery’s findings.

Famously, the Liberals did not win that election. “The days of kickback schemes and envelopes stuffed with cash are over,” Treasury Board president John Baird crowed the next year as he introduced the Federal Accountability Act, which created the DPP.

Thirteen years later, Trudeau’s right-hand man allegedly thought it was a good idea to go a-meddling in the DPP’s business to protect a company accused of cartoonish corruption in Libya, and that admitted to over $100,000 in illegal donations to the Liberal party, riding associations and leadership candidates between 2004 and 2011. Why? By Wilson-Raybould’s account: because there was an election coming up in Quebec, because Lavalin might decamp from Montreal to London, because the PM’s seat is in Quebec, and because “we can have the best policy in the world but we need to get re-elected,” as Wilson-Raybould said the PMO told her chief of staff.

Oh yes and jobs. Mostly jobs!

It speaks of a massive, lethal blind spot that never seems to go away: So often, Trudeau’s Liberals confuse not being Conservatives, not being led by Stephen Harper, with virtue. At his Wednesday press conference, Trudeau set out to enumerate some of the “great things that we’ve accomplished together as a team on the justice file.” He pointed first to medical assistance in dying — fair dues, though as with so many advances the Liberals claim as their own, it came at the Supreme Court’s behest. He pointed second to legalizing marijuana — a surprising and positive development, certainly, though it came with outrageously intrusive impaired driving legislation that is sure to be abused by police until the courts find it unconstitutional. And finally pointed to “progressive reforms around criminal justice and sentencing.”

Oof. Ask any justice reform advocate if he thinks the Liberals have lived up to their promises. You’ll get an earful.

Self-congratulation out of the way, Trudeau reminded Canadians twice that the choice they face next year is between him and his Liberals and what is “still very much the party of Stephen Harper.” You would think they had won by 20 points, that Harper was in miserable exile. They won by seven-and-a-half points. The spectre of Harper does not terrify most normal Canadians; nor that of Prime Minister Andrew Scheer. In the long term, it’s likely good news for Trudeau that at least some of his MPs still seem intent on aiming higher than the inherent righteousness of being Liberals in government. In the short term, however, one of them is being a total pain in the neck.

It was but one facet of the post-vote spin battle in Canadian politics after each of the major parties scored a victory in federal byelections Monday.

Mélanie Joly, the Liberal minister of tourism, official languages and La Francophonie, told reporters in Montreal on Monday night that the NDP byelection loss in Outremont marked the end of the huge surge of NDP support in Quebec that lifted the party to its best-ever election result in 2011. Finance Minister Bill Morneau picked up the theme Tuesday on Parliament Hill, when he told reporters: “It looks fairly like there’s no wave to me. It seems like a fairly flat sea.” The NDP’s Alexandre Boulerice bristled at that analysis.

“It’s over. Jagmeet Singh is our leader. He is our leader in the next federal election, and he will be great in Parliament,” said Boulerice. “It’s a huge victory for the NDP. He’s the first federal leader who is racialized who will sit in the House of Commons. We’re very proud of that.”

Article Continued Below

The potential for disappointment in Quebec has cast a shadow on Singh since the 2017 leadership campaign, when questions were raised about how voters would react to a political leader who openly wears the symbols of his faith in a province where a debate over state secularism continues. Singh spoke briefly in French during his 19-minute victory speech in Burnaby on Monday night, pledging to travel to Quebec next week to deliver a “plan” that will unite left-leaning voters across French and English Canada—a goal he described as “the dream of Jack Layton.” Boulerice said Tuesday that Singh will unveil at least part of the party’s platform for voters in Quebec. But the Outremont defeat on Monday is being scrutinized closely because the province’s importance to the NDP began in that riding in 2007, when Thomas Mulcair won the longtime Liberal fortress for the first time. That win is seen as the precursor to Layton’s “orange wave” in 2011, which saw the party surge to 59 seats in the province. Fifteen of the party’s 40 current MPs now hail from Quebec. Farouk Karim, a former NDP press secretary who is from Montreal, contended Tuesday that the “bittersweet” mixture of Singh’s victory in Burnaby South and NDP candidate Julia Sanchez’s loss in Outremont is “not that bitter.” Sanchez took 26 per cent of the vote, Karim noted, arguing that shows solid support in the face of polls that have put voting intentions for the NDP in single digits across the province. That, combined with his view that the Green candidate’s third-place finish shows a strong desire for environmental action, gives the NDP something a solid foundation in Quebec, Karim said. “It’s not orange-wave level, but it’s not catastrophic either. It’s something to build on,” he said. Christian Bourque, executive vice-president of polling firm Léger, isn’t ready to count the New Democrats out in Quebec either. “The NDP is not dead,” Bourque said. “That was something people were watching out for because their national numbers are quite dismal. But, then again, the issue is the popularity of their leader across the country. As of this morning, he still remains the leader of the NDP.” Indeed, speaking to the Star in B.C., Singh was casting ahead to his arrival on Parliament Hill just before the Liberal government tables an election-year budget on March 19. He said the budget will be an opportunity for him to contrast the NDP’s call for Ottawa to directly build hundreds of thousands of affordable housing units, create universal pharmacare and invest heavily in clean technology with the Liberals’ housing plan and ongoing support—including the $4.4-billion purchase of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline—for fossil-fuel industries. “I want to see some commitments in this budget to make people’s lives better, to make the lives of people in Burnaby South better,” Singh said. “So that’s what we’re going to focus on when I get back into the House, to push this government to deliver something meaningful that will help people out right now.” Alex Ballingall is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

The major social policy change formed part of the general election platform for Trudeau’s Liberal Party in 2015, which suggested that “To ensure that we keep marijuana out of the hands of children, and the profits out of the hands of criminals, we will legalise, regulate, and restrict access to marijuana”. Canada is the first major developed nation to have legalised recreational cannabis use. It is now also legal for recreational purposes in ten US states and could be legalised in a number of others this year. At the country level, Uruguay legalised it in 2013 and the move is under consideration elsewhere, with Mexico likely to legalise it soon and New Zealand due to hold a referendum in 2020.

A relatively significant proportion of Canadians are regular cannabis users. According to the 2017 Canadian Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey (CTADS), almost five million or around 15 per cent of Canadians over the age of 15 report smoking cannabis in the previous twelve months, which is the same as the share of the population that report smoking tobacco. Meanwhile, the proportion reporting using at least one other illegal drug excluding cannabis is much lower at just over 3 per cent (Figure 1), with cannabis users being the predominant consumers of other illegal drugs. Given that cannabis use for recreational purposes was illegal at the time of the surveys, the usage numbers could actually be an underestimate.

Figure 1. A similar proportion use cannabis as tobacco in Canada

Source: CTADS, 2017

The amount spent by Canadians on cannabis in 2017 was estimated by Statistics Canada to be around C$5.5 billion (Figure 2), with the black market in recreational use estimated to be around 90 per cent of that, or around C$5 billion (the remainder being legal purchases for medicinal use). This compares with spending of around C$23 billion and C$17 billion on alcohol and tobacco respectively. Statistics Canada estimates that legal consumer spending for cannabis will range between C$0.816 billion and C$1.018 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018 (C$3.85 billion-C$4.8 billion annualised), with around 25 per cent of the market remaining illegal.

Figure 2. Cannabis market is over C$5 billion in Canada

Prior to the legalisation, almost all retail purchases of recreational cannabis are likely to have been made in cash. The basic idea is that, given the illegality, almost all shadow economy (black economy plus grey economy) transactions will be made in cash. The black economy is defined as consisting of illegal activities, (e.g., drugs, prostitution), while the grey economy is defined as otherwise legal activities that are deliberately not recorded in order to avoid or evade taxation (e.g. a builder failing to properly report part of his/her income to the authorities). The fact that cash is an anonymous instrument makes it the payment mechanism of choice for those who do not want their transactions to be recorded and capable of being used in evidence against them. In contrast, almost all electronic forms of payment leave a record.

Tracking developments in the value of cash in circulation can provide some insight into the impact cannabis legalisation has had on the black economy in Canada. Slower growth in the value of cash in circulation or actual declines would support the view that legalisation has hit the black economy. This is because most new legal purchases of cannabis are likely to occur through electronic payment channels e.g. debit/credit cards, similar to general payment trends for other legal items. For example, according to Payments Canada, in 2016 cash accounted for just 31 per cent of Canadian total payment transaction volumes down from 42 per cent in 2011.

Despite cash’s rapidly diminishing role as the payment mode of choice for transactions, both in Canada and the rest of the world, the amount of cash in circulation has actually been rising significantly across most economies over recent decades, particularly since the global financial crisis (GFC). In a forthcoming paper, we suggest declining interest rates and a sharp rise in the size of the grey economy have been key drivers. Exhibit 3 highlights the fact that cash in circulation has been rising rapidly in Canada too. The pace of year-on-year growth has moderated since the legalisation of cannabis, however, from 7.3 per cent in September to 5.3 per cent in both October and November.

Figure 3. Currency in circulation has generally been growing at a solid clip

Source: Bank of Canada

Looking at the actual value of the amount of currency in circulation and the month-on-month changes can provide us with a somewhat clearer picture of the impact of cannabis legalisation though. As Figure 4 highlights, there was quite a sharp fall in the non-seasonally adjusted value of notes in circulation around the time of cannabis legalisation on October 17th with falls of 0.9 per cent (C$0.8 billion) and 0.7 per cent (C$0.6 billion) in the week before and after legalisation respectively. Given that the date of legalisation had been announced in June, one suspects that some of the fall in the week before legalisation may have been driven by consumers holding off normal purchases until they could be made legally a week later. Figure 5 highlights the fact that the value of notes in circulation fell by around 1.4 per cent (C$1.2 billion) in October as a whole, which compares with decent rises every October over the past decade. Meanwhile, looking at Figure 6, which also shows the monthly percentage increases in September and November, it does not appear as though October’s sharp fall was perhaps a response to an uncharacteristically large increase in the previous month, while neither has it unwound with a big rise in November.

Figure 6. Monthly changes in September and November don’t suggest October move was a fluke

Source: Bank of Canada

The movements in cash in circulation around the time of cannabis legalisation would seem to provide early evidence to suggest that Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau’s policy has already been successful in crimping the black economy. The fall in currency in circulation of C$1.2 billion in October was broadly in line with Statistics Canada’s estimate of likely legal spending on cannabis by consumers in 4Q. Clearly, changes in cash in circulation are a rather crude measure of changes in the size of the black economy, but they do provide some evidence in support of the expected move of the majority of cannabis users from the black to the official economy.

According to Statistics Canada, the size of the “underground” economy at the time of the last published estimate in 2016 was around 2.5 per cent of GDP, although its estimate does not include some illegal activities such as drugs and prostitution. Their GDP estimate associated with illegal cannabis in 2016 was approximately 0.2 per cent of GDP and a rough approximation would suggest that the total size of the underground economy could be around C$62 billion or 3 per cent of GDP.

If around one-quarter of the cannabis market remains illegal (as estimated by Statistics Canada for 4Q 2018) or even slightly less over time, the legalisation of cannabis could over time reduce the size of the total underground economy by around 4 or 5 per cent, with possibly some upside if switching to legal outlets for their cannabis purchases also leads some users to buy less of other illegal drugs. Admittedly, there is significant uncertainty around any such estimate given the many assumptions involved. Meanwhile, the legalisation of cannabis is likely to have fuelled a much larger decline in the total size of the black economy.

It wasn’t “rule of law” since she never calls what the government did illegal. She explicitly said it wasn’t. It was “inappropriate.”

Jody Wilson-Raybould appears at the House of Commons Justice Committee on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Wednesday. ( Sean Kilpatrick / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

Nor was it about Justin Trudeau losing the “moral right (or mandate) to govern,” making that sound like a shiny object they hand you when you win an election. Or “clearly” crossing a line (Andrew Coyne) since there’s no clear line. She objected to the “barrage of people hounding me and my staff.” She was impressively firm on stuff like the “constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence.” Yet also a bit abstract and intellectual. It’s Trudeau who said he’s motivated by job loss and the impacts on people. And she agreed it was OK to raise job issues, though once she’d been damn clear about her decision they should’ve laid off. Yet why wouldn’t they continue pressing if grave matters are involved, and not just “in the early stages?” Sheer persistence is often what gets things done — sometimes it takes generations. I don’t even think the “political” concerns Trudeau voiced were illegitimate. You must be elected to achieve what you believe — on, say, climate change, even if it’s in pathetically limited ways. If the Tories win next fall, even that’ll be undone. If you care about jobs/climate, then you have to win. No one’s suggested Trudeau’s political motive is mere money or power.

Article Continued Below

That’s why I think Wilson-Raybould could’ve gone either way on rule of law, and that other things are involved. Near the end of her statement, she said “Crown-Indigenous relations” in Canada “includes a history of the rule of law not being respected” and that “foundational value” wasn’t always “upheld.” So there it is: she’s simultaneously striking a blow on behalf of Indigenous peoples. Suddenly it’s no longer abstract, it’s very concrete. She’s had it with liberal/Liberal well-intentioned crap. SNC-Lavalin gets fast action from the law, we get delays. She found an infuriatingly calm, Canadian way of detonating a deeply laid bomb that’s been ticking since the arrival of European settlers. It’s key that she’s actually part of two nations. She’d rather not choose (she still calls Canada “the greatest country in the world”) but if she must separate from one, another remains. That isn’t unique, in a Canada that includes Quebec. When Lucien Bouchard bolted from federal Tories after the Meech Lake fiasco in 1992, he went home to Quebec, created a separatist party (the Bloc), and became premier of his own “nation,” Quebec. She doesn’t have to become that classic Western figure: the isolated, principled individual. Less evident I think is the feminist context. “It was hard not to watch and wince,” wrote Liz Renzetti. It was mostly guys who came at her persistently, and they came at her in a guy way. The last straw before she quit was Trudeau saying, “Her presence in cabinet speaks for itself.” Men speaking for women. The weird thing is Trudeau was probably the best chance for advancing both Indigenous rights and feminism in a conventional politician. I don’t think he’s lying when he professes them. But they’re hard to deliver in the context of a single lifetime that’s conditioned by your own and your society’s past, and an electoral politics riddled with garbage and debris like first-past-the-post, big corporate donors and powerful voting blocs. I don’t think this mess was unavoidable but it would’ve taken very astute planning, plus lots of luck.

You could almost see Wilson-Raybould cringe at being embraced by Tories and NDPers on the committee. I exclude Conservative Lisa Raitt, who put the Barbara Frum question — Are you bitter? — and who gets a pass because of her magnificent humanity in getting a drunken Elizabeth May offstage years go. If she and Wilson-Raybould got together and formed a party, I’d probably vote for them. So I think it’s murky but I’m more with her than with them. Still, it’s close. Maybe 45 per cent with them, 55 per cent with her. It was political psycho-socio-drama of the most earnest, worthwhile sort. Not many things are more crucial than jobs and who governs, but the fights for Indigenous restitution and women’s equality are among them, if you must choose, as sometimes you must.

177,Empty,2019-02-25T11:30:38Z,"Two women behind news conference have clear ties to Beijing, one of them asserting there are no human-rights problems in China","The chief financial officer of Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei had barely been arrested last December — triggering a diplomatic scrap of historic scale between China and Canada — when an obscure B.C.-based group called an unusual Vancouver press conference.

With most Canadians still digesting the news of Meng Wanzhou’s detention, and the U.S. extradition request behind it, the United Association of Women and Children of Canada appeared before the cameras to demand the executive’s immediate release.

“Canada should stay out of it,” a spokeswoman declared in Mandarin, her translated comments generating a number of stories in local media. “This is supposed to be a serious matter but looks like a joke between the two countries.”

Leaders of the United Association insisted they had no connection to the Chinese government, which had been making similar pronouncements.

But a closer look reveals a more complicated story, one that seems to point to Beijing’s long reach into Canadian affairs.

Behind the event were two women with clear ties to China, generous donations to political parties here and, in one case, a colourful history in Canadian law and municipal politics.

Lawyer Hong Guo boasts that she was appointed as a foreign legal specialist by the the People’s Republic, and while running for mayor of Richmond, B.C. last year insisted “there is no human rights abuse in China.”

All but a tiny handful of Canadians of Chinese heritage are here because they do not wish to be ruled or controlled by the CCP

Before immigrating to Canada, association founder Han Dongmei launched her investment fund in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, a Communist mecca usually reserved for august party and state functions. Her company contributed $100,000 to the B.C. Liberal party while it was still in government.

Han could not be reached for comment. Guo did not respond to telephone messages and emailed questions about the Meng event and possible co-ordination with Chinese officials. China’s embassy also did not answer emailed questions.

There is no direct evidence the women were acting at the behest of Beijing, or even just trying to curry favour with it for business reasons.

But there is mounting concern generally about China’s influence campaign in countries like Canada, much of it executed through the United Front Work Department, a secretive offshoot of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) known to work with ethnic Chinese organizations overseas.

“Establishing fake civil society NGOs is an established modus operandi” of the United Front, said Charles Burton, a Brock University professor and former Canadian diplomat in Beijing.

According to its website, the Vancouver-based United Association of Women and Children has 1,500 members, branches in several provinces and a focus on equal treatment and work opportunities for women — but it lists no contact information.

Two B.C. leaders of the non-profit sector dedicated to helping women in business — Laurel Douglas of the Women’s Enterprise Centre and Lisa Niemetscheck of WebAlliance — told the National Post they had never heard of it.

The Chinese media in China, they have very much freedom, to talk and to criticize and to make suggestions

The group seems to have “all the hallmarks” of a front organization to further Beijing’s interests, says Jonathan Manthorpe, whose just-published book, Claws of the Panda, documents China’s influence campaign here.

In the midst of a “political offensive by the Beijing regime,” he cautioned, people should remember that such organizations do not represent Chinese-Canadians.

“All but a tiny handful of Canadians of Chinese heritage are here because they do not wish to be ruled or controlled by the CCP,” said Manthorpe.

The group’s speakers, Guo in English and Han in Mandarin, told the news conference Canada was being used by the U.S. to attack Huawei and China, that Canadian courts had no jurisdiction over a Chinese citizen like Meng and Canada was needlessly undermining relations between the two countries.

“Their statement precisely echoes the Chinese Government’s official response to Meng Wanzhou’s arrest,” notes Burton, also a senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute.

As the CBC, CTV, local Richmond News and others reported those comments, they cited the group’s denial of links to China’s government.

What was less clear, though, is the personal ties both spokeswomen have to their home country’s power centres.

Guo immigrated from China in 1993, obtained a Master’s degree from the University of Regina and then a law degree from the University of Windsor. Her Richmond-based law firm specializes in “Sino-Canadian commercial transactions.”

From 2002 to 2005, her website says, she acted as a “foreign legal specialist” for China, appointed by the 35-member state council of the People’s Republic — the country’s chief administrative authority.

But it was when Guo decided to run for mayor in Richmond last year, campaigning in part on strengthening ties with China, that her perspective on the country came startlingly into focus.

Asked by The Breaker news website about China’s human-rights record, she insisted that reports of rights abuses were an invention of foreign media like the New York Times and CBC.

“I think China has lots of freedom of speech,” she told the site. “The Chinese media in China, they have very much freedom, to talk and to criticize and to make suggestions.”

The Guo election campaign itself, conducted almost entirely in Mandarin, also raised eyebrows.

“Only Chinese people can understand what Chinese people want,” said a video played at the launch, the Richmond News reported. Chinese-Canadians should “vote for Chinese candidates to speak on our behalf,” Guo said in a speech, before finishing in fourth place.

Canada should stay out of it. This is supposed to be a serious matter but looks like a joke between the two countries

She was likely not helped by disciplinary charges from the Law Society of British Columbia that alleged, among other breaches, that she failed to adequately safeguard trust accounts — allowing for a $7.5 million employee theft.

Cheuk Kwan, spokesman for the Toronto Association for Democracy in China, said he does not know Guo, but noted generally that Beijing seems to be encouraging immigrants from mainland China to run for office here, even if sometimes “they have no understanding of how democracy works in the Canadian context.”

Han appears to have immigrated in the last five years or so, heading up a firm called Huamulan Developments Inc. with an apparent goal to build student housing. According to biographies on a number of Chinese-language websites, the company was launched nine years ago in the Great Hall of the People, a landmark on Beijing’s Tianamen Square that, in the words of a government account, has hosted many “earth-shaking historical events.”

That same year, the firm organized a celebration of the 60th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic, the bios say.

There is little visible sign of Huamulan’s work in Canada, though it has held events attended by representatives of Vancouver’s Chinese consulate, and local politicians — with Han performing her own songs at some.

Like its founder, Huamulan has also been an active political donor. Its three contributions to the B.C. Liberal Party from 2015 to 2017 — when the Liberals were voted out of power — totaled $99,000, among the largest corporate gifts recorded by Elections B.C.

A donor with Han’s name gave $5,800 to the federal Conservatives and $2,400 to the Liberals between 2014 and 2016, according to Elections Canada.

Guo talks on her website of making contacts with various Canadian politicians, and is even pictured online with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Her one donation, $1,500 in 2017, was to the federal Liberal riding association of MP Geng Tan, a mainland China immigrant, though his seat is in another province. Tan once headed the Chinese Students and Scholars Association at the University of Toronto, an organization believed to report directly to the United Front.

As they faced the TV cameras at their December news conference, the two women had a clear message for those politicians they had earlier courted and funded. Even if, as they said, Beijing played no part in the event, it would likely have approved.

“The Chinese people would like to keep the good relationship to expand the business with Canada,” said Guo, according to a CTV report. “But this matter will damage that because people understand Canada is doing something for the benefit of America.”

178,Empty,2019-02-26T04:55:16Z,"With most polls reporting, Singh took Burnaby South with more than 38% of the vote. Had he lost, he would almost certainly have faced demands to resign as leader","OTTAWA — Jagmeet Singh tightened his shaky grip on the reins of the NDP Monday by winning a do-or-die federal byelection in British Columbia.

But the challenge he now faces in reviving the party’s flagging fortunes in time for this fall’s national election was underscored by the NDP’s simultaneous loss to the Liberals in Outremont, the Montreal riding that served as a launching pad for the orange wave that swept Quebec in 2011.

With most polls reporting, Singh captured Burnaby South with more than 38 per cent of the vote, ahead of the Liberal contender with 26 per cent and the Conservative with 22 per cent.

Had he lost, Singh would almost certainly have faced demands to resign as leader. Going into Monday’s byelection, many New Democrats — including Singh’s predecessor, Tom Mulcair — had questioned how Singh could lead the party in the October federal election if he couldn’t win a seat for himself.

However, the loss of Outremont cast a pall over Singh’s victory celebration.

Lawyer Rachel Bendayan reclaimed the riding for the Liberals with 42 per cent of the vote, even as the governing party struggles with the fallout from allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office improperly pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to halt criminal proceedings against Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

The NDP’s Julia Sanchez captured 27 per cent.

Outremont was a longtime Liberal stronghold until 2007, when Mulcair scored a byelection upset for the NDP, creating a beachhead for the party in Quebec, from which it eventually went on to sweep the province in 2011 and vault into official Opposition status for the first time in party history.

Since those heady days, the party has fallen back to its traditional third-party status. It won just 44 seats in the 2015 election, 16 of them in Quebec. Monday’s loss of Outremont gives credence to polls that suggest the party risks being wiped out altogether in Quebec this fall.

Vancouver NDP MP Jenny Kwan acknowledged the loss of Outremont was “a disappointment.”

“What we’re going to do, of course, is learn from this experience and then we’re going to redouble our efforts to ensure that the people of Quebec know we are there for them,” she said at Singh’s victory party.

In a third byelection Monday, the Conservatives handily hung on to the Ontario riding of York-Simcoe, which had been held since 2004 by former Conservative cabinet minister Peter Van Loan. Scot Davidson took 53 per cent of the vote for the Tories, well ahead of Liberal Shaun Tanaka with 30 per cent.

There were, however, a couple of potentially bad omens for the Conservatives in Monday’s results.

The breakaway People’s Party of Canada, created last summer by one-time Tory leadership contender Maxime Bernier, faced its first electoral test in the byelections and results suggest it could be a spoiler that deprives the Conservatives of victory in tight contests come the fall.

While the fledgling party won less than two per cent of the vote in Outremont and York-Simcoe, it did surprisingly well in Burnaby South, where Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson won more than 11 per cent of the vote after running on a “Canadians first” campaign that was denounced as anti-immigration and racist by some supporters of rival candidates.

And in Outremont, the Conservative candidate ran a distant fifth with just over six per cent of the vote, behind the Liberals, NDP, Greens, and Bloc Quebecois.

The Greens, who’ve watched their vote share increase in a number of other recent byelection contests, came third in Outremont with some 13 per cent of the vote — up 10 points from the 2015 election. However, the party’s vote share was down slightly in York-Simcoe, at less than three per cent. The Greens did not run a candidate in Burnaby South, as a courtesy to Singh.

Singh’s win was all the sweeter for the fact that Burnaby South was not a natural home or a safe seat for a former Ontario provincial politician. New Democrat Kennedy Stewart, now mayor of Vancouver, won the riding by just over 500 votes ahead of the Liberals in 2015.

His victory will give Singh some much-needed visibility in the House of Commons in the run-up to the general election and will help put to rest grumbling within NDP ranks about his underwhelming performance since being chosen leader almost 18 months ago.

What we’re going to do, of course, is learn from this experience

But his problems go well beyond his low profile on the main stage of federal politics.

Singh has faced criticism about his seeming unfamiliarity with federal issues and his handling of internal caucus discipline.

Under his leadership, the NDP has plunged to its lowest standings in public opinion polls since 2000, when it won just 13 seats. The party is mired in debt and its fundraising results have been dismal. As well, at least 11 of the 44 MPs who won seats for the party in 2015 have announced they won’t seek re-election this fall.

While the Liberals could celebrate victory in Outremont, the party’s vote share dropped by about seven percentage points in each of the other two byelections — at least in part likely due to the fallout from the SNC-Lavalin affair.

In Burnaby South, the ruling party was likely also hurt by the fact that it dumped its original candidate after she identified Singh as being of “Indian descent” and contrasted herself as the “only” Chinese candidate in a riding with a large Chinese-Canadian population.

179,Empty,2019-02-28T01:54:12Z,'Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this great nation now that Canadians know what he has done',"Immediately after the conclusion of former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould’s testimony on the SNC-Lavalin scandal before the House of Commons justice committee Wednesday, Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer released this statement:

“Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this great nation now that Canadians know what he has done. That is why I am calling on Justin Trudeau to resign. Further, the RCMP must immediately open an investigation – if it has not already done so – into the numerous examples of obstruction of justice the former Attorney General detailed in her testimony.

“The testimony Canadians have just heard from the former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould tells the story of a Prime Minister who has lost the moral authority to govern. A Prime Minister who allows his partisan political motivations to overrule his duty to uphold the rule of law. A Prime Minister who doesn’t know where the Liberal Party ends and where the Government of Canada begins. And a Prime Minister who has allowed a systemic culture of corruption to take root in his office and those of his most senior cabinet and public service colleagues.

“I listened carefully to the testimony of the former Attorney General, and like Canadians, I was sickened and appalled by her story of inappropriate, and frankly illegal pressure brought to bear on her by the highest officials of Justin Trudeau’s government. All to let a Liberal-connected corporation off the hook on corruption charges.

“Before Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, Canadians knew Justin Trudeau had engineered an unwanted, sustained, and co-ordinated attempt to get Ms. Wilson-Raybould to change her mind and stop the criminal trial of SNC-Lavalin. Today, thanks to Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, we now know just how intense those efforts were: ten meetings and ten phone calls involving eleven senior government officials relentlessly targeting Ms. Wilson-Raybould over a four month period – with the sole objective of bullying her into bending the law to benefit a well-connected corporation.

“The details are as shocking as they are corrupt: multiple veiled threats to her job if she didn’t bow to their demands. Urgings to consider the consequences on election results and shareholder value above judicial due process. And reminders from Justin Trudeau to his Attorney General about his own electoral prospects should she allow SNC-Lavalin’s trial to proceed.

“As Ms. Wilson-Raybould has so clearly articulated, the people Canadians entrusted to protect the integrity of our very nation were instead only protecting themselves and their friends.

“Mr. Trudeau can no longer, in good standing and with a clear conscience, lead this great nation.

“Canada should be a country where we are all equal under the law. Where nobody – regardless of wealth, status, or political connections – is above the law. I believe we can be that country again.”",Andrew Scheer’s full statement calling for Justin Trudeau’s resignation over SNC-Lavalin scandal,Nationalpost.com,https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/andrew-scheers-full-statement-calling-for-justin-trudeaus-resignation-over-snc-lavalin-scandal

Opposition leader Scheer issued a statement calling for Trudeau’s resignation shortly after Wilson-Raybould delivered her testimony to the House of Commons.

“Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this great nation now that Canadians know what he has done,” Scheer wrote.

“That is why I am calling on Justin Trudeau to resign,” he continued. “Further, the RCMP must immediately open an investigation – if it has not already done so – into the numerous examples of obstruction of justice the former Attorney General detailed in her testimony.”

The Toronto Sun agreed on Wednesday that the SNC-Lavalin case is now a matter for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

“After the first minute of Jody Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, it was already clear that this was a colossal bombshell,” the Sun editorialized, presenting the former justice minister’s opening statement as a concise summary of the case:

She began her opening remarks: “For a period of approximately four months between September and December 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the Attorney General of Canada in an inappropriate effort to secure a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with SNC-Lavalin. “These events involved 11 people (excluding myself and my political staff) – from the Prime Minister’s Office, the Privy Council Office, and the Office of the Minister of Finance. This included in-person conversations, telephone calls, emails, and text messages. There were approximately 10 phone calls and 10 meetings specifically about SNC-Lavalin that I and/or my staff was a part of.” That in itself was damning enough. Then Wilson-Raybould went on in detail to explain how she had repeatedly told these senior figures to not pressure her, that she had made up her mind, and that she thought the pressure was inappropriate. But they kept on doing it.

Wilson-Raybould testified that there was a “barrage of people hounding me and my staff” to avoid a criminal trial for SNC-Lavalin, including Prime Minister Trudeau and his senior aides. She said these people not only warned her about the dire consequences of a prosecution, including jobs lost for SNC-Lavalin employees and political fallout for the Liberal Party, but issued “veiled threats if a deferred prosecution agreement was not made available to SNC.”

Wilson-Raybould said she was ultimately pushed out of her position to make room for a more pliable justice minister. She said SNC-Lavalin was made the first order of business for her successor, David Lametti, in one of his first meetings with Trudeau.

SNC-Lavalin, one of the largest engineering firms in the world, was investigated for fraud and corruption due to its business practices in Libya, which was one of the company’s largest clients under dictator Muammar Qaddafi. The company was accused of paying millions of dollars in bribes to secure business deals during the ten years before Qaddafi was overthrown in 2011. The company argues the wrongdoing was entirely the work of a single rogue executive named Riadh Ben Aissa.

If SNC-Lavalin as a whole is convicted on corruption charges, the company would be banned from bidding on Canadian federal contracts for ten years. Trudeau has publicly worried such a penalty could severely damage the company and eliminate a large number of jobs. He denies improperly pressuring Wilson-Raybould to avoid prosecution.

Trudeau’s principal secretary, Gerald Butts, resigned over the scandal two weeks ago, claiming he was innocent of wrongdoing but did not wish to bring further negative attention to the prime minister’s office.

Former Ontario Attorney General Michael Bryant, director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, told the Globe and Mail on Thursday the testimony from Wilson-Raybould “disclosed a constitutional crisis far worse than what I envisioned.”

“She says it was a bald attempt by the Prime Minister to exercise his cabinet-making power over her quasi-judicial authority. I am personally very familiar with the tactic, but have never seen evidence of it used on an attorney-general in this brazen, reckless fashion,” he said.

Another former attorney general, Geoff Plant, found it deeply “problematic” that pressure against Wilson-Raybould continued after she clearly stated she did not support a deferred prosecution agreement for SNC-Lavalin.

“This observation crosses the line between inquiries that relate to the public interest, which are legitimate, and partisan political considerations, which are not. She was right to say that this was inappropriate. The fact that this consideration was raised again and again is very disturbing,” he said, citing the importance of maintaining political independence for prosecutors.

Trudeau’s defenders essentially argue his concerns about crippling the huge engineering company with a corruption prosecution were valid, and while he and his aides may have vigorously communicated that argument to the justice minister, their actions came up short of improper political interference.

Scheer completely rejected that reasoning in his statement on Wednesday, saying Trudeau has “lost the moral authority to govern.”

Regarding Trudeau, he said:

A Prime Minister who allows his partisan political motivations to overrule his duty to uphold the rule of law. A Prime Minister who doesn’t know where the Liberal Party ends and where the Government of Canada begins. And a Prime Minister who has allowed a systemic culture of corruption to take root in his office and those of his most senior cabinet and public service colleagues.

“As Ms. Wilson-Raybould has so clearly articulated, the people Canadians entrusted to protect the integrity of our very nation were instead only protecting themselves and their friends. Mr. Trudeau can no longer, in good standing and with a clear conscience, lead this great nation,” he contended.

Writing at Maclean’s on Wednesday, Paul Wells called Trudeau a “moral catastrophe” and said he was running a “sickeningly smug protection racket” for the Liberal Party’s allies.

“If a company can rewrite the Criminal Code to get out of a trial whose start date was set before the legislation was drafted, all because a doomed Quebec government has its appointment with the voter, then which excesses are not permitted, under the same justification?” he asked, referring to the elections looming when the SNC-Lavalin scandal began.

Trudeau said on Wednesday that he has no intention of resigning and suggested voters should have the final judgment on his actions in the October election.

“There will be a clear choice to be made between the Liberal Party, this government that … has consistently stood up for Canadian jobs, consistently defended Canadian jobs while defending our institutions and the independence of our judiciary,” he said, as quoted by the Calgary Herald. He continued, “And on the other hand there is a choice of the party that is still very much the party of Stephen Harper, that continues to attack, to divide, to play politics with big issues and (thinks) the best way to create economic growth is still to give advantages to the wealthiest.”

Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee that she had confronted Trudeau over what she said were persistent efforts by officials to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc evade trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials. “I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,” Trudeau told a televised news conference in Montreal.

Preliminary results showed Jagmeet Singh won a special election to fill an empty seat in the parliamentary constituency of Burnaby-South, in the Pacific province of British Columbia.

Singh captured just under 40 percent of the vote.

A practicing Sikh, Singh made headlines in October 2017 when he became the first person from an ethnic minority to be elected leader of a major Canadian political party. But he has failed to lift the New Democratic Party (NDP), which trails its rivals badly.

The NDP and the Liberals - who compete for the same center-left segment of the electorate - will face each other in a federal election this October. The worse the New Democrats do, the better Trudeau’s chances become.

“This staves off all the talk that Singh would have to quit ... at least for the moment he is vindicated,” said Richard Johnston, a political science professor at the University of British Columbia.

Johnston said in a phone interview that Singh would still need to overcome unhappiness with his leadership.

Both Craft and her husband are major supporters of President Donald Trump.

The pick gives the former Republican commentator Max Boot major concerns that the Trump administration will once again become a laughingstock on the world stage.

Writing in the Washington Post, Boot points out that historically that position was filled by the major statesmen of their time — major historical figures including Henry Cabot Lodge and Adlai Stevenson. He notes that the President’s first pick, Nikki Haley, was a continuation of that legacy. “She was a former governor who has been talked about as a possible presidential contender, and she acquitted herself admirably at the United Nations,” Boot writes.

Her initial replacement, Heather Nauert, did not have an equally relevant resume. Nauert had previously worked at Fox News.

Craft is even more problematic, argues Boot.

“Kelly Knight Craft was chosen to be U.S. ambassador to Canada, and now to the United Nations, because she and her third husband, the billionaire coal baron Joe Craft, are mega MAGA-donors,” he writes.

“According to The Post, they gave ‘about $1.5 million to GOP candidates in 2016, including $270,800 to Trump’s campaign committee or his joint fundraising committee with the Republican National Committee.'”

He observes that Craft appears to be politically connected to the Trumps and the Republican leadership. She previously served as ambassador to Canada.

“Perhaps just as important from this president’s perspective, they are also ‘repeat, high-paying customers at Trump’s hotel in Washington.’ Craft’s other recommendation is that, as a Kentucky native, she is a supporter of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and is said to be friends with McConnell’s wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.”

“If confirmed, Craft will arrive at the United Nations as a laughingstock — just like her boss,” writes Boot, who left the Republican Party due to their embrace of President Donald Trump.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The leader of Canada's main opposition party demanded on Wednesday that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau quit after a former justice minister said government officials inappropriately pressured her to help a major firm avoid a bribery trial.

The allegations by Jody Wilson-Raybould dramatically deepened the biggest crisis of Trudeau's tenure just months ahead of an October election in which his Liberals face a tough fight.

Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee that she had confronted Trudeau over what she called inappropriate pressure to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc evade a corruption trial.

Andrew Scheer, leader of the official opposition Conservative Party, demanded the resignation of what he called a disgraced prime minister.

""He can no longer, with a clear conscience, continue to lead this nation,"" Scheer told reporters, calling for police to immediately probe the matter. Trudeau is due to address reporters later on Wednesday.

After 16 months without a seat in the Commons — and dire warnings from within his own party that he'd either win the seat or find himself looking for another job — the NDP leader defied his critics and the pundits by capturing Burnaby South.

""To Burnaby South, thank you for trusting me to be your member of Parliament,"" a jubilant Singh told the crowd at his election headquarters.

Singh led throughout the night over his main rivals, Conservative candidate Jay Shin and the Liberals' Richard Lee.

Some will still suggest that Lee, a long-time provincial politician, had too much ground to make up after the Liberals original choice was forced to resign mid-campaign after making remarks in Mandarin about Singh's ethnicity that were considered offensive.

Some Liberals even suggested, privately, that a Singh victory wouldn't be such a bad thing for them given his uneven performance as leader, and their hopes of repeating their success poaching NDP supporters in 2015.

Whatever the reason, Singh is now poised to take a seat in the House of Commons — poised, finally, to begin shifting the discussion away from his embattled leadership to the issues the party intends to champion in the few months remaining before the fall general election: affordable housing, pharmacare and real action to combat climate change.

'National stage'

""With this win, people will get to see a progressive alternative to Justin Trudeau,"" said James Smith, Singh's campaign spokesperson. ""Conservatives won't push for more affordable housing, or for universal pharmacare. Jagmeet gets a chance now to stand up for those values on the national stage.""

That's the good news for the NDP. Good news for the party these days, however, always seems to come mixed with the bad.

In this case, New Democrats have to balance Singh's personal win against the loss of Outremont, the closest thing the party had to a fortress in Quebec. The Liberals resoundingly reclaimed the Montreal riding held by Singh's predecessor, Tom Mulcair, for the past decade.

Mulcair's 2007 byelection win gave the New Democrats a beachhead in Quebec. It was only the second time a New Democrat had ever won a seat in the province.

Four years later, Outremont became the epicentre of the so-called Orange Wave that swept across Quebec, giving the NDP nearly 60 seats there and vaulting it into the official opposition in Ottawa for the only time in its history.

Still, Monday's result in Outremont was not unexpected. For the Liberals, winning in Burnaby South would have been significant — more of an indication of momentum, especially in the wake of two weeks of negative media coverage from the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Watch as Singh addresses supporters after his byelection win:

Federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has claimed victory in the Burnaby South byelection, finally allowing him to lead his party from within the House of Commons. 7:03

In Quebec, opinion polls have unblinkingly recorded the decline in NDP support ever since Singh became leader. As it stands, the party might have trouble holding a single one of its 16 — make that 15 — seats in the province after Monday night.

Battle for momentum

Liberals insist the win in Outremont is a good omen for them, a clear indication that they are on track to increase their seats in a province that may well be decisive to their chances of winning a second term.

Outremont is also the third byelection in which the Trudeau Liberals have taken an opposition seat, joining Lac Saint Jean, Que., and South Surrey-White Rock, B.C. Both had been held by Conservatives.

The Conservatives, as expected, won handily in the Ontario riding of York—Simcoe. And they did so despite the presence of candidates from Maxime Bernier's maverick People's Party of Canada.

The PPC did surprisingly well in Burnaby South. The party's candidate took about 11 per cent of the vote there, most of it from the Conservatives. In the other two races, Bernier's candidates barely registered.

What does that mean? Possibly very little. But Conservatives will have to consider the potential impact of vote-splitting with the People's Party this fall in swing ridings, where even a small amount of vote bleeding just might mean the difference between them and the Liberals.

But the big story of the night remains Burnaby South.

Watch as Singh calls for change after his byelection win:

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh says Canada can make different choices and get better results 1:59

The prevailing wisdom was that Singh would have a tough time winning the riding for any number of reasons.

Start with the results in 2015, when the NDP won Burnaby South by fewer than 600 votes. Add in the fact that Singh's political home, until recently, was halfway across the country in Ontario. His political experience was based on his time in provincial politics there.

The polls have been similarly unkind since he became leader in October 2017. NDP fortunes took a tumble with each Singh stumble, whether it was not knowing the party's position on a gun control bill or his decision to boot MP Erin Weir from caucus after complaints that he made women feel uncomfortable.

The party's fundraising has also been weak, with the NDP lagging far behind the other two major parties. And just to finish the pile-on, let's observe that fully a quarter of the current NDP caucus isn't running again.

That made Burnaby South an interesting choice for a rookie leader who had what appeared to be everything to lose in this race.

But it proved to be a good laboratory for testing the tolerance of progressive voters in one of this country's most diverse ridings. Half of the people who live there were born outside Canada.

It's also exactly the kind of riding Justin Trudeau has cultivated, said Shachi Kurl, executive director of the polling firm Angus Reid Institute, with tax hikes on the rich, the tax-free child care benefit and promises of new money for infrastructure.

""This is middle-class ground zero, middle-class central,"" said Kurl. ""This will be a good assessment of whether people think Justin Trudeau's delivering or not.""

Three byelections. Three winners from three different parties. For the candidates, an exciting conclusion to three exhausting campaigns. And the winners, at least, will get to do it all over again in just a few months' time.

Attempting to work around a lack of pipelines, the provincial government intends to spend $3.7 billion to lease 4,400 oil tank cars and locomotives to export more Canadian tar sands oil to the U.S. The announcement came just days after the latest oil train derailment and spill in Manitoba, Canada.

Alberta Premier Rachel Notley addressed concerns about safety regarding the oil trains.

“We are treating the safety of these rail cars as though they are traveling through our own backyards,” Notley said. “The cars we will be using will be the safest cars on the tracks. They include the safest technology and meet the highest standards including all recent changes to safety standards.”

New regulations enacted after the 2013 oil train disaster killed 47 in Lac-Mégantic, Quebec, require oil and rail companies to use newer rail cars to move oil. And while these new tank cars — known as DOT-117 and 117Rs — are more robust than the older tank cars involved in the deadly incident, they aren't immune to the forces of a train derailment.

In the past year, two Canadian oil trains consisting of these “safest” tank cars have derailed and resulted in large oil spills. In June 2018, a train from Canada derailed and spilled 230,000 gallons of oil into floodwaters in Iowa.

The most recent oil train crash, which occurred on a ranch in Manitoba on February 16, involved 37 derailed tank cars. No details have been released on the amount of oil spilled, but aerial photos show streams of dark black oil leaking from the damaged tank cars.

While Premier Notley claims that these new rail cars are the safest, that doesn't mean they will survive a derailment intact. Oil trains will continue to derail and cause large fires and spills.

Drone footage shows an overhead view of the oil spill on a western Manitoba ranch caused by a train derailment.

Global News will have an update from rancher Jayme Corr, Wednesday.

Oil-By-Rail Becomes an Election Issue

Not everyone is welcoming Alberta’s plans to get into the oil-by-rail business, which will likely become an issue in the upcoming election. The announcement was criticized by Jason Kenney, leader of Alberta's Official Opposition United Conservative Party, who told the CBC that, “If elected, a United Conservative government will subject today's [oil-by-rail] proposal to that value-for-money review.”

While Notley claims that the Alberta government will make over $2 billion in revenue from the investment, Kenney is skeptical. He says the deal is something Canadian taxpayers “cannot afford” and called it “corporate welfare.”

The skepticism about the deal's finances comes after recent reports that Canada likely overpaid in purchasing the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project when Kinder Morgan couldn't find a buyer — another Canadian government effort to support the money-losing tar sands industry.

Dueling Policies Mean Economics Not Working for Oil-By-Rail

Oil-by-rail can cost as much as $15 more a barrel for Canadian producers to transport the oil to the U.S. Gulf Coast compared to pipelines. It only makes economic sense for oil producers to use rail when the discount for Western Canadian Select (WCS, Canadian) oil versus West Texas Intermediate (WTI, American) oil is more that $15.

In late 2018, that discount was as high as $50 per barrel, which led Canadian producers to export a record 354,000 barrels of oil per day by rail in December. However, the steep discounts for WCS oil meant the Alberta tar sands industry was losing money on all of the oil it sold.

This situation led to Premier Notley announcing mandatory oil production cuts in early December, which very effectively decreased the discount for WCS oil. However, with the discount below $15, many producers are choosing to no longer use trains to move oil because it is no longer economically viable.

In mid-February, the CEO of oil producer Suncor commented on this unintended consequence of the production cuts.

“The rail economics are seriously damaged,” said Suncor CEO Steve Williams. “A lot of the rail movements are stopping or have stopped.”

Yet the Alberta government is now investing in moving oil by rail.

Whether or not Canadian government efforts to save the struggling tar sands industry succeed, the risks of moving oil-by-rail are well known.

The latest oil train derailment and spill demonstrate a maxim among oil spill responders: It's not a question of if the next oil spill happens but when. That would also seem to apply as more Canadian oil moves by rail and more oil spills inevitably occur.

While the oil may be moving in the “safest” rail cars — those cars are by no means safe.

As the 45th Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, begins Wednesday, a look at the event’s sponsors shows a collection of outside spending groups, prominent conservative activist organizations, think tanks and media outlets.

A who’s-who of conservative money networks, many sponsors are promoted in CPAC’s’ panels and events, and often onstage rubbing elbows with the influencers currently driving grassroots conservative politics.

CPAC touts itself as “the birthplace of modern conservatism,” and has long been observed for the pulse of the conservative movement. President Donald Trump’s appearances at the event before his presidential bid have been credited by some for raising his profile among movement conservatives in the years before the 2016 Republican primary.

Behind CPAC is the American Conservative Union a conservative lobbying organization and outside spending group which organizes the event. In the last election cycle, ACU spent $258,000 in support of Republican candidates, according to data tracked by the Center for Responsive Politics.

2018 was ACU’s biggest year for lobbying since 2005. Last year the group spent $540,000 on lobbying, advocating for bills ranging from net neutrality, pro-sugar industry regulation, budget cuts and sentencing reform.

ACU’s going rate for a sponsorship buy-in at CPAC costs thousands of dollars. The lowest level of sponsorship, a “participating sponsor,” costs $7,000, with the highest level, a “platinum sponsor,” running at $250,000.

Sponsorship not only buys organizations extensive promotion at the event, but many sponsors have their own panels, speakers and events at CPAC. As one “ACU insider” told the Daily Beast last year: “That’s one of the bigger benefits of sponsorship… the higher you sponsor, the higher the chances your speaker and your panel topic will happen at CPAC.”

Yet the subject of panels and events is reached through “consensus” by CPAC’s organizers and not by sponsors, according to Ian Walters, ACU’s communications director. Planning committees in the run-up to the event, which can include people affiliated with sponsors, plan the event’s schedule before sponsors are ultimately decided, Walters said. He added that it would be inaccurate to say sponsors have any limiting influence on potential events or panels.

“It’s about as public and transparent a process as there can be,” Walters said.

This year, CPAC has two “platinum sponsors” spending $250,000. One is Liberty HealthShare, a health care cost-sharing company. The other is Dragging Canoe – Pigeon Forge.

Dragging Canoe is the only sponsor without a hyperlink to its website on CPAC’s sponsors page. It is an upcoming “a second-amendment themed entertainment venue and restaurant in Pigeon Forge” slated to open in 2020, according to Walters. CPAC was approached by Dragging Canoe’s owners last year for a potential sponsorship.

Google searches provide no information about the company. A Dragging Canoe, LLC was registered as a business with the Tennessee Secretary of State last November and lists a for-sale empty building in Maryville, Tennessee as its address. Despite being an up-and-coming business, Dragging Canoe is sponsoring CPAC’s $250 a ticket “Ronald Reagan Dinner and Reception” on Friday night.

The next level of sponsorship at CPAC, “presenting sponsors” who spent $125,000, include the National Rifle Association, the GOP, and Liberty, a Japanese cryptocurrency start-up.

The event, in turn, has multiple panels on the second amendment and gun control, including a speech by NRA president and Iran-Contra figure Lt. Col. Oliver North. The co-founder of Liberty, Jikido “Jay” Aeba of the Japanese Conservative Union, will participate in a panel about cryptocurrency.

While not all events and speakers represent sponsors, those that do have extensive real estate in CPAC’s agenda. The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank, spent $60,000 to sponsor the event. A number of Heritage Foundation staff are to appear on stage throughout the week, and the think tank will host events on censorship of conservatives and election security.

The Center for Security Policy, another think tank and longtime sponsor, spent $12,000 to sponsor CPAC this year. CSP has long been criticized as Islamophobic, and has promulgated conspiracy theories about Muslims, including an impending Sharia take-over of the United States and the infiltration of the U.S. government by the Muslim Brotherhood.

CPS is sponsoring multiple events at CPAC, including an event moderated by National Security Advisor John Bolton’s former chief of staff on “Why Anti-Zionism is a Form of Anti-Semitism and a Threat to National Security.” Frank Gaffney Jr., the controversial founder of CPS, will moderate his own event on CPAC about the persecution of Christians around the world.

Another major sponsor of CPAC is the Heartland Institute, a free-market think tank and previous sponsor. The Heartland Institute has positioned itself as a leading critic of climate science for many years, and has coordinated with the Trump administration’s Environmental Protection Agency to promote views denying climate change. As a $28,000-sponsor, Heartland is present throughout CPAC’s agenda. Its CEO has a stand-alone speech on Friday afternoon, and the group is sponsoring an event on “AOC’s Green New Deal: Debunking the Climate Alarmism Behind Bringing Full Socialism to America.”

Another CPAC sponsor is the Alliance of Conservative and Reformists in Europe, or ACRE, which represents the third-largest political party in the European Parliament. While ACRE includes member parties outside of Europe like the GOP, the conservative party of Canada and Likud in Israel, it has within its parliamentary ranks the controversial far-right parties of Poland, Italy, Denmark and Bulgaria.

ACRE will host an event at CPAC on “Building a Stronger Transatlantic Security and Defense Cooperation” featuring the Polish ambassador to the United States.

There are other ties to the European right-wing at CPAC. Italian lawmaker Giorgia Meloni, an ally of Matteo Salvini, Italy’s controversial deputy prime minister, will appear on a panel with ACU board member José Cárdenas and Rep. Francis Rooney (R-Fla.) on “Democracy Breaking through Darkness: Can Europe and Venezuela be Liberated?”

Though not listed as an official sponsor, Heritage Action for America, a lobbying organization and outside spending group, has a number of sponsored events throughout CPAC’s agenda. Heritage Action for America spent nearly $2 million supporting Republican candidates in the last-election cycle.

Reporters for conservative media outlets who paid thousands of dollars to sponsor CPAC are also featured prominently throughout the event’s agenda.

The Washington Times, which spent $60,000 to sponsor the event, has 6 of its reporters appearing on-stage. The Daily Caller, a participating sponsor, has four reporters featured at CPAC, one of whom publicly apologized earlier this month for racist, homophobic and anti-Semitic old tweets.

As CPAC commences, it remains at the intersection of grassroots conservatism and big-money influence. The event too remains a prominent spot for GOP officialdom, shown by its upcoming appearances by numerous Republican lawmakers as well as President Trump.",A guide to CPAC’s sponsors: from a Japanese cryptocurrency startup to the NRA,Opensecrets.org,https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2019/02/a-guide-to-cpacs-sponsors-from-a-japanese-cryptocurrency-startup-to-the-nra/

With that, let me turn the call over to Christopher Constant, our Chief Executive Officer.

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Josh. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our call for the fourth quarter and year-ended 2018. With Josh and me on the call today are Mark Olear, our Chief Operating Officer; and Danion Fielding, our Chief Financial Officer.

I will begin today's call by providing an overview of our fourth quarter and year-end 2018 performance, touch on our 2019 strategic objectives and then we'll pass the call to Mark to discuss our portfolio in more detail, and then, Danion will discusses our financials as well.

Our fourth quarter 2018 results and business activities concluded another strong year for Getty. During the quarter, our portfolio continued to display the strength and stability that we expect from our long-term triple net leases. And just as important, we continue to execute on our growth strategies with the acquisition of two properties and the completion of three redevelopment projects.

As we close out 2018 and look ahead to 2019, we continue to benefit from the overall health of the convenience and gas sector, while we remain focused on creating shareholder value by executing on each of our stated growth initiatives, including realizing internal growth from our operating assets and financing our portfolio through accretive acquisitions and unlocking embedded value through selective redevelopments, all of which we further demonstrated throughout 2018.

Turning to our results for the quarter. We continue to grow our revenue, net earnings, FFO and AFFO for the quarter as compared to the same periods for the prior year. On a per share basis, which takes into account our capital raising activities during 2018, our quarterly AFFO per share was $0.43.

For the year ended 2018, we reported AFFO per share of $1.71, which was 3% higher than our results for the prior year and which fell within our revised guidance range. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to underwrite and acquire new properties during the quarter. For the year, our total investment was approximately $87 million.

We acquired 41 high-quality convenience and gas, and other automotive locations during the year. This demonstrates our proactive, yet disciplined underwriting approach to grow our portfolio. Over the past few years, we have acquired 144 properties for investments for approximately 300 -- have mostly completed three portfolio transactions over this time and established relationships with new high-quality growth-oriented tenants.

So relationships, such as these are one of the keys to our ongoing ability to source accretive growth opportunities. As an example, subsequent to our initial transaction with Applegreen, in 2017, we partnered with them to acquire another portfolio in 2018. In addition, rents commenced on six redevelopments during 2018.

These projects included new-to-industry convenience and gas, automotive, retail, financial services, food services and urgent care uses. This brings our total completed redevelopments to nine, since commencing this program. We also maintain an attractive pipeline of both acquisition and redevelopment projects, which are scheduled to come online in 2019 and beyond.

Utilizing the financial flexibility that we've worked hard to create, we were able to finance our growth in 2018 with a combination of debt and equity, including a 10-year unsecured debt private placement and measured use of our ATM program.

We placed a premium on being conservatively leveraged and are committed to maintaining a well-laddered flexible capital structure as we look to grow completions.

Looking ahead, we remain committed to an active approach to managing our portfolio of net leased assets, expanding our portfolio through acquisitions in the convenience, gas and auto-related sectors and selective redevelopment projects. We are confident that we will be able to continue to successfully execute on our strategic objectives throughout 2019.

We will continue to be focused on acquiring high-quality real estate and partnering with tenants who share our commitment to the growth and evolution of the convenience, gas and other automotive-related sectors. This approach and focus on these critical components should result in driving additional shareholder value as we move through 2019 and beyond.

With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Olear to discuss our portfolio and investment activities.

Mark J. Olear -- Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer

Thank you, Chris. In terms of our investment activities, we had a productive year, where we were able to both add high-quality, convenience and gas, and other auto-related assets to the portfolio, as well as move redevelopment projects back into our net lease portfolio following rent commencement.

During 2018, Getty's pipeline of potential transactions remain consistent with prior years experience. For the year, we underwrote approximately $1 billion of opportunities, which met our initial screening process, the result of which was the acquisition of 41 properties for $78 million. The weighted average return exceeded 7.25%, and the weighted average initial lease term was 14.1 years.

To review a few highlights of our investment activities, for the fourth quarter, we acquired two convenience and gas locations for $3.2 million with an average initial return of more than 7.2%. For the year, we further advanced our goal of diversifying our revenue by expanding our relationships with three tenants, Applegreen, Circle K and GPM Investments.

We display high-quality operations and strong credit quality. We also expanded the company's presence in Southern US, primary through our portfolio transaction with GPM, which had one-third of the sites in the Dallas-Fort Worth MSA, and through our second transaction with Applegreen, where all of these sites are located in the Columbia, South Carolina metropolitan market.

The net result is that we are now represented in 30 states, plus Washington DC, and 60% of our annualized base rent comes from the top 25 National MSAs. Overall, the pipeline of opportunities we are underwriting for convenience and gas and other automotive use sites remains robust.

Moving to our redevelopment platform. For the year, we invested approximately $9 million in both our completed projects and sites, which are in progress. As Chris mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we returned three redevelopment projects back to the net lease portfolio, bringing our total for rent commenced projects to six in 2018 and nine since the inception of this initiative.

Specifically in November, rent commenced for a build-to-suit urgent care location lease to ConvenientMD in Massachusetts. Our total investment in the project was $2.1 million, and we expect to generate a return on our investment of more than 10%. In December, we funded the raise and rebuild of a convenience and gas side with our global partners on Long Island, New York. In this project, our total investment was $3.1 million, and we expect to generate a return on our investment of 7.5%.

Finally, in December, rent commenced on a project where we ground lease a site to a regional developer for a food service use. In this project, we invested $0.3 million, and we expect to generate a return on investment of more than 20%. In terms of redevelopment projects, we ended the quarter with 13 signed leases. Of these redevelopment projects, six are on properties not currently included in our net lease portfolio and seven are on properties, which are included in our net lease portfolio.

All of these projects are continuing to advance through the redevelopment process. We expect substantially all these projects will be completed over the next one to three years. In total, we have invested approximately $2.1 million in these 13 redevelopment projects in our pipeline, and we expect to have rent commencement at several sites during 2019.

On the capital spending side, we estimate that these 13 projects will require a total investment by Getty of $8.2 million and will generate incremental returns for the company in excess of where we can invest these funds in the acquisition markets today. For more detailed information on the redevelopment pipeline, please refer to page 14 of our investor presentation, which is found on our website. We remain committed to transforming selective sites in our portfolio and look forward to updating everyone as we make progress.

Turning to dispositions. We sold 10 properties during 2018, realizing proceeds of approximately $7.2 million. The properties sold were vacant or returned to us by our tenants as per the terms of their lease agreements. We expect the net financial impact of these dispositions will be minimal.

As we look ahead, we continue to selectively dispose the properties where we have made a determination, that the properties are aren't competitive as a gas, convenience location and does not have redevelopment potential. As a result of our -- all of our activity, we ended the year with 918 net lease properties, six active redevelopment sites and nine vacant properties. Our weighted average lease term is approximately 10 years, and our overall occupancy, excluding active redevelopments remains constant at 99%.

With that, I turn the call over to Danion.

Danion Fielding -- Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer

Thank you, Mark. For the fourth quarter, our total revenues and revenues from rental properties, which excludes tenant reimbursements and interest on notes and mortgages receivables grew 3% to $35.1 million, and 5% to $29.5 million, respectively.

Our top line growth continues to be driven by rents escalated in our leases, plus incremental growth from completed acquisitions and redevelopment projects. During the fourth quarter of 2018, property costs and environmental and G&A expenses collectively declined, primarily due to reductions in our environmental expense line item, which is highly variable quarter-to-quarter. For more information on the specific expense movements, please refer to today evening's release.

Our FFO for the quarter was $20.3 million, or $0.49 per share, as compared to $20.2 million, or $0.51 per share, for the prior year's quarter. Our AFFO for the quarter was $17.6 million, or $0.43 per share, as compared to $17.3 million, or $0.43 per share, for the prior year's quarter. For the year ended 2018, our total revenues and revenues from rental properties grew by 13% to $136.1 million and 15% to $116.3 million, respectively. Again, this growth stems from the escalators on net leases and successful execution of both acquisitions and redevelopments.

For the year ended 2018, our operating expenses increased. The primary driver for the increases was our environmental expense line item, which is highly variable. In addition, during the year, we experienced an increase in property costs due to pursue cost of deals, ultimately, not completed.

Our FFO for the year was $73.6 million, or $1.80 per share, as compared to $74.6 million, or $2 per share, for the prior year.Our AFFO for the year was $69.7 million, or $1.71 per share, as compared to $62.0 million, or $1.66 per share, for the prior year.

Turning to the balance sheet and our capital markets activities. We ended 2018 with $445 million of borrowings, which includes $120 million under our credit agreement and $325 million of long-term fixed rate debt. Our weighted average borrowing cost is 5.1%. The weighted average maturity of our debt is five years, with 73% of our debt being fixed rate and our earliest debt maturity remains 2021. Our debt to total capitalization currently stands at 24%. Our debt to total asset value is 36%, and our net debt to EBITDA is a conservative four times.

In addition, we utilized our at-the-market equity program during the quarter and issued $9.7 million of capital at an average price of $30.24 per share. For the year, we raised $31 million through our ATM program at an average price of $27.93 per share. Our environmental liability ended the quarter at $59.8 million, down $3.7 million for the year.

For the quarter and year ended December 31, 2018, the company's net environmental remediation spending was approximately $3.1 million and $9.9 million, respectively. Finally, we are introducing our 2019 AFFO per share guidance at a range of $1.71 to $1.75 per share.

Our guidance does not assume any acquisition or capital markets activities, although it does reflect our expectation that we will continue to execute on our redevelopment, leasing and disposition activities. Specific factors, which impact our guidance this year include, one, our expectation that we forego rent when we recapture properties for redevelopment.

Two, our expectation that our cost of borrowings will increase in 2019. Three, the full-year impact of the dilution associated with the company's 2018 capital raising activities. And four, our expectation that we will remain active in pursuing acquisition on redevelopments, which could result in additional expenses for deals ultimately not completed.

With that, I will turn the call back to Chris.

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

That concludes our prepared remarks. So, let me ask the operator to open the call for questions.

Questions and Answers:

Operator

(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead, sir.

Craig Mailman -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst

Hey guys. Good morning.

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Good morning.

Craig Mailman -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst

Dan, anything else in guidance, any other big variances as we look year-to-year? Do you guys have any impact from the new lease accounting impact on G&A at all, year-over-year?

Danion Fielding -- Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer

Craig, we're not expecting in our guidance a big impact on that at the moment.

Craig Mailman -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst

Okay. And then just bigger picture. I know acquisitions are a little bit more volatile for you guys. You guys are north of $200 million in '17 and about $80 million in '18. Just -- as you guys look at what's in the pipeline, the competitiveness of the market, I mean, do you think that 2019 could be more like '18 or '17 in terms of volume?

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Well, I think if you look at our track record of portfolio acquisitions and one-off acquisitions, we think we've been successful in executing both portfolio and one-off deals. Really, it's a matter of two factors, which is, a lot of our activities being driven by industry M&A and consolidation, and we expect that trend to continue.

And secondly, we have an underwriting criteria, which really places an emphasis on being in certain markets and where those sites are located within those markets. And any transaction that we ultimately pursue has to fit right into our underwriting model for us to move forward with it. So, those are two things that I think will impact any deal that we look at sort of this year and beyond.

Craig Mailman -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst

Maybe another way to ask it. The investment pipeline today, how does that look relative to maybe the beginning of last year?

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, I think it's consistent. We disclosed a year ago this time that we underwrote $1.3 billion last year and last year, we underwrote $1 billion, so a slight difference. But the volume of opportunities that we continue to see, which make it through our initial screen is fairly consistent.

Craig Mailman -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst

And what are you guys seeing on the competitive side, and how is that impacting yields that you're able to get in the market on acquisitions?

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Well, I think there's no doubt that there is definitely competition from other REITs and from other institutional real estate investors for convenience and gas assets. This sector is quite healthy and it is consolidated. We are seeing a lot more activity there.

In general, our view is that pricing has been pretty disciplined across the -- especially, the public REIT market for our type of assets. So, I don't really think it impacts pricing on our side. I do think it does make the sector a little more crowded just from the number of people looking at every deal.

Craig Mailman -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst

Okay. Thank you.

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Welcome.

Operator

(Operator Instructions) We'll take our next question from Mitch Germain with JMP Securities.

Mitchell Germain -- JMP Securities -- Analyst

I just wanted to follow up on Craig's question regarding the deal pipeline. I mean, more or less what deals you saw. 2017, I think you said 1.3 or so. Last year, one. Closed on a smaller amount in 2018. Did you guys make any sort of shift in your underwriting just to account for the rate environment or the -- where we sit in the cycle? Was there any kind of shift that you guys made personally that might have caused a smaller amount of acquisition activity?

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

No, our model has been pretty consistent in terms of the way we value the real estate, the way we price transactions internally. I think, really, it is -- it's the acquisition, so certain transactions closed and certain transactions that we really like didn't close for various reasons. And that's really the thing that I would point to in terms of the delta between 2017 and 2018.

We think We've been pretty consistent in terms of generating new activity in terms of our underwriting model and our internal processing. We think we can continue to do that. Looking ahead, the volume of opportunities will be fairly consistent from where it was in '17 and '18.

Mitchell Germain -- JMP Securities -- Analyst

Got you. And then any new players emerged? I mean, obviously, you've got some big retail focus funds or -- I don't even know if we want to call them non-traded REITs again. But that's sort of a product is certainly reemerging again. Is that -- is the competitive environment changed in any way, shape or form?

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Look, similar to my answer to Craig's question, the convenience and gas sector has definitely become more mainstream in terms of the retail, real estate landscape side. The competition, I think has been increasing over the last three to five years. And we decide where it is and we've been able to execute with more competition over the last several years.

Mitchell Germain -- JMP Securities -- Analyst

Did the tax reform made any shift to house some of the private owners are approaching some of the generational issues in terms of state planning and what not?

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

I think if you look at some of the industry data that's out there, there is a immense amount of real estate that's owned by these companies or by families who have built up their businesses over time. And a lot of the M&A activity or what we generally refer to as industry M&A activity is driven by succession or state planning and really, a family or small private business that's reached the end of their risk tolerance to continue to grow their business on their own balance sheet. And there are large acquirers out there, many of which we've partnered with, for seizing that opportunity to grow their business and expand, either within their region or nationally as a result of a family that's sort of looking to monetize or transition out of the business.

Mitchell Germain -- JMP Securities -- Analyst

Thank you.

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Welcome.

Operator

We'll take our next question from John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services.

John Massocca -- Ladenburg Thalmann & Company -- Analyst

Good morning.

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Hey, John.

John Massocca -- Ladenburg Thalmann & Company -- Analyst

So, what's sort of kind of the decline in properties leased from third-party landlords? It came down by about three. If I think about the owned ones, it kind of makes sense based on what you bought when you sold. But was that movement, maybe some landlords taking those properties back or maybe transfer of those into you guys having full ownership of them?

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Sure. So, I'll answer the question in a few different ways, right? So, there are certain leased properties, right, that we have acquired over time, where we want to eventually own the real estate and we're able to come to an agreement with our landlords.

The flip side to that is, there is a number of leases where we're coming to the end of our term and either, we were not able to buy the property or we chose not to renew the lease for economic reasons and we let the lease expire. That's really -- those are the two moving pieces with the lease portfolio.

John Massocca -- Ladenburg Thalmann & Company -- Analyst

In -- how many of those lease properties are coming to that kind of decision in the next, maybe one to two years?

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. The schedule is in the 10-K. We'll need to pull it up here. Sorry.

John Massocca -- Ladenburg Thalmann & Company -- Analyst

No, if it isn't there (ph), I can --

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

We have 74 leases. There are seven, which we expect to -- which come up for expiration in 2019.

John Massocca -- Ladenburg Thalmann & Company -- Analyst

Okay.

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

It's a steady stream of properties for you there. But the initial term is coming due, and why they want to buy the property, in certain cases, we'll look to extend the lease, if we have a long-term tenant up there and in other cases, we'll exit the leases.

John Massocca -- Ladenburg Thalmann & Company -- Analyst

Okay. And then maybe switching to the acquisition front again. There has been a lot of talk of operator transaction activity up in Canada. Is that a place where you guys feel you can invest and will be willing to invest?

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

We've looked at Canada a little bit over the years. I think our focus really is on the US, and we think there is ample opportunity for us to continue to do acquisitions within the 50 states.

John Massocca -- Ladenburg Thalmann & Company -- Analyst

And then, one kind of clarifying point on guidance. Is it correct in kind of the way you were describing it that you're assuming costs of pursuing the transactions this year, but no NOI from closing any transactions?

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

So the reference that Danion made to those costs, that's really a cost that we expect to incur with respect to the developments, right? And certain costs that are expensed as part of our development projects and then certain deal-related costs, again, for development.

We have not traditionally included acquisitions as part of our guidance. Obviously, to the extent we are successful throughout the year, we'll update the guidance and that will reflect any additional costs coming from those acquisitions.

John Massocca -- Ladenburg Thalmann & Company -- Analyst

That makes sense. That's it for me. Thank you very much.

Christopher J. Constant -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to our management for any additional or closing remarks.

194,Empty,2019-02-26T14:35:00Z,"The British prime minister has outlined a plan for parliamentary votes on her Brexit deal with the EU, a ""no deal"" or an extension to the date for leaving the EU. But another key motion is also on the agenda this week.","British Prime Minister Theresa May announced a series of parliamentary votes on Tuesday that will let lawmakers decide on whether or not to leave the European Union on March 29 as planned — or to postpone the date.

The move comes after weeks of mounting political pressure on May, whose initial withdrawal agreement with the EU was overwhelmingly rejected by Parliament in January.

What will be voted on?

The first vote in the House of Commons will take place no later than March 12 when lawmakers will decide whether or not to accept May's divorce agreement with the EU. The deal would include any amendments that she has been able to agree with Brussels since January.

Should lawmakers reject the deal again, another vote will take place on March 13. This time, MPs will vote on whether or not to leave the EU without a deal.

If MPs reject a ""no-deal"" Brexit, a third vote will be held on March 14 on asking the EU to temporarily extend Article 50. If EU leaders approve, Brexit will be delayed and both sides will have extra time to negotiate a final deal.

Watch video 00:38 Mays says Brexit could be delayed

Clock ticking

May told lawmakers that she still intends to lead Britain out of the EU at the end of March with a deal.

""Let me be clear, I do not want to see Article 50 extended. Our absolute focus should be on working to get a deal and leaving on March 29,"" she said, later adding: ""An extension cannot take 'no deal' off the table.""

The prime minister added that any extension, which she says would not extend beyond the end of June, would be a one-off and that her government was committed to following through on honoring the results of the 2016 referendum that saw 51.9 percent of voters back leaving the EU while 48.1 percent voted to remain.

May's announcement comes after the opposition Labour Party shifted its Brexit policy towards supporting a second referendum.

Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn accused May of ""continuing to run down the clock,"" saying that the ongoing spat is intensifying uncertainty for business.

Brexit timeline: Charting Britain's turbulent exodus from Europe June 2016: 'The will of the British people' After a shrill referendum campaign, nearly 52 percent of British voters opted to leave the EU on June 24. Polls had shown a close race before the vote with a slight lead for those favoring remaining in the EU. Conservative British Prime Minister David Cameron, who had campaigned for Britain to stay, acknowledged the ""will of the British people"" and resigned the following morning.

Brexit timeline: Charting Britain's turbulent exodus from Europe July 2016: 'Brexit means Brexit' Former Home Secretary Theresa May replaced David Cameron as prime minister on July 11 and promised the country that ""Brexit means Brexit."" May had quietly supported the Remain campaign before the referendum. She did not initially say when her government would trigger Article 50 of the EU treaty to start the two-year talks leading to Britain's formal exit.

Brexit timeline: Charting Britain's turbulent exodus from Europe March 2017: 'We already miss you' May eventually signed a diplomatic letter over six months later on March 29, 2017 to trigger Article 50. Hours later, Britain's ambassador to the EU, Tim Barrow, handed the note to European Council President Donald Tusk. Britain's exit was officially set for March 29, 2019. Tusk ended his brief statement on the decision with: ""We already miss you. Thank you and goodbye.""

Brexit timeline: Charting Britain's turbulent exodus from Europe June 2017: And they're off! British Brexit Secretary David Davis and the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, kicked off talks in Brussels on June 19. The first round ended with Britain reluctantly agreeing to follow the EU's timeline for the rest of the negotiations. The timeline split talks into two phases. The first would settle the terms of Britain's exit, and the second the terms of the EU-UK relationship post-Brexit.

Brexit timeline: Charting Britain's turbulent exodus from Europe July-October 2017: Money, rights and Ireland The second round of talks in mid-July began with an unflattering photo of a seemingly unprepared British team. It and subsequent rounds ended with little progress on three phase one issues: How much Britain still needed to pay into the EU budget after it leaves, the post-Brexit rights of EU and British citizens and whether Britain could keep an open border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.

Brexit timeline: Charting Britain's turbulent exodus from Europe December 2017: Go-ahead for phase 2 Leaders of the remaining 27 EU members formally agreed that ""sufficient progress"" had been made to move on to phase two issues: the post-Brexit transition period and the future UK-EU trading relationship. While Prime Minister Theresa May expressed her delight at the decision, European Council President Tusk ominously warned that the second stage of talks would be ""dramatically difficult.""

Brexit timeline: Charting Britain's turbulent exodus from Europe July 2018: Johnson, Davis resign British ministers appeared to back a Brexit plan at May's Chequers residence on July 6. The proposal would have kept Britain in a ""combined customs territory"" with the EU and signed up to a ""common rulebook"" on all goods. That went too far for British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis, who resigned a few days later. May replaced them with Jeremy Hunt and Dominic Raab.

Brexit timeline: Charting Britain's turbulent exodus from Europe September 2018: No cherries for Britain May's Chequers proposal did not go down well with EU leaders, who told her at a summit in Salzburg in late September that it was unacceptable. EU Council President Tusk trolled May on Instagram, captioning a picture of himself and May looking at cakes with the line: ""A piece of cake perhaps? Sorry, no cherries."" The gag echoed previous EU accusations of British cherry-picking.

Brexit timeline: Charting Britain's turbulent exodus from Europe November 2018: Breakthrough in Brussels EU leaders endorsed a 585-page draft divorce deal and political declaration on post-Brexit ties in late November. The draft had been widely condemned by pro- and anti-Brexit lawmakers in the British Parliament only weeks earlier. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab resigned along with several other ministers, and dozens of Conservative Party members tried to trigger a no-confidence vote in May.

Brexit timeline: Charting Britain's turbulent exodus from Europe December 2018: May survives rebellion In the face of unrelenting opposition, May postponed a parliamentary vote on the deal on December 10. The next day, she met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel to seek reassurances that would, she hoped, be enough to convince skeptical lawmakers to back the deal. But while she was away, hard-line Conservative lawmakers triggered a no-confidence vote. May won the vote a day later.

Brexit timeline: Charting Britain's turbulent exodus from Europe January 2019: Agreement voted down The UK Parliament voted 432 to 202 against May's Brexit deal on January 16. In response to the result, European Council President Donald Tusk suggested the only solution was for the UK to stay in the EU. Meanwhile, Britain's Labour Party called for a no-confidence vote in the prime minister, her second leadership challenge in as many months.

Brexit timeline: Charting Britain's turbulent exodus from Europe March 2019: Second defeat for May's deal May tried to get legal changes to the deal's so-called Irish backstop in the weeks that followed. She eventually got assurances that the UK could suspend the backstop under certain circumstances. But on March 12, Parliament voted against the revised Brexit deal by 391 to 242. EU leaders warned the vote increased the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit. Two days later, MPs voted to delay Brexit.

Brexit timeline: Charting Britain's turbulent exodus from Europe March 2019: Extension after second defeat The EU agreed to minor additions to the Irish backstop, but it wasn't enough. On March 12, Parliament voted again against the revised Brexit deal. After MPs voted to delay Brexit, EU leaders gave May two options: delay Brexit until May 22 if MPs vote for the withdrawal deal or delay it until April 12 if they vote against the deal. If the deal fails, May could ask for a long extension. Author: Alexander Pearson



Key votes still to come this week

It remains to be seen whether May's move to offer parliamentary votes will win over hardliners within her Conservatives.

The House of Commons is due to vote on several Brexit-related amendments, which could possibly bypass May's proposed votes if they are approved.

Several of the amendments would force the government to set a new Brexit date if May fails to secure her deal by March 13.

The Labour Party will also table an amendment that pushes for the adoption of its Brexit proposals, including creating a permanent customs union with the EU. Corbyn has said that if the Labour measure doesn't pass, his party would then put forward an amendment that would call for a second referendum.

This septic isle It never rains A delay by UK Prime Minister Theresa May to allow Parliament to vote on her Brexit deal has increased the chances Britain will leave the bloc without a deal in March. The odds on a no-deal Brexit have shortened to 2/1, according to oddschecker.com, while Steve Eisman, the trader whose prediction of the 2008 crisis was dramatized in the film The Big Short, is betting against UK banks.

This septic isle Money where your mouth is The IMF says that while some sectors like agriculture and mining might benefit, the majority of sectors would shrink by between about 1 percent and 33 percent. The Bank of England said no-deal would wipe between 4.75 percent and 7.75 percent off what the UK would have produced by 2024 and the pound would fall by 25 percent.

This septic isle Not waving, but drowning The EU has said the UK would have ""third country"" status under a no-deal scenario, giving it the same status as China, Russia and Pakistan. All goods crossing EU borders would be subject to tariffs of up to 38 percent. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said additional paperwork attached to trading under WTO rules would act as an extra tariff of up to an average of 6.5 percent.

This septic isle Love's labor lost Britain’s farmers and manufacturers face the largest shortage of skilled workers since 1989 due to a fall in the numbers of EU27 nationals coming to work since the Brexit vote. A no deal would likely accelerate that process.

This septic isle A road to nowhere The financial industry and British regulators say a hard Brexit poses a threat to trillions of euros worth of derivative and insurance contracts London could lose up to to €800 billion to Frankfurt, lobby group Frankfurt Main Finance has said. Some 30 banks and financial firms have already chosen the city as the site of their new EU headquarters, with others opting for Dublin or Paris.

This septic isle Movers and shakers left in limbo No-deal would have significant implications for people's ability to go where they want. A €7 charge for visiting the EU's Schengen Area would kick in in 2021, after the UK's transition period ends. British expats would face uncertainty, as many foreign governments have not yet established their rules for residency under no-deal.

This septic isle Can't beat a good queue The UK Road Haulage Association has said a lack of planning over no-deal would mean the manufacturing sector would be put under ""severe pressure"" and hauliers would go out of business. European airports have warned that no-deal would cause ""major disruption and heightened safety risks"" to the air network. Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary has warned planes could be grounded.

This septic isle All in it together The biggest impact of no deal could be felt in Ireland, which exports 12 percent of its goods and 40 percent of its food to the UK, and two-thirds of its other exports travel through the UK. The IMF believes the Netherlands, Denmark, the Czech Republic and Belgium also face taking moderate hits to their economies of between 0.5 percent and 0.7 percent.

This septic isle Where there is harmony, May brings discord The Police Federation has said it was worried about ""widescale disruption and dangers for the general public."" Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has said 3,500 troops are on standby to cope with the fallout of no deal. The government is preparing for potential shortages of key items in the wake of a no-deal Brexit. But May refused to guarantee the health service (NHS) would have enough medicines.

This septic isle Christmas-voting turkeys play chicken in Ireland The border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would remain unresolved with no deal. The main sticking point has been the Irish 'backstop' — the insurance scheme for avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland. One solution has been a Canada-style agreement that would remove most EU restrictions but would not abolish the need for a hard border. But uncertainty breeds fear. Author: Jo Harper

Good day and welcome to Nexstar Media Group's 2018 Fourth Quarter Conference Call. Today's Conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Jaffoni, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Joe. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining Tom Carter, our Chief Financial Officer and me today to review Nexstar's record financial performance and our outlook for 2018-2019. With our record fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results, the December announcement of the Tribune Media transaction and our immediate work on the regulatory approval process and the development of our post closing plans, it's been an active and productive time here at Nexstar.

We believe what we've accomplished since the closing of the Media General transaction, is an important guide for what we will achieve as we move toward the closing of the Tribune transaction expected later this year. Nexstar had an outstanding 2018, our strong fourth quarter and full-year operating results mark our seventh consecutive year of record financial performance with all of our key metrics from net revenue to free cash flow growing at double-digit rates and coming in at the highest levels in the Company's history for both the three and the 12-month periods.

The 22.1% rise in fourth quarter net revenue and nearly 100% increase in operating income highlight the ongoing value of our strategies focused on leveraging our local content and community involvement, that generate record shares of political spending in our markets, as well as continued distribution and digital revenue growth. Our ability to capture historic levels of mid-term election spending in our markets combined with the strong operating leverage in our business model drove our record fourth quarter -- a record fourth quarter BCF adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.

For the full year, our enterprisewide focus on managing operations for current and future cash flow enabled us to generate free cash flow of $692.7 million or about $15.20 per share, representing approximately 30% -- 31% growth over 2017 levels. By comparison, if you look back at the 2016 presidential election year and prior to the completion of the Media General transaction, Nexstar generated approximately $7.97 in free cash flow per share, so in just two years, we've grown that important metric by approximately 91%.

In 2018, we brought about $0.25 of every net revenue dollar to the free cash flow line, allowing us to invest in our people, our local media platform and our complementary accretive acquisitions, while at the same time reducing net debt by approximately $400 million and returning over $120 million to shareholders, in the form of share repurchases and dividends.

I'll do a quick review of the quarterly highlights and then review some of the transaction initiatives under way, after which, Tom will go through the financials, including an update on our cap structure, 2019 expectations and other items of interest to those of you on the call.

Again, Nexstar's record fourth quarter financial results highlight our ability to maximize the political revenue opportunity in our markets as we continue to build new to television ad revenue and grow retransmission consent revenue, also combined with the ongoing benefits of our management and operating disciplines. 22.1% rise in fourth quarter net revenue resulted in BCF growth at 57%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 57.3% and free cash flow growth of 62.1%.

In total, Nexstar's fourth quarter core local and national television ad revenue were down little over 1% at $4.7 million down, that's all related to our heavy allocation of inventory to political as we booked over $140 million in political in Q4, were $127 million more than 2017. As expected, local, national ad revenue strengthened as we move through Q4 and they remain up on a year-over-year basis in the 2019 period-to-date.

November and December were the strongest months of 2018 for core advertising revenue, when excluding February, which benefited from the Super Bowl and Olympic-related spending in Q4 of '18, we generated increased ad revenue in three of our top five categories and five of our top ten overall. Core revenue continues to reflect healthy levels of new business with Q4 new to television ad revenue of $16.3 million, which is a 15.6% rise over the prior year. Reflecting our expanded platform and presence in states with contested elections, we generated solid results in the political ad category in markets like Las Vegas, Tampa, Portland and Grand Rapids, to name a few, with a diversified mix from the house, the gubernatorial and senate candidates, as well as healthy contributions from PAC and issue spending.

Nexstar's fourth quarter television ad revenue growth was complemented by the combined fourth quarter retransmission and digital media revenue growth up 10.5% to a combined total of $349.6 million in the fourth quarter and we grew 13.1% to $1.4 billion for the full year, marking the first time in the Company's history that this combined distribution and digital metric has exceeded total television advertising revenue on an annual basis.

Overall, the year-over-year increase in fourth quarter and full year non-television advertising revenue reflects renewals of distribution agreements with MVPDs and initial contributions from distribution agreements with OTT providers and the early '18 accretive acquisition of LKQD, as well as organic growth across our profitable digital operations.

Reflecting the ongoing benefits of our revenue diversification strategies and considering the magnitude of the Q4 '18 political revenue, total fourth quarter retransmission fee and digital media revenue represented 43.8% of our fourth quarter net revenue, compared to 40.7% of total net revenue in 2016. The last even year political quarter. At $284.5 million in the quarter retransmission fee revenue reached the highest ever level for quarter in the Company's history, and we expect our long-term distribution revenue growth to continue at a double-digit pace.

We continue to see consistency in pay television subscriber levels in our markets with now meaningful growth in OTT subs for which we are beginning to be compensated. With the renewal of retransmission consent agreements, representing approximately 10% of our subscriber base in 2018 and approximately 70% in 2019, continued revenue growth from this source remains highly visible for 2019 and beyond. And given the after acquired clauses in our retransmission consent agreements, once we complete the transaction, the Tribune stations are immediate party to our distribution agreements and our rates.

On Tribune with our long-term strategic focus on completing accretive transactions to enhance our overall competitive position, we were delighted to announce in December, our definitive agreement to acquire Tribune were $6.4 billion in an accretive all-cash transaction. Upon closing, Nexstar will be the largest local television group in the United States, and one of the nation's leading providers of local news, entertainment, sports, lifestyle and network programming across all devices. Importantly, we've approached this transaction, just as we did when we acquired Media General. Namely, we've identified and plan to divest of certain television stations necessary to obtain FCC and other regulatory approvals, which we believe will allow us to close the transaction sometime in the third quarter of 2019.

This transaction highlights Nexstar's role as the industry's leading consolidator and represents the culmination of over a year-and-a-half of work. The proposed transaction is a strategically and financially compelling growth opportunity that further expands our geographic diversity and our audience reach.

With 216 combined post divestiture television stations and 118 markets, and rapidly growing digital media operations, Nexstar will offer superior and great engagement across all devices and influence on consumers' purchasing decisions that will be unrivaled by other media, including now large scale digital companies. Pro-forma for the completion of the transaction, we will serve 15 of the nation's top 25 markets and 34 of the top 50 markets and by adding Tribune, we will increase our audience reach by approximately 50% from 26% to 39% of U.S. television households, reflecting the FCC's UHF discount and that audience reach is pro forma for the anticipated divestitures. Pro-forma for the completion of the transaction, Nexstar will generate approximately $900 million in average annual free cash flow pro forma for the 2018-2019 cycle.

That anticipated 46% free cash flow accretion afforded by the transaction relative to our last guide of $615 million for the average annual free cash flow in 2018-2019, clearly surpasses our stated criteria of evaluating strategic growth opportunities against the opportunity to repurchase our own shares. Upon closing, we intend to allocate our free cash flow to rapid leverage reduction as well as the increased return of capital to shareholders and allow us to make additional investments in our business to improve our service to viewers and advertisers.

Notably, we expect our net leverage ratio to approximately 5.3 times at the closing of the transaction and to decline to approximately 4 times by the end of 2020. In fact in the slightly more than two years, since we closed Media General. We have, as expected, reduced our opening leverage from 5.5 times at the closing of the transaction to 3.69 times at 2018 year-end.

So our vigilance with respect to managing leverage is obviously well documented. As with our past acquisitions, we developed a comprehensive regulatory compliance plan for required station divestitures and a detailed integration plan that will result in significant synergy realization. Nexstar has committed financing for the transaction and has made all required FCC and other regulatory applications and as you've likely read in the press, Nexstar and Tribune are actively engaged in the process of reviewing our planned divestiture stations with respective purchasers.

We've also embarked on a battery of station due diligence visits with more to come even this week and based on these meetings, our corporate management team and our executive team are refining our strategic plans for each station and business unit to ensure they operate with Nexstar's proven disciplines and adopt and implement best practices enterprise wide post closing.

The common core principles underlying the Tribune transaction and the Media General deals completed in -- the Media General deal, which we completed in January '17 is that they both represent further steps along our path of growing our local marketing and content platform and free cash flow through accretive acquisitions. Our growth has been rapid, yet measured in each of our transactions and while we've met or exceeded our synergy targets we've also improved operations and margins significantly and we've reduced the purchase multiple to what we acquired going in.

Importantly, with our track record of significant post transaction synergy realization and the organic growth in front of us including significant upcoming distribution renewals, as well as the 2020 presidential election and the continued growth of our digital platform, Nexstar will be posed for rapid leverage reduction and increased capital returns for shareholders, and will be one of the nation's preeminent local and national brand builders.

Nexstar will offer brands and advertisers a deep and truly diversified local marketing and content platform allowing us compete even more aggressively in the dynamic and rapidly converging advertising markets. And as an industry leader with a portfolio of premier stations and digital assets, a strong balance sheet and attractive weighted average cost of capital and significant free cash flow and free cash flow growth, we are also extremely well positioned to continue to build value for our shareholders.

In January, we announced a 20% increase in the amount of our quarterly cash dividend marking our sixth annual consecutive rise in our cash dividend. With the annual dividend rate now at $1.80 per share, approximately 45.6 million Nexstar Media Group shareholders and our $900 million of pro forma average free annual cash flow in 2018-2019, we'll be in a sweet spot for deleveraging, as well as other shareholder-friendly initiatives as I said.

With that, let me turn the call over to Tom Carter, who I'd like to acknowledge for his insights, his vision and his tireless efforts as we move toward the execution of our definitive agreements with Tribune, as well as the financing package. Tom?

Tom Carter -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Perry and good morning everybody. I'll start with a review of Nexstar's Q4 income statement and balance sheet data, after which I'll provide an update on our capital structure and some points of guidance. To start, as noted previously, effective 11 of 2018, the Company adopted the new revenue accounting guidance issued by FASB. As a result, beginning on 11 of '18, the Company presents local, national digital and political revenues net of their related agency commissions. This morning's release also provided the 2017 Q4 and year-to-date, local, national and political revenue comps adjusted to net out the sales commissions. In addition, we no longer recognize barter revenue and barter expense related to the exchange of advertising time for certain program materials.

These changes don't impact the Company's past or future income from operations, net income, BCF, adjusted EBITDA or free cash flow. Also effective at the beginning of 2018, the Company adopted an accounting standards update, which requires pension and other post retirement plans cost or credit other than service cost to be presented outside of income from operations. Thus the income from operations during the 3 and 12 months ended 12/31/2018 was decreased by a pension I'm sorry, 12/31/2017 was decreased by a pension and other post retirement credit of $4.2 million and $13.1 million respectively. And I'm pleased to say that's the last time I'll have to remind everyone of those accounting changes.

Now turning to the Q4 income statement. Net revenues were $798 million, which was a 22% increase over the same fourth quarter -- over the same period the previous year, fourth quarter of 2017. Total television ad revenue, local, national, political was up almost 39% to $438 million with local revenue down 1.5% to $216 million and national revenue at $81.9 million, which was down 1.8%. Political revenue, as Perry mentioned, was a record high of $140.2 million for the fourth quarter, which is up over 1000% of the same period in 2017, and digital revenues were up approximately 3%.

Profitability metrics across the Board were records with broadcast cash flow of approximately $380 million, adjusted EBITDA before one-time expenses of $358 million and free cash flow before one-time expenses of approximately $255 million.

On a same-station basis, our results were very comparable to the 2017 -- 2018 reported results with net revenue up approximately 22% total television ad revenue on a same-station basis, up 38% local revenue on a same-station basis was down 2% as was national revenue and digital revenues were up 3%. Retransmission fee revenues on a same-station basis we're very much comparable to the actual reported results and were up 12%.

As Perry mentioned, we recorded net political revenue of $140 million in the quarter, which exceeded our net political guidance for the full year and to further emphasize the strength of the election spending in our markets during 2018 mid-terms, full year same station political ad revenue came in 50% higher than the comparable 2014 period and 38% higher than the 2016 presidential election cycle.

Fourth quarter non-television advertising revenue increased 10.5% including 12.3% in retransmission fee revenues and 3.3% in -- rise in digital revenues. While full-year digital revenues were up 15.2%, fourth quarter was impacted by timing issues related to the implementation of required updates of our technology platform to comply with GDPR and authorized dealer sellers -- digital seller specifications, as well as rebranding and consolidation of certain digital businesses to focus on profitability.

During the fourth quarters of 2018 and 2017, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $19.9 million and $20 million respectively relating to goodwill and intangible assets of our digital businesses, including the last of the goodwill writedowns from legacy Media General assets. Fourth quarter station direct operating expense,s net of trade expense, rose 5.5%, primarily reflecting the growth in broadcast ad sales, as well as budget increase in network affiliation expense and expenses from LKQD. Same station fixed expenses including programming expenses were down 1.3% year-over-year. The 7.9% rise in fourth quarter G&A expense primarily reflects higher variable costs relating to the higher political revenues and our previously disclosed reclassification of certain digital administrative expenses to corporate expense.

Nexstar's fourth quarter -- corporate expense was in line with our expectations at $29.5 million inclusive of $8.5 million in stock-based compensation and $5.5 million of one-time transaction cost relating to the Tribune merger. This was largely in line with our guidance for the fourth quarter recurring cash overhead exclusive of stock comp of approximately $18 million to $19 million.

Overall, our significant fourth quarter revenue growth combined with ongoing expense management resulted in substantial increases in fourth quarter BCF and adjusted EBITDA margins, which rose to 47.6% and 44.2% respectively. Looking ahead to the 2019 first quarter, we project recurring corporate overhead, while approximately $20 million inclusive of stock -- exclusive of stock comp and Tribune related transaction expenses. Non-cash compensation is projected to be approximately $7 million for the quarter and $37 million for the year, reflecting anticipated issuance of new equity incentive awards later this year.

Cash transaction expenses primarily severance and success oriented fees cannot be capitalized -- that cannot be capitalized or expected to be approximately $5 million to $7 million during the first quarter.

Turning to balance sheet, I'll review a couple of key items at 12/31/2018. Total net leverage at that date was 3.69 times, which compares to 4.23 at the end of Q3 and 5.07 at the end of fourth quarter -- Q4 of '17. Covenant first lien leverage was 2.11 versus a covenant of 4.25, which compares to 2.59 at the end of Q3 '18 and 3.20 at the end of Q4 '17.

Our outstanding debt associated with the balance sheet amounted first lien debt of $2.4 billion, comprised of the term loans, with a decrease from September 30th, reflecting an additional $167 million in payments on the term loans in Q4 with cash from operations.

Our three outstanding bond issues, the 6.125%, the 5.875% and 5.625%, remain outstanding in approximately $1.5 billion in total outstandings. Net debt at December 31, 2018, amounted to approximately $3.84 billion compared to $4.25 billion a year ago and $4.7 billion in January of '17, when we close the MEG transaction, thus we quickly reduced debt by approximately $850 million since the closing the Media General transaction through eight quarters of operation even as we've allocated capital to serve other shareholder enhancement initiatives.

As you'll see in the 10-K, which is expected to be filed this evening, subsequent to quarter end, we made additional principal payments of approximately $10 million and through the 13-month period ended January 31, 2019, $412 million in total debt repayments. We anticipate making additional principal payments on the senior facility over the next several months.

In line with Nexstar's focuses on actively managing our capital structure and cost of capital, we closed on the $2.7 billion repricing our outstanding senior secured term loan facilities early in 4Q. The new terms represent a 25-basis point interest rate reduction compared to the Company's prior senior secured term loans and revolving credit facilities, resulting in approximately a $7 million reduction in the Company's annual interest expense, increasing net income and free cash flow by approximately $5 million on an annualized basis.

As it relates to our funding of the pending acquisition of Tribune Media, we intend to be opportunistic in tapping the markets and have a $6.4 billion committed financing facility, initially provided by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank, to fund the transactions cash consideration. Similar to our previous transaction, our intention is to have pro forma capital structure reflect a proper balance of fixed and floating debt and attractive weighted average cost of capital with prepayment and refinancing flexibility.

At closing, which is anticipated in 3Q of 2019, we expect our net leverage to be approximately 5.3 times on an L8QA adjusted EBITDA basis after giving effect to the transaction, the incurrence of that transaction expenses anticipated first year synergies of $160 million and net of the divestiture proceeds.

With the free cash flow generated from base operations, we expect Nexstar's net leverage to decline to the 4 times range by the end of 2020. We've remain committed to applying our growing free cash flow to drive shareholder returns and our record 2018 results including full year cash flow of $693 million, enabled us to remain opportunistically active in taking action to enhance shareholder value through the year with our total return of capital in leverage reduction activities amounting to approximately $521 million, including net debt reduction of $400 million, dividend payments of approximately $70 million and share repurchases of approximately $50 million. In addition, we funded the $120 million accretive acquisitions in the digital and television space during the year.

Fourth quarter total interest expense approximated $53.9 million compared to $52.7 million in the prior year's period, while cash interest expense was $51.8 million compared to $50 million in the prior year. We expect cash interest expense to approximately $50 million in Q1 of 2019. In Q4, we had operating cash taxes of approximately $32.7 million compared to $7 million of cash taxes in Q4 of '17. Full-year operating cash taxes were approximately $90 million, including a net payment of $1.1 million relating to tax liabilities in an assumed acquisition and payment slightly below our full year guidance of approximately $100 million. We expect operating cash taxes to amount to between $110 million and $115 million for the year and $20 million for Q1 of 2019.

Nexstar's CapEx for the quarter totaled $42 million of which $28.6 million was related to the station infrastructure investments, our platform programming digital operations with the remaining $13.3 million for station spectrum repack and relinquishment of spectrum costs, which are fully reimbursable.

Through 12/31/2018, we have spent $29.7 million included in CapEx, of which $29 million has been been reimbursed as it relates to the income statement, both relating to the spectrum repack. We expect CapEx in Q1 of 2019 to approximately $20 million with an additional amount for repack CapEx.

Our Q4 cash flow was approximately $250 million inclusive of the impact of $5.5 million of one-time transaction expenses and this compares with consensus estimates of approximately $230 million. With 2017- 2018 average annual free cash flow of over $610 million, before one-time expenses and projected to be slightly higher on a 2018-2019 basis, our near and long-term path to growth and enhancement of shareholder value remains on plan.

As it relates to management's focus on free cash flow generation, our record 2018 and positive outlook for Nexstar Media Group will follow the approach we've successfully deployed in terms of building the top line, maintaining close control of fixed and variable costs and optimizing the balance sheet and capital structure. The plan will continue to support our goals of generating significant free cash flow while allowing us to reduce leverage, pursue additional selective accretive acquisitions, pay dividends, repurchase shares and take other actions taken that enhance shareholder value.

Our focus on free cash flow is a key driver of our attraction to the Tribune assets and the value we can create by combining the companies. As Perry noted, we expect the transaction to result in approximately $900 million of average annual free cash flow in the 2018-2019 cycle or 46% more than our last guidance for Nexstar -- for legacy Nexstar of $615 million of annual free cash flow in the same period.

All of our pre-Tribune merger activities in due diligence continues to support our $900 million or $19.15 a share of free cash flow, but we recognize that our analysts and others continue to model Nexstar stand-alone in the periods leading up to the Tribune, closing later this year. As such, we reiterate the $900 million Tribune guidance and remind you that the two variables related to Tribune that we are aggressively working on every day, are the divestitures in the financing and we look forward to reporting to you as we finalize those items.

Now, I'll provide some guidance points for next our stand-alone over the next two years. First, as I mentioned before, we reiterate our guidance on 2018-2019 cycle of approximately $615 million per year or $13.40 rolling that forward today we're establishing guidance for average annual free cash flow in the 2019-2020 cycle of approximately $660 million or $14.40 a share or $1 more than the prior guidance.

The 2019 guidance assumes that core advertising is up slightly in 2019 versus 2018. The trend that we have seen since the November post election. Our guidance assumes that net political revenue in 2019 will decline almost $220 million compared to the 2018 period with respect to deep potential for early primary spending later this year, we're using historical data and not at this time forecasting anything in the way of material changes from past pre-presidential election cycle revenues.

As we've indicated previously, retrans and digital revenues will both grow low double-digits in 2019 over 2018 levels and again we have a high percentage of renewals at the end of this year, which will show up in our 2020 retrans growth. 2020, of course, will be a political year, so we'll see the same type of inventory management, we successfully exercised in 2018 to maximize this revenue opportunity.

I'm not going to provide guidance for 2020 core because it's just too far out and our sites will be based on driving political dollars in that year.

In summary, Nexstar is executing well on all functions including operations, integration, synergy realization, capital structure and service to our communities. Our disciplines in these areas have driven successful growth as well as consistency and visibility in our results with our financial results and the value we expect to derive from our pending accretive merger with Tribune Media. We continue to believe we have forged a clear path for the continued near and long-term enhancement of shareholder value.

As such, we're excited about our guidance for pro forma and annual average free cash flow in the 2018-2019 cycle of $900 million for the post Tribune merger and approximately $19.50 per share, per year. Our long-term experience in integrating acquired assets and our success over the last eight quarters and outperforming our synergy targets and driving other operating efficiencies related to the transaction of the Media General operations, will serve us well as we add Tribune Media to our operating base upon closing this year.

That concludes the financial review, and now I'll turn the call back over to Perry for some closing remarks before Q&A.

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Thanks very much, Tom. In the almost 23 years since Nexstar was founded, we remain true to our mission to deliver premium local programming and content as well as advertising solutions at the local level now with the growing scale for advertisers as well as political campaigns. This focus has proven to be good business for Nexstar as it consistently has positioned us to continue to invest in our business as well as reducing leverage and aggressively returning capital to shareholders and building shareholder value.

Consumer's brand awareness in purchasing decisions are every bit as strong if not stronger at the local level where businesses is operated and transactions take place. Local diversified media companies like ours, are uniquely positioned to thrive in today's multi-platform world because we provide superior local content that is unique and relative to each of the local communities that we serve across the U.S. while offering local businesses advertisers and brands unparalleled 24/7 marketing opportunities across all screens and all devices.

At the same time, our development of complementary retrans and digital revenue streams have materially diversified our revenue mix and we continue to focus on implementing new standards and technologies to monetize the unrivaled reach, trust and influence of our leading local platform. The fourth quarter marked a strong end to a record year of financial performance for Nexstar as well as the beginning of what we expect to be a tremendous period of growth for the Company with our pending acquisition of Tribune Media.

As we begin to benefit from initial contributions from Tribune later this year as well as the continued double-digit growth of

combined retransmission and digital revenue, a large number of distribution contract renewals up at the end of the year and what many expect to be a very substantial and possibly unprecedented spending level related to the 2020 presidential election cycle. We have excellent visibility to delivering on or exceeding our free cash flow targets and a clear path for the continued near and long-term enhancement of shareholder value through our commitment to localism, innovation and growth.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our operator to express and hear from you as to your specific areas of interest. Operator?

Questions and Answers:

Operator

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The first question will come from Marci Ryvicker with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.

Marci Ryvicker -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Thank you. I'm surprised by the core guide for '19, so curious what's driving positive core? Is this Nexstar's specific? Is just the overall better environment? Is it a contribution from auto or is it growing in spite of auto?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

I would say it's a little bit of all of the above. Marci, we budget conservatively for core growth this year. But I would say into the absence of political has inventory back into our base that we can resell to local advertisers, automotive is better than what we saw ending the Q4 period and 2018. I think it's just a combination of things. I think at Main Street, there is a pretty good level of confidence in the economy. And so, we're also beating (ph) the business for new business. So I think it's a combination of things that, that are driving the growth and with January and February in the books, we are over budget on core, our core revenue budgets for this year and obviously in February, we budget it down because of the Olympics last year, but we have exceeded our goals in the first two months of the year. Small sample size, but it's the beginning of a streak.

Marci Ryvicker -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Got it. In terms of the Tribune deal, I have a couple of questions. It feels like you're still on par to close in Q3 despite the government shutdown. I assume that means that conversations with the regulators are going well. And then can you also update us on the timing of station divestitures that forthcoming in the next couple of weeks?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Sure. The station divestiture process is robust. There are a number of participants that are moving forward and have advanced into our next round. We do anticipate being in a position to announce the divestiture buyers and stations and markets, and all of those details by the end of the quarter and maybe a little sooner than that.

Marci Ryvicker -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Got it. Any conversation with the FCC or DOJ or anything you can comment on?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

No. Other than, we have made a commitment that we will deliver to them a quote-unquote clean transaction. We won't be asking for any waivers of any existing regulations and we're keeping our eye on the price of closing the big deal.

Marci Ryvicker -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Got it. And then last question, does your net leverage or any commentary on synergies related to Tribune include the real estate sales coming from Tribune?

Tom Carter -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Not in 2019, but in 2020, and really all it is, is a -- would be a cash inflow and a debt reduction because the economics of the real estate really don't materially affect the EBITDA of Tribune, in our view.

Marci Ryvicker -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Got it. Thank you so much.

Operator

Thank you. The next question will come from Dan Kurnos with Benchmark. Please go ahead.

Daniel Kurnos -- Benchmark -- Analyst

Yes, good morning. Heck of a quarter guys. Just quickly to go back on the core. I think the bigger surprise in the quarter was Q4 core strength. Perry , you talked about November and December being particularly strong and we're kind of trying to do the math or crowd. I know it's never really a clean number. But if you could give us a sense of kind of what December was up and kind of what you think sort of ex-crowd out Q4 look like, that would be helpful?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

I can tell you core December was up mid single-digit and the crowd out thing is almost impossible to quantify because the last passenger on the plane pays the highest rate, so some of the political rates were multiples of what regular advertisers pay on a 52-week basis. So it's hard, you would have to assume a static demand and quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year and of course that's not the case. So, I hesitate to comment on that because I wouldn't want to lead you down and exit ramp that goes nowhere. But we did see mid mid single growth in core and as I look at Q1 core revenue again with the comparison of February out of the mix. If I look at January and March taken together, it's a mid single-digit pacing increase on core business, right now.

Daniel Kurnos -- Benchmark -- Analyst

Perfect. That's really helpful. And then obviously you had a bit of a protracted negotiation with TDS which got resolved. I know you guys talked about a pretty healthy retrans outlook. I don't know if those negotiations are getting any more contentious, but it doesn't sound like your outlook has been changed. But if you care to comment on sort of the landscape that you're seeing there?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

You know, there's a deal of contention in every negotiation and ultimately, a constructive conversation. So, I don't think the -- certainly we feel that this is a business and revenue stream that we pioneered that we pay a lot of attention to it, treat it with respect and do a lot of planning and analysis before we begin the negotiation. So I -- the the outage is the exception rather than the rule, if you look at our track record here and I don't think the 2019 renewals will be any different from that, from where we sit today.

Daniel Kurnos -- Benchmark -- Analyst

Great. And then just last, Tom. I don't know if I maybe misheard you, but you said retrans up double digits and assuming that was gross, as your outlook -- you guys outlook changed at all for net for this year and next?

Tom Carter -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

No.

Daniel Kurnos -- Benchmark -- Analyst

And what was that outlook, if you care to reiterate Tom?

Tom Carter -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

It will be low double-digit growth in net retrans this year and slightly more than that next year.

Daniel Kurnos -- Benchmark -- Analyst

Got it. Thank you very much guys.

Operator

Thank you for the question. The next question will come from David Joyce with Evercore. Please go ahead .

David Joyce -- Evercore -- Analyst

Thank you. If you could just provide some more color on a couple of the revenue items. I was just wondering why digital was down, was there some political impact in that somehow. And what should we think about that contributing going forward? And then secondly, on the new to TV advertisers, what should we think about in terms of the upside from there. Are those advertisers who are allocating to local media or they just literally newer companies in your footprint, if you could provide some more color there will be great? Thank you.

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Sure. When you look at our digital revenue number. As reported, there are two components there, local site revenue and then there's Nexstar Digital , which is our digital operating company. Nexstar site revenue for the quarter was up high-single digits and that's usually high-single low-double digit growth, consistently for us. Nexstar Digital, basically the revenue was flattish, but let me read the financial statements from the bottoms up in 2017, Q4, we had negative operating income of about $3 million for Nexstar Digital and in Q4 of 2018, we had positive operating income of approximately $5 million.

So, the lower top line growth was a conscious decision, not to chase on profitable revenue and also the cessation of certain unprofitable lines of business, and you did see we took an impairment charge in the fourth quarter related some of those legacy businesses that will no longer be contributing.

I think on a going forward basis, if I again look at site revenue, January's growth was double-digit and we anticipate that being the case for the quarter on our site revenue and we are off to a good start in Nexstar Digital and I think you'll see a return to a consistent high-single low-double digit growth, as the year progresses on the combined metric.

Your second question was on new to television advertising, If I remember, and these are literally in a local marketplaces, we probably do business consistently with somewhere between 5% and 10% of the registered businesses in the marketplace. And so, our greenfield opportunities, the other 90% of the of the businesses that exist in a local market that don't do business with us. And so, there is a tremendous incentive to develop new business, tremendous commission potential. And so, it's just part of our culture and and quite frankly, I think it will be a driver of post closing growth in the Tribune acquisition, because they've not focused as much on business development in their markets, as I think they will under Nexstar.

David Joyce -- Evercore -- Analyst

Great, thank you very much.

Operator

Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Kyle Evans with Stephens. Please go ahead.

Kyle Evans -- Stephens -- Analyst

Hi, thanks. You guys posted 50% cycle growth, it sounds like in '18 off of '14. Can you help us think that on the '12 and '16 cycles and give us present contribution as a percent of total political for those periods?

Tom Carter -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

'12 is a little far back from a reach perspective for me, I don't have that information, but on '16, I want to say that it was traditionally low relative to other presidential elections and it was probably somewhere in the 20% to 25% contribution of total political. And before it had been closer to 30%.

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. I was going to say almost closer to 40% contribution from presidential, but remember in 2016, President Trump didn't spend a lot of money on his own behalf because of all the free media that he was getting at the time. We don't anticipate that being the case in 2020, but again for being conservative, we're use -- basically using historical numbers for 2020 compared to '16 and the end of '15. So that parallel would be '19 into '20.

Kyle Evans -- Stephens -- Analyst

Could you -- I'm sorry, could you say that last statement one more time?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

So, I'm just saying, we're basically -- we're not assuming huge growth in political revenue in '20 over '16 on a pro forma basis, at this point in time.

Kyle Evans -- Stephens -- Analyst

Okay. Got it. And then I know you can't make detailed commentary here, but I'm interested from a high level kind of your views on Apollo's COGS (ph) transaction, how that either does or doesn't change your operator perspective?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Well, I think it's a net positive for shareholders to have private equity interest in the business because that should help to firm up valuations. My understanding of that. We dropped out of the COGs process when we acquired Tribune because we couldn't acquire COGs under the National ownership gap (ph), but my understanding is that the headline price will be a healthy multiple probably above where the space is trading today. But time will tell and the documents will need to be made public before we can know for sure, but we see it as a net positive in the space, but there is private equity interest and anytime there's another buyer that should help values.

Kyle Evans -- Stephens -- Analyst

Great, thank you.

Operator

Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Zack Silver with B. Riley, FBR. Please go ahead.

Zack Silver -- B. Riley, FBR -- Analyst

Okay, great. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to kind of discuss local viewership and given how compelling the 2018 election cycle was, it seems like that could have provided a nice lift for local news viewership. Can you provide an update on how viewership trends were during the election? And if you have available how they are pacing in December as well as maybe year-to-date?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

As you know, we subscribe to comps for primarily and there is not huge users of Nielsen, suffice to stay there was enhanced interest in local news during the election cycle. We produced 83 debates across our footprint that were well viewed during the election cycle. We don't get a rating book, our November rating book until now and we're in a rating period in February, that we won't see the results until April. So, kind of hard to me to comment on current trends here. But again, we've expanded our local newsprint -- footprint even within our local group and launched additional news broadcasts, since the beginning of the year. And so, we obviously believe it's a good business and we will continue to grow our footprint, which will grow our gross aggregate eyeballs just because of more time periods being programmed for local news.

Zack Silver -- B. Riley, FBR -- Analyst

Got it. Thank you, Perry, and then one more if I could. Can you just give us an update on the tip initiative and when we may see that providing some left to core advertising?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Sure, that's the television interface practices and project or whatever you want to use for the initials, but the whole focus there is to provide more automation to the bay-sell process with local television stations to make the business more profitable for the agencies to do business with us. We are attempting to automate all of the back-end processes, the reconciliations, log times and all of that. We're not focused on the front end of the buy-sell process, but it's more of the automation of all the processes around make goods and invoicing and those kinds of things. And we had a press release, which you should have seen earlier this year, that talked about milestones that we'd achieved and our roadmap of what we look to achieve in 2018.

And our goal is to have the whole back-end process automated and vendors designing to that process, which they are now. And these -- it's basically open standards here at the business rules, here's how we see going about it, let the market determine who are the winners and losers from a technology standpoint, but at least have business rules and common standards, my goal is ultimately searchable APIs, but at this point, we're just taking it a step at a time, but I think if we can remove the friction out of the reconciliation part of the process that will be a huge saving for agencies and we hope the money will flow back to -- an increasing money will flow into spot television because of its superior value proposition for the advertiser, we just have to make it profitable for the agency to do business with us.

So, more will come as the year goes on and our goal is that we'll have the whole back-end process automated by the end of the year and then obviously now it's -- it will be up to agencies to adopt those standards and to implement them when -- and that's our ultimate goal.

Zack Silver -- B. Riley, FBR -- Analyst

Got it. That's interesting. Thank you very much.

Operator

Thank you for your question. The next question will come from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Please go ahead.

Craig Huber -- Huber Research Partners -- Analyst

Yes, hi. Thank you, a few questions. Maybe, I think you said January and March TV pacings were up mid single digits, if you included February. Are you sort of suggesting is up say 1%, 2% for the whole quarter year-over-year as it stands right now?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Let me look. Yes, it's up slightly, probably on the order of about 1% as we see it today.

Craig Huber -- Huber Research Partners -- Analyst

Thank you for that. And then how would you categorize auto relative to that, is it better or worse?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

I have not drove down into category pacing by category yet, but that Tim Busch is in the room. He can comment on that. Tim, do you want to talk about auto pacing for the quarter?

Timothy Busch -- President, Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

Auto pacing has been slowly improving and certainly over prior quarter.

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

So, hopefully that's helpful to you.

Craig Huber -- Huber Research Partners -- Analyst

Yes, appreciate that. You're paying TV subs like say in the fourth quarter, what was that number on a year-over-year basis, was it flat? Up a little bit? Down a little bit?

Tom Carter -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

I would say down a little bit.

Craig Huber -- Huber Research Partners -- Analyst

Okay. And then also wanted to jump over now that your are basically two years off the Media General deal, can you remind us please, how much was the original synergies you've told us where you thought you would get out of Media General deal, and what is it coming out now you look back on it?

Tom Carter -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

The original synergies when we announced the deal were $75 million. When we closed the deal, we up that to $81 million, and I would say obviously we stop keeping count after a little while. But in the first nine months, we totaled between $85 million and $87 million in synergies.

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

And I think we have to give commentary the time that there would be additional synergies in years two and three, which we have realized on the order of single-digit million dollars of contract run-outs and lease cancellations and things like that. So, we've realized that as part of our '19 guidance as well.

Craig Huber -- Huber Research Partners -- Analyst

And do you think the $160 million. I think you've talked about for Tribune has potential upside too, I know it's early, but do you feel pretty conservative about that number?

Tom Carter -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Well, it is what it is until that something different.

Craig Huber -- Huber Research Partners -- Analyst

Okay, thanks a lot guys.

Operator

Thank you. The next question will come from Steven Cahall with Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.

Steven Cahall -- Royal Bank of Canada -- Analyst

Thanks. Maybe first Perry, just to drill down on what you said on the 2020 presidential election. I think a lot of us intuitively agree that it probably won't look like 2016. But just wondering if you could help us sleep a little better with why you think that's the case. Are you hearing that from some of your ad agencies? Are you hearing that from the parties that are putting money to work. So anyway you could couch that would be helpful?

And then, Tom, just on the debt, I think, in December, you said about the Tribune debt refinancing it that we should stay tune. Just wondering if you have any updated thoughts on how you're thinking about the Tribune debt. And just reluctantly (ph) when it comes to debt reduction, is there any value or transaction you think it's possible for food network? Thank you.

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Let me first start with political; Tim Busch, who's President of Nexstar Broadcasting, is in the room, just made a tour of all of the major political agencies in Washington. So let him remark on their pulse of things.

Timothy Busch -- President, Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

I would tell you that the president election is probably going to come earlier this year, meaning for the primary races than we have seen in prior cycles. It will also be more robust because you'll have a larger field of candidates and you may have opposition on the incumbent party. And so, you're also going to see spending that will need to occur from our president, which we did not see in 2016, to that degree. And then lastly, pack and party moneys that should be more robust to support eventual candidates beyond the primary. So, you're going to just see overall activity larger than what we saw in 2016 on both sides of the parties in addition to Bernie Sanders.

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

So, we've never disappointed on political guidance and I think you should just take us at our word that we, as we have more information, we will give more clarity on our guidance. But we are -- I would say you can probably always bet the over on our guidance, but we're going to do database and fact-based projections here and not -- just put a finger in the wind. So, as we get closer and have more data, you will likely see our guidance on political improve, as it has historically. And again, we tend to try and over-deliver on our promises.

As it relates to food network. That's not even on the to-do list of things to be thinking about right now. We're looking for clean divestitures and maximizing that value, regulatory approval, integration and that's -- we're happy to get it checked that we don't have to do a lot of work for as part of our EBITDA, but there's really nothing in the wind regarding food network not even on our radar screen to talk about. Now I'll let Tom answer the debt question.

Tom Carter -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Sure. On the debt, we feel a lot better about the debt capital markets now than we did at year-end. We're not quite back to the levels we were in late November or early December when we did our -- when we got our indications at that time from our financing sources. But clearly, the market continues to grind back to more acceptable levels. And we're not going to give interim updates on the synergy number on Tribune until we have more absolute known, we're doing ongoing diligence on the operating synergies, the financing synergies and the financing costs will be worked into that as well as the divestiture.

So, as soon as we have more known's, then we will give more guidance with regard to the synergies.

Operator

Thank you for the question. We have a question from Jim Goss with Barrington Research. Please go ahead.

Jim Goss -- Barrington Research -- Analyst

Thank you. First, I was wondering the broader national scope and increased penetration in larger markets with the Tribune acquisition, makes me wonder that despite your historical aversion to entertainment programming and maybe that would continue, are there other programming initiatives you think would be a better consideration for you just because they would give you greater chance to monetize your base of operations?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Tim Busch and I have visited so far seven markets that of the Tribune markets that we will be retaining. And I think we've identified opportunities to increase local programming in every one of those markets along the way, and we'll be in Des Moine and Oklahoma City later this week and the roadshow will continue through the first week of April.

So I would say, we still have an aversion to national entertainment programming creating that, but I do think that we can potentially monetize our local programming as a day part or potentially an upfront or an unwired network of our own doing. We participate in unwired networks with our rep firms and other parties event specific that perhaps we can do that under our own power given the national reach we have.

This will be a company with national scale, but focused on local markets and I think that's the thing to remember. And that's what we're good at and that's what we'll continue to strive to get better at.

Operator

Thank you. The next question will come from Barton Crockett of BCS Stocks. Please go ahead.

Barton Crockett -- BCS Stocks -- Analyst

Okay, great, thanks for taking the question. I haven't heard much from you guys about ATSC 3.0 on this call. I was just wondering if you could update what you see the landscape looking like for ATSC 3.0 in 2019, in terms of rollout, in terms of potential building a base for monetization are -- is there still reason to be excited about that or does it look like it is taking a little bit longer than maybe it had been hoped at one time?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Well, I think we've been encouraging folks to kind of cap the brakes on monetization because we've got to go through a repack and then a conversion to ATSC 3.0, most folks are doing that or spending money to get ATSC 3.0 ready, when they do the repack and spend incremental money and I think we have earmarked probably $20 million of our CapEx this year and next for ATSC 3.0 improvements beyond what the FCC would reimburse. And so that's how that this will begin, the first market to participate in a full market conversion is Phoenix. We will be the first ATSC 3.0 lighthouse station, others will provide the 1.0 lighthouse. We're still waiting on some approvals from the FCC to license MODs (ph) to allow us to do that.

So, there's a lot of organization, but our goal is that we have between the Pearl consortium and the Spectrum consortium. And again, we're the only Company in -- with a foot in both of those camps have 20 markets converted by the end of this year. That may be ambitious, but as you know, it's a voluntary transition, you have to get all the parties to agree. And then you've got to negotiate reciprocal tower leases. I mean there's a lot that goes into this and Brett Jenkins our Chief Technical Officer, is probably spending 30% to 40% of his time on ATSC and repack related issues here, but you have a coalition of the willing, it's just the repack itself will take three years plus from where we sit here and then we'll begin the path to monetization once markets do the voluntary conversion to 3.0 transmission technology.

So, all of which is to say, we think it's like having mineral rights and there is value here to be unlocked by the right technology and while it took 20 years to monetize shale oil and gas by improved technology, it's not going take 20 years, but it's going to take 5 to 10 before, this is a real meaningful contributor.

But again, I think it is the next huge value lever for local television because we're the ones that control and can monetize our spectrum. And I think the potential is as big as retrans probably, which is a $10 billion, almost $11 billion industry at the local station level in 2018. So, we think it has that potential, but you just going to have some patience, it's going to take time.

Operator

Thank you. The next question will come from Ryan Vaughan with Needham. Please go ahead.

Ryan Vaughan -- Needham -- Analyst

Hi, Tom And Perry. Thanks for taking my question. Just Tom you mentioned the -- I'm sorry, Perry mentioned that the $10 billion or $11 billion I actually have a retrans question for you. So, you've talked about double-digit growth for years to come. I'm just curious how do you think about that, whether it's coming from virtual MVPD subs growth or is it the distribution option for the pricing expands or is it coming from some of the lower viewership channels that are getting bumped of at certain packages, fully recognizing in the bigger picture that broadcast is under earning relative to what cable is getting today, is a big picture question there?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes, if you look at 2019, the estimate is that total distribution payments are $50 billion and we're getting, let's call it $10 billion or $11 billion. So we're somewhere between 20%, 22% of the pie. And that's for all television stations in aggregate. And all television stations in aggregate typical MVPD home, generate 35% of the cumulative viewing.

So I would say that's your bid and as to begin with, we won't even get into a quality of content -- premium content and what people really want, which is the local television stations. But, we're right now at about a 1.6 million in OTT sub counts. And that number is probably a little less than the actual, because there is a payment lag on that from the networks who are paying us to be part of their offering and so, that is a growth driver.

Again, we've seen our sub count declines really level off. I think people kind of get the bundle and the value of the bundle and they don't want to have four remotes on the coffee table again, and so broadband plus video and navigation is pretty powerful. And so -- but I think the primary driver is going to be from getting our fair share of the distribution bundle. And I think that will occur over the next couple of cycles, which would be three to six years basically.

Operator

Thank you. The final question will come from Dennis Leibowitz with Act II Partners. Please go ahead.

Dennis Leibowitz -- Act II Partners -- Analyst

Yes. What is the same factors that are causing you to raise your free cash flow estimates, moving from '18-'19 to '19-'20 for the core apply to the Tribune stations as well meaning that the total instead of 1950 or even 2050 would be higher than that?

Tom Carter -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

We're not prepared to comment on Tribune '19-'20 free cash flow guidance yet. There's a lot of moving parts that goes into that. I think we want to do it once and we want to do it with full information from synergies, from diligence, from financing, from divestitures, et cetera. But -- we're just speaking for the Nexstar at this point.

Operator

Thank you speakers. This concludes the Q&A portion. I'll turn it back to you for closing remarks.

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Well, thank you all for joining us today in celebrating our record Q4 '18 and full year 2018 results.

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to ORBCOMM's Fourth Quarter 2018 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. (Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded and a replay of this conference call will be available from approximately 7:30 PM Eastern Time today through 7:30 PM Eastern Time on March 13, 2019. The replay service details can be found in today's press release. Additionally ORBCOMM will have a webcast available in the Investors section of its website at www.orbcomm.com.

I would now like to turn the call over to Aly Bonilla, ORBCOMM's Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Aly.

Aly Bonilla -- Vice President of Investor Relations

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'm here with Marc Eisenberg, ORBCOMM's Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Ford, ORBCOMM's Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind you that today's conference call includes forward-looking statements and that actual results may differ from the expectations reflected in these statements. We encourage you to review our press release and SEC filings for a full discussion of the risks and uncertainties that pertain to these statements. ORBCOMM assumes no duty to update forward-looking statements.

Furthermore, the financial information we will discuss includes non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures is included in our press release. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Marc Eisenberg.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Aly, and good afternoon. Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year end -- ending December, 2018. We're going to focus this quarter's call on a number of significant initiatives, I'd like to cover in detail and Mike will then provide an in-depth look at the financials and our 2019 outlook. We'll finish the call by taking some questions. So let's get started.

Looking at the fourth quarter, the first thing that stands out is that hardware sales were light. Hardware sales were down $9 million year-over-year, but if you back out the large deployments with JB Hunt and the U.S. Postal Service hardware sales in the quarter were up almost $2 million. That being said comparative declines have not been our trend and it's not the entire story.

We entered 2018 with a number of initiatives that we believe were absolutely necessary for the long term. While our Company was growing, we were not getting the anticipated leverage in the business. With a desire to improve adjusted EBITDA and optimize our working capital, we embarked on the following initiatives. First, we refreshed nearly all our products with a new feature-rich technology while significantly reducing costs. This gives our customers a better products, while also achieving a jump in product margins.

Second, we set out to change how we manage our working capital. Inventory was hampered by growing lead times, coupled with a wide assortment of products with multiple variations. This led it to escalating inventory levels and dramatically slowed our cash generation. In short, we reduced the number of SKUs. Third, we set out to take our newly acquired Blue Tree in-cab solution to some of our largest customers that needed significant integration with their third-party systems. Had we focused on smaller opportunities, we likely would have had experience faster short-term growth, but that's not a representation of our customer base. Throughout 2018, we further developed our fleet manager in-cab solution to meet the needs of these larger customers.

With these issues in mind, over the course of 2018 we replaced nearly every product in our portfolio with a more-featured less-expensive version. As a result, we've grown our product margins from 13% in Q4, 2017 to almost 28% in Q4, 2018. We've reduced inventory levels by about 30% from our highs of $48 million to $34 million and have cut our SKUs by more than half. With these initiatives, having a -- a negative short-term effect on the hardware revenues, they're having a significant positive effect on adjusted EBITDA, where we improved Q4 year-over-year by almost 80% despite lower hardware revenues.

Let's take a minute to talk about the impact of our product transition on revenues. Over the last couple of quarters with inventory levels of discontinued SKUs running low, we were helping customers work through their valuation and integration process on our new products, while increasing production. Breaking that down on a per product basis, our satellite products are almost completely transitioned. Our reefer product is about 50% transitioned. Our trailer product, the GT1200 line is about 25% transitioned, and our new container product is only just starting to be shipped. With the new products commercially ready and many evaluations completed, we're starting to see the customer reaction we were hoping for.

In our container and ports group, we received an initial order from one of our OEMs for 10,000 units, anticipated to begin shipping in August and we expect to supply their customers total fleet of approximately 200,000 units. We've also completed evaluation programs with five other major shipping companies with additional opportunities totaling between 150,000 and 200,000 units. So combined with all six customers, they represent approximately $70 million in hardware revenue alone. This would be a substantial increase compared to 2018, where the port -- the container and ports group did about $2 million in hardware sales.

In our in-cab group, we've signed letters of intent to our negotiating final contracts to deploy on 10,000 trucks expected this year, which is double what we did last year. Keep in mind, it's only February. Needless to say, we expect revenues to ramp in the back half of 2019. With the 2018 initiatives in place, we successfully improved adjusted EBITDA margins from a low of 12% last year to about 25% in Q4 2018, achieving $57 million for the full-year 2018, a record high for the Company and a 27% increase over the prior year.

Adjusted EBITDA margins achieved in 2018 were also insisted by improvements in service gross margins, increasing from 58% in Q4, 2017 to 68% in Q4, 2018. This was primarily driven by steering away from negative margins realized from managing third-party installation services as well as increased efficiencies in the business. As a result of these efforts, the Company's free cash flow pivoted from using about $24 million of cash in the first half of 2018 to generating about $14 million of cash in the second half. This is the result we expected to achieve and gives us confidence that we're now in a position to be a significant cash generator in 2019 and beyond.

Let's move on to our business highlights. We were selected by Lidl UK, one of the largest supermarket chains in Europe, will be using our cold chain solution to ensure transparency on their refrigerated trucks and trailers. By providing insight alerts and systems integration, we are helping Little gain real-time visibility and control of their assets, while ensuring regulatory compliance and improving customer service.

In addition, Swift, one of the largest transport companies in the United States and a longtime customer of our reefer solution has started to deploy our newly designed cargo product for their intermodal assets. Swift is a great example of a longtime customer that started with one asset class and is now taking advantage of our Double Player Triple Play (ph) bundles, where multiple asset classes utilizing our single integrated platform. These opportunities may use a combination of our in-cab, refrigerated, dry van or intermodal solutions, which is a unique competitive advantage . We've also been selected by SeaCube, a large container leasing company has begun offering our ReeferConnect solution to provide end-to-end visibility and remote control of their refrigerated containers in gensets. SeaCube can bundle ORBCOMM's telematics offerings with a sea container into one lease for one monthly price.

Our partner AT&T fully deployed an additional 70,000 containers from Maersk, after they completed the acquisition of Hamburg Sud in late 2017. All 70,000 devices were activated throughout 2018. The Hamburg Sud deployment demonstrates another key win in the reefer container market. Our resellers in Latin America are gaining market share and have committed to a minimum of approximately 30,000 units in 2019. We've also began significant deployments of our IDP products with a large telecom operator in the Middle East and we can expect them to offer our solution portfolio throughout their sales channels in the region.

We're excited to announce the first significant opportunity deployed by our analytics group with Rehrig Pacific Company, a leader in supply chain solutions to provide our services to power their business intelligence platform. The platform is designed to help Rehrig customers maximize their ROI and assets across their waste management sites, environmental and retail markets. With the addition of ORBCOMM's Analytics, Rehrig enabled its customers to query massive amounts of real-time data in seconds, providing actionable information and visibility into their supply chain, including missed customer container pickups, inefficient routes, driver behavior, inventory management and damaged assets.

Turning to operations, over the last few years, we invested tens of millions of dollars to create and redesign 20 cost optimized feature-rich products that enhance our existing capabilities. We tend to compete more effectively and to improve our product margins. I'd like to go into some detail on a few of these. So you can see the incremental benefits they offer to our customers. For our cargo business, which includes trailers, containers and railcars, we developed a new GT1200 line which replaces the GT1100. This device helps customers locate assets, improve turn times for increased asset utilization, maximize fleet size and improve the speed of cargo delivery to customers. With multiple sensor options, the GT1200 helps containers turn from dark, dumb and disconnected to visible, smart and connected.

Our integrated cargo sensor tells customers if they're asset is full or empty and ready for pickup. Our door sensor reports whether the assets doors are open or close to help manage theft. And geofences alert customers when the asset reaches designated areas to start the loading or unloading process or if the assets deviate from their schedule route. The integrated cargo sensor and the other wireless sensors eliminate the need for up to 40 feet of cable that can take up to an hour to install. With its new streamline design and external installation, the GT1200 could be installed on an asset in just minutes even when the trailer or container is full, making customer deployments quick and efficient with minimal disruption to their operations.

The GT1200 charges 20 times faster than its predecessor even without direct sunlight resulting in three times more messages per day for enhanced visibility and utilization. In addition by offering just a few versions of the GT1200, we were able to reduce the number of SKUs by 80% resulting in faster customer fulfillment, while substantially lowering inventory levels and achieving significant cost savings.

Our new PT 6000 is an industry-leading trailers solution for cold chain temperature control and monitoring compliance, which replaces the RT 6000. Historically a fleet with 3,000 trucks with 3,000 drivers to manage the refrigeration assets, while focusing on their primary objective driving the truck. Connecting the PT 6000 directly to the trucks refrigeration unit takes control out of the hands of the 3000 drivers and puts it in the hands of just a few dispatchers. The dispatcher can adjust unit temperature settings remotely, while the trailers on the move, monitor fuel levels, observe critical diagnostics and respond to maintenance alerts by ordering parts and scheduling repairs before the truck even gets back to the yard. Not only does this add efficiency and save temperature sensitive loads, but in today's market with increasing driver shortages, it maximizes the amounts of driving time.

The PT 6000 includes multiple new temperature probes and humidity sensor, which protects the quality integrity of the cargo, ensures compliance and mitigate cycling losses. The PT 6000 is also the first reefer products sold to the Carrier Transicold dealer network, allowing Carrier customers to remotely update the firmware in the reefer, including new temperature applications. Our next generation IDP products continue to resonate well with customers looking for satellite connectivity for new or existing telematics solutions that are deployed in remote parts of each geographies.

You can take a successful telematics application and add satellite connectivity with a single cable for easy installation. Our new IDP products are ideal for markets such as tuna fisheries, secure cargo transport and oil and gas applications that require satellite coverage. These products utilize our dual mode RFIC custom chip, which was designed to reduce the component counts of our first IDP products from 600 to 1, providing significant cost reductions and higher reliability while making satellite connectivity affordable.

Wrapping up, I'm pleased with the accomplishments of 2018, while we still have a lot of work to do in the year ahead. Our Company's foundation is stronger than it's ever been and we're executing at a higher level. With our margin improvement and cash generation plans on track in an unprecedented number of opportunities in our pipeline, 2019 is shaping up to be a promising year as we expect to make substantial strides in all three key metrics of the business, revenue, margin and profitability.

With that I will turn the call over to Mike to take you through the financials.

Michael W. Ford -- Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon everyone. Let me start with our Q4 results. Total revenue was $66 million compared to $76 million in the same period last year. Keep in mind, last year included over $13 million of revenue from the JB Hunt and U.S. Postal Service deployments. Excluding the revenues of these two customers in both years, total revenue from our base business was up nearly 3% versus Q4 2017. Even with some revenue shifting to the right, we successfully increased adjusted EBITDA to $16.5 million, an improvement of $7 million over the prior year.

There were a number of non-recurring accounting entries in the quarter mostly associated with inthinc and Blue Tree acquisitions, which resulted in a net benefit of $1.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin continued to improve, reaching 24.9% in Q4 '18. This is 40 basis points higher than Q3 '18 and more than doubled compared to Q4 '17. Our adjusted EBITDA performance was primarily driven by higher service and product margins. Q4 service gross margin increased to 67.7% up 90 basis points from Q3 '18 and up over 1,000 basis points from Q4 '17. Product gross margin in Q4, improved to 27.5% compared to 12.7% in Q3 '18 -- Q3 '18, 24.2%. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of increasing product margins.

In Q4, we saw a significant number of our older models SKUs, which carried lower margins and had a negative impact on the impressive 27.5% we reported. We sold off about $9 million of this older inventory in the quarter. Excluding these sales, our Q4 '18 product margins would have been significantly higher. We believe there is further upside to product margins, as we shipped out greater quantities of our cost reduced products to customers in 2019. We ended the year with almost $54 million of cash on our balance sheet strengthening our liquidity position. This was an improvement of nearly $8 million from Q3 '18. Even after making a $10 million interest payment on our debt in October, we generated operating cash flow of $12.4 million in Q4, an increase of $10.2 million compared to the prior year, primarily driven by favorable operating results and reductions in inventory.

With CapEx of $5 million in the quarter, the Company generated free cash flow of $7 million in Q4, our second consecutive quarter with positive free cash flow. With improvements in cash generation, coupled with higher adjusted EBITDA, our Company's trailing 12-month net debt leverage ratio now stands at 3.4 times, down from 3.9 times in Q3 and from our high of 4.9 times in Q1 '18.

Turning to our full year results. 2018 total revenue was $276 million, an increase of about $22 million or 8.6% compared to 2017. This increase is driven by our growing service revenues, which ended the year at $154 million, up nearly $19 million or 13.8% over the prior year. More importantly, full-year recurring service revenue grew 17% over the prior year, driven by nearly 350,000 net new subscribers, bringing our total subscriber count to approximately 2.37 million at year-end.

Contributing to the improvement was steady growth from our AIS business achieving a record high of $11 million in 2018, 17% increase over the prior year. Higher service and product margins drove gross profit margin for the year to almost 47%, a 600 basis point improvement over 2017. Compared to the full-year 2017 product margins climbed 730 basis points and service margin grew 290 basis points. Full year 2018 adjusted EBITDA increased 27% over the prior year to a record $57 million, with adjusted EBITDA margins reaching almost 21%. This is an improvement of $12 million or 300 basis points over 2017. Better operating results, along with improvements in working capital and cash management practices led to operating cash flow of $11 million in 2018 versus $5 million use of cash in 2017. This is $16 million year-over-year improvement. Let me summarize the six key financial highlights of our 2018 performance year-on-year. Revenue was up 8.6%. Service margin was up 290 basis points. Product margin was up 730 basis points, adjusted EBITDA margin was up 310 basis points, operating cash flow was up $16 million, subscriber count increased by nearly 350,000 units.

Moving to our 2019 outlook, they will -- we will provide full-year guidance on recurring service revenue, service margins, product margins, adjusted EBITDA, operating cash flow and capital expenditures. For the full year 2019, we expect recurring service revenues to grow 5% to 7.5% compared to 2018 with service margins anticipated to be between 66% and 68%. We expect product margins to continue increasing throughout 2019 and average over 30% for the full year. We anticipate adjusted EBITDA to be between $70 million and $75 million in 2019, weighted more heavily toward the second half of the year. We expect operating cash flow in 2019 to be approximately $50 million. Capital expenditures are anticipated to run at approximately $25 million this year.

As Mark pointed out earlier, our sales pipeline includes several customer opportunities with large-scale deployments, leading us to provide quarterly guidance on product sales and net subscriber counts, due to the uncertain timing of these deployments. Looking at Q1, we expect product sales to be similar to Q4 '18 as we work through our short-term hardware issues over the course of the quarter. We expect to bring onboard about 70,000 net new subscribers. In summary, we look forward to delivering sales growth, margin expansion, improved profitability and greater cash flow this year.

This concludes our remarks for the call and we'll now take your questions.

Questions and Answers:

Operator

Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And the first question will be from Mike Walkley of Canaccord. Please go ahead.

Mike Walkley -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst

Great, thank you. Marc, just trying to get a little more color on the 5% to 7% recurring revenue guidance. Is there any puts and takes, maybe a drop in the mix for ARPU or some greater churn this year that's pointing to year slower recurring revenue growth versus last year? Thank you.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

I think what we experienced toward the end of 2018 is -- you heard me say that AT&T put on those units. And you remember the ARPUs on those units are just a fraction of what some of the other ones are. So when you're churning the units in normal numbers and you're adding on -- based on that -- based on the ARPU of those units, it had a kind of a slowing effect in Q3 and Q4. I think, we're being conservative in the first half of next year, because we're seeing hundreds of thousands of units that we're going to have to start turning on, especially in that container group and transportation group in the second half. And when that stuff comes on or when you're little back heavy in the year, you don't get the full year effect of the service revenues that are coming on, like you do, if we were installing them early in the year. So I think, when you do the math, that's just the way the timing comes out.

Mike Walkley -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst

Okay, thanks. And just on the short term, just with the adjusted EBITDA guidance and it sounds like there is a little bit of some positive effects that helped in Q4. Should we expect higher OpEx levels from what you posted for Q4 to start the year and a little bit dip in adjusted EBITDA, then kind of build from that level throughout the year that kind of how we should think about it?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

We've been pretty strict with our field organization about OpEx growth. We don't expect to see much growth at all of the course of the coming year. We stabilized the workforce. We don't anticipate adding much of them -- with winning (ph) more employees. We'll be concentrating heavily on cost control as we move forward. We're at the point now where scaling our business is possible and will be a high priority for us.

Michael W. Ford -- Chief Financial Officer

But I think you, Mike, you were referring to the seasonality in the first quarter where there is like another $0.5 million or $1 million, because the spike the -- some of the public company cost to come in earlier in the year. So, yeah, there's probably just like it was last year, it spikes up like $0.5 million or $1 million in costs.

Mike Walkley -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst

Okay, great. Last question from me and I'll pass it on. And just as you look at the pipeline, Marc. Just a little color on kind of the mix of the ARPU and particularly on maybe the Blue Tree. I know that's been getting some good traction, how you see the front of the cab business developing throughout the year? Thank you.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, so I kind of see the Blue Tree stuff or in-cab in general, if you look at Blue Tree and then think, they tend to average around 30-ish, give or take a couple of dollars in the other -- in either direction. And then, the container stuff is kind of in the low single digits, but you're talking about hundreds of thousands of units we expect to be fielding. So, I think the timing can push ARPUs around in multiple directions, but I think if the number is 10 to one, then you end up just where you started between those two.

Mike Walkley -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst

Thank you.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Sure.

Operator

The next question will be from Ric Prentiss of Raymond James. Please go ahead.

Ric Prentiss -- Raymond James & Co. -- Analyst

Thanks, good afternoon.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Hey.

Ric Prentiss -- Raymond James & Co. -- Analyst

Hey. One follow-up on a couple of Mike's questions. If we can go back to the non-recurring items in 4Q that had to do I think you said with inthinc and Blue Tree. What line items did those effect with that $1.5 million, was it revenues? Was it margins? Just kind of where should we think that $1.5 million was in 4Q '18?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

They'll will be in our SG&A line.

Ric Prentiss -- Raymond James & Co. -- Analyst

Okay. And then if we think about the guidance going forward for 2019, I think you've mentioned recurring service, sorry, service gross margins of 66% to 68%. But I think you guys have been putting up kind of closer to 67% already. What would cause service gross margins to go back down into the 66% range versus being able to get up to the 68% range?

Michael W. Ford -- Chief Financial Officer

Not a whole lot. You've got to 66% to 68%. So you're going to model 67%, but I don't know, I mean, to come up with a range of an exact number, I don't know something can happen. You get an increase from one of your terrestrial providers, where we're doing an awful lot of work with Inmarsat. We do have some vendors there. I think that our products, our costs are going to hold steady. In some cases they even fall. So I would probably bet closer to the higher end of that the lower.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

I would. Fair. I think that's a good assumption.

Ric Prentiss -- Raymond James & Co. -- Analyst

Yeah, I just wanted to make sure that it wasn't something unseen or that we didn't know about out there.

Michael W. Ford -- Chief Financial Officer

No. There is nothing in our head. that made us change that number. I think we like that 67%. So we drew ourselves as a point in each direction for the unforeseen.

Ric Prentiss -- Raymond James & Co. -- Analyst

Makes sense. And final one for me Marc, obviously the timing is important as you pointed out to Mike earlier. But if we thought about maybe recurrings service revenue growth like second half '19 over second half '18, how should we think about that, because there is the optics, so the guidance is 5% to 7.5% on an annual basis, but you thought apples-to-apples, like whether it's 1Q '19 over 1Q '18 or 4Q '19 over 4Q '18. Can you help us understand on which order of magnitude kind of what would be a more normal rather than calendar year to look at that kind of growth rate?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

I think, in -- I'm trying to remember what Q1 was last year. So if you took Q4 and just flat, put it over last year, what would the growth be? Let's -- I'm -- these guys feeding me the numbers. Maybe Mike you could answer here?

Michael W. Ford -- Chief Financial Officer

So, yeah, so I think if you expect the first half of the year to be up low-single digits growth year-over-year, the second half of the year will be closer to 10%.

Ric Prentiss -- Raymond James & Co. -- Analyst

Okay. I think that helps Mike's question a little bit more to just understand that the optic looks kind of odd, so that helps, I appreciate.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

I agree, I mean if you take a look at Q4 and you run the Q4 against our own Q1, that's the 5%. So that's the low end. And then any growth on top of that gets you to the higher number.

Michael W. Ford -- Chief Financial Officer

And you we put on -- as we sell more products in the second half of the year, that's when the subscriber show up. So that's when you'll start to see an uptick in our service revenue.

Ric Prentiss -- Raymond James & Co. -- Analyst

And then that leads to probably more sustained growth even on calendar '20 then?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. We haven't seen -- we haven't seen any change -- real change in our churn rates. So I don't -- I think, that you can -- I think you can rely on the subscriber growth following closely the product revenue sales growth. And I think, Rick, the hardware thing that we're dealing with now, I think it's kind of a blip on the radar. I think as we -- if you look at just this container deal that we're talking about, you're going to start shipping about 2,000 a week in August, and if we could stay at that rate, which I don't think we can, it would have to escalate. But you'd be shipping that 8,000 to 10,000 a month for the next 3.5 years. And so I think, there is -- when you're in these big game hunters like we are, you get these peaks and valleys.

Ric Prentiss -- Raymond James & Co. -- Analyst

Yeah, and that gives us some comfort too on the visibility than on the product sales of having that big contracts?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

I would love to see these guys with $70 million worth of backlog versus $2 million of hardware sales in 2017.

Ric Prentiss -- Raymond James & Co. -- Analyst

One other question. You see that one (ph). Have you guys thought about giving backlog numbers as far as what the backlog on sales or product sales or service revenue might be?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Maybe, but let me explain why we come up with something that says first order of 10,000 against the fleet of 200,000. Why it kind of looks like that? There is a long lead item in those components that, it is like four months or five months. So what happens is the OEM is always giving you orders to keep you running four, five months ahead. So you get -- so what you get is a 10,000 in order to get you started in August against a fleet that's much larger. But in fact you continually get these purchase orders as you continue to put up the fleet. Because putting it out a year or two in advance doesn't do them any good.

So just to be clear, that's the way JB Hunt was done. That's the way Hub Group was done. That's the way every deal gets done. So I -- to answer your question, I don't know if the backlog is 200, is the backlog the 10, I don't know.

Ric Prentiss -- Raymond James & Co. -- Analyst

Okay. We'll see you down here in Orlando next week. Take care. Thanks guys.

Operator

The next question will be from David Gearhart of First Analysis. Please go ahead. Mr. Gearhart. Your line is open, you may be muted on your side.

David Gearhart -- First Analysis -- Analyst

Sorry about that. Thank you for taking my questions. My first question for you is just a housekeeping question. Did you provide the AIS revenue for the quarter? Because I think you mentioned $11 million for the year and it would imply, I'm not (ph) having the full number that it's down quarter-over-quarter. So I just wanted to clarify what the number was for the quarter?

Michael W. Ford -- Chief Financial Officer

No, it was flat quarter-over-quarter.

David Gearhart -- First Analysis -- Analyst

Okay. Flat. And then Marc, throughout the year, you were providing forecasted number of net additions 350,000 to 400,000 for the year, you came in at 348,000 for the year, slightly below that. So just wondering if you could quantify the impact for Q4, if that's being pushed into 2019. And if you can give us an update on kind of what you're expecting for the sub number for the year, if possible?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, I think, we're expecting 70,000 for Q1, because the hardware is going to be similar to Q4 and we shipped about 75,000 units in Q4 of hardware. I think, that's the struggle with the timing on the hardware. I think, if everything kind of goes off flawlessly, which it never does, and we're shipping all these container units and bunch of trailer units and all the stuff we're looking at, it would be well over 100,000 in the back half of the year. But the timing is what's pulling back us our ability to give you full-year hardware guidance. So it's the same problem.

David Gearhart -- First Analysis -- Analyst

Okay and then lastly from me. Just one of your initiatives, I know, that you've been working on, is rationalizing your acquired platforms kind of standardizing on the Blue Tree platform and just wondering where you are with those efforts?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

So seven platforms, web platforms are going to move into one. We call it Project Synergy. And I think all along the plan is to have that available in Q2. But all new customers are already being deployed on it. So there is the conversion, but in terms of new customers are already being deployed that way. So in Q2, what's going to happen is people that have been on the old platforms are going to have visibility on both platforms. They're going to be able to run them both concurrently and while we're going to keep those old platforms alive, we're not going to do any more development on it.

David Gearhart -- First Analysis -- Analyst

Got it. That's it from me. Thanks so much.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Sure.

Operator

The next question will be from Mike Malouf of Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Please go ahead.

Eric Des Lauriers -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

Hi guys. This is Eric Des Lauriers on for Mike. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, if you could just dive a bit more deeply into ARPU? I know there is obviously a mix difference between you're Blue Tree and inthinc products and your container products. But I was wondering if you could kind of give us your take on how -- where you expect the bottom to be come down pretty steadily for the past four quarters. And just wondering if you guys see that trend continuing or if this Q4 range is about bottoming out? Thanks.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Well, I think those Blue Tree products, while the backlog keeps building and the workload for the engineers keeps building, Q4 didn't have an actual lot of shipments. We're getting more orders, we're getting more excitement, but we still have a huge amount of integration that the engineers are doing. So you didn't get any of the impact. But when I said -- when we say a quarter of 70,000 net adds, those are net adds. So the gross adds it could be north of 100,000 and then you add some new churn and over the last year you turned on 70,000 of those AT&T units at these super low ARPUs. And then your churn could be $4 ARPUs, $5 ARPU, $6 ARPUs. So those units kind of cancel each other out. The rest of your subscribers you're putting on have to eat up the difference, and it's been ticking away from -- ticking away from ARPUs. And I think that's literally what you've been seeing in the ARPU.

So the -- I think, there's maybe one or two partnership deals with AT&T, that we're still looking out of the six that I talked about on the call today. One of them is an AT&T deal and six of them are not. So as opposed to one of these deals that's kind of turned upside down, when you're ARPU shrink. But you have you know very low costs. The deals that are coming forward ORBCOMM is the lead on these deals. So the economics are kind of turns right side up like a normal ORBCOMM deal. So I think that should be helpful.

Eric Des Lauriers -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

Okay. So do you think that this sub 5 range that we've seen in the back half of the '18 should, basically touch the bottom out and then start to trickle up again or is this kind of like the new normal do you think?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

I hope so. I think, that's the case. The only reason I'm hesitating is the Blue Tree units, I think those are the ones that are -- they're going to come in the back half of the year. We're pretty certain of that. So I think, that's going to help us. And then, I think we're going to close 400,000 or 350,000 units on the container side. And if they all zoom into this year, good news is, wow, you're going have some great revenues. (Inaudible) is they are a a lower ARPU than the average and if it kind of get some split over the course of the next two years, it could be more balanced. So I think, it still depends on the mix. But I just want to emphasize that regardless of what the ARPUs are -- there is not a single sub that's a bad sub. If you look at some of these licensing subs, where the ARPUs are all the way down at $1. There's no cost on those. There is no -- in the cost of service line there's nothing there. So it's a great sub. A $30 with the $6 cost is a better sub, but it's still -- from a margin perspective, it's a good, but it's not as good as the service one. So I'm kind of routing for all of them and let the chips fall where they may.

Our ARPU has been dropping over time because of pricing concerns. It's all mix.

Eric Des Lauriers -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

Sure. Yes. That definitely makes sense. I was just trying to get a gauge of where do you expect the mix. Thanks guys. I appreciate the color.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Thanks.

The next question will be from Mike Latimore of Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

Pavan -- Northland Capital Markets -- Analyst

Hi guys. This is Pavan (ph) on for Mike Latimore. I have two questions. What percentage of your shipments now are from newer low-cost products?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

I'm sorry, say that again. The new products?

Pavan -- Northland Capital Markets -- Analyst

What percentage of your shipments now are from newer low-cost products?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. So in my script, let me say 50%. But of that 50%, the satellite products are complete, the GT1200 which is the cargo product was -- we only shipped 3,500 of them, because that's all we built last quarter in time, so that was -- I don't know 25%. If you look at the PT 6000, which was the reefer product, it was about 50% and the cargo products for the most part that was just hundreds of units, but we're not shipping the old ones. So it was 100% of a very, very low number, but I guess if you were to just rough estimate, average all those things out, it would be about half.

So there is a long way to go. I mean, Mike said something, I went and did the math, because if I was struggling to believe it and then we're kind of parked here with our Chief Accounting Officer that was splitting out the numbers. We did $9 million of the old products at high-teen margins. And then the other 50% -- whatever we did it averaged to 27.5%.

Pavan -- Northland Capital Markets -- Analyst

Okay, thank you. So my second question is related to Chinese tariffs. Are you seeing any difficulty in sourcing components or like -- is there any impact, which we could expect on the income statement going forward?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

China kind of scares me. I think the good news in China is we've got upside there. We're in the middle of installing an earth station and we're going we're going to go into China, assuming that whatever these issues are, by the time we get installed it will work out and if not, it's not like like an incredible investment, but I don't think there's anything built into our plan or our guidance today that -- some tariff or something is going to blow up in China. We've got upside there. There's very little business there today. There's almost no downside, but our plan is to go forward.

Pavan -- Northland Capital Markets -- Analyst

Yeah. Thank you. That's all for me. Thank you.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Sure.

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Your next question will be from Chris Quilty of Quilty Analytics. Please go ahead.

Chris Quilty -- Quilty Analytics -- Analyst

Thanks. Marc, it sounds like you've done a tremendous transition on the hardware side, but I know you've always got some new tricks in your back pocket. Can you talk about what is next or what you have in development in terms of hardware and is it having already done cost reduction, are you targeting new markets or new applications, what's the emphasis on the hardware side?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Well, the emphasis on the hardware is, I don't know, it feels like each each one has a different story. And Chris, you've been -- this is 50th call. So I'm guessing this is your 50th call. So, like -- and I know you're -- you've got such great expertise in satellite, but our goal on the satellite side is -- I think the satellite business across the entire IoT is growing -- it's growing, but it is not growing like the cellular side is growing and the reason it's not growing is as you know, it's not features. I mean, gee, you've got a platform, that's going to last for an awful lot longer than 2G converting to 3G or 3G converting to LTE.

Plus, you get all the benefits of global coverage. I think everyone would want to you satellite, but that being said, the price per byte and the price for the hardware, it's always been a very difficult comp for satellite and why satellite struggled and when you can take 600 components and put it down on one chip. The idea is to make satellite affordable. Blue Tree -- Blue Tree is super cool. It's a in the in-cab side and it is a perfect customer for dual mode, but they never were able to do dual mode before, because if they sourced it from one of our competitors, then the cost of just the 15% of the time they would have used satellite would have been greater 5x what the cellular was and then you were burdening it with this great hardware and then we figure to ourselves.

As opposed to 10% of the in-cab business being satellite, what is the price point that makes it 30%? What is the price point that makes it 50%? What is the price point that makes it 100%? And how could we get there, right? That is the -- that is the purpose there. The other big one is, this container business, Maersk, went first. They are up to 350,000 to 400,000 units now with the acquisition of Hamburg Sud. Everyone's going to do something, it feels like over the next year or two years, we think we're going to win the lion's share of that business. And it's funny, I'm sitting there with these customers and it's not, gee, your competitors here and you're there and what makes you excited. That's not what we're seeing at all. What we're seeing is, this is the price that -- makes this a positive return for us. And this is the go forward or not go forward.

It's almost like that discussion that we had with JB Hunt. And we went, pulled the cost out of it, ripped it apart and the good thing here is the volumes are so damn high, right. So you have the economies of scale. So that is part of it. And then secondly, we did a -- we took a long time to take a look at the model and took a step back and -- yeah, we had a little hardware blip this quarter. It's not going to matter, but you have this hardware blip in the quarter. But what's really -- look at what's happening here, right. You had some sales that weren't profitable last year and you've like more than doubled your -- you more than doubled your margins at a small decrease in hardware, and I think it all day. All day, right. Of course, you do.

And I think in order to get running on all three cylinders, in order to get the margins back in line, to get our cash in line because, well, we had too many skews and in order to get the revenues up, we took 2018 to -- I mean this is the year of the product and these things are really cool.

Chris Quilty -- Quilty Analytics -- Analyst

Got you. And Mike, I mean, clearly you're focused on cash flow -- free cash flow generation, but at some point what becomes the primary goal here in terms of delevering to a certain level or do you start to look at tack-on acquisitions once again?

Michael W. Ford -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. I think we will -- we're going to get on too fast, right? We're going to generate as much cash as we can between now and when our debt comes due. And we can start to pay it down. But between now and then, we're going to -- we'll have -- we'll have positive operating cash flow, even positive free cash flow I believe from this point going forward. So, two years from now, when it's time to make our final decision about what to do with our debt, if we are in an economy where there are acquisition bargains, there are attractive technology we want to buy, we'll go down the acquisition path. If there are not any good bargains there, then we'll consider we can -- we will consider restructuring our debt.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

I don't think you're thinking far different than what we are, Chris. We are just looking at the math. 2020, your (inaudible) disappears and you've got a 4% penalty to refinance; 2021, it's 2% and 2022, It's -- there's no penalty. So that's just a whole lot of math, right?

Chris Quilty -- Quilty Analytics -- Analyst

Yeah.

Michael W. Ford -- Chief Financial Officer

Because of our increased EBITDA, our cash is on the balance sheet -- our leverage ratio, as I mentioned those earlier. They will be much more attractive by the time it's -- we are ready to make a decision about what to do with our debt. So we're going to have more options this time around than we did last time.

Chris Quilty -- Quilty Analytics -- Analyst

Great. And final question here. When you look at the company structure, you've had a lot of consolidation of hardware and manufacturing in the EMS providers is the structure of the company in terms of number of facilities and capabilities, where you want it, do you see a need to expand or are there areas where you can make some cuts?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

I think in terms of where we are, there are definitely areas of excellence that have evolved in the company based on the acquisitions. Some offices have been shrunk down, other ones have been built up. But if you look at ORBCOMM as a whole, if you want to know where ORBCOMM does it's hardware, it's in Ottawa, Canada. May be supported by some other building, but there are 145 people in Canada and predominantly they do hardware engineering.

The largest office ORBCOMM has believe it or not, it is not in Dulles, Virginia, it's in Hyderabad, India. Hyderabad is about 160 employees and that is where the overwhelming majority of customer service and where most of our web design is. Our in-cab products are really designed out of go away. There is so damn talented there. We couldn't consider moving them. And then our space operations are in Dulles, Virginia. I think, we've really kind of built, even through acquisition, the people that came through the acquisition are not necessarily doing exactly what they were doing then. So I think that's worked out pretty well for us.

Are there efficiencies out there? Yes, there's always efficiencies out there and I think, we can find them. I mean, if you're thinking that you know the Company goes from 860 employees to 500 and to be able to support the growth that we're looking to achieve, not likely. But that being said, if we're wrong, and the business isn't what we think it is, then there is certainly opportunities there.

Chris Quilty -- Quilty Analytics -- Analyst

One final, if I can. You just had the announcement a couple of days ago with the Rehrig Pacific and the poorly named Analytics Services, which is sort of a generic name. But clearly that looks like something that you're selling now as a separate service software platform. Can you add a little bit there of color in terms of -- does this become a branded packaged product or is it just an add-on to existing customers in terms of capability and can that help drive some of service margins up.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes. So -- let me start by saying, if you have a better name for it, you know my -- you've got email, you've got text, you've got my phone number, whatever you need. But I get it's a bit of a buzzword these days. But we really are doing it. I mean for Rehrig, it's pretty neat. They've got this -- garbage is a good busines, right. They monitor these garbage trucks and they're monitoring it by the second. When they miss a stop, they know precisely where it is and how to reroute and go around. I mean it's pretty incredible what they're able to do and we were put up against some of the biggest companies that you've heard of. And we were able to get the timeliness and get that data spun much quicker than they were. So I think that's pretty neat.

But for Rehrig, it looks like a sub-times ARPU deals. It does. Because it's not really a telematics deal, it's something that we're doing on top of what they already have. So, there is no telecommunications, but it's just software times ARPU. And I think, when there is something unique, that's kind of the model, it could be a flat fee or something. But I think that is a portion of the business. The real part of -- not the real, but the other part of the business is taking some of our best practices and some of the data that we have across entire fleets and helping companies with best practices, helping customers with gee. I mean, there is everything you want to know about reefers.

There's is only one company that knows at all and that's ORBCOMM or that business or how long the average time that you are sitting there waiting to unload or be picked up or whether you're using the amount of time you use continuous cool versus start-stop, and driver efficiency over time. I mean there's so much stuff that we already know that we are almost -- those are the next generation stuff that we're building. And I think, we're perfectly happy to continue offering to a refrigerated customer, let's say, the product that they have today, but maybe for another $2 or $3 of ARPU. They can kind of get the LinkedIn plus as an example.

Chris Quilty -- Quilty Analytics -- Analyst

Great. Thank you for the color and good luck with that.

Prepared Remarks:

Operator

Good morning and welcome to the Cheniere Energy Incorporated Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call and Webcast. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Randy Bhatia, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

Randy Bhatia -- VP of Investor Relations

Thanks, operator. Good morning and welcome to Cheniere Energy's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. The slide presentation and access to the webcast for today's call are available at cheniere.com. Joining me for today's call are Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO, Anatol Feygin, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer and Michael Wortley, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all listeners that our remarks, including answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements.

And actual results could differ materially from what is described in these statements. Slide 2 of our presentation contains a discussion of those forward-looking statements and associated risks. In addition, we may include references to non-GAAP financial measures such as consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the appendix of the slide presentation. As part of our discussion of Cheniere Energy Inc's results, today's call may also include selected financial information and results for Cheniere Energy Partners LP or CQP. We do not intend to cover CQP's results separately from those of Cheniere Energy Inc.

The call agenda is shown on slide 3. Jack will begin with an overview of our 2018 operating and financial highlights and perspective on 2019 and beyond. Following Jack's comments Anatol will provide an update on the LNG market and Michael will review our financial results. After prepared remarks we will open the call for Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO.

Jack Fusco -- President and CEO

Thank you, Randy and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to be here this morning to review our significant accomplishments from a very successful 2018. To share my optimism for the continued success as we look forward to 2019 and beyond. 2018 was a truly remarkable year for Cheniere. On last year's call I described 2017 as our breakthrough year which is certainly was. In 2018, we maintained our momentum achieving excellence in reaching new heights in virtually all phases of our business.

From commercial success achieved by signing over 7 million tons per year, a new long-term SPAs. To the FID of Corpus Christi Train 3 in May and the start up of Corpus Christi Train 1 few months later. To continued financial discipline and simplification of our corporate structure. We've achieved those and much more and in doing so have cemented our reputation as a reliable full service LNG operator which delivers on its promises to its customers, employees and stakeholders.

In 2018, we executed on our strategic growth plans, operational plans and financial plans and the results of our execution are apparent in the financial results we reported earlier this morning. Slide 5 presents some key highlights of the fourth quarter 2018. There are a couple of achievements I'd like to highlight from this slide. We generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of over $630 million and the the distributable cash flow of approximately $130 million. And produced and exported a record 80 cargoes on the quarter almost a cargo a day. In addition, we reached the commissioning milestone of our first cargo at both Train 5 at Sabine Pass and Train 1 at Corpus Christi.

As of year-end we had exported four commissioning cargoes from Train 5 at Sabine Pass and two from Train 1 at Corpus Christi. Our substantial commercial momentum continued in the fourth quarter, as we signed long-term SPAs with both Polish oil and Gas Company and Petronas for over 2.5 million tons per year in aggregate. We look forward to successful long-term relationships with our newest SPA customers and expect these SPAs to support our growth plans.

The market for LNG contracting remains active and we continue to pursue additional long-term commercial arrangements with new and existing counterparts worldwide. Turning now to slide 6, a look of some of 2018s most notable highlights. Financial results for the first year 2018 came in at the top end of our guidance ranges for both consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow. As we generated more than $2.6 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and approximately $600 million in distributable cash flow for the full year.

Michael will cover these results in more detail. But our financial performance in 2018 improved throughout the year. And we are pleased to deliver full-year financial results at or above our upwardly revised guidance range. In 2018, we executed two important market transactions that I'll highlight briefly. First, we closed the merger with CQH in which we opportunistically and economically, simplified our corporate structure. Our corporate structure remains complex and we would prefer to be simpler, however, we will remain opportunistic and only pursue further simplification transaction to the extent they are economic LNG shareholders.

In addition to the CQH transaction in 2018, we also refinanced the remaining term loans at CQP into the bond market. Economically addressing the nearest term maturity in our complex and further demonstrating our commitment in managing our balance sheet throughout the corporate structure. Operationally in 2018, we produced and exported a total of 273 cargoes which required over 1 quadrillion BTUs of gas to our terminals. Our teams in gas supply and operations made the significant operational and logistical achievement look easy and their dedication and commitment to excellence are significant contributors to our reputation as a reliable operator.

Strategically 2018 was an incredible success, as we made a positive final investment decision on Train 3 at Corpus Christi and originated over 7 million tons per year of new long-term SPAs, giving us sufficient visibility on Train 6 at Sabine Pass that enables us to finalize the EPC contract. An issue limited notices to proceed on that project late last year. Having that project under way, the limited notice to proceed is strategically important for us. As we have cost and date certainty on Train 6 ahead of a formal FID which is where efforts are concentrated today.

The FID of Train 6 is one of my key priorities for 2019 which I'll address on slide 7. On this slide I have included a few key priorities which highlight that our focus remains centered on growth, execution and being disciplined toward the capital. We are focused on completing the remaining steps necessary to achieve FID of Train 6 which we expect to occur over the coming months. As we have previously communicated we expect to finance Train 6 with approximately 50% debt and 50% equity, which is consistent with our strategy of deleveraging through growth.

Ahead of that FID, Bechtel is hard at work on Train 6 and making excellent progress at its scope of work. Bechtel now estimates that Train 6 is approximately 14% complete, highlighted by over that 3300 piles already driven as part of the site preparation. Beyond Train 6, we are focused on progressing Stage 3 at Corpus Christi through the permitting process which we are permitting for approximately 9.5 million tons of additional LNG capacity. This project is moving through the process very well. We expect to have all the required regulatory approvals in place by the end of 2019.

We expect to bring three trains into commercial operations during 2019. Train 5 at Sabine Pass and the first two trains at Corpus Christi. As we have done with all the trains to date, we expect these three to be brought online safely, ahead of schedule within budget. Completing commissioning and start-up as well as commencing long-term contracts associated with new trains, is a significant undertaking and requires a tremendous amount of work and coordination among Cheniere, our EPC partner Bechtel in our foundation customers.

These efforts are especially critical for 2019, as we will be starting up three trains and commencing long term SPAs for Train 5 at Sabine Pass, Train 1 at Corpus Christi and I am focused on maintaining our track record for seamless transitions from construction to operations. The performance test for Train 1 at Corpus Christi has been successfully completed and we expect substantial completion to occur in the next few days.

Last priority, I'd like to highlight is our plan to communicate the capital allocation policy. This is a high priority for the executive team who are working closely with our advisors and our Board of Directors to ensure we develop a durable flexible policy that enables us to allocate capital. The most effective impactful way for our shareholders. We look forward to communicating it to the investment community in the coming months. As I said earlier, 2018 was a remarkable year for Cheniere. And we are proud of the accomplishments we achieved throughout the year, we have many more successes we're pursuing both in 2019 and beyond. And my confidence in our ability to continue delivering on our promises underscored our people and the relentless focus on execution that continues to define Cheniere. And now, I'll turn it over to Anatol, who will provide an update on the market.

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Thanks, Jack, and good morning everyone. Please turn to slide 9, 2018 was a banner year for LNG in many regards. Globally 9 Trains started service increasing global supply by roughly 30 million tonnes. The largest year-on-year increase since 2009 when Qatar began to bring its mega trains online. New and expansion trains in Australia, Russia and the U.S. push total global supplies over the 320 million tonne mark, according to preliminary data. In the U.S., exports from our facilities totaled nearly 19 million tons during the year, a 33% increase over 2017. The Sabine Pass Train 4 started commercial deliveries in March and Train 5, which is currently undergoing commissioning exported its first cargo in November. Also in November, we saw start-up of the first greenfield LNG terminal in the lower 48 U.S. as Train 1 at our Corpus Christi facility started producing LNG and exported two commissioning cargoes before the end of the year.

We expect LNG production from our facilities and others in the U.S. to continue ramping up in the coming months and contribute to further enhancing the reliability, flexibility and liquidity of the global LNG market. Strong global LNG supply growth was met with robust demand in 2018, that led to some late year market rebalancing. Demand growth in Asia absorbed virtually all of the incremental supply, the step up in global production, especially in the fourth quarter when the global complex added more than 10.5 million tonnes year-on-year. Ensured adequate supply availability for Asia and the rest of the world as mild winter temperatures kept price spikes in check and supported an uptick in imports into Europe which added over 4 million tonnes year-on-year in 2018.

The graph on the top right displays the fourth quarter of 2018 demand compared to that what we saw in fourth quarter of 2017. As you can see China along with the rest of Asia had strong year-on-year increases in imports. For the month of November, China overtook Japan as the world's top importer although the position went back to Japan in December. Total European demand increased nearly 7 million tonnes in the quarter, which as I mentioned was partially supported by mild weather in Asia, new LNG supply coming online and high shipping rates that incentivized Atlantic source cargoes to target Europe.

I'll come back to weather in Europe in just a minute. Global gas price benchmarks in the fourth quarter saw higher levels and increased volatility compared to the same period in 2016 and 2017. However, even with a brief spike in Henry Hub prices in December. The U.S. benchmark continue to trade at a heavy discount compared to other global gas price indices. Despite a mild winter and a reduction in the storage deficit seen earlier in the year. TTF prices traded more than a $1.50 higher than levels seen during the same time a year ago.

Similarly, fourth quarter Asian spot prices settled at more than $3 higher on average year-on-year though the premium decreased over the course of the quarter. Please now turn to slide 10. More than 20 countries, almost half of all LNG importing countries had record annual LNG import levels in 2018 including China, South Korea, India and Pakistan. In addition to record import levels China and Pakistan also set records for LNG demand growth rates in 2018.

The graph to the far left highlights how remarkable China's demand has been over the past two years. China alone absorb more than 50% of the worldwide incremental supplies in 2018 adding 16 million tonnes above the 2017 level. China remains an important demand center for our product and the country's need for natural gas and LNG is expected to continue to rise as the country balances its economic growth needs and environmental commitments.

South Korea's steady demand over the last two years has also been impressive. Demand growth was largely due to low nuclear utilization as well as lower coal-fired power generation resulting from policies intended to improve air quality. Looking ahead to 2019 for South Korea, LNG consumption taxes are set to decrease while coal taxes are set to increase which of course is expected to be supportive of LNG demand. Pakistan which began importing LNG in 2015 has shown consistent in growing demand and regasification build-out in the early 2020s could make Pakistan a significantly larger importer than it is today.

The middle graph shows the total accumulation of population weighted heating degree days for the heating season in Asia. Populous areas of East Asia have seen mostly minor cold spells this winter and the month of January finished on an extremely mild note. Asia's heating degree days an indicative of factor of weather-driven demand ran close to average at best for much of the early part of the winter. Nonetheless, prices remained fairly robust, compared to last year. The graph on the far right shows spot prices in relation to crude oil for the past three years. Price levels in the first half of '18 were higher than in 2017 and particularly more bullish from June to November probably due to China's early buying ahead of the winter in order to secure more LNG and avoid shortages and price spikes in the winter.

High Asian LNG storage levels, combined with the arrival of new supply in the fourth quarter and a fairly mild winter resulted in more moderate prices in the fourth quarter. Please turn to slide 11 where I'll highlight the European market. LNG imports to Europe reached record levels in December. European LNG imports during the first three quarters of 2018 were actually lower year-on-year. But the fourth quarter showed very strong levels for a number of reasons. Storage levels were at a 17-year low after the 2017-18 winter in Europe leaving the region to play catch-up throughout the year.

The relative tightness in the global LNG market through the first three quarters left limited opportunities for storage replenishment. Early buying and mild temperatures in Asia left that region adequately supplied and elevated shipping rates. High coal and carbon prices and an uptick in global LNG production incentivized flows into Europe in the fourth quarter. Nuclear maintenance and domestic supply declines also supported imports. The middle graph shows a total accumulation of population weighted, heating degree days for the heating season in Europe through January 24.

Europe has also seen mild weather this winter, particularly in December making the regions heating degree days below average in the fourth quarter. Cooler temps in the back half of January have helped bring Europe's temperatures closer to average for the season which should help with the weather sensitive demand. However, given all of the factors encouraging LNG flows into Europe, we do not view the increase is entirely weather driven.

The graph on the far right displays storage levels on the left and TTF prices on the right axis. As mentioned earlier, the store situation Europe faced coming out of the winter of 2017 exerted upward pressure on TTF prices. Europe entered the third quarter with storage levels near the bottom of the 5-year range which contributed to upward pressure on TTF prices. In the fourth quarter, prices were still more than $3 an MMBTU, higher the level seen in the fourth quarter of 2017. Although they have moderated particularly after October settlement.

Europe is undergoing a structural shift in the overall dynamics of its gas market, which makes it an increasingly attractive region for both our long-term and shorter term LNG strategies. There is debate in Europe heightened in recent weeks about limiting coal use and achieving climate targets that could have a significant positive impact on Europe's appetite for LNG in the longer term. In the near term a number of the issues that were in play in the fourth quarter could remain in 2019. Potentially, resulting in continued robust European LNG imports again this year. I'll now turn the call over to Michael to review our financial results.

Michael Wortley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Thanks Anetol and good morning everyone. Turning to slide 13 for the fourth quarter, we generated net income of $67 million consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $634 million and distributable cash flow of approximately $130 million. Our results for the quarter were positively impacted by higher than forecast LNG volumes and revenue and lifting(ph) margins. As well as lower than forecast O&M expenses. For the full year, we generated net income of $471 million consolidated adjusted EBITDA of over $2.6 billion, distributable cash flow of approximately $600 million.

As Jack mentioned consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow for the full year were both at the top of the revised guidance ranges we provided on our third quarter call. Exported 285 TBtu of LNG from our liquefaction projects during the fourth quarter, of which 21 TBtu were commissioning volumes. Total volumes exported were higher than exports in the third quarter due to commissioning volumes from Sabine Pass Train 5 and Corpus Christi Train 1 and higher seasonal production from the four trains in operation at Sabine Pass.

Approximately 72% of the volumes exported during the quarter are 260 TBtu were listed by our third party long term SPA customers and the remaining 79 TBtu were lifted by our marketing functions. Long-term SPA customer volumes were consistent with prior quarter and marketing volumes were higher due to increased production and commissioning volumes. The full year and we exported 976 TBtu from our liquefaction projects, of which 21 TBtu were commissioning volumes. Approximately 77% of total volumes 756 TBtu were lifted by a third-party long term SPA customers and 220 TBtu were lifted by our marketing functions.

In the fourth quarter, we recognized an income 242 TBtu of LNG produced at Sabine Pass, consisting of 263 TBtu loaded during the quarter, plus 3 TBtu or one cargo loaded in the prior quarter, but delivered and recognized in the current quarter. Last 25 TBtu or 7 cargoes sold on a delivered basis that were in transit as of the end of the fourth quarter. We also recognized an income 40 TBtu or 12 cargoes of LNG that were sourced from third parties. The full year, we recognized an income 973 TBtu of LNG produced at Sabine Pass and 84 TBtu of LNG that were sourced from third parties. Five commissioning cargoes from Sabine Pass Train 5 in Corpus Christi Train 1 totaling 17 TBtu of LNG were recognized on our balance sheet as an offset of $140 million to LNG terminal construction in progress during the fourth quarter. One commissioning cargo exported during the fourth quarter was on the water at year-end and will be recognized as an offset to construction in progress during the first quarter of 2019.

Net income attributable to common stockholders for the fourth quarter was $67 million or $0.26 per share consistent with the third quarter. Increased operating income due to additional LNG volumes recognized in revenue was offset by increased derivative loss related to interest rate swaps. Full year 2018, we generated net income attributable to common stockholders of $471 million or $1.90 per share on a diluted basis. An increase of more than $860 million from a net loss of 393 million in 2017.

Increase in net income was primarily due to increased income from operations as a result of additional trains in operation at Sabine Pass. Decreased loss on modification or extinguishment of debt, increased derivative gain and decreased net income attributable to non-controlling interests, partially offset by increased interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. During the fourth quarter we amended our existing revolving credit facility. Increasing total commitments to $1.25 billion and extending the maturity date to December 2022.

This undrawn revolving facility enhances our liquidity position and provides a backstop for Corpus equity funding obligations. Turn now to slide 14 where I'll review our 2019 guidance and touch on the highest priorities for 2019. Jack mentioned earlier, we remain focused on delivering results and today we are reiterating our full year 2019 consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.9 billion to $3.2 billion. A distributable cash flow guidance of $0.6 billion to $0.8 billion. We are also reconfirming our full year 2019 CQP distribution guidance of 235 to 255 per unit.

Our actual results could be impacted by changes to train completion timing or LNG market pricing. Before turning the call over to Q&A, I'd like to briefly review our top three financial priorities for 2019. First is to achieve financial results within these guidance ranges. Second priority is to complete the debt financing transaction for 50% of the total cost of Sabine Pass Train 6. (inaudible) that process and it is an essential step prior to reaching FID. Jack also mentioned this that our final key priority for this year is to develop and communicate capital allocation strategy. A process, which has been under way for several months now.

As we have previously indicated, we expect our capital allocation plan to support our ability to invest in growth, enable us to maintain investment grade credit metrics at the projects and ensure that consolidated leverage is at an appropriate level and return capital to shareholders in a way most appropriate (inaudible) our shareholders. We expect to communicate this policy to the investment community in the coming months. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions.

Questions and Answers:

Operator

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We'll now take our first question from Christine Cho from Barclays. Please go ahead.

Christine Cho -- Barclays -- Analyst

Good morning, everyone.

Michael Wortley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Good morning, Christine.

Christine Cho -- Barclays -- Analyst

I know it's early for Corpus Christi Stage 3 and it depends on the contracts, but how are you thinking about targeted financing for it, especially as you are in the process of developing your capital allocation policy. Should we also think of it as 50-50 bet equity similar to Train 6?

Michael Wortley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, Christine. It's Michael. That's how we're thinking about it, continue to deleverage through growth, with no more than 50% debt on all incremental projects and maybe you can bring that down over time.

Christine Cho -- Barclays -- Analyst

Okay and then I think on the last quarter call you said that 2.5 to 3 mtpa was the assumption for early cargoes this year. Has the contracting for this book increased since last quarter and how should we think about your strategy around this, as we move through the year? And should we still think $5 margin for the uncontracted portion, this is what we should assume?

Michael Wortley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yes, this is Michael again. So I think the number is more like 6 million tonnes. I think is of post COD volumes with another 1.5 million on top of that a commissioning volumes which won't hit the P&L. I don't know exactly how the portfolios evolved over the past few months, but certainly we've been selling one thing to keep in mind is we don't like to sell volumes until we know we have them, right until we go through this commissioning process. There's always uncertainty about exactly when the train is going to come on. So we don't want to get out of our skies having placed a lot of volume prior to getting the train.

So with that starting to become behind us as Jack mentioned Corpus passed the performance test recently. So we have more certainty there. So the guys will definitely be more active in putting those volumes away. In terms of market you guys can all see the screen like we can. I told you for the unsold piece of our portfolio we were assuming $4.5 to $5.5 margins when we did our budget, three or four months ago. Clearly that has come in, probably almost $2 and so we gave you that sensitivity on the last call that said, for every dollar move in margin it affect our EBITDA by $130 million. So you can do that math. So if we were in upper half of our guidance range three or four months ago certainly were lower in that range today, but still within it.

Christine Cho -- Barclays -- Analyst

Okay, thank you so much.

We'll now take our next question from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.

Jeremy Tonet -- JPMorgan -- Analyst

Good morning. Just wanted to build on SPL 6 a little bit more here and see what else is needed for positive FID seems like a contractual support is largely there. Is it just lining up the financing and then also looks like the EPC contract price $2.5 billion is a bit lower than what you had pressed PL5 and just wondering what drives the deltas there.

Jack Fusco -- President and CEO

Hi, Jeremy. Thanks. SPL 6 we're extremely excited about as I mentioned on my talking points we've released Bechtel with limited notice to proceed. So we've locked in the price. We've locked in the schedule in regards to that and Bechtel is making extremely good progress as you know. There's a lot of synergies with having the workforce just roll off of five into six. Additionally, what you're seeing are with the cost of 6, we think it's extremely competitive just like Corpus Christi Train 3 and we were able to utilize not only the synergies of having the workforce, already mobilized in the equipment already there to move right into train 6, but also into utilizing some of the existing infrastructure that it affords us having the brownfield site. So we've got the infrastructure that was already built for the first five trains that we've rolled into Train 6 and that's part of the cost reduction. Michael, I don't know if you have anything to add.

Michael Wortley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, I mean on the financing that we're progressing that as we speak. As I said on the last call, as Jack said, we have Bechtel working right there full speed ahead, we know price, we know schedule, we don't owe them a full mtpa until all of the summer. And so, as I said on the last call, we're just kind of waiting to see what contracts come in and what the best portfolio is to really attached to that train for financing purposes and since the last call you saw Petronas come in, it's a very clean FOB deal, which we like to put down at the project.

So we have three or four months to see what else comes in and then decide the optimum mix and close that financing. But that's not slowing us down in anyway because we're under way on Train 6 and then I'd add to Jack's comment on remember when we built Train 5, the first four trains leveraged a lot of infrastructure that we had at the regas facility all the utilities and things like that with Train 5, we had to really add all of that and we did that in anticipation of Train 6. So Train 5 was always going to be the higher cost train ,Train 6 was is far more attractive on a cost perspective, because so much infrastructure is in place from the Train 5. So yeah just like Train 3.

Jeremy Tonet -- JPMorgan -- Analyst

That's helpful, thanks. Just wanted to switch gears over to ESG seems like this is the greater focal point for the marketplace for investors going forward here. And we're just wondering if you could tell us how Cheniere thinks about these issues? How you're positioning yourself and how you guys see yourselves stacking up versus other energy infrastructure company?

Jack Fusco -- President and CEO

So we're very excited here recently organizationally, we were able to bring on a Fiji George who is from Southwest who's got a lot of experience in ESG type programs and he's been spearheading our effort, as well as Chris Smith, who is our Senior Vice President of External Affairs in Washington DC, and you all may know Chris he was Assistant Secretary of Energy under the previous administrations. So we think we need to be a leader in it as you know we feel like we're on the right side of the equation when it comes to ESG we think natural gas is the solution. It's economic, it's secure and it's sustainable and what you see around the world is a policy shift I think it's going to be a secular shift in the way energy is utilized worldwide and I think you're going to see natural gas and liquefied natural gas take a much more prominent role in that.

Well, we will be rolling out our ESG methodology and program here very, very soon. Anatol, do you have anything there?

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

No, just exactly as you said, we're focused, we are looking to leverage our position on the gas procurement side as well as our ability to supply this clean reliable fuel to the rest of the world and have the rest of the world achieve that type of carbon dioxide reductions that the U.S. has enjoyed over the last decade.

Jeremy Tonet -- JPMorgan -- Analyst

That's all from me. Thanks for taking my question.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Michael Webber from Wells Fargo Securities. Mr Webber. Please go ahead, your line is open.

Michael Webber -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Thanks. Hi, good morning guys, how are you ?

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Good morning.

Michael Webber -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Jack, just wanted to start off with you a market-based question, overnight we saw tensions escalate in Pakistan and India, because obviously I have some exposure there to India. I'm just curious, can you maybe you run the risk and the impact your business, can you maybe walk us through the impact theoretically of a force majeure there on your import contracts if we saw a replay of 1999 or a broader conflict. And then maybe I guess within the context of kind of walking through that -- volumes just gets put into the spot market and make them on the back end. I know it's early but seems pretty pressing so..?

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Yes, there is no force majeure Michael right it's FOB, so our contract with GAIL they pick up at the flange as Sabine Pass, and they can take it wherever they want to take it and that's one of the benefits of the U.S. LNG and the Cheniere model. So from that perspective, we don't see anything meaningful one way or the other.

Michael Webber -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Okay, that's it wouldn't be applicable to an FOB-based contracts that basically, what you're saying ?

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

It's not, no we would expect them to honor their contract and we would enforce our contract but so far relationship with GAIL is extremely strong, and we will continue to try to meet their needs so.

Michael Webber -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Okay now that's helpful I appreciate that. And then maybe just around the competitive dynamics in and around the U.S. Gulf I guess it's been again a bit more crowded in the last quarter or two with FID at Golden Pass and VG kind of knocking on the door I guess maybe a little bit more insight. I guess within the industry in terms of where those deals are getting done, do you have a better sense yet around whether you've been able to price or able to command a premium for your volumes relative to your peers in U.S. Gulf, and if so maybe kind of a vague sense on where you think that is ?

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

So a couple of things, one, I think when you see a lot of other folks that want to have a position like Cheniere and then it just reconfirms that our business model, our position is second to none right worldwide and so I'm very, very excited about that as you know we were a first mover and we've executed extremely well right, you can compare us to just about everybody else in the U.S. and see that our construction effort has been second to none. Our operating ability in the hand off from construction operations has been second to none, our ability to produce real volume in a growing demand market has been second to none so I feel very good about our ability to execute.

And I do think our full-service model and our ability to deliver anywhere around the world has afforded us a slight premium to were the spot market is clearing today.

Michael Webber -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Okay, thanks for the time guys. I appreciate it.

Operator

We'll take the next question from Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers, please go ahead.

Craig Shere -- Tuohy Brothers -- Analyst

Good morning guys.

Hi Craig, Michael In May, 2018 at your Analyst Day I think you guided that on a 9 train program that you won't required to think about debt amortization out of operating cash flows at both the MLP, SPL level and also at the LNG Corpus Christi level to late 2020s, can you kind of share what maybe all equity funding of $300 a ton upsizing of all the liquefaction trains and the possible successful addition of a 50-50 Corpus Christi Phase 3, would do to that would push amortization requirements under the 20s and 30s ?

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Yes, absolutely I don't know what the exact date is that we'd look to get into the details on that when we hit the road probably after our next call to roll-out capital allocation and Train 6, the Train 6 numbers and probably add some Stage 3 numbers into the whole model but absolutely I mean it's every piece of equity differs that amortization date.

Craig Shere -- Tuohy Brothers -- Analyst

Yes speaking of Phase 3, since Corpus Train 3, you signed four agreements with a total of five in a quarter mtpa which obviously is more than you could possibly need for 4.5 6, how much do you feel like you already have in the bag so to speak Corpus Phase 3 and what minimum percentage of the 9.5 mtpa, would you like to Train 6 contracted before perhaps an FID next year ?

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Yes, I mean, we definitely have more contracts than we need for Train 6 for sure we've drawn down kind of some of our CMI inventory to service some of that, but the plan would be to, we would think that piece of our business competitive advantage to keep some capacity there. How much do we need on Stage 3 I think we're running a couple of cases, one where we built the whole thing and one where we built, half of it and certainly we're making our way toward at least building, half of it but not quite there yet so.

Jack Fusco -- President and CEO

And I would say, Craig, we're extremely excited about Corpus Christi, and our ability to expand, we think there are no constraints with the site, there's no constraints with natural gas pipeline capacity coming into the side, the amount of infrastructures is there and then our location to the Permian should be a real advantage -- all the way around so that we're not going to slow down on the growth side I think I've got some of the best originators in this industry, and we're going to capitalize upon that.

Craig Shere -- Tuohy Brothers -- Analyst

That sounds great. Jack, if I could kind of dovetail on the those comments do you see prospects related to Corpus Phase 3, for signing both supply and off take agreements linked to Brent or perhaps a Texas-based gas (inaudible)?

Jack Fusco -- President and CEO

Anatol you want to take that.

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Thanks, Jack. Thanks, Greg yes, I think one of the things that was surprising in some sense amazing in the LNG market in 2018 was that the majority of the contracts that were executed were Henry Hub linked and obviously it was us and our neighbors at VG that had the that success, the world has got comfortable with this as an attractive model it offers liquidity, price transparency and it has seen a number of times now when if Henry Hub has a quick excursion to prices above $3 it comes down very rapidly and continues to be very competitive with Brent linked and other contracts. We continue to think that that is the right flag to fly, your question about alternative indices that's a very long part and in our view of the world isn't ready to price meaningful volume. Aguadulce(ph) while it's something that you and we know well just does not have the liquidity, transparency term structure that would make it marketable internationally.

Michael Webber -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

That's very helpful. Very quick last one for Michael, I think May last year at Analyst Day, you said $1.9 billion of incremental forecast equity funding for Corpus Christi Trains 1 to 3 with things progressing seemingly better than expected. Any range of how much that might come under?

Michael Wortley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

I don't think we're ready to I mean Train 3 has a long way to go. So I would stick with that number for now. Train 6 we're going to end up with probably close to $300 million of contingency though. And so that will get rolled into Train 6 to help meet our 50-50 debt equity to Train 5 we had excess contingency which will roll into Train 6 to achieve our 50-50 debt equity. But on Corpus side stick with the numbers we put out in May.

Michael Webber -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Great. Thank you.

Operator

Will, now take our next question from Danilo Juvane from BMO Capital Markets.

Danilo Juvane -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst

Thanks and good morning. My first question is for Michael. You have pretty clear visibility to the contractive portion of your cash flow profile, just curious with that in mind, how you sort of evaluating the various capital allocation decisions going forward?

Michael Wortley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, we do have a lot of visibility. Again, we'll roll that out in a few months, probably after our next call will hit the road and talk about it. But it's pretty straightforward for us, there's three buckets. Right there is the growth bucket, the balance sheet bucket and the shareholder returns bucket. And I can tell you we're really excited about the growth. So that's going to be a big number as we look at not only Train 6 but stage 3, reinvesting in the business is the best use of our money at the returns. We think we can generate and then we'll have to decide if we want to do something else on the balance sheet, relative to what we've already said publicly. So we're thinking through that and then there's probably some money left over for some kind of shareholder return, flexibility is going to be key for us. We will keep that in mind as we think about bucket number 3. But look to put some real numbers to that here in the coming months.

Danilo Juvane -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst

And as you think about bucket number 3. Is that something that you think you'd be able to actually implement this year or farther out to assuming some sort of a run rate and (inaudible).

Michael Wortley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, we'll see. I mean, probably both, but we'll see.

Danilo Juvane -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst

Okay. I thank you for that other question is for Jack. You spoke earlier in your prepared remarks about being opportunistic to a CQP simplification I mean it seems that there will be a little bit more difficult to achieve versus what you were able to do with CQH. How should we think about how you ultimately end up rolling up the MLP. Thank you.

Jack Fusco -- President and CEO

I think that I said it fairly clearly we're going to be very opportunistic. The math doesn't work and we're going to have a complicated structure for the foreseeable future and until we convince all of you that our growth really is there. I think we'll get hopefully get you'll comfortable and we can actually execute what we say and that we're a conservative bunch overall. But right now the exchange ratio just don't work.

Danilo Juvane -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst

Got you. Last question from me. With respect to Stage 3 have we ultimately just abandoned midscale , that seems to be, let's talk about now. There seems to be shift in zones just having sort of conventional trains going forward. How should we think about that?

Jack Fusco -- President and CEO

No, we are moving full speed ahead with our midscale solution right now which is our Corpus Christi stage 3 sorry not train 3, stage 3 that would filing, which we have in front of FERC right now.

Danilo Juvane -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst

Those are my question. Thank you.

Jack Fusco -- President and CEO

Thanks.

Operator

As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen. Please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up and rejoin the queue for additional questions. Our next questioner comes from Jean Salisbury from Bernstein. Please go ahead.

Jean Ann Salisbury -- Bernstein -- Analyst

Hi, good morning. How much advanced locking in is there of pricing for spot cargoes. Have we seen the full effect of the fourth quarter winter gas spike on margins or it will sum up your next quarter.

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Well. Thank you. It's Anatol, it's really a mix as Michael said, we have three trains coming on with a fair amount of timing uncertainty on cargoes and we're not in the business of going short in the market. We, as we've said to you before, we do have some tranches, obviously we have early cargoes associated with some term deals that we've executed over the last year, as well as some medium-term deals for '19 and '20, but for competitive reasons, we're not going to get into the specifics of the volumes quarter by quarter.

Jean Ann Salisbury -- Bernstein -- Analyst

Okay, fair enough. And then, do you see a risk in 2019 that have everything starts up as scheduled some U.S. LNG facilities won't be running at full capacity for parts of the year.

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

It Anatol again. I really cannot envision that scenario. Actually, I have to say I can't envision the first premise of that scenario either. But even if that did play out, the probability that on a marginal basis, there is no value in exporting a $2.5 Henry Hub molecule to a strong global market is pretty close to zero to me.

Jean Ann Salisbury -- Bernstein -- Analyst

Okay, that's all from me. Thank you.

Operator

Next question comes from Fotis Giannakoulis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.

Fotis Giannakoulis -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Yes, hi. Thank you all. Anatol, I have one question for you. The last three FIDs they can be reached without long term SPAs from the respective parties. Is this a new trend and how does this change the the long-term dynamics of the market and your potential margins and growth initiatives beyond the stage 3 of Corpus Christi.

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Thanks Fotis. It's not a surprise to you or to us, it's a global and competitive market and lots of places have attractive molecules that they want to monetize with eight different capital allocation algorithm and different risk tolerance than we do. So we are always expecting what in the U.S., we may have called a producer push component, the LNG market calls it the equity lifting model. Those are projects that we always believed would be able to get off the ground, whether that's East Africa, Western Canada, Arctic Russia et cetera and where we are expecting fully expecting to compete with them. We have been competing with them and there weren't a surprise to anyone in 2018 where we had pretty close to a record year. So we love the hand that we're dealt, we love as Jack said the business model and the track record that we've built and we're confident that we'll be able to leverage that into continued success. But it is a competitive market.

Fotis Giannakoulis -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

So from your answer. Shall I take that your strategy of backing every new expansion, with long-term SPAs will remain intact or this new FIDs might change your risk appetite.

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Well, look, we told you a couple of years ago, our model was continued to refine that we think that the range of CMI having the warehouse staff 5% to 20% sort of as the side boards of volume in it is a very good number and we're still comfortable with that and we've had good success. As Michael mentioned, we've in essence drawn down that inventory will look to reallocate volumes to that in order to continue to prosecute the type of bridging volume and secure reliable attractive value proposition that we've been successful with. So there is no reason to change what's been working and is expected to continue working for the foreseeable future.

Fotis Giannakoulis -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Thank you very much, Anatol. Congratulation for the great year.

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Thanks, Fotis.

Our next question comes from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.

Michael Lapides -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Hey, guys. Two questions, one on the last quarterly call, you kind of updated the range of potential output. Our capacity for each training kind of raise the high end. Can you talk to us about kind of how you get comfortable with hitting that high-end and is even upside to that level. I'd love response on that and then I've got a follow-on about the balance sheet.

Jack Fusco -- President and CEO

Michael, it's Jack. Yeah. So from an operating perspective. I would say that we are very comfortable now with the upper end of the range that we gave all of you. We have some de-bottlenecking initiatives that we have plans of achieving this year with some of our turnaround and maintenance schedules and you should expect us to revise our output but I think most of you are probably on Genscape and can see our gas flows into our facility and noq hat we're very close to 5 Bcf/d right now so we're very, very pleased with the way our trains have been performing.

Michael Lapides -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Got it. And then one quick one on the balance sheet, just curious how do you think about, let's say, once you get Train 6 online and that's we're talking a couple years down the road what you think about as a normal credit metrics that you'd like to achieve kind of a long run target or a long-run goal and whether that is measured on an FFO to debt or debt to EBITDA perspective ?

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Before Michael answers that question, I just want to make sure already this morning with the L&T of Train 6 that the price in the schedule are fixed and not a risk for us so we haven't had any cost overruns yet we don't expect to start now on our Trains number 8 and 9. So I just want to make sure I got that clear.

Michael Lapides -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Understood. I've known you for a long time have, I've not seen, you have very many cost overruns in the 12 to 15 years.

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Go ahead Michael.

Michael Wortley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

The balance sheet, the rating agencies, look at it several different ways the projects they care about debt service coverage ratios and then deconsolidated numbers consolidated numbers and for us, I think we had, we need to keep it simple and just communicate like everybody else, which is just a consolidated debt-to-EBITDA number.

And so that over the long run I think that's what we'll start to look at more and more though the rating agencies are more nuance given our multiple levels of debt.

Michael Lapides -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Do have a kind of a mental target in mind of where you'd like that debt-to-EBITDAR number to be Train 6 is up and running ?

Michael Wortley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Well they are the part of our grant roll-out in a few months currently we're at 5 times to 6 times consolidated probably on the upper end of that range from what we said last time so that's what we'll stick with for now.

Michael Lapides -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Got it. Thank you, Michael, much appreciated guys.

Our final question today will come from Alex Kania from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.

Alex Kania -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Thanks. I just wanted to touch on the commentary related to maybe the financing package for Sabine Pass 6 Michael, I think you talked about thinking about optimizing what contracts you which has that facility are you talking mainly about the CMI contracts that you've already got secured or maybe are you, is there kind of discussions far enough along in another FOB type contract that you may want to wait to see play out for you, you finalize that ?

Michael Wortley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yes, I mean we have a free option right now which is that we don't have to give full mtpa summer so yes, we just wait and see what happens I mean I like our position now if we had to make a decision tomorrow I don't think we have any problem with that but given that we have free time to wait working hard yes, I mean we'll wait and see if anything else comes down the pipe between now and then we have Vitol and PETRONAS which you're FOB deals and then we have a fair amount of does deals so yes we'll just wait.

Alex Kania -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Related Stories Democrats had historic gains in T…","In the past half century, America has had three Democratic Presidents — Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama—who all pursued peace and reconciliation in international affairs and diplomacy. The goal has been to repair historical divisions and resolve conflicts where possible.

Jimmy Carter promoted peace and diplomatic ties between Israel and Egypt, inviting Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar el-Sadat to Camp David in 1978. The subsequent Camp David Accords, resulted in diplomatic recognition and an historic exchange of visits ushered in what is now 40 years of ties between the first Arab nation to recognize Israel and the Jewish state.

Carter also negotiated the Panama Canal Treaty, which led to eventual takeover of the Canal and the Canal Zone by the Panamanian government in 2000, improving relations with Latin America, and overcoming unfounded fears that Fidel Castro and Cuba would seize control of the Canal. At home, this treaty helped promote the rise of the Far Right in the Republican Party and contributed to the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980.

In 1978 Carter went beyond the economic and travel ties Richard Nixon had established with the People’s Republic of China, by recognizing the mainland government as the government of China, rather than Taiwan, and rejecting a thirty-year old policy. While U.S. recognition enhanced the relationship of the world’s most populous nation and the world’s leading democracy, it did not lead to a long-term liberalization of the Chinese leadership.

Early in his first term, Bill Clinton pursued peace negotiations with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat. The resulting Oslo Accords were a step toward acceptance of co-existence between the Palestinians and Israelis, which failed miserably after Rabin’s assassination by a right wing Israeli in the fall of 1995. A later attempt in 2000 to reach a Camp David II Accord also failed. (Clinton blamed Arafat for its failure, at a time when the Israeli government was amenable to compromise, after the defeat of Benjamin Netanyahu as prime minister in 1999).

Like Carter with the People’s Republic of China, Clinton reconciled with a long-time adversary when he established diplomatic relations with the Communist nation of Vietnam in 1995, sending former prisoner of war Senator John McCain of Arizona, and Vietnam War participant Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts to finalize the reconciliation.

SPONSORED



Also during the Clinton administration former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell successfully negotiated the Good Friday Agreement between the warring Protestant and Catholic factions in Northern Ireland —a settlement which is now in its twenty-first year.

Following through on his pledge, in 2011 Barack Obama withdrew U.S. forces from Iraq after eight years of bloodshed, although he later sent some troops back to counter ISIS, the terrorist group.

Four years later, Obama opened relations with Raul Castro’s Cuba, despite opposition from Republicans and Cuban Americans in South Florida. Relations with Cuba have cooled under Donald Trump and the issue of the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, which the US has controlled since the Spanish American War, remains an area of dispute, as well as the issue of hearing loss suffered by western diplomats in Cuba.

Obama’s decision to join with the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, along with Russia and China, to pursue a nuclear deal with the Islamic Republic of Iran in 2015, to avoid that nation’s development of offensive nuclear weapons, which might threaten Israel, Saudi Arabia, and other Middle Eastern nations, was a well-regarded attempt to solve a major foreign policy dilemma although his successor has repudiated it.

None of the three Democratic Presidents had a “perfect” record of peace and reconciliation in diplomacy. Carter failed to release American hostages in Iran in 1980; Clinton led the belated bombing of Serbia in 1995 and the 1998 bombing in Kosovo; Obama continued military action in Afghanistan and Iraq. Nevertheless, the three Democratic presidents in the last half-century pursued peace and reconciliation within reasonable means and circumstances.

As one examines the major foreign policy issues that will probably be factors in the 2020 presidential primary, what stands out is the historical desire of Democrats to promote peaceful dialogue and avoid war. However, the next president, Democrat or Republican, will face a daunting set of foreign policy dilemmas—everything from terrorism, immigration, North Korea’s nuclear program, and possible Russian collusion in U.S. politics to global warming, the Middle East, and the repair of the U.S.’s fractured relationships with its traditional allies.

It would be wise if the next President of the United States examined the records of accomplishment in foreign policy of the three most recent Democratic Presidents. It is important to pursue dialogue but also make it clear that the nation will pursue its basic values of respect for human rights and maintaining a strong defense. Working through international organizations and restoring the strong ties America has had since World War II with its allies in Western Europe, Canada, and the Far East are essential to promote democracy and international stability and to deal with the growing crisis of global warming. The next president must respect the sovereignty of other nations and avoid future military ventures to shape relations in the Western Hemisphere.

It is essential to make it clear to the Russian and Chinese governments that we insist on fruitful relations while remaining rivals. Working with Kim Jong Un of North Korea to resolve the issue of his nuclear program is likely to be a major challenge as well. Trying to resume diplomacy with Iran and Cuba would also be a positive move. The Middle East will remain the most complex international challenge. We should remain loyal to the survival of Israel but not allow them to dictate American policy in the area. And Saudi Arabia must not have an undue impact on American policy, as that would undermine the chances of a negotiated resolution of tensions in the area. And the constant danger of terrorism is a never ending nightmare that the next American President will face.

The Democratic candidates must show they are ready to handle these challenges. Looking to their Democratic predecessors offers a valuable model of navigating international policy.","What 2020 Presidential hopefuls can learn from Carter, Clinton and Obama’s foreign policy",Alternet.org,https://www.alternet.org/2019/02/what-2020-presidential-hopefuls-can-learn-from-carter-clinton-and-obamas-foreign-policy/

Today's early morning highlights from the major news organizations.

Kaiser Health News: Despite 1991 Ruling, Foes Of New Family Planning Rules See Law On Their Side

State attorneys generals and women’s health advocates hoping to block in court new Trump administration rules for the federal family planning program face one major obstacle: The Supreme Court upheld very similar rules in 1991. Those rules were summarily canceled after a change in administrations. But the court is arguably more conservative than it was 28 years ago.Still, those who oppose the rules say that the ground has shifted enough to help them succeed this time. (Rovner, 2/28)

Kaiser Health News: There’s A New ‘Medicare-For-All’ Bill In The House. Why Does It Matter?

In many ways, the proposal sounds familiar: The government would establish a health plan that pays for basically all forms of medical care for all citizens. That’s how it gets the moniker “Medicare-for-all.” Under this plan, patients would not be responsible for any cost sharing of medical expenses, and the government coverage would include hospitals, doctors, preventive care, prescription meds and dental and vision care. Private insurers would not be allowed to sell plans that compete with the government program. Senior citizens would be folded into the new Medicare plan, which would be more generous than their current coverage, and the government would make sure any medical care they are getting is not disrupted. The bill leaves two other government health care payers intact: the Veterans Health Administration and the Indian Health Service. (Luthra, 2/27)

Kaiser Health News: Listening To Older Patients Who Want To Stop Dialysis

Dr. Susan Wong sat down with an 84-year-old patient in the hospital, where he’d been admitted with a flare-up of a serious autoimmune condition and deteriorating kidney function. The older man told her he wanted to go home; he’d had a good life and was ready for its end. He didn’t want aggressive care — including dialysis — having witnessed his wife and son die painfully in intensive care years ago. (Graham, 2/28)

The New York Times: As Over 100 House Democrats Embrace ‘Medicare For All,’ A Party Division Appears

Denouncing the profit motive in health care, more than 100 House Democrats rallied on Wednesday around a bill to replace most private health insurance with a national single-payer system, “Medicare for all.” The chief sponsor of the bill, Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington, said it would cure “a deep sickness within our for-profit system” of health care. But the bill highlights Democrats’ split over health policy going into the 2020 elections. (Pear, 2/27)

The Hill: Moderate Dems Revive Effort To Stabilize ObamaCare Markets

A group of moderate House Democrats will make a push this year to stabilize ObamaCare's markets, reviving an effort that fell to partisan bickering in 2017. The New Democrat Coalition, a caucus of 101 centrists, says the House should ""immediately"" work with Republicans to bring down ObamaCare premiums and reverse the Trump administration's ""sabotage"" of the health care law. (Hellmann, 2/27)

Bloomberg: Health Insurers Sink As `Medicare For All' Idea Gains Traction

Health insurers are leading declines among health-care stocks as investors turned their focus to Democrats’ new “Medicare for all” bill that would replace almost all private plans and assessed the implications of a Senate hearing on surging drug prices. The S&P 500 Managed Health Care Index plunged as much as 4.9 percent, the most since Dec. 6, led by UnitedHealth Group Inc., Humana Inc. and WellCare Health Plans Inc. The broader health sector index fell 0.8 percent. (Darie, 2/27)

Reuters: U.S. House Approves Expanded Background Checks For Gun Sales

The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday passed a bill that would expand background checks for gun sales to include firearm purchases at gun shows and over the internet, a measure likely to face Senate and White House opposition. The background check bill, which was approved by a 240-190 vote, is the first gun control measure taken up by Democrats since they regained control of the House in the 2018 congressional midterm elections. (Becker, 2/27)

Politico: House Passes Most Sweeping Gun Control Legislation In Decades

The background checks legislation faces stiff opposition in the GOP-controlled Senate, and President Donald Trump — who has strong backing from the National Rifle Association and other gun rights groups — has vowed to veto the bill if it ever reaches his desk. But House Democrats insist that some federal action must be taken to address the growing toll of gun violence. In addition to Wednesday's vote, they will move legislation on Thursday to close the ""Charleston loophole,"" which allows people to buy guns before background checks are completed, and extend the time period for any background checks from three days to as long as 20 days. White supremacist Dylann Roof was able to buy a gun in 2015 despite pending drug charges, and he later killed nine African-Americans at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C. (Bresnahan, 2/27)

The Washington Post: Hard-Charging Democrats’ Cautious Strategy On Gun Control Reflects Limits Of Political Change

For six years, Rep. Mike Thompson’s job as House Democrats’ point man on combating gun violence amounted to stretches of obscurity punctuated by tragedy. As leader of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, he convened countless meetings of lawmakers, experts, advocates and victims, trying to build support for some kind — any kind — of gun control legislation. And when a mass shooting occurred, he stepped forward alongside Democratic leaders to explain the need for the kind of action the House Republican majority had no interest in taking. (DeBonis, 2/27)

The Associated Press: FBI: Vet Shoots, Wounds Doctor Before Mental Health Check

The FBI says a 59-year-old U.S. Army veteran has shot and wounded a doctor just before a mental health evaluation at a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs hospital in Riviera Beach, Florida. The FBI told news outlets Wednesday night that Larry Ray Bon, of Michigan, arrived at the West Palm Beach VA Medical Center that morning and was combative for hours. They say he was about to undergo the evaluation that evening when he pulled out the gun and shot the doctor in the neck. (2/28)

The New York Times: Patient Shoots Doctor At Florida Veterans Affairs Hospital, Officials Say

The F.B.I. took over the investigation of the shooting because it occurred in a federal building, Agent Leverock said. Mr. Bon was scheduled to appear in federal court on Thursday. The West Palm Beach V.A. Medical Center, about 75 miles north of Miami on Florida’s eastern coast, is a general medical, psychiatric and surgical facility, according to its website. The 153-bed facility opened in 1995 and “provides health services to veterans throughout South Florida,” both at the main facility in West Palm Beach and six contractor-operated outpatient clinics, a 2017 report said. The facility also operates a 108-bed “community living center” and a 13-bed “blind rehabilitation service,” according to the report. During the 2017 fiscal year, the facility served about 60,000 veterans, the report said. (Jacobs and Stevens, 2/27)

Stat: Did Some Pharma Execs Give Misleading Answers To Senate Panel?

During Tuesday’s Senate hearing on drug pricing, each of the seven pharma execs insisted their companies have never withheld samples from generic rivals, a step that has raised concerns about unfairly thwarting competition. This is because generic companies need samples to develop copycat medicines and, sometimes, run tests to show a product is bioequivalent in order to win regulatory approval. Yet a recent Food and Drug Administration list of drug makers that withheld samples includes two companies — Pfizer (PFE) and AstraZeneca (AZN) — whose chief executives testified samples were, in fact, not withheld.

The New York Times: Thousands Of Immigrant Children Said They Were Sexually Abused In U.S. Detention Centers, Report Says

The federal government received more than 4,500 complaints in four years about the sexual abuse of immigrant children who were being held at government-funded detention facilities, including an increase in complaints while the Trump administration’s policy of separating migrant families at the border was in place, the Justice Department revealed this week. The records, which involve children who had entered the country alone or had been separated from their parents, detailed allegations that adult staff members had harassed and assaulted children, including fondling and kissing minors, watching them as they showered, and raping them.

The Associated Press: Transgender Troops Tell Congress They Excel In Military

Transgender troops testifying for the first time to Congress on Wednesday said transitioning to another sex made them stronger, while Pentagon officials defended the Trump administration's desire to bar people like them from enlisting in the future. Army Capt. Alivia Stehlik, an infantry officer and graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y. and Ranger School, told lawmakers she became a more ""effective soldier"" after she transitioned from male to female in 2017. (2/27)

The Washington Post: In First, Transgender Troops Testify Before House As Trump Administration Seeks To Limit Their Service

Army Capt. Alivia Stehlik commissioned as an infantry officer from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., graduated from Ranger School and lived a “soldier’s life,” she said, spending long periods in the field before becoming a physical therapist in the service. After the Obama administration rescinded a ban in 2016 on serving while transgender, she wanted to do something else as a soldier, too: transition from male to female. (Lamothe, 2/27)

Reuters: Most Americans Back Transgender Troops: Reuters/Ipsos Poll

Nearly 60 percent of Americans said transgender people should be allowed to serve in the U.S. armed forces, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll conducted ahead of a congressional panel's review, set for Wednesday, of Trump administration curbs on transgender service. The U.S. Supreme Court on Jan. 22 ruled in favor of letting the Trump administration enforce its policy of barring many transgender people from the military. Implementation of the policy has been delayed by legal wrangling in a lower court case that the Supreme Court did not directly address. (2/27)

The Associated Press: Missouri House Passes Wide-Ranging Abortion Restrictions

The Missouri House on Wednesday took steps to outlaw most abortions in the state should the U.S. Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade, an effort that's part of a broader Republican push amid renewed optimism that the high court might be more open to increased restrictions, and possibly an outright ban, on the procedure. (Ballentine, 2/27)

The Associated Press: Evers' Official: Ex-Planned Parenthood VP Has No Legal Say

Gov. Tony Evers' pick to lead the Wisconsin Department of Health Services on Wednesday defended naming a former vice president at Planned Parenthood as a top deputy, saying she won't have any involvement in lawsuits challenging the state's abortion laws. Secretary-designee Andrea Palm was asked about the pick of Nicole Safar during a confirmation hearing before the state Senate's health committee. (Bauer, 2/27)

The Associated Press: Weeks After 2030 HIV Pledge, Report Shows US Headway Stalled

Three weeks after President Donald Trump announced a campaign to end the U.S. HIV epidemic by 2030, new government data show that progress against the disease stalled recently. After declining for several years, the estimated number of new HIV infections held about steady from 2013 to 2016, the latest available data, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday. (Stobbe, 2/27)

The Hill: CDC: Progress In Preventing HIV 'Stalled'

The report comes three weeks after President Trump announced a new campaign to end the HIV epidemic in the U.S. within 10 years. Eugene McCray, director of the CDC's Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, framed the report as evidence the campaign is needed. “After a decades-long struggle, the path to eliminate America’s HIV epidemic is clear,” McCray said in a statement. “Expanding efforts across the country will close gaps, overcome threats, and turn around troublesome trends.” (Rodrigo, 2/27)

The Associated Press: How 'Completely Avoidable' Measles Cases Continue To Climb

The U.S. has counted more measles cases in the first two months of this year than in all of 2017 — and part of the rising threat is misinformation that makes some parents balk at a crucial vaccine, federal health officials told Congress Wednesday. Yet the vaccine is hugely effective and very safe — so the rise of measles cases ""is really unacceptable,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, infectious disease chief at the National Institutes of Health. (2/27)

The Washington Post: Texas State Rep. Bill Zedler Suggests Antibiotics Treat Measles

Amid a relentless anti-vaccine movement and measles outbreaks across the United States, a Texas lawmaker has falsely suggested that antibiotics can be used to treat the deadly childhood disease. Texas state Rep. Bill Zedler (R), an anti-vaxxer who is promoting legislation to allow parents to more easily opt out of vaccinations for their children, said he had measles when he was a child. ""When I grew up, I had a lot of these illnesses,” Zedler recalled, according to the Texas Observer. “They wanted me to stay at home. But as far as being sick in bed, it wasn’t anything like that.” (Bever, 2/27)

The Associated Press: Study: US Pedestrian Deaths Hit Highest Number Since 1990

The number of pedestrians killed on U.S. roads last year was the highest in 28 years, according to a report from a safety organization. Using data reported by states, the Governors Highway Safety Association estimates that 6,227 pedestrians were killed last year. That’s up 4 percent from 2017 and 35 percent since 2008. The association blames the increase on factors that include distracted or impaired drivers, more people walking to work, and more SUVs on the road, which cause more severe injuries in collisions with people on foot. (2/28)

The Wall Street Journal: Pedestrian Deaths Reach Highest Level In Nearly 30 Years

Pedestrian deaths now account for about 16% of motor-vehicle crash deaths, up from 12% a decade ago. In that span, all other traffic deaths grew by less than 5%. “We’re killing way too many pedestrians. This has got to be a high priority,” said Jonathan Adkins, executive director of the nonprofit Governors Highway Safety Association, which represents state highway-safety offices and commissioned the report.

The Washington Post: ‘Miraculous’ Stem Cell Therapy Has Sickened People In Five States

Over the past year, at least 17 people have been hospitalized after being injected with products made from umbilical cord blood, a little-known but fast-growing segment of the booming stem cell industry, according to state and federal health officials and patient reports. Sold as a miracle cure for a variety of in­trac­table conditions, the injections have sickened people in five states, prompting new warnings from health officials about the risks of unproven stem cell treatments.

The Wall Street Journal: New Cancer Drugs Aim To Offer Alternatives To Chemo

Michelle Lowry was a healthy baby until a pea-sized lump appeared on her neck when she was two. Within weeks it had swelled into a life-threatening tumor obstructing her breathing and she was hospitalized at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. “Her right arm and hand stopped working,” recalled her mom, Christina Lowry, who lives in Simi Valley, Calif. “Her face was swollen, her eye was almost swollen shut. The tumor was almost all the way around her neck.” A test showed her tumor was caused by a so-called NTRK fusion, which happens when a gene known as NTRK fuses with another unrelated gene.

Stat: New Study Finds No Link Between Flu Shots And Miscarriages, Allaying Fears

A new study looking at whether women who are pregnant face an increased risk of a miscarriage if they get a flu shot found no link between the vaccine and pregnancy loss. The reassuring finding contradicts an earlier study by the same researchers that raised questions about the safety of getting a flu shot during pregnancy. An overview of the study findings was presented Wednesday at a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which guides vaccination policy for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Stat: Study: Guardant Blood Test Might Replace Biopsies In Some Cancers

Could a blood test help more lung cancer patients get drugs that are targeted to the genetic weaknesses of their tumors? Yes, according to summary results of a 282-patient clinical trial being made available Wednesday. The result is a boon for Guardant Health, the San Francisco-based startup that sells the test, Guardant360, which is a “liquid biopsy” that works by detecting fragments of DNA in the bloodstream. The full study will be presented in full at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in early April. (Herper, 2/27)

Los Angeles Times: What It’s Like To Go To School When Dozens Have Been Killed Nearby

Jaleyah Collier had just said goodbye to Kevin Cleveland outside a doughnut shop a few blocks from Hawkins High School on a spring afternoon in 2017. Get home safe, she told him before walking away. Minutes later someone drove into an alley nearby, got out of the car and asked Kevin, 17, and two others about their gang affiliation. The gunman then sprayed them with at least 10 rounds, killing Kevin and injuring the others. Jaleyah, then a high school sophomore, barely had time to grieve when a month later, her best friend, Alex Lomeli, 18, was shot and killed when someone tried to rob a market about a mile from the same high school, located at 60th and Hoover streets.

This would be a first for California: state government buying insurance to protect itself against overspending its budget. But before you start pelting the politicians and screaming fiscal irresponsibility, know that the budget-busting would be for fighting wildfires. (Skelton, 2/28)

Operator

Good morning and welcome to the Cheniere Energy Incorporated Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call and Webcast. Today's conference is being recorded.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over Mr. Randy Bhatia, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.

Randy Bhatia

Thanks, operator. Good morning and welcome to Cheniere Energy's fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings conference call. A slide presentation and access to the webcast for today's call are available at cheniere.com. Joining me for today's call are Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO; Anatol Feygin, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Michael Wortley, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Before we begin, I would like to remind all listeners that our remarks, including answers to your questions, may contain forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from what is described in these statements. Slide 2 of our presentation contains a discussion of those forward-looking statements and associated risk.

In addition, we may include references to non-GAAP financial measures, such as consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the appendix of the slide presentation.

As part of our discussion of Cheniere Energy, Inc.'s results, today's call may also include selected financial information and results for Cheniere Energy Partners, LP, or CQP. We do not intend to cover CQP's results separately from those of Cheniere Energy, Inc.

The call agenda is shown on Slide 3. Jack will begin with an overview of our 2018 operating and financial highlights and perspectives on 2019 beyond. Following Jack's comments, Anatol will provide an update on the LNG markets and Michael will review our financial results. After the prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A.

I'll now turn the call over to Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO.

Jack Fusco

Thank you, Randy, and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to be here this morning to review our significant accomplishments from a very successful 2018, to share my optimism for the continued success as we look forward to 2019 and beyond. 2018 was a truly remarkable year for Cheniere. On last year's call, I described 2017 as our breakthrough year which it certainly was.

In 2018, we maintained our momentum, achieving excellence and reaching new heights in virtually all phases of our business from commercial success achieved by signing over 7 million tons per year in new long-term SPAs with the FID of Corpus Christi Train 3 in May and the startup of Corpus Christi Train 1 a few months later to continued financial discipline and simplification of our corporate structure.

We've achieved those and much more and in doing so have cemented our reputation as a reliable full-service LNG operator which delivers on its promises to its customers, employees and stakeholders. In 2018, we executed on our strategic growth plans, operational plans and financial plan and results of our execution are apparent in the financial results we reported earlier this morning.

Slide 5 presents some key highlights for the fourth quarter 2018. There are a couple of achievements I would like to highlight from the slide. We generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of over 630 million and a distributable cash flow of approximately 130 million and produced and exported of record 80 cargoes on the quarter almost a cargo a day.

In addition, we reached the commissioning milestone of our first cargo of both Train 5 at Sabine Pass and Train 1 at Corpus Christi. As of yearend, we had exported four commissioning cargoes from Train 5 at Sabine Pass and two from Train 1 Corpus Christi. Our substantial commercial momentum continued in the fourth quarter as we signed long-term SPAs with both Polish oil and gas company and Petronas for over 2.5 million tons per year in aggregate.

We look forward to successful long-term relationships with our newest SPA customers and expect these SPAs to support our growth plans. The market for LNG contracting remains active and we continue to pursue additional long-term commercial arrangements with new and existing counterparts worldwide.

Turn now to Slide 6 and look at some of 2018s most notable highlights. Financial results for the first year 2018 came in at the top end of our guidance ranges for both consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow, as we generated more than 2.6 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and approximately 600 million in distributable cash flow for the full year. Michael will cover these results in more detail, but our financial performance in 2018 improved throughout the year and we're pleased to deliver full year financial results at or above our upwardly revised guidance range.

In 2018, we executed two important market transactions that I'll highlight briefly. First, we closed the merger with CQH in which we opportunistically and economically simplified our corporate structure. Our corporate structure remains complex and we would prefer to be simpler. However, we will remain opportunistic and only pursue further simplification transactions to the extent their economic LNG shareholders.

In addition to the CQH transaction, in 2018, we also refinanced the remaining term loans at CQP into the bond market, economically addressing the nearest term maturity in our complex and further demonstrating our commitment to managing our balance sheet throughout the corporate structure. Operationally in 2018, we produced and exported a total of 273 cargoes which required over 1 quadrillion BTUs of gas at our terminals.

Our teams in gas supply and operations made a significant operational and logistical achievement look easy and their dedication and commitment to excellence are significant contributors to our reputation as a reliable operator. Strategically, 2018 was an incredible success as we made a positive final investment decision on Train 3 at Corpus Christi and originated over 7 million tons per year of new long-term SPAs giving us sufficient visibility on Train 6 at Sabine Pass and enable us to finalize the EPC contract and issue limited notices to proceed from that project late last year.

Having that project underway via limited notice to proceed is strategically important for us as we have cost and date certainty on Train 6 ahead of our formal FID, which is where efforts are concentrated today. The FID of Train 6 is one of my key priorities for 2019, which I'll address on Slide 7. On this slide, I have included a few key priorities which highlights that our focus remains centered on growth, execution and being disciplined towards capital.

We are focused on completing the remaining steps necessary to achieve FID of Train 6, which we expect to occur over the coming months. As we have previously communicated, we expect to finance Train 6 with approximately 50% debt 50% equity, which is consistent with our strategy of deleveraging through growth. Ahead of that FID, Bechtel was work hard at work on Train 6 and making excellent progress in the scope of work. Bechtel will now estimate at Train 6 is approximately 14% complete, highlighted by over 3,300 piles already driven as part of the site preparation.

Beyond Train 6, we are focused on progressing Stage 3 at Corpus Christi through the permitting process, which we are permitting for approximately 9.5 million tons of additional LNG capacity. This project is moving through the process very well. We expect to have all the required regulatory approvals in place by the end of 2019. We expect to bring three trains into commercial operations during 2019. Train 5 at Sabine Pass and the first two trains at Corpus Christi.

As we have done with all the trains to date, we expect these three to be brought online safely, ahead of schedule and within budget. Completing commissioning and startup as well as commencing long-term contracts associated with new trains is a significant undertaking that requires a tremendous amount of work in coordination among Cheniere, our EPC partner Bechtel and our foundation customers. These efforts are especially critical for 2019 as we will be starting up three trains and commencing long-term SPAs for Train 5 at Sabine Pass, Train 1 at Corpus Christi and I'm focused on maintaining our track record for seamless transition from construction to operations.

The performance test for Train 1 at Corpus Christi has been successfully completed and we expect substantial completion to occur in the next few days. The last priority I'd like to highlight is our plan to communicate the capital allocation policy. This is a high priority for the executive team. we're working closely with our advisors and our Board of Directors to ensure we develop a durable, flexible policy that enables us to allocate capital the most effective, impactful way for our shareholders. We look forward to communicating it with the investment community in the coming months.

As I said earlier, 2018 was a remarkable year for Cheniere and we are proud of the accomplishments we achieved throughout the year, we have many more successes we're pursuing both in 2019 and beyond, and my confidence in our ability to continue delivering on our promises is underscored our people and the relentless focus on execution that continues to define Cheniere.

And now, I'll turn it over to Anatole who'll provide an update on the market.

Anatol Feygin

Thanks, Jack, and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 9. 2018 was a banner year for LNG in many regards. Globally, nine trains started service increasing global supply by roughly 30 million tons, the largest year-on-year increase since 2009 when Qatar began to bring its mega trains online. New and expansion trains in Australia, Russia and the U.S. pushed total global supplies over the 320 million to mark according to preliminary data.

In the U.S., exports from our facilities totaled nearly 19 million tons during the year, a 33% increase over 2017. Sabine Pass Train 4 started commercial deliveries in March and Train 5 which is currently undergoing commissioning exported its first cargo in November. Also in November, we saw startup of the first greenfield LNG terminal in the Lower-48 U.S. as Train 1 at our Corpus Christi facility started producing LNG and exported two commissioning cargoes before the end of the year.

We expect LNG production from our facilities and others in the U.S. to continue ramping up in the coming months and contribute to further enhancing the reliability, flexibility and liquidity of the global LNG market. Strong global LNG supply growth was met with robust demand in 2018 and led to some late-year market rebalancing. Demand growth in Asia absorbed virtually all of incremental supply.

The step up in global production especially in the fourth quarter when the global complex added more than 10.5 million tons year-on-year ensured adequate supply availability for Asia and the rest of the world as mild winter temperatures kept price points in check and supported an uptick in imports into Europe, which added over 4 million tons year on year in 2018.

The graph on the top right displays the fourth quarter 2018 demand compared to that what we saw in the fourth quarter of '17. As you can see China, along with the rest of Asia has strong year-over-year increases in imports. For the month of November, China overtook Japan as the world's top importer though the position went back to Japan in December.

Total European demand increased nearly 7 million tons in the quarter, which as I mentioned was partially supported by mild weather in Asia, new LNG supply coming online and high shipping rates that incentivized Atlantic source cargoes to target Europe. I'll come back to weather in Europe in just a minute.

Global gas price benchmarks in the fourth quarter saw higher levels and increased volatility compared to the same period in 2016 and '17. However, even with a brief spike in Henry hub prices in December, the U.S. benchmark continues to trade at a heavy discount compared to other global gas price indices. Despite a mild winter and a reduction in the stores deficit seen earlier in the year, TTF prices traded more than a $1.50 higher than levels seen during the same time a year ago. Similarly, fourth quarter Asian spot prices settled at more than $3 higher on average year-on-year of the premium decrease over the course of the quarter.

Please now turn to Slide 10. More than 20 countries almost half of all LNG importing countries had record annual LNG import levels in 2018, including China, South Korea, India and Pakistan. In addition to record import levels, China and Pakistan also set records for LNG demand growth rates in 2018. The graph to the far left highlights how remarkable China's demand has been over the past two years.

China alone absorbed more than 50% of the worldwide incremental supplies in 2018, adding 16 million tons above the 2017 levels. China remains an important demand center for our products and the country's need for natural gas and LNG is expected to continue to rise as the country balances its economic growth needs and environmental commitments.

South Korea's steady demand over the last two years has also been impressive. Demand growth was largely due to low nuclear utilization as well as low coal-fired power generation resulting from policies intended to improve air quality. Looking ahead to 2019 for South Korea, LNG consumption taxes are set to decrease while coal taxes are set to increase which of course is expected to be supportive of LNG demand.

Pakistan which began importing LNG in 2015 has shown consistent and growing demand and re-gasification build out in the early 2020s to be Pakistan is significantly larger importer than it is today. The middle graph shows the total accumulation of population weighted heating degree days for the heating season in Asia. Populous areas of East Asia have seen mostly minor cold spells this winter and the month of January finished on an extremely mild note.

Asia's heating degree days an indicative of factor of weather driven demand ranked close to average at best for much of the early part of the winter. Nonetheless prices remain fairly robust, compared to last year. The graph on the far right shows spot prices in relation to crude oil for the past three years.

Price levels in the first half of '18 were higher than in '17 and particularly more bullish from June to November partly due to China's early buying ahead of the winter in order to secure more LNG and avoid shortages and price spikes in the winter. High Asian LNG storage levels combined with the arrival of new supply in the fourth quarter and a fairly mild winter resulted in more moderate prices in the fourth quarter.

Please turn to Slide 11 where I will highlight the European markets. LNG imports to Europe reached record levels in December. European LNG imports during the first three quarters of 2018 were actually lower year-on-year, but the fourth quarter showed very strong levels for a number of reasons. Storage levels were at 17 year low after the 2017, '18 winter in Europe, leaving the region to play catch-up throughout the year.

The relative tightness in the global LNG market through the first three quarters left limited opportunities for storage replenishment. Early buying and mild temperatures in Asia left that region adequately supplied and elevated shipping rates. High coal and carbon prices and an uptick in global LNG production incentivized flows into Europe in the fourth quarter. Nuclear maintenance and domestic supply declines also supported imports.

The middle graph shows the total accumulation of population weighted heating degree days for the heating season in Europe through January 24th. Europe has also seen mild weather this winter, particularly in December, making the regions heating degree days below average in the fourth quarter. Cool attempts in the back half of January have helped bring Europe's temperature closer to average for the season, which should help with the weather sensitive demand. However, given all of the factors encouraging LNG flows into Europe, we do not view the increase is entirely weather driven.

The graph on the far right displays storage levels on the left and TTF prices on the right axis. As mentioned earlier, the storage situation Europe faced coming out of the winter of 2017 exerted upward pressure on TTF prices. Europe entered the third quarter was storage levels near the bottom of the five-year range, which contributed to upward pressure on TTF prices. In the fourth quarter, prices were still more than $3 an MMBtu higher than level seen in the fourth quarter of '17, although, they have moderated particularly after October settlement.

Europe is undergoing to structural shift in the overall dynamics of its gas market, which makes it increasingly attractive region for both our long-term and shorter-term LNG strategy. There is debate in Europe heightened in recent weeks about limiting coal use and achieving climate targets that could have a significant positive impact on Europe's appetite for LNG in the longer term. In the near term, a number of issues that were in play in the fourth quarter could remain in 2019, potentially resulting in continued robust European LNG imports again this year.

I'll now turn the call over to Michael to review our financial results.

Michael Wortley

Thanks, Anatol, and good morning everyone. Turning to Slide 13, for the fourth quarter, we generated net income of 67 million consolidated adjusted EBITDA of 634 million and distributable cash flow of approximately 130 million. Our results for the quarter were positively impacted by higher than forecast LNG volumes and revenue and listing margins as well as lower than forecast and O&M expenses. For the full year, we generated net income of 471 million, consolidated adjusted EBITDA of over 2.6 billion, distributable cash flow of approximately 600 million.

As Jack mentioned, consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow for the full year were both at the top of the revised guidance ranges we provided on our third quarter call. We exported 285 TBtu of LNG from the liquefaction projects during the fourth quarter of which 21 TBtu were commissioning volumes. Total volumes exported were higher than exports in the third quarter due to commissioning volumes from Sabine Pass Train 5 and Corpus Christi Train 1 and higher seasonal production from the four trains in operation at Sabine Pass.

Approximately 72% of the volumes exported during the quarter, our 260 Btu were lifted by a third party long-term SPA customers and the remaining 79 TBtu were lifted by our marketing function. Long-term SPA customer volumes were consistent with prior quarter and marketing volumes were higher due to increased production and commissioning volumes. For the full year, we exported 976 TBtu from our liquefaction projects of which 21 TBtu were commissioning volumes.

Approximately 77% of total volumes 756 TBtu were lifted by our third party long-term SPA customers and 220 TBtu were lifted by our marketing function. For the fourth quarter we recognized an income 242 TBtu of LNG produced at Sabine Pass consisting of 263 TBtu loaded during the quarter plus 3 TBtu or one cargo loaded in the prior quarter but delivered and recognized in the current quarter, last 25 TBtu are seven cargoes built on a delivered basis that were in transit as of the end of the fourth quarter. We also recognized an income 40 TBtu or 12 cargoes for the LNG that was sourced from third parties.

For the full year, we recognize an income 973 TBtu of LNG produced at Sabine Pass and 84 TBtu of LNG that was sourced from third parties. Five commissioning cargoes from Sabine Pass Train 5 and Corpus Christi Train 1, totaling 17 TBtu of LNG were recognized on the balance sheet as an offset of a 140 million to LNG terminal construction in progress during the fourth quarter. One commissioning cargo exported during the fourth quarter is on the water at year-end and will be recognized as an offset to construction in progress during the first quarter of 2019.

Net income attributable to common stockholders for the fourth quarter was 67 million or $0.26 per share, consistent with the third quarter. Increased operating income due to additional LNG volumes recognized in revenue was offset by increased derivative loss related to interest rate swaps. Full year 2018, we generated net income attributable to common stockholders of 471 million or a $1.90 per share on a diluted basis, an increase of more than 860 million from a net loss of 393 million in 2017.

The increase in net income was primarily due to increased income from operations as a result of additional trends and operations at Sabine Pass. Decreased loss on modification or extinguishment of debt, increased derivative gains and decreased net income attributable to non-controlling interest, partially offset by increased interest expense net of amount capitalized. During the fourth quarter, we amended our existing revolving credit facility, increasing total commitments to 1.25 billion and extending the maturity date to December of 2022. This undrawn revolving facility enhances our liquidity position and provides a backstop for corpus equity funding obligations.

Turning now to Slide 14 where I'll review our 2019 guidance and touch on the highest priorities for 2019. Jack mentioned earlier, we remain focused on delivering results and today, we are reiterating our full year 2019, consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance of 2.9 to 3.2 billion and distributable cash flow guidance of 0.6 to 0.8 billion. We're also reconfirming our full year 2019 CQP distribution guidance of 235 to 255 per unit. Actual results could be impacted by changes to train completion timing or LNG market pricing.

Before turning the call over to Q&A, I'd like to briefly review our top three financial priorities for 2019. First is to achieve financial results within these guidance ranges. A second priority is to complete a debt financing transaction for 50% of the total cost of Sabine Pass Train 6. We kicked of that process and it is an essential step prior to reaching FID. Jack also mentioned this, but our final key priority for this year is to develop and communicate capital allocation strategy, a process which has been underway for several months now.

As we have previously indicated, we expect our capital allocation plan to support our ability to invest in growth, enable us to maintain investment grade credit metrics of the project and ensure the consolidated leverage is at an appropriate level, and return capital to shareholders in a way most appropriate for Cheniere and our shareholders. We expect to communicate this policy to the investment community in the coming months. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere.

Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from Christine Cho from Barclays. Please go ahead.

Christine Cho

I know it's early for Corpus Christi Stage 3 and it depends on the contract, but how are you thinking about targeted financing for it, especially, as you are in the process of developing your capital allocation policy? Should we also think of it as 50-50 debt equity similar to Train 6?

Michael Wortley

It's Michael. That's how we are thinking about. We continue to deleverage through growth with no more than 50% debt on all the incremental projects and maybe we can bring that down overtime.

Christine Cho

And then, I think on the last quarter call you said that 2.5 to 3 mtpa was the assumption for early cargoes this year. Has the contracting for this book increased since last quarter? And how should we think about your strategy around this, as we move through the year? And we should we still think $5 margin for the un-contracted portion at least what we should assume?

Michael Wortley

Yes, it's Michael again. So, the number is more like 6 million tons I think of post COD volumes with another 1.5 million on top of that commissioning volumes, which won't hit the P&L. So, I don’t know exactly how the portfolio is evolved over the past few months, but certainly we've been selling. One thing to keep in mind as we don't like to sale volumes until we know we have them right, and so as we go through this commissioning process, there is always uncertainty about exactly when the train is going to come on. So, we don’t want to get out of our skis have in place a lot of volume prior to getting the train.

So with that, starting to become behind us, as Jack mentioned, Corpus passed the performance test recently, so we have more certainty there, so the guys will definitely be more active in putting those volumes away. In terms of market, you guys can all see the screen like we can. I told you for the unsold piece of our portfolio we were assuming $4.5 to $5.5 margins when we did our budget three or four months ago. Clearly that has come in probably almost $2 and so, we gave you that sensitivity on the last call that said for every dollar move in margin it affect our EBITDA by 130 million. So you can do that math. So if we were in the upper half of our guidance range 3 to 4 months ago, certainly, we are lower in that range today, but still within it.

Operator

We will now take our next question from Jeremy Tonet from JP Morgan.

Jeremy Tonet

Just want to build on SPL 6 a little bit more here and see what else is needed for positive FID, seems like the contractual support is largely there. Is it just lining of the financing? And then also it looks like the EPC contract price 2.5 billion is a bit lower than what you have from SPL 5 and I was just wondering what drives the delta there?

Jack Fusco

So, SPL 6, we are extremely excited about as I mentioned on my talking points, we have released Bechtel with limited notice to proceed, so we've locked-in the price, we have locked in the schedule in regards to that, and Bechtel was making extremely good progress as you know. There's a lot of synergies with having the workforce just roll off of 5 into 6. Additionally what you are seeing with the cost of 6, we think is extremely competitive just like Corpus Christi Train 3, and we were able to utilize one not only the synergies of having the workforce already mobilized and the equipment already there to move right into Train 6, but also in the utilizing some of the existing infrastructure that it affords us having the brownfield site. So, we've got the infrastructure that was already built for the first five trains that we've rolled into Train 6 and that's part of the cost reduction. Michael, I don't know if you have anything to add.

Michael Wortley

Yes, I mean on the financing that we're progressing that as we speak. As I said on the last call, as Jack said, we have Bechtel working right, they're full speed ahead. We know price, we know schedule. We don't owe them a full NTB until all of the summer. And so, as I said on the last call, we're just kind of waiting to see what contracts come in and that the best portfolio is to really attach to that train for financing purposes. And since the last call you saw Petronas come in, which is very clean, FOB deal, which we like to put down with the project.

So, that's 3 or 4 months to see what else comes in and then decide the optimum mix and close that financing, but that's not flowing us down in anyway because we're underway on Train 6, and then, I'd add to Jack's comments on, remember, when we built Train 5, the first four trains leveraged a lot of infrastructure that we had at the re-gas facility, all the utilities and things like that. With Train 5, we had to really add all of that and we did that in anticipation of Train 6, so Train 5 was always going to be a higher cost train, Train 6 was far more attractive on a cost perspective. There's so much infrastructures in place from a Train 5 build. So, yes, just like Train 3.

Jeremy Tonet

And just want to switch gears over to ESG. It seems like the greater focal point for the marketplace for investors going forward here. And I was just wondering, if you could tell us how Cheniere thinks about these issues? How you position yourself? And how you guys see yourself stacking up versus other energy infrastructure companies?

Jack Fusco

Yes, so, we're very excited here recently, organizationally, we are able to bring on a Fiji George, who is from Southwest, who's got a lot of experience in ESG type programs, and he's been spearheading our effort as well as Chris Smith who is our Senior Vice President of External Affairs in Washington DC. And you all may know, Chris, he was Assistant Secretary of Energy under the previous administration. So, we think we need to be a leader in it, as you know we feel like we're on the right side of the equation when it comes to ESG.

We think natural gas is a solution. It's economic, it's secure and it's sustainable. And I know what you see around the world is a policy shift. I think it’s going to be a secular shift in the way energy is utilized worldwide. And I think you're going to see natural gas and liquefied natural gas take a much more prominent role in that, but we will be rolling out our ESG methodology and program here very soon. Anatol, do you have anything to?

Anatol Feygin

No, it's just exactly as you said, we are focused, we are looking to leverage our position on the gas procurement side as well as our ability to supply this clean and reliable fuel to the rest of the world and have the rest of the world achieve the type of carbon dioxide reductions that the U.S. has enjoyed over the last decade.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Michael Weber from Wells Fargo Securities. Mr. Weber, please go ahead. Your line is open.

Michael Weber

Jack, just wanted to start off with a quick note of your market-based question. Overnight, we saw tensions escalate in Pakistan and India. You guys obviously have some exposure there in India. I'm just curious, can you maybe -- you are in the risk and in fact your business -- can you maybe walk us through the impacts theoretically of a force majeure there on your import contracts, if we saw replay of 1999 or a broader conflict? And then maybe I guess within the context and kind of walking through that see those volumes just get pushed into the spot market and make them up on the back ends. I know it's early but it seems pretty pressing so…

Jack Fusco

Yes, there is no force majeure, Michael, right. It's FOB. So our contract with Gail, they take up at phalange at Sabine Pass and they can take it wherever they want to take it and that’s one of the benefits of U.S. LNG and the Cheniere model. So from that perspective, we don’t see anything meaningful one way or the other.

Q - Michael Weber

So, it wouldn't be applicable to an FOB-based contracts, is that basically what you are saying?

Jack Fusco

It's not, no, we would expect them to honor their contract and we would enforce our contract. But so far relationship with Gail is extremely strong and we continue to try to meet their needs.

Michael Weber

And then maybe just around the competitive dynamics in an around the U.S. gulf I guess it's been -- going to bit more crowded in the last quarter or two with FID at Golden Pass and BG kind of knocking on the door. I guess maybe a little bit more insight in guess within the industry in terms of where those deals are getting done. Do you have a better sense yet around whether you have been able to price or able to command a premium for your volumes relative to your peers in the U.S. gulf? And if so maybe kind of a vague sense on where you think that is?

Jack Fusco

So, a couple of things; one, I think when you see a lot of other folks that want to have a position like Cheniere and then it reconfirms that our business model, our position is second to none, right worldwide. And so I'm very excited about that. As you know we were a first mover, and we've executed extremely well, right. You can compare us to just about everybody else in the U.S. and see that our construction effort has been second to none. Our operating ability in the handoff from construction operations has been second to none. Our ability to produce real volume in a growing demand market has been second to none. So I feel very good about our ability to execute. And I do think our full service model and our ability to deliver anywhere around the world has afforded us a slight premium to where the spot market is clearing today.

Operator

We will take the next question from Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.

Craig Shere

Michael, in May 2018 in your mini Analyst Day, I think you guided that on a nine train program that you won't be required to think about debt amortization out of operating cash flows at both the MLP SPL level and also at the LNG Corpus Christi level till late 2020s. Can you kind of share what maybe the all equity funding of $300 a ton upsizing of all the liquefaction trains? And the possible successful addition of 50-50 Corpus Christi phase 3 would do to that? Would it push amortization requirements into the 2030s?

Michael Wortley

Yes, absolutely. I don’t know what the exact date is, but that we would look to get into the details on that when we hit the road probably after our next call to rollout capital allocation and Train 6 numbers and probably add some Stage 3 numbers into the whole model. But absolutely, I mean every piece of equity differs that amortization date.

Craig Shere

And so speaking of Phase 3, since Corpus Train 3 you signed four agreements with total of 5.75 mtpa which obviously is more than you could possibly need for 4.5 at saving 6. How much do you feel like you already have in the back so to speak towards Corpus Phase 3? And what minimum percentage of the 9.5 mtpa would you like to seek contracted before perhaps an FID next year?

Anatol Feygin

Yes, I mean we definitely have more contracts than we need for Train 6 for sure. We have drawn down kind of some of our CMI inventory to service some of that, but the plan would be to, we would think that piece of our business competitive advantage so to keep some capacity there. How much do we need on Stage 3? I think we are running a couple of cases. One where we build the whole thing and one where we build half of it, and certainly, we are making our way towards at least building half of it, but not quite there yet.

Jack Fusco

And I would say, Craig, we are extremely excited about Corpus Christi in our ability to expand. We think there are no constraints with the site, there is constraints with nat gas, pipeline capacity coming into the site, the amount of infrastructure is there, and then our location to the Permian should be a real advantage to us all the way around. So, we are not going to slow down on the growth side, I think I have got some of the best originators in this industry and we are going to capitalize upon that.

Craig Shere

Jack, if can I kind of dovetail on those comments. Do you see prospects related to corpus Phase 3 signing both supply and offtake agreements linked to Brent or perhaps a Texas-based gas sub like Waha or Agua Dulce.

Jack Fusco

Anatol, you wanted to take this.

Anatol Feygin

Thanks Jack, thanks Craig. I think one of the things that, that was surprising and in some sense amazing in the LNG market in 2018 was that, the majority of the contracts that were executed were Henry hub linked. And obviously it was us and our neighbors at BG that had that success. The world has gotten comfortable with this as an attractive model. It offers liquidity price transparency and it has seen a number of times now when if Henry hub has a quick excursion to prices above $3 it comes down very rapidly and continues to be very competitive with Brent linked and other contracts. We continued to think that that is the right flag to fly. Your question about alternative indices, that's a very long pot and in our view the world isn’t ready to price meaningful volume, and Agua Dulce, while it's something that you and we know well just does not have the liquidity, transparency, turn structure that would make it marketable internationally.

Craig Shere

That's very helpful. Very quick last one for, Michael, I think May last year at Analyst Day, in the mini Analyst Day, you said 1.9 billion of incremental forecast equity funding for Corpus Christi Trains 1 to 3, with things progressing seemingly better than expected. Any range of how much that might come under?

Michael Wortley

No, I don't think we're ready to, I mean Train 3 obviously has a long way to go. So I would stick with that number for now.

Jack Fusco

Train 6, we're going to end up with probably close to $300 million of contingency though. And so, that'll get rolled into Train 6 to help meet our 50-50 debt equity, trains to Train 5, we had excess contingency which will roll into Train 6 to achieve our 50-50 debt equity. But on Corpus, I'd stick with the members we put out in May.

Operator

We'll now take our next question from Danilo Juvane from BMO Capital Markets.

Danilo Juvane

My first question is for Michael. You have pretty clear visibility to meet the contracted portion of your cash flow profile. I'm just curious, with that in mind, how you're sort of evaluating the various capital allocation decisions going forward?

Michael Wortley

Yes, we do have a lot of visibility. Again, we'll roll that out in a few months, probably after our next call, hit the road and talk about it. But it's pretty straightforward for us, there's three buckets right, there's the growth bucket, the balance sheet bucket and the shareholder returns bucket. I can tell you we're really excited about the growth, so that's going to be a big number as we look at not only Train 6, but Stage 3, reinvesting in the business is the best use of our money at the returns we think we can generate.

And then one we decide, if we want to do something else on the balance sheet relative to what we’ve already said publicly, so we're thinking through that. And then, there's probably some money left over for some kind of shareholder return. Flexibility is going to be key for us, so we'll keep that in mind as we think about bucket number three, but look to put some real numbers to that, here in the coming months.

Danilo Juvane

And as you think about bucket number 3, is that something that you think you would be able to actually implement this year or try to out to some sort of our runway from your blend?

Michael Wortley

We'll see, I mean probably both, but we’ll see.

Danilo Juvane

My other question is for Jack. You spoke earlier in your prepared remarks about being opportunistic to a CQP simplification. I mean, it seems that, that will be a little bit more difficult to achieve versus what you're able to do at CQH. How should we think about how you'll ultimately end up rolling up the MLP?

Jack Fusco

I think I said it fairly clearly, we're going to be very opportunistic the math that working, and we're going to have a complicated structure for the foreseeable future until we convince all of you that our growth really is there. I think we'll hopefully get you all comfortable and we can actually execute what we say and that we're a conservative bunch overall. But right now, the exchange ratios just don’t work.

Danilo Juvane

And last question from me. With respect to Stage 3, have we ultimately just abandoned midscale investment should be less talk about now, there seems to be shifts in tone in terms of having sort of conventional trains going forward. How should we think about that?

Jack Fusco

We're moving full speed ahead with our midscale solution right now, which is our Corpus Christi Stage 3 that filing which we have in front of FERC right now.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our next question now comes from Jean Salisbury from Bernstein. Please go ahead.

Jean Salisbury

How much advanced locking? And is there a pricing for spot cargoes? Have we seen the full effect of the fourth quarter winter gas spike on margins or will some appear next quarter?

Anatol Feygin

It's Anatol. It's really a mix, as Michael said, we have three trains coming on with the fair amount of time and uncertainty on cargoes, and we are not in the business of going short in the market. As we have said to you before, we do have some tranches.

Obviously, we have early cargoes associated with some term deals that we've executed over the last year as well as some medium term deals for '19 and '20. But for competitive reasons we are not going to get into the specifics of the volumes quarter by quarter.

Jean Salisbury

And then, do you see risk in 2019 that if everything starts up as scheduled some U.S. LNG facilities won't be running at full capacities for part of the year?

Anatol Feygin

It's Anatol again. I really cannot envision that scenario, actually I have to say I can't envision the first premise of that scenario either, but even if that did play out the probability that on a marginal basis there is no value in exporting a $2.5 Henry hub molecule to a strong global market is pretty close to zero to me.

Operator

Our next question comes from Fotis Giannakoulis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead sir.

Fotis Giannakoulis

Anatol, I have one question for you. The last three FIDs they have been resolved long-term SPAs from the respective parties. Is this a new trend? And how does this change the long-term dynamics of the market and your potential margins and growth initiatives beyond the Stage 3 of Corpus Christi?

Anatol Feygin

It's not a surprise to you or to us, it’s a global and competitive market and lots of places have attractive molecules that they want to monetize with a different capital allocation algorithm and different risk tolerance than we do. So, we are always expecting what -- in the U.S. when we have called a producer push component, the LNG market called that the equity lifting model, those are projects that we always believed would be able to get off the ground whether that’s East Africa, Western Canada Arctic Russia, et cetera.

And we are fully expecting to compete with them. We have been competing with them. And they weren’t a surprise to anyone in 2018 where we had pretty close to a record year. So we love the hand that we dealt. We love as Jack said the business model and the track record that we built and we are confident that we will be able to leverage that into continued success but it is a competitive market.

Fotis Giannakoulis

So from your answer shall I take that your strategy over backing every new expansion with long term SPAs will remain intact or there is this new FIDs might change your risk appetite.

Anatol Feygin

We told you a couple of years ago, our model we've continue to refine that, we think that the range of CMI having this warehouse 5% to 20% sort of as the sideboards of volume in, it is a very good number and we're still comfortable with that and we had good success. As Michael mentioned, we in essence drawn down that inventory, we will look to reallocate volumes to that in order to continue to prosecute the type of bridging volume and secure reliable attractive value proposition that we've been successful with. So, there's no reason to change what's been working and is expected to continue working for the foreseeable future.

Operator

Our next question comes from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.

Michael Lapides

Two questions; one, on the last quarterly call you kind of updated the range of potential output or capacity for each train and kind of raised the high-end. Can you talk to us about how you get comfortable with hitting that high-end and is or even upside to that level? I'd love a response on that then I've got a follow on about the balance sheet.

Jack Fusco

Hi Michael, it's Jack. Yes, so from an operating perspective, I would say that we are very comfortable now with the upper end of the range that we gave all of you. We have some debottlenecking initiatives that were -- we have plans of achieving this year with some of our turnaround and maintenance schedules, and you should expect us to revise our output. But I think most of you are probably on Genscape and can see our gas flows into our facility know that we're very close to 5 Bcf a day right now. So we are very, very pleased with the way our trains have been performing.

Michael Lapides

And then, one quick one on the balance sheet. Just curious, how do you think about -- let's say once you get Train 6 online and I know that's we're talking a couple years down the road, what you think about as a normal credit metric that you'd like to achieve, kind of a long run target or a long-run goal and whether that's measured on an FFO to debt or debt to EBITDA perspective?

Jack Fusco

Michael, before Michael Wortley answered that question, I just want to make sure, I read your note this morning. You know with the LNTP of Train 6 that the price and the schedule are fixed and not a risk for us. We haven't had any cost overruns yet. We don't expect to start now on our trains number 8 and 9. So I just want to make sure I got that clear with you.

Michael Lapides

Understood, I've known you for a long time, I've not seen you have very many cost overruns in the 12 to 15 years.

Jack Fusco

Go ahead Michael.

Michael Wortley

On the balance sheet, the rating agencies look at it several different ways, the projects, they care about debt service, coverage ratios and then deconsolidated numbers, consolidated numbers. For us I think we need to keep it simple and just communicate like everybody else which is at the consolidated debt to EBITDA number. And so, that over the long run, I think that's what we will start to look at more and more though the rating agency are more nuanced given our multiple levels of debt.

Michael Lapides

Do have a kind of a mental target in mind of where you'd like that debt to EBITDA number to be once Train 6 is up and running?

Michael Wortley

It will be part of our grand rollout in a few months. Currently, we are at 5 times to 6 times, consolidated by on the upper end of that range from what we said last time. So, that’s what we will stick with for now.

Operator

Our final question today will come from Alex Kania from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.

Alex Kania

I just wanted to touch on the commentary related to maybe the financing package for Sabine Pass 6. Michael, I think you talked about thinking about optimizing what contracts you want to attest that facility. Are you talking mainly about the CMI contract that you've already got secured? Or maybe is there kind of discussions far enough along another FOB type contract that you may want to wait to see play out for you to finalize that?

Michael Wortley

Yes, we have a free option right now, which is that we don't have to give full MTP until summer. So, yes, I think we would just wait and see what happens. I mean, I like our position now, if we have to make a decision tomorrow. I don’t think we would have any problem with that. But given that, we have free time to wait. Bechtel is working hard. Yes, I think we will wait and see if anything else comes down the pipe between now and then. We have Vitol and Petronas, which are FOB deals and then we have a fair amount of [gas] deals, so, yes, we will just wait.

Jack Fusco

And thank you all for your support at Cheniere.

Ladies and gentlemen, I would now turn it back to management for additional or closing remarks.

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Joe. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining Tom Carter, our Chief Financial Officer and me today to review Nexstar's record financial performance and our outlook for 2018-2019. With our record fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results, the December announcement of the Tribune Media transaction and our immediate work on the regulatory approval process and the development of our post closing plans, it's been an active and productive time here at Nexstar.

We believe what we've accomplished since the closing of the Media General transaction, is an important guide for what we will achieve as we move toward the closing of the Tribune transaction expected later this year. Nexstar had an outstanding 2018, our strong fourth quarter and full-year operating results mark our seventh consecutive year of record financial performance with all of our key metrics from net revenue to free cash flow growing at double-digit rates and coming in at the highest levels in the Company's history for both the three and the 12-month periods.

Story continues

The 22.1% rise in fourth quarter net revenue and nearly 100% increase in operating income highlight the ongoing value of our strategies focused on leveraging our local content and community involvement, that generate record shares of political spending in our markets, as well as continued distribution and digital revenue growth. Our ability to capture historic levels of mid-term election spending in our markets combined with the strong operating leverage in our business model drove our record fourth quarter -- a record fourth quarter BCF adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.

For the full year, our enterprisewide focus on managing operations for current and future cash flow enabled us to generate free cash flow of $692.7 million or about $15.20 per share, representing approximately 30% -- 31% growth over 2017 levels. By comparison, if you look back at the 2016 presidential election year and prior to the completion of the Media General transaction, Nexstar generated approximately $7.97 in free cash flow per share, so in just two years, we've grown that important metric by approximately 91%.

In 2018, we brought about $0.25 of every net revenue dollar to the free cash flow line, allowing us to invest in our people, our local media platform and our complementary accretive acquisitions, while at the same time reducing net debt by approximately $400 million and returning over $120 million to shareholders, in the form of share repurchases and dividends.

I'll do a quick review of the quarterly highlights and then review some of the transaction initiatives under way, after which, Tom will go through the financials, including an update on our cap structure, 2019 expectations and other items of interest to those of you on the call.

Again, Nexstar's record fourth quarter financial results highlight our ability to maximize the political revenue opportunity in our markets as we continue to build new to television ad revenue and grow retransmission consent revenue, also combined with the ongoing benefits of our management and operating disciplines. 22.1% rise in fourth quarter net revenue resulted in BCF growth at 57%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 57.3% and free cash flow growth of 62.1%.

In total, Nexstar's fourth quarter core local and national television ad revenue were down little over 1% at $4.7 million down, that's all related to our heavy allocation of inventory to political as we booked over $140 million in political in Q4, were $127 million more than 2017. As expected, local, national ad revenue strengthened as we move through Q4 and they remain up on a year-over-year basis in the 2019 period-to-date.

November and December were the strongest months of 2018 for core advertising revenue, when excluding February, which benefited from the Super Bowl and Olympic-related spending in Q4 of '18, we generated increased ad revenue in three of our top five categories and five of our top ten overall. Core revenue continues to reflect healthy levels of new business with Q4 new to television ad revenue of $16.3 million, which is a 15.6% rise over the prior year. Reflecting our expanded platform and presence in states with contested elections, we generated solid results in the political ad category in markets like Las Vegas, Tampa, Portland and Grand Rapids, to name a few, with a diversified mix from the house, the gubernatorial and senate candidates, as well as healthy contributions from PAC and issue spending.

Nexstar's fourth quarter television ad revenue growth was complemented by the combined fourth quarter retransmission and digital media revenue growth up 10.5% to a combined total of $349.6 million in the fourth quarter and we grew 13.1% to $1.4 billion for the full year, marking the first time in the Company's history that this combined distribution and digital metric has exceeded total television advertising revenue on an annual basis.

Overall, the year-over-year increase in fourth quarter and full year non-television advertising revenue reflects renewals of distribution agreements with MVPDs and initial contributions from distribution agreements with OTT providers and the early '18 accretive acquisition of LKQD, as well as organic growth across our profitable digital operations.

Reflecting the ongoing benefits of our revenue diversification strategies and considering the magnitude of the Q4 '18 political revenue, total fourth quarter retransmission fee and digital media revenue represented 43.8% of our fourth quarter net revenue, compared to 40.7% of total net revenue in 2016. The last even year political quarter. At $284.5 million in the quarter retransmission fee revenue reached the highest ever level for quarter in the Company's history, and we expect our long-term distribution revenue growth to continue at a double-digit pace.

We continue to see consistency in pay television subscriber levels in our markets with now meaningful growth in OTT subs for which we are beginning to be compensated. With the renewal of retransmission consent agreements, representing approximately 10% of our subscriber base in 2018 and approximately 70% in 2019, continued revenue growth from this source remains highly visible for 2019 and beyond. And given the after acquired clauses in our retransmission consent agreements, once we complete the transaction, the Tribune stations are immediate party to our distribution agreements and our rates.

On Tribune with our long-term strategic focus on completing accretive transactions to enhance our overall competitive position, we were delighted to announce in December, our definitive agreement to acquire Tribune were $6.4 billion in an accretive all-cash transaction. Upon closing, Nexstar will be the largest local television group in the United States, and one of the nation's leading providers of local news, entertainment, sports, lifestyle and network programming across all devices. Importantly, we've approached this transaction, just as we did when we acquired Media General. Namely, we've identified and plan to divest of certain television stations necessary to obtain FCC and other regulatory approvals, which we believe will allow us to close the transaction sometime in the third quarter of 2019.

This transaction highlights Nexstar's role as the industry's leading consolidator and represents the culmination of over a year-and-a-half of work. The proposed transaction is a strategically and financially compelling growth opportunity that further expands our geographic diversity and our audience reach.

With 216 combined post divestiture television stations and 118 markets, and rapidly growing digital media operations, Nexstar will offer superior and great engagement across all devices and influence on consumers' purchasing decisions that will be unrivaled by other media, including now large scale digital companies. Pro-forma for the completion of the transaction, we will serve 15 of the nation's top 25 markets and 34 of the top 50 markets and by adding Tribune, we will increase our audience reach by approximately 50% from 26% to 39% of U.S. television households, reflecting the FCC's UHF discount and that audience reach is pro forma for the anticipated divestitures. Pro-forma for the completion of the transaction, Nexstar will generate approximately $900 million in average annual free cash flow pro forma for the 2018-2019 cycle.

That anticipated 46% free cash flow accretion afforded by the transaction relative to our last guide of $615 million for the average annual free cash flow in 2018-2019, clearly surpasses our stated criteria of evaluating strategic growth opportunities against the opportunity to repurchase our own shares. Upon closing, we intend to allocate our free cash flow to rapid leverage reduction as well as the increased return of capital to shareholders and allow us to make additional investments in our business to improve our service to viewers and advertisers.

Notably, we expect our net leverage ratio to approximately 5.3 times at the closing of the transaction and to decline to approximately 4 times by the end of 2020. In fact in the slightly more than two years, since we closed Media General. We have, as expected, reduced our opening leverage from 5.5 times at the closing of the transaction to 3.69 times at 2018 year-end.

So our vigilance with respect to managing leverage is obviously well documented. As with our past acquisitions, we developed a comprehensive regulatory compliance plan for required station divestitures and a detailed integration plan that will result in significant synergy realization. Nexstar has committed financing for the transaction and has made all required FCC and other regulatory applications and as you've likely read in the press, Nexstar and Tribune are actively engaged in the process of reviewing our planned divestiture stations with respective purchasers.

We've also embarked on a battery of station due diligence visits with more to come even this week and based on these meetings, our corporate management team and our executive team are refining our strategic plans for each station and business unit to ensure they operate with Nexstar's proven disciplines and adopt and implement best practices enterprise wide post closing.

The common core principles underlying the Tribune transaction and the Media General deals completed in -- the Media General deal, which we completed in January '17 is that they both represent further steps along our path of growing our local marketing and content platform and free cash flow through accretive acquisitions. Our growth has been rapid, yet measured in each of our transactions and while we've met or exceeded our synergy targets we've also improved operations and margins significantly and we've reduced the purchase multiple to what we acquired going in.

Importantly, with our track record of significant post transaction synergy realization and the organic growth in front of us including significant upcoming distribution renewals, as well as the 2020 presidential election and the continued growth of our digital platform, Nexstar will be posed for rapid leverage reduction and increased capital returns for shareholders, and will be one of the nation's preeminent local and national brand builders.

Nexstar will offer brands and advertisers a deep and truly diversified local marketing and content platform allowing us compete even more aggressively in the dynamic and rapidly converging advertising markets. And as an industry leader with a portfolio of premier stations and digital assets, a strong balance sheet and attractive weighted average cost of capital and significant free cash flow and free cash flow growth, we are also extremely well positioned to continue to build value for our shareholders.

In January, we announced a 20% increase in the amount of our quarterly cash dividend marking our sixth annual consecutive rise in our cash dividend. With the annual dividend rate now at $1.80 per share, approximately 45.6 million Nexstar Media Group shareholders and our $900 million of pro forma average free annual cash flow in 2018-2019, we'll be in a sweet spot for deleveraging, as well as other shareholder-friendly initiatives as I said.

With that, let me turn the call over to Tom Carter, who I'd like to acknowledge for his insights, his vision and his tireless efforts as we move toward the execution of our definitive agreements with Tribune, as well as the financing package. Tom?

Tom Carter -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Perry and good morning everybody. I'll start with a review of Nexstar's Q4 income statement and balance sheet data, after which I'll provide an update on our capital structure and some points of guidance. To start, as noted previously, effective 11 of 2018, the Company adopted the new revenue accounting guidance issued by FASB. As a result, beginning on 11 of '18, the Company presents local, national digital and political revenues net of their related agency commissions. This morning's release also provided the 2017 Q4 and year-to-date, local, national and political revenue comps adjusted to net out the sales commissions. In addition, we no longer recognize barter revenue and barter expense related to the exchange of advertising time for certain program materials.

These changes don't impact the Company's past or future income from operations, net income, BCF, adjusted EBITDA or free cash flow. Also effective at the beginning of 2018, the Company adopted an accounting standards update, which requires pension and other post retirement plans cost or credit other than service cost to be presented outside of income from operations. Thus the income from operations during the 3 and 12 months ended 12/31/2018 was decreased by a pension I'm sorry, 12/31/2017 was decreased by a pension and other post retirement credit of $4.2 million and $13.1 million respectively. And I'm pleased to say that's the last time I'll have to remind everyone of those accounting changes.

Now turning to the Q4 income statement. Net revenues were $798 million, which was a 22% increase over the same fourth quarter -- over the same period the previous year, fourth quarter of 2017. Total television ad revenue, local, national, political was up almost 39% to $438 million with local revenue down 1.5% to $216 million and national revenue at $81.9 million, which was down 1.8%. Political revenue, as Perry mentioned, was a record high of $140.2 million for the fourth quarter, which is up over 1000% of the same period in 2017, and digital revenues were up approximately 3%.

Profitability metrics across the Board were records with broadcast cash flow of approximately $380 million, adjusted EBITDA before one-time expenses of $358 million and free cash flow before one-time expenses of approximately $255 million.

On a same-station basis, our results were very comparable to the 2017 -- 2018 reported results with net revenue up approximately 22% total television ad revenue on a same-station basis, up 38% local revenue on a same-station basis was down 2% as was national revenue and digital revenues were up 3%. Retransmission fee revenues on a same-station basis we're very much comparable to the actual reported results and were up 12%.

As Perry mentioned, we recorded net political revenue of $140 million in the quarter, which exceeded our net political guidance for the full year and to further emphasize the strength of the election spending in our markets during 2018 mid-terms, full year same station political ad revenue came in 50% higher than the comparable 2014 period and 38% higher than the 2016 presidential election cycle.

Fourth quarter non-television advertising revenue increased 10.5% including 12.3% in retransmission fee revenues and 3.3% in -- rise in digital revenues. While full-year digital revenues were up 15.2%, fourth quarter was impacted by timing issues related to the implementation of required updates of our technology platform to comply with GDPR and authorized dealer sellers -- digital seller specifications, as well as rebranding and consolidation of certain digital businesses to focus on profitability.

During the fourth quarters of 2018 and 2017, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $19.9 million and $20 million respectively relating to goodwill and intangible assets of our digital businesses, including the last of the goodwill writedowns from legacy Media General assets. Fourth quarter station direct operating expense,s net of trade expense, rose 5.5%, primarily reflecting the growth in broadcast ad sales, as well as budget increase in network affiliation expense and expenses from LKQD. Same station fixed expenses including programming expenses were down 1.3% year-over-year. The 7.9% rise in fourth quarter G&A expense primarily reflects higher variable costs relating to the higher political revenues and our previously disclosed reclassification of certain digital administrative expenses to corporate expense.

Nexstar's fourth quarter -- corporate expense was in line with our expectations at $29.5 million inclusive of $8.5 million in stock-based compensation and $5.5 million of one-time transaction cost relating to the Tribune merger. This was largely in line with our guidance for the fourth quarter recurring cash overhead exclusive of stock comp of approximately $18 million to $19 million.

Overall, our significant fourth quarter revenue growth combined with ongoing expense management resulted in substantial increases in fourth quarter BCF and adjusted EBITDA margins, which rose to 47.6% and 44.2% respectively. Looking ahead to the 2019 first quarter, we project recurring corporate overhead, while approximately $20 million inclusive of stock -- exclusive of stock comp and Tribune related transaction expenses. Non-cash compensation is projected to be approximately $7 million for the quarter and $37 million for the year, reflecting anticipated issuance of new equity incentive awards later this year.

Cash transaction expenses primarily severance and success oriented fees cannot be capitalized -- that cannot be capitalized or expected to be approximately $5 million to $7 million during the first quarter.

Turning to balance sheet, I'll review a couple of key items at 12/31/2018. Total net leverage at that date was 3.69 times, which compares to 4.23 at the end of Q3 and 5.07 at the end of fourth quarter -- Q4 of '17. Covenant first lien leverage was 2.11 versus a covenant of 4.25, which compares to 2.59 at the end of Q3 '18 and 3.20 at the end of Q4 '17.

Our outstanding debt associated with the balance sheet amounted first lien debt of $2.4 billion, comprised of the term loans, with a decrease from September 30th, reflecting an additional $167 million in payments on the term loans in Q4 with cash from operations.

Our three outstanding bond issues, the 6.125%, the 5.875% and 5.625%, remain outstanding in approximately $1.5 billion in total outstandings. Net debt at December 31, 2018, amounted to approximately $3.84 billion compared to $4.25 billion a year ago and $4.7 billion in January of '17, when we close the MEG transaction, thus we quickly reduced debt by approximately $850 million since the closing the Media General transaction through eight quarters of operation even as we've allocated capital to serve other shareholder enhancement initiatives.

As you'll see in the 10-K, which is expected to be filed this evening, subsequent to quarter end, we made additional principal payments of approximately $10 million and through the 13-month period ended January 31, 2019, $412 million in total debt repayments. We anticipate making additional principal payments on the senior facility over the next several months.

In line with Nexstar's focuses on actively managing our capital structure and cost of capital, we closed on the $2.7 billion repricing our outstanding senior secured term loan facilities early in 4Q. The new terms represent a 25-basis point interest rate reduction compared to the Company's prior senior secured term loans and revolving credit facilities, resulting in approximately a $7 million reduction in the Company's annual interest expense, increasing net income and free cash flow by approximately $5 million on an annualized basis.

As it relates to our funding of the pending acquisition of Tribune Media, we intend to be opportunistic in tapping the markets and have a $6.4 billion committed financing facility, initially provided by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank, to fund the transactions cash consideration. Similar to our previous transaction, our intention is to have pro forma capital structure reflect a proper balance of fixed and floating debt and attractive weighted average cost of capital with prepayment and refinancing flexibility.

At closing, which is anticipated in 3Q of 2019, we expect our net leverage to be approximately 5.3 times on an L8QA adjusted EBITDA basis after giving effect to the transaction, the incurrence of that transaction expenses anticipated first year synergies of $160 million and net of the divestiture proceeds.

With the free cash flow generated from base operations, we expect Nexstar's net leverage to decline to the 4 times range by the end of 2020. We've remain committed to applying our growing free cash flow to drive shareholder returns and our record 2018 results including full year cash flow of $693 million, enabled us to remain opportunistically active in taking action to enhance shareholder value through the year with our total return of capital in leverage reduction activities amounting to approximately $521 million, including net debt reduction of $400 million, dividend payments of approximately $70 million and share repurchases of approximately $50 million. In addition, we funded the $120 million accretive acquisitions in the digital and television space during the year.

Fourth quarter total interest expense approximated $53.9 million compared to $52.7 million in the prior year's period, while cash interest expense was $51.8 million compared to $50 million in the prior year. We expect cash interest expense to approximately $50 million in Q1 of 2019. In Q4, we had operating cash taxes of approximately $32.7 million compared to $7 million of cash taxes in Q4 of '17. Full-year operating cash taxes were approximately $90 million, including a net payment of $1.1 million relating to tax liabilities in an assumed acquisition and payment slightly below our full year guidance of approximately $100 million. We expect operating cash taxes to amount to between $110 million and $115 million for the year and $20 million for Q1 of 2019.

Nexstar's CapEx for the quarter totaled $42 million of which $28.6 million was related to the station infrastructure investments, our platform programming digital operations with the remaining $13.3 million for station spectrum repack and relinquishment of spectrum costs, which are fully reimbursable.

Through 12/31/2018, we have spent $29.7 million included in CapEx, of which $29 million has been been reimbursed as it relates to the income statement, both relating to the spectrum repack. We expect CapEx in Q1 of 2019 to approximately $20 million with an additional amount for repack CapEx.

Our Q4 cash flow was approximately $250 million inclusive of the impact of $5.5 million of one-time transaction expenses and this compares with consensus estimates of approximately $230 million. With 2017- 2018 average annual free cash flow of over $610 million, before one-time expenses and projected to be slightly higher on a 2018-2019 basis, our near and long-term path to growth and enhancement of shareholder value remains on plan.

As it relates to management's focus on free cash flow generation, our record 2018 and positive outlook for Nexstar Media Group will follow the approach we've successfully deployed in terms of building the top line, maintaining close control of fixed and variable costs and optimizing the balance sheet and capital structure. The plan will continue to support our goals of generating significant free cash flow while allowing us to reduce leverage, pursue additional selective accretive acquisitions, pay dividends, repurchase shares and take other actions taken that enhance shareholder value.

Our focus on free cash flow is a key driver of our attraction to the Tribune assets and the value we can create by combining the companies. As Perry noted, we expect the transaction to result in approximately $900 million of average annual free cash flow in the 2018-2019 cycle or 46% more than our last guidance for Nexstar -- for legacy Nexstar of $615 million of annual free cash flow in the same period.

All of our pre-Tribune merger activities in due diligence continues to support our $900 million or $19.15 a share of free cash flow, but we recognize that our analysts and others continue to model Nexstar stand-alone in the periods leading up to the Tribune, closing later this year. As such, we reiterate the $900 million Tribune guidance and remind you that the two variables related to Tribune that we are aggressively working on every day, are the divestitures in the financing and we look forward to reporting to you as we finalize those items.

Now, I'll provide some guidance points for next our stand-alone over the next two years. First, as I mentioned before, we reiterate our guidance on 2018-2019 cycle of approximately $615 million per year or $13.40 rolling that forward today we're establishing guidance for average annual free cash flow in the 2019-2020 cycle of approximately $660 million or $14.40 a share or $1 more than the prior guidance.

The 2019 guidance assumes that core advertising is up slightly in 2019 versus 2018. The trend that we have seen since the November post election. Our guidance assumes that net political revenue in 2019 will decline almost $220 million compared to the 2018 period with respect to deep potential for early primary spending later this year, we're using historical data and not at this time forecasting anything in the way of material changes from past pre-presidential election cycle revenues.

As we've indicated previously, retrans and digital revenues will both grow low double-digits in 2019 over 2018 levels and again we have a high percentage of renewals at the end of this year, which will show up in our 2020 retrans growth. 2020, of course, will be a political year, so we'll see the same type of inventory management, we successfully exercised in 2018 to maximize this revenue opportunity.

I'm not going to provide guidance for 2020 core because it's just too far out and our sites will be based on driving political dollars in that year.

In summary, Nexstar is executing well on all functions including operations, integration, synergy realization, capital structure and service to our communities. Our disciplines in these areas have driven successful growth as well as consistency and visibility in our results with our financial results and the value we expect to derive from our pending accretive merger with Tribune Media. We continue to believe we have forged a clear path for the continued near and long-term enhancement of shareholder value.

As such, we're excited about our guidance for pro forma and annual average free cash flow in the 2018-2019 cycle of $900 million for the post Tribune merger and approximately $19.50 per share, per year. Our long-term experience in integrating acquired assets and our success over the last eight quarters and outperforming our synergy targets and driving other operating efficiencies related to the transaction of the Media General operations, will serve us well as we add Tribune Media to our operating base upon closing this year.

That concludes the financial review, and now I'll turn the call back over to Perry for some closing remarks before Q&A.

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Thanks very much, Tom. In the almost 23 years since Nexstar was founded, we remain true to our mission to deliver premium local programming and content as well as advertising solutions at the local level now with the growing scale for advertisers as well as political campaigns. This focus has proven to be good business for Nexstar as it consistently has positioned us to continue to invest in our business as well as reducing leverage and aggressively returning capital to shareholders and building shareholder value.

Consumer's brand awareness in purchasing decisions are every bit as strong if not stronger at the local level where businesses is operated and transactions take place. Local diversified media companies like ours, are uniquely positioned to thrive in today's multi-platform world because we provide superior local content that is unique and relative to each of the local communities that we serve across the U.S. while offering local businesses advertisers and brands unparalleled 24/7 marketing opportunities across all screens and all devices.

At the same time, our development of complementary retrans and digital revenue streams have materially diversified our revenue mix and we continue to focus on implementing new standards and technologies to monetize the unrivaled reach, trust and influence of our leading local platform. The fourth quarter marked a strong end to a record year of financial performance for Nexstar as well as the beginning of what we expect to be a tremendous period of growth for the Company with our pending acquisition of Tribune Media.

As we begin to benefit from initial contributions from Tribune later this year as well as the continued double-digit growth of

combined retransmission and digital revenue, a large number of distribution contract renewals up at the end of the year and what many expect to be a very substantial and possibly unprecedented spending level related to the 2020 presidential election cycle. We have excellent visibility to delivering on or exceeding our free cash flow targets and a clear path for the continued near and long-term enhancement of shareholder value through our commitment to localism, innovation and growth.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our operator to express and hear from you as to your specific areas of interest. Operator?

Questions and Answers:

Operator

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The first question will come from Marci Ryvicker with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.

Marci Ryvicker -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Thank you. I'm surprised by the core guide for '19, so curious what's driving positive core? Is this Nexstar's specific? Is just the overall better environment? Is it a contribution from auto or is it growing in spite of auto?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

I would say it's a little bit of all of the above. Marci, we budget conservatively for core growth this year. But I would say into the absence of political has inventory back into our base that we can resell to local advertisers, automotive is better than what we saw ending the Q4 period and 2018. I think it's just a combination of things. I think at Main Street, there is a pretty good level of confidence in the economy. And so, we're also beating (ph) the business for new business. So I think it's a combination of things that, that are driving the growth and with January and February in the books, we are over budget on core, our core revenue budgets for this year and obviously in February, we budget it down because of the Olympics last year, but we have exceeded our goals in the first two months of the year. Small sample size, but it's the beginning of a streak.

Marci Ryvicker -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Got it. In terms of the Tribune deal, I have a couple of questions. It feels like you're still on par to close in Q3 despite the government shutdown. I assume that means that conversations with the regulators are going well. And then can you also update us on the timing of station divestitures that forthcoming in the next couple of weeks?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Sure. The station divestiture process is robust. There are a number of participants that are moving forward and have advanced into our next round. We do anticipate being in a position to announce the divestiture buyers and stations and markets, and all of those details by the end of the quarter and maybe a little sooner than that.

Marci Ryvicker -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Got it. Any conversation with the FCC or DOJ or anything you can comment on?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

No. Other than, we have made a commitment that we will deliver to them a quote-unquote clean transaction. We won't be asking for any waivers of any existing regulations and we're keeping our eye on the price of closing the big deal.

Marci Ryvicker -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Got it. And then last question, does your net leverage or any commentary on synergies related to Tribune include the real estate sales coming from Tribune?

Tom Carter -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Not in 2019, but in 2020, and really all it is, is a -- would be a cash inflow and a debt reduction because the economics of the real estate really don't materially affect the EBITDA of Tribune, in our view.

Marci Ryvicker -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Got it. Thank you so much.

Operator

Thank you. The next question will come from Dan Kurnos with Benchmark. Please go ahead.

Daniel Kurnos -- Benchmark -- Analyst

Yes, good morning. Heck of a quarter guys. Just quickly to go back on the core. I think the bigger surprise in the quarter was Q4 core strength. Perry , you talked about November and December being particularly strong and we're kind of trying to do the math or crowd. I know it's never really a clean number. But if you could give us a sense of kind of what December was up and kind of what you think sort of ex-crowd out Q4 look like, that would be helpful?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

I can tell you core December was up mid single-digit and the crowd out thing is almost impossible to quantify because the last passenger on the plane pays the highest rate, so some of the political rates were multiples of what regular advertisers pay on a 52-week basis. So it's hard, you would have to assume a static demand and quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year and of course that's not the case. So, I hesitate to comment on that because I wouldn't want to lead you down and exit ramp that goes nowhere. But we did see mid mid single growth in core and as I look at Q1 core revenue again with the comparison of February out of the mix. If I look at January and March taken together, it's a mid single-digit pacing increase on core business, right now.

Daniel Kurnos -- Benchmark -- Analyst

Perfect. That's really helpful. And then obviously you had a bit of a protracted negotiation with TDS which got resolved. I know you guys talked about a pretty healthy retrans outlook. I don't know if those negotiations are getting any more contentious, but it doesn't sound like your outlook has been changed. But if you care to comment on sort of the landscape that you're seeing there?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

You know, there's a deal of contention in every negotiation and ultimately, a constructive conversation. So, I don't think the -- certainly we feel that this is a business and revenue stream that we pioneered that we pay a lot of attention to it, treat it with respect and do a lot of planning and analysis before we begin the negotiation. So I -- the the outage is the exception rather than the rule, if you look at our track record here and I don't think the 2019 renewals will be any different from that, from where we sit today.

Daniel Kurnos -- Benchmark -- Analyst

Great. And then just last, Tom. I don't know if I maybe misheard you, but you said retrans up double digits and assuming that was gross, as your outlook -- you guys outlook changed at all for net for this year and next?

Tom Carter -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

No.

Daniel Kurnos -- Benchmark -- Analyst

And what was that outlook, if you care to reiterate Tom?

Tom Carter -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

It will be low double-digit growth in net retrans this year and slightly more than that next year.

Daniel Kurnos -- Benchmark -- Analyst

Got it. Thank you very much guys.

Operator

Thank you for the question. The next question will come from David Joyce with Evercore. Please go ahead .

David Joyce -- Evercore -- Analyst

Thank you. If you could just provide some more color on a couple of the revenue items. I was just wondering why digital was down, was there some political impact in that somehow. And what should we think about that contributing going forward? And then secondly, on the new to TV advertisers, what should we think about in terms of the upside from there. Are those advertisers who are allocating to local media or they just literally newer companies in your footprint, if you could provide some more color there will be great? Thank you.

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Sure. When you look at our digital revenue number. As reported, there are two components there, local site revenue and then there's Nexstar Digital , which is our digital operating company. Nexstar site revenue for the quarter was up high-single digits and that's usually high-single low-double digit growth, consistently for us. Nexstar Digital, basically the revenue was flattish, but let me read the financial statements from the bottoms up in 2017, Q4, we had negative operating income of about $3 million for Nexstar Digital and in Q4 of 2018, we had positive operating income of approximately $5 million.

So, the lower top line growth was a conscious decision, not to chase on profitable revenue and also the cessation of certain unprofitable lines of business, and you did see we took an impairment charge in the fourth quarter related some of those legacy businesses that will no longer be contributing.

I think on a going forward basis, if I again look at site revenue, January's growth was double-digit and we anticipate that being the case for the quarter on our site revenue and we are off to a good start in Nexstar Digital and I think you'll see a return to a consistent high-single low-double digit growth, as the year progresses on the combined metric.

Your second question was on new to television advertising, If I remember, and these are literally in a local marketplaces, we probably do business consistently with somewhere between 5% and 10% of the registered businesses in the marketplace. And so, our greenfield opportunities, the other 90% of the of the businesses that exist in a local market that don't do business with us. And so, there is a tremendous incentive to develop new business, tremendous commission potential. And so, it's just part of our culture and and quite frankly, I think it will be a driver of post closing growth in the Tribune acquisition, because they've not focused as much on business development in their markets, as I think they will under Nexstar.

David Joyce -- Evercore -- Analyst

Great, thank you very much.

Operator

Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Kyle Evans with Stephens. Please go ahead.

Kyle Evans -- Stephens -- Analyst

Hi, thanks. You guys posted 50% cycle growth, it sounds like in '18 off of '14. Can you help us think that on the '12 and '16 cycles and give us present contribution as a percent of total political for those periods?

Tom Carter -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

'12 is a little far back from a reach perspective for me, I don't have that information, but on '16, I want to say that it was traditionally low relative to other presidential elections and it was probably somewhere in the 20% to 25% contribution of total political. And before it had been closer to 30%.

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. I was going to say almost closer to 40% contribution from presidential, but remember in 2016, President Trump didn't spend a lot of money on his own behalf because of all the free media that he was getting at the time. We don't anticipate that being the case in 2020, but again for being conservative, we're use -- basically using historical numbers for 2020 compared to '16 and the end of '15. So that parallel would be '19 into '20.

Kyle Evans -- Stephens -- Analyst

Could you -- I'm sorry, could you say that last statement one more time?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

So, I'm just saying, we're basically -- we're not assuming huge growth in political revenue in '20 over '16 on a pro forma basis, at this point in time.

Kyle Evans -- Stephens -- Analyst

Okay. Got it. And then I know you can't make detailed commentary here, but I'm interested from a high level kind of your views on Apollo's COGS (ph) transaction, how that either does or doesn't change your operator perspective?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Well, I think it's a net positive for shareholders to have private equity interest in the business because that should help to firm up valuations. My understanding of that. We dropped out of the COGs process when we acquired Tribune because we couldn't acquire COGs under the National ownership gap (ph), but my understanding is that the headline price will be a healthy multiple probably above where the space is trading today. But time will tell and the documents will need to be made public before we can know for sure, but we see it as a net positive in the space, but there is private equity interest and anytime there's another buyer that should help values.

Kyle Evans -- Stephens -- Analyst

Great, thank you.

Operator

Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Zack Silver with B. Riley, FBR. Please go ahead.

Zack Silver -- B. Riley, FBR -- Analyst

Okay, great. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to kind of discuss local viewership and given how compelling the 2018 election cycle was, it seems like that could have provided a nice lift for local news viewership. Can you provide an update on how viewership trends were during the election? And if you have available how they are pacing in December as well as maybe year-to-date?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

As you know, we subscribe to comps for primarily and there is not huge users of Nielsen, suffice to stay there was enhanced interest in local news during the election cycle. We produced 83 debates across our footprint that were well viewed during the election cycle. We don't get a rating book, our November rating book until now and we're in a rating period in February, that we won't see the results until April. So, kind of hard to me to comment on current trends here. But again, we've expanded our local newsprint -- footprint even within our local group and launched additional news broadcasts, since the beginning of the year. And so, we obviously believe it's a good business and we will continue to grow our footprint, which will grow our gross aggregate eyeballs just because of more time periods being programmed for local news.

Zack Silver -- B. Riley, FBR -- Analyst

Got it. Thank you, Perry, and then one more if I could. Can you just give us an update on the tip initiative and when we may see that providing some left to core advertising?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Sure, that's the television interface practices and project or whatever you want to use for the initials, but the whole focus there is to provide more automation to the bay-sell process with local television stations to make the business more profitable for the agencies to do business with us. We are attempting to automate all of the back-end processes, the reconciliations, log times and all of that. We're not focused on the front end of the buy-sell process, but it's more of the automation of all the processes around make goods and invoicing and those kinds of things. And we had a press release, which you should have seen earlier this year, that talked about milestones that we'd achieved and our roadmap of what we look to achieve in 2018.

And our goal is to have the whole back-end process automated and vendors designing to that process, which they are now. And these -- it's basically open standards here at the business rules, here's how we see going about it, let the market determine who are the winners and losers from a technology standpoint, but at least have business rules and common standards, my goal is ultimately searchable APIs, but at this point, we're just taking it a step at a time, but I think if we can remove the friction out of the reconciliation part of the process that will be a huge saving for agencies and we hope the money will flow back to -- an increasing money will flow into spot television because of its superior value proposition for the advertiser, we just have to make it profitable for the agency to do business with us.

So, more will come as the year goes on and our goal is that we'll have the whole back-end process automated by the end of the year and then obviously now it's -- it will be up to agencies to adopt those standards and to implement them when -- and that's our ultimate goal.

Zack Silver -- B. Riley, FBR -- Analyst

Got it. That's interesting. Thank you very much.

Operator

Thank you for your question. The next question will come from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Please go ahead.

Craig Huber -- Huber Research Partners -- Analyst

Yes, hi. Thank you, a few questions. Maybe, I think you said January and March TV pacings were up mid single digits, if you included February. Are you sort of suggesting is up say 1%, 2% for the whole quarter year-over-year as it stands right now?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Let me look. Yes, it's up slightly, probably on the order of about 1% as we see it today.

Craig Huber -- Huber Research Partners -- Analyst

Thank you for that. And then how would you categorize auto relative to that, is it better or worse?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

I have not drove down into category pacing by category yet, but that Tim Busch is in the room. He can comment on that. Tim, do you want to talk about auto pacing for the quarter?

Timothy Busch -- President, Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

Auto pacing has been slowly improving and certainly over prior quarter.

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

So, hopefully that's helpful to you.

Craig Huber -- Huber Research Partners -- Analyst

Yes, appreciate that. You're paying TV subs like say in the fourth quarter, what was that number on a year-over-year basis, was it flat? Up a little bit? Down a little bit?

Tom Carter -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

I would say down a little bit.

Craig Huber -- Huber Research Partners -- Analyst

Okay. And then also wanted to jump over now that your are basically two years off the Media General deal, can you remind us please, how much was the original synergies you've told us where you thought you would get out of Media General deal, and what is it coming out now you look back on it?

Tom Carter -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

The original synergies when we announced the deal were $75 million. When we closed the deal, we up that to $81 million, and I would say obviously we stop keeping count after a little while. But in the first nine months, we totaled between $85 million and $87 million in synergies.

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

And I think we have to give commentary the time that there would be additional synergies in years two and three, which we have realized on the order of single-digit million dollars of contract run-outs and lease cancellations and things like that. So, we've realized that as part of our '19 guidance as well.

Craig Huber -- Huber Research Partners -- Analyst

And do you think the $160 million. I think you've talked about for Tribune has potential upside too, I know it's early, but do you feel pretty conservative about that number?

Tom Carter -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Well, it is what it is until that something different.

Craig Huber -- Huber Research Partners -- Analyst

Okay, thanks a lot guys.

Operator

Thank you. The next question will come from Steven Cahall with Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.

Steven Cahall -- Royal Bank of Canada -- Analyst

Thanks. Maybe first Perry, just to drill down on what you said on the 2020 presidential election. I think a lot of us intuitively agree that it probably won't look like 2016. But just wondering if you could help us sleep a little better with why you think that's the case. Are you hearing that from some of your ad agencies? Are you hearing that from the parties that are putting money to work. So anyway you could couch that would be helpful?

And then, Tom, just on the debt, I think, in December, you said about the Tribune debt refinancing it that we should stay tune. Just wondering if you have any updated thoughts on how you're thinking about the Tribune debt. And just reluctantly (ph) when it comes to debt reduction, is there any value or transaction you think it's possible for food network? Thank you.

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Let me first start with political; Tim Busch, who's President of Nexstar Broadcasting, is in the room, just made a tour of all of the major political agencies in Washington. So let him remark on their pulse of things.

Timothy Busch -- President, Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

I would tell you that the president election is probably going to come earlier this year, meaning for the primary races than we have seen in prior cycles. It will also be more robust because you'll have a larger field of candidates and you may have opposition on the incumbent party. And so, you're also going to see spending that will need to occur from our president, which we did not see in 2016, to that degree. And then lastly, pack and party moneys that should be more robust to support eventual candidates beyond the primary. So, you're going to just see overall activity larger than what we saw in 2016 on both sides of the parties in addition to Bernie Sanders.

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

So, we've never disappointed on political guidance and I think you should just take us at our word that we, as we have more information, we will give more clarity on our guidance. But we are -- I would say you can probably always bet the over on our guidance, but we're going to do database and fact-based projections here and not -- just put a finger in the wind. So, as we get closer and have more data, you will likely see our guidance on political improve, as it has historically. And again, we tend to try and over-deliver on our promises.

As it relates to food network. That's not even on the to-do list of things to be thinking about right now. We're looking for clean divestitures and maximizing that value, regulatory approval, integration and that's -- we're happy to get it checked that we don't have to do a lot of work for as part of our EBITDA, but there's really nothing in the wind regarding food network not even on our radar screen to talk about. Now I'll let Tom answer the debt question.

Tom Carter -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Sure. On the debt, we feel a lot better about the debt capital markets now than we did at year-end. We're not quite back to the levels we were in late November or early December when we did our -- when we got our indications at that time from our financing sources. But clearly, the market continues to grind back to more acceptable levels. And we're not going to give interim updates on the synergy number on Tribune until we have more absolute known, we're doing ongoing diligence on the operating synergies, the financing synergies and the financing costs will be worked into that as well as the divestiture.

So, as soon as we have more known's, then we will give more guidance with regard to the synergies.

Operator

Thank you for the question. We have a question from Jim Goss with Barrington Research. Please go ahead.

Jim Goss -- Barrington Research -- Analyst

Thank you. First, I was wondering the broader national scope and increased penetration in larger markets with the Tribune acquisition, makes me wonder that despite your historical aversion to entertainment programming and maybe that would continue, are there other programming initiatives you think would be a better consideration for you just because they would give you greater chance to monetize your base of operations?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Tim Busch and I have visited so far seven markets that of the Tribune markets that we will be retaining. And I think we've identified opportunities to increase local programming in every one of those markets along the way, and we'll be in Des Moine and Oklahoma City later this week and the roadshow will continue through the first week of April.

So I would say, we still have an aversion to national entertainment programming creating that, but I do think that we can potentially monetize our local programming as a day part or potentially an upfront or an unwired network of our own doing. We participate in unwired networks with our rep firms and other parties event specific that perhaps we can do that under our own power given the national reach we have.

This will be a company with national scale, but focused on local markets and I think that's the thing to remember. And that's what we're good at and that's what we'll continue to strive to get better at.

Thank you. The next question will come from Barton Crockett of BCS Stocks. Please go ahead.

Barton Crockett -- BCS Stocks -- Analyst

Okay, great, thanks for taking the question. I haven't heard much from you guys about ATSC 3.0 on this call. I was just wondering if you could update what you see the landscape looking like for ATSC 3.0 in 2019, in terms of rollout, in terms of potential building a base for monetization are -- is there still reason to be excited about that or does it look like it is taking a little bit longer than maybe it had been hoped at one time?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Well, I think we've been encouraging folks to kind of cap the brakes on monetization because we've got to go through a repack and then a conversion to ATSC 3.0, most folks are doing that or spending money to get ATSC 3.0 ready, when they do the repack and spend incremental money and I think we have earmarked probably $20 million of our CapEx this year and next for ATSC 3.0 improvements beyond what the FCC would reimburse. And so that's how that this will begin, the first market to participate in a full market conversion is Phoenix. We will be the first ATSC 3.0 lighthouse station, others will provide the 1.0 lighthouse. We're still waiting on some approvals from the FCC to license MODs (ph) to allow us to do that.

So, there's a lot of organization, but our goal is that we have between the Pearl consortium and the Spectrum consortium. And again, we're the only Company in -- with a foot in both of those camps have 20 markets converted by the end of this year. That may be ambitious, but as you know, it's a voluntary transition, you have to get all the parties to agree. And then you've got to negotiate reciprocal tower leases. I mean there's a lot that goes into this and Brett Jenkins our Chief Technical Officer, is probably spending 30% to 40% of his time on ATSC and repack related issues here, but you have a coalition of the willing, it's just the repack itself will take three years plus from where we sit here and then we'll begin the path to monetization once markets do the voluntary conversion to 3.0 transmission technology.

So, all of which is to say, we think it's like having mineral rights and there is value here to be unlocked by the right technology and while it took 20 years to monetize shale oil and gas by improved technology, it's not going take 20 years, but it's going to take 5 to 10 before, this is a real meaningful contributor.

But again, I think it is the next huge value lever for local television because we're the ones that control and can monetize our spectrum. And I think the potential is as big as retrans probably, which is a $10 billion, almost $11 billion industry at the local station level in 2018. So, we think it has that potential, but you just going to have some patience, it's going to take time.

Operator

Thank you. The next question will come from Ryan Vaughan with Needham. Please go ahead.

Ryan Vaughan -- Needham -- Analyst

Hi, Tom And Perry. Thanks for taking my question. Just Tom you mentioned the -- I'm sorry, Perry mentioned that the $10 billion or $11 billion I actually have a retrans question for you. So, you've talked about double-digit growth for years to come. I'm just curious how do you think about that, whether it's coming from virtual MVPD subs growth or is it the distribution option for the pricing expands or is it coming from some of the lower viewership channels that are getting bumped of at certain packages, fully recognizing in the bigger picture that broadcast is under earning relative to what cable is getting today, is a big picture question there?

Perry A. Sook -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Yes, if you look at 2019, the estimate is that total distribution payments are $50 billion and we're getting, let's call it $10 billion or $11 billion. So we're somewhere between 20%, 22% of the pie. And that's for all television stations in aggregate. And all television stations in aggregate typical MVPD home, generate 35% of the cumulative viewing.

So I would say that's your bid and as to begin with, we won't even get into a quality of content -- premium content and what people really want, which is the local television stations. But, we're right now at about a 1.6 million in OTT sub counts. And that number is probably a little less than the actual, because there is a payment lag on that from the networks who are paying us to be part of their offering and so, that is a growth driver.

Again, we've seen our sub count declines really level off. I think people kind of get the bundle and the value of the bundle and they don't want to have four remotes on the coffee table again, and so broadband plus video and navigation is pretty powerful. And so -- but I think the primary driver is going to be from getting our fair share of the distribution bundle. And I think that will occur over the next couple of cycles, which would be three to six years basically.

Operator

Thank you. The final question will come from Dennis Leibowitz with Act II Partners. Please go ahead.

Dennis Leibowitz -- Act II Partners -- Analyst

Yes. What is the same factors that are causing you to raise your free cash flow estimates, moving from '18-'19 to '19-'20 for the core apply to the Tribune stations as well meaning that the total instead of 1950 or even 2050 would be higher than that?

Tom Carter -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

We're not prepared to comment on Tribune '19-'20 free cash flow guidance yet. There's a lot of moving parts that goes into that. I think we want to do it once and we want to do it with full information from synergies, from diligence, from financing, from divestitures, et cetera. But -- we're just speaking for the Nexstar at this point.

I would now like to turn the call over to Aly Bonilla, ORBCOMM's Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Aly.

Aly Bonilla -- Vice President of Investor Relations

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'm here with Marc Eisenberg, ORBCOMM's Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Ford, ORBCOMM's Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind you that today's conference call includes forward-looking statements and that actual results may differ from the expectations reflected in these statements.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Aly, and good afternoon. Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year end -- ending December, 2018. We're going to focus this quarter's call on a number of significant initiatives, I'd like to cover in detail and Mike will then provide an in-depth look at the financials and our 2019 outlook. We'll finish the call by taking some questions. So let's get started.

Looking at the fourth quarter, the first thing that stands out is that hardware sales were light. Hardware sales were down $9 million year-over-year, but if you back out the large deployments with JB Hunt and the U.S. Postal Service hardware sales in the quarter were up almost $2 million. That being said comparative declines have not been our trend and it's not the entire story.

We entered 2018 with a number of initiatives that we believe were absolutely necessary for the long term. While our Company was growing, we were not getting the anticipated leverage in the business. With a desire to improve adjusted EBITDA and optimize our working capital, we embarked on the following initiatives. First, we refreshed nearly all our products with a new feature-rich technology while significantly reducing costs. This gives our customers a better products, while also achieving a jump in product margins.

Second, we set out to change how we manage our working capital. Inventory was hampered by growing lead times, coupled with a wide assortment of products with multiple variations. This led it to escalating inventory levels and dramatically slowed our cash generation. In short, we reduced the number of SKUs. Third, we set out to take our newly acquired Blue Tree in-cab solution to some of our largest customers that needed significant integration with their third-party systems. Had we focused on smaller opportunities, we likely would have had experience faster short-term growth, but that's not a representation of our customer base. Throughout 2018, we further developed our fleet manager in-cab solution to meet the needs of these larger customers.

With these issues in mind, over the course of 2018 we replaced nearly every product in our portfolio with a more-featured less-expensive version. As a result, we've grown our product margins from 13% in Q4, 2017 to almost 28% in Q4, 2018. We've reduced inventory levels by about 30% from our highs of $48 million to $34 million and have cut our SKUs by more than half. With these initiatives, having a -- a negative short-term effect on the hardware revenues, they're having a significant positive effect on adjusted EBITDA, where we improved Q4 year-over-year by almost 80% despite lower hardware revenues.

Story continues

Let's take a minute to talk about the impact of our product transition on revenues. Over the last couple of quarters with inventory levels of discontinued SKUs running low, we were helping customers work through their valuation and integration process on our new products, while increasing production. Breaking that down on a per product basis, our satellite products are almost completely transitioned. Our reefer product is about 50% transitioned. Our trailer product, the GT1200 line is about 25% transitioned, and our new container product is only just starting to be shipped. With the new products commercially ready and many evaluations completed, we're starting to see the customer reaction we were hoping for.

In our container and ports group, we received an initial order from one of our OEMs for 10,000 units, anticipated to begin shipping in August and we expect to supply their customers total fleet of approximately 200,000 units. We've also completed evaluation programs with five other major shipping companies with additional opportunities totaling between 150,000 and 200,000 units. So combined with all six customers, they represent approximately $70 million in hardware revenue alone. This would be a substantial increase compared to 2018, where the port -- the container and ports group did about $2 million in hardware sales.

In our in-cab group, we've signed letters of intent to our negotiating final contracts to deploy on 10,000 trucks expected this year, which is double what we did last year. Keep in mind, it's only February. Needless to say, we expect revenues to ramp in the back half of 2019. With the 2018 initiatives in place, we successfully improved adjusted EBITDA margins from a low of 12% last year to about 25% in Q4 2018, achieving $57 million for the full-year 2018, a record high for the Company and a 27% increase over the prior year.

Adjusted EBITDA margins achieved in 2018 were also insisted by improvements in service gross margins, increasing from 58% in Q4, 2017 to 68% in Q4, 2018. This was primarily driven by steering away from negative margins realized from managing third-party installation services as well as increased efficiencies in the business. As a result of these efforts, the Company's free cash flow pivoted from using about $24 million of cash in the first half of 2018 to generating about $14 million of cash in the second half. This is the result we expected to achieve and gives us confidence that we're now in a position to be a significant cash generator in 2019 and beyond.

Let's move on to our business highlights. We were selected by Lidl UK, one of the largest supermarket chains in Europe, will be using our cold chain solution to ensure transparency on their refrigerated trucks and trailers. By providing insight alerts and systems integration, we are helping Little gain real-time visibility and control of their assets, while ensuring regulatory compliance and improving customer service.

In addition, Swift, one of the largest transport companies in the United States and a longtime customer of our reefer solution has started to deploy our newly designed cargo product for their intermodal assets. Swift is a great example of a longtime customer that started with one asset class and is now taking advantage of our Double Player Triple Play (ph) bundles, where multiple asset classes utilizing our single integrated platform. These opportunities may use a combination of our in-cab, refrigerated, dry van or intermodal solutions, which is a unique competitive advantage . We've also been selected by SeaCube, a large container leasing company has begun offering our ReeferConnect solution to provide end-to-end visibility and remote control of their refrigerated containers in gensets. SeaCube can bundle ORBCOMM's telematics offerings with a sea container into one lease for one monthly price.

Our partner AT&T fully deployed an additional 70,000 containers from Maersk, after they completed the acquisition of Hamburg Sud in late 2017. All 70,000 devices were activated throughout 2018. The Hamburg Sud deployment demonstrates another key win in the reefer container market. Our resellers in Latin America are gaining market share and have committed to a minimum of approximately 30,000 units in 2019. We've also began significant deployments of our IDP products with a large telecom operator in the Middle East and we can expect them to offer our solution portfolio throughout their sales channels in the region.

We're excited to announce the first significant opportunity deployed by our analytics group with Rehrig Pacific Company, a leader in supply chain solutions to provide our services to power their business intelligence platform. The platform is designed to help Rehrig customers maximize their ROI and assets across their waste management sites, environmental and retail markets. With the addition of ORBCOMM's Analytics, Rehrig enabled its customers to query massive amounts of real-time data in seconds, providing actionable information and visibility into their supply chain, including missed customer container pickups, inefficient routes, driver behavior, inventory management and damaged assets.

Turning to operations, over the last few years, we invested tens of millions of dollars to create and redesign 20 cost optimized feature-rich products that enhance our existing capabilities. We tend to compete more effectively and to improve our product margins. I'd like to go into some detail on a few of these. So you can see the incremental benefits they offer to our customers. For our cargo business, which includes trailers, containers and railcars, we developed a new GT1200 line which replaces the GT1100. This device helps customers locate assets, improve turn times for increased asset utilization, maximize fleet size and improve the speed of cargo delivery to customers. With multiple sensor options, the GT1200 helps containers turn from dark, dumb and disconnected to visible, smart and connected.

Our integrated cargo sensor tells customers if they're asset is full or empty and ready for pickup. Our door sensor reports whether the assets doors are open or close to help manage theft. And geofences alert customers when the asset reaches designated areas to start the loading or unloading process or if the assets deviate from their schedule route. The integrated cargo sensor and the other wireless sensors eliminate the need for up to 40 feet of cable that can take up to an hour to install. With its new streamline design and external installation, the GT1200 could be installed on an asset in just minutes even when the trailer or container is full, making customer deployments quick and efficient with minimal disruption to their operations.

The GT1200 charges 20 times faster than its predecessor even without direct sunlight resulting in three times more messages per day for enhanced visibility and utilization. In addition by offering just a few versions of the GT1200, we were able to reduce the number of SKUs by 80% resulting in faster customer fulfillment, while substantially lowering inventory levels and achieving significant cost savings.

Our new PT 6000 is an industry-leading trailers solution for cold chain temperature control and monitoring compliance, which replaces the RT 6000. Historically a fleet with 3,000 trucks with 3,000 drivers to manage the refrigeration assets, while focusing on their primary objective driving the truck. Connecting the PT 6000 directly to the trucks refrigeration unit takes control out of the hands of the 3000 drivers and puts it in the hands of just a few dispatchers. The dispatcher can adjust unit temperature settings remotely, while the trailers on the move, monitor fuel levels, observe critical diagnostics and respond to maintenance alerts by ordering parts and scheduling repairs before the truck even gets back to the yard. Not only does this add efficiency and save temperature sensitive loads, but in today's market with increasing driver shortages, it maximizes the amounts of driving time.

The PT 6000 includes multiple new temperature probes and humidity sensor, which protects the quality integrity of the cargo, ensures compliance and mitigate cycling losses. The PT 6000 is also the first reefer products sold to the Carrier Transicold dealer network, allowing Carrier customers to remotely update the firmware in the reefer, including new temperature applications. Our next generation IDP products continue to resonate well with customers looking for satellite connectivity for new or existing telematics solutions that are deployed in remote parts of each geographies.

You can take a successful telematics application and add satellite connectivity with a single cable for easy installation. Our new IDP products are ideal for markets such as tuna fisheries, secure cargo transport and oil and gas applications that require satellite coverage. These products utilize our dual mode RFIC custom chip, which was designed to reduce the component counts of our first IDP products from 600 to 1, providing significant cost reductions and higher reliability while making satellite connectivity affordable.

Wrapping up, I'm pleased with the accomplishments of 2018, while we still have a lot of work to do in the year ahead. Our Company's foundation is stronger than it's ever been and we're executing at a higher level. With our margin improvement and cash generation plans on track in an unprecedented number of opportunities in our pipeline, 2019 is shaping up to be a promising year as we expect to make substantial strides in all three key metrics of the business, revenue, margin and profitability.

With that I will turn the call over to Mike to take you through the financials.

Michael W. Ford -- Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon everyone. Let me start with our Q4 results. Total revenue was $66 million compared to $76 million in the same period last year. Keep in mind, last year included over $13 million of revenue from the JB Hunt and U.S. Postal Service deployments. Excluding the revenues of these two customers in both years, total revenue from our base business was up nearly 3% versus Q4 2017. Even with some revenue shifting to the right, we successfully increased adjusted EBITDA to $16.5 million, an improvement of $7 million over the prior year.

There were a number of non-recurring accounting entries in the quarter mostly associated with inthinc and Blue Tree acquisitions, which resulted in a net benefit of $1.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin continued to improve, reaching 24.9% in Q4 '18. This is 40 basis points higher than Q3 '18 and more than doubled compared to Q4 '17. Our adjusted EBITDA performance was primarily driven by higher service and product margins. Q4 service gross margin increased to 67.7% up 90 basis points from Q3 '18 and up over 1,000 basis points from Q4 '17. Product gross margin in Q4, improved to 27.5% compared to 12.7% in Q3 '18 -- Q3 '18, 24.2%. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of increasing product margins.

In Q4, we saw a significant number of our older models SKUs, which carried lower margins and had a negative impact on the impressive 27.5% we reported. We sold off about $9 million of this older inventory in the quarter. Excluding these sales, our Q4 '18 product margins would have been significantly higher. We believe there is further upside to product margins, as we shipped out greater quantities of our cost reduced products to customers in 2019. We ended the year with almost $54 million of cash on our balance sheet strengthening our liquidity position. This was an improvement of nearly $8 million from Q3 '18. Even after making a $10 million interest payment on our debt in October, we generated operating cash flow of $12.4 million in Q4, an increase of $10.2 million compared to the prior year, primarily driven by favorable operating results and reductions in inventory.

With CapEx of $5 million in the quarter, the Company generated free cash flow of $7 million in Q4, our second consecutive quarter with positive free cash flow. With improvements in cash generation, coupled with higher adjusted EBITDA, our Company's trailing 12-month net debt leverage ratio now stands at 3.4 times, down from 3.9 times in Q3 and from our high of 4.9 times in Q1 '18.

Turning to our full year results. 2018 total revenue was $276 million, an increase of about $22 million or 8.6% compared to 2017. This increase is driven by our growing service revenues, which ended the year at $154 million, up nearly $19 million or 13.8% over the prior year. More importantly, full-year recurring service revenue grew 17% over the prior year, driven by nearly 350,000 net new subscribers, bringing our total subscriber count to approximately 2.37 million at year-end.

Contributing to the improvement was steady growth from our AIS business achieving a record high of $11 million in 2018, 17% increase over the prior year. Higher service and product margins drove gross profit margin for the year to almost 47%, a 600 basis point improvement over 2017. Compared to the full-year 2017 product margins climbed 730 basis points and service margin grew 290 basis points. Full year 2018 adjusted EBITDA increased 27% over the prior year to a record $57 million, with adjusted EBITDA margins reaching almost 21%. This is an improvement of $12 million or 300 basis points over 2017. Better operating results, along with improvements in working capital and cash management practices led to operating cash flow of $11 million in 2018 versus $5 million use of cash in 2017. This is $16 million year-over-year improvement. Let me summarize the six key financial highlights of our 2018 performance year-on-year. Revenue was up 8.6%. Service margin was up 290 basis points. Product margin was up 730 basis points, adjusted EBITDA margin was up 310 basis points, operating cash flow was up $16 million, subscriber count increased by nearly 350,000 units.

Moving to our 2019 outlook, they will -- we will provide full-year guidance on recurring service revenue, service margins, product margins, adjusted EBITDA, operating cash flow and capital expenditures. For the full year 2019, we expect recurring service revenues to grow 5% to 7.5% compared to 2018 with service margins anticipated to be between 66% and 68%. We expect product margins to continue increasing throughout 2019 and average over 30% for the full year. We anticipate adjusted EBITDA to be between $70 million and $75 million in 2019, weighted more heavily toward the second half of the year. We expect operating cash flow in 2019 to be approximately $50 million. Capital expenditures are anticipated to run at approximately $25 million this year.

As Mark pointed out earlier, our sales pipeline includes several customer opportunities with large-scale deployments, leading us to provide quarterly guidance on product sales and net subscriber counts, due to the uncertain timing of these deployments. Looking at Q1, we expect product sales to be similar to Q4 '18 as we work through our short-term hardware issues over the course of the quarter. We expect to bring onboard about 70,000 net new subscribers. In summary, we look forward to delivering sales growth, margin expansion, improved profitability and greater cash flow this year.

This concludes our remarks for the call and we'll now take your questions.

Questions and Answers:

Operator

Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And the first question will be from Mike Walkley of Canaccord. Please go ahead.

Mike Walkley -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst

Great, thank you. Marc, just trying to get a little more color on the 5% to 7% recurring revenue guidance. Is there any puts and takes, maybe a drop in the mix for ARPU or some greater churn this year that's pointing to year slower recurring revenue growth versus last year? Thank you.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

I think what we experienced toward the end of 2018 is -- you heard me say that AT&T put on those units. And you remember the ARPUs on those units are just a fraction of what some of the other ones are. So when you're churning the units in normal numbers and you're adding on -- based on that -- based on the ARPU of those units, it had a kind of a slowing effect in Q3 and Q4. I think, we're being conservative in the first half of next year, because we're seeing hundreds of thousands of units that we're going to have to start turning on, especially in that container group and transportation group in the second half. And when that stuff comes on or when you're little back heavy in the year, you don't get the full year effect of the service revenues that are coming on, like you do, if we were installing them early in the year. So I think, when you do the math, that's just the way the timing comes out.

Mike Walkley -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst

Okay, thanks. And just on the short term, just with the adjusted EBITDA guidance and it sounds like there is a little bit of some positive effects that helped in Q4. Should we expect higher OpEx levels from what you posted for Q4 to start the year and a little bit dip in adjusted EBITDA, then kind of build from that level throughout the year that kind of how we should think about it?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

We've been pretty strict with our field organization about OpEx growth. We don't expect to see much growth at all of the course of the coming year. We stabilized the workforce. We don't anticipate adding much of them -- with winning (ph) more employees. We'll be concentrating heavily on cost control as we move forward. We're at the point now where scaling our business is possible and will be a high priority for us.

Michael W. Ford -- Chief Financial Officer

But I think you, Mike, you were referring to the seasonality in the first quarter where there is like another $0.5 million or $1 million, because the spike the -- some of the public company cost to come in earlier in the year. So, yeah, there's probably just like it was last year, it spikes up like $0.5 million or $1 million in costs.

Mike Walkley -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst

Okay, great. Last question from me and I'll pass it on. And just as you look at the pipeline, Marc. Just a little color on kind of the mix of the ARPU and particularly on maybe the Blue Tree. I know that's been getting some good traction, how you see the front of the cab business developing throughout the year? Thank you.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, so I kind of see the Blue Tree stuff or in-cab in general, if you look at Blue Tree and then think, they tend to average around 30-ish, give or take a couple of dollars in the other -- in either direction. And then, the container stuff is kind of in the low single digits, but you're talking about hundreds of thousands of units we expect to be fielding. So, I think the timing can push ARPUs around in multiple directions, but I think if the number is 10 to one, then you end up just where you started between those two.

Mike Walkley -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst

Thank you.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Sure.

The next question will be from Ric Prentiss of Raymond James. Please go ahead.

Ric Prentiss -- Raymond James & Co. -- Analyst

Thanks, good afternoon.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Hey.

Ric Prentiss -- Raymond James & Co. -- Analyst

Hey. One follow-up on a couple of Mike's questions. If we can go back to the non-recurring items in 4Q that had to do I think you said with inthinc and Blue Tree. What line items did those effect with that $1.5 million, was it revenues? Was it margins? Just kind of where should we think that $1.5 million was in 4Q '18?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

They'll will be in our SG&A line.

Ric Prentiss -- Raymond James & Co. -- Analyst

Okay. And then if we think about the guidance going forward for 2019, I think you've mentioned recurring service, sorry, service gross margins of 66% to 68%. But I think you guys have been putting up kind of closer to 67% already. What would cause service gross margins to go back down into the 66% range versus being able to get up to the 68% range?

Michael W. Ford -- Chief Financial Officer

Not a whole lot. You've got to 66% to 68%. So you're going to model 67%, but I don't know, I mean, to come up with a range of an exact number, I don't know something can happen. You get an increase from one of your terrestrial providers, where we're doing an awful lot of work with Inmarsat. We do have some vendors there. I think that our products, our costs are going to hold steady. In some cases they even fall. So I would probably bet closer to the higher end of that the lower.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

I would. Fair. I think that's a good assumption.

Ric Prentiss -- Raymond James & Co. -- Analyst

Yeah, I just wanted to make sure that it wasn't something unseen or that we didn't know about out there.

Michael W. Ford -- Chief Financial Officer

No. There is nothing in our head. that made us change that number. I think we like that 67%. So we drew ourselves as a point in each direction for the unforeseen.

Ric Prentiss -- Raymond James & Co. -- Analyst

Makes sense. And final one for me Marc, obviously the timing is important as you pointed out to Mike earlier. But if we thought about maybe recurrings service revenue growth like second half '19 over second half '18, how should we think about that, because there is the optics, so the guidance is 5% to 7.5% on an annual basis, but you thought apples-to-apples, like whether it's 1Q '19 over 1Q '18 or 4Q '19 over 4Q '18. Can you help us understand on which order of magnitude kind of what would be a more normal rather than calendar year to look at that kind of growth rate?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

I think, in -- I'm trying to remember what Q1 was last year. So if you took Q4 and just flat, put it over last year, what would the growth be? Let's -- I'm -- these guys feeding me the numbers. Maybe Mike you could answer here?

Michael W. Ford -- Chief Financial Officer

So, yeah, so I think if you expect the first half of the year to be up low-single digits growth year-over-year, the second half of the year will be closer to 10%.

Ric Prentiss -- Raymond James & Co. -- Analyst

Okay. I think that helps Mike's question a little bit more to just understand that the optic looks kind of odd, so that helps, I appreciate.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

I agree, I mean if you take a look at Q4 and you run the Q4 against our own Q1, that's the 5%. So that's the low end. And then any growth on top of that gets you to the higher number.

Michael W. Ford -- Chief Financial Officer

And you we put on -- as we sell more products in the second half of the year, that's when the subscriber show up. So that's when you'll start to see an uptick in our service revenue.

Ric Prentiss -- Raymond James & Co. -- Analyst

And then that leads to probably more sustained growth even on calendar '20 then?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. We haven't seen -- we haven't seen any change -- real change in our churn rates. So I don't -- I think, that you can -- I think you can rely on the subscriber growth following closely the product revenue sales growth. And I think, Rick, the hardware thing that we're dealing with now, I think it's kind of a blip on the radar. I think as we -- if you look at just this container deal that we're talking about, you're going to start shipping about 2,000 a week in August, and if we could stay at that rate, which I don't think we can, it would have to escalate. But you'd be shipping that 8,000 to 10,000 a month for the next 3.5 years. And so I think, there is -- when you're in these big game hunters like we are, you get these peaks and valleys.

Ric Prentiss -- Raymond James & Co. -- Analyst

Yeah, and that gives us some comfort too on the visibility than on the product sales of having that big contracts?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

I would love to see these guys with $70 million worth of backlog versus $2 million of hardware sales in 2017.

Ric Prentiss -- Raymond James & Co. -- Analyst

One other question. You see that one (ph). Have you guys thought about giving backlog numbers as far as what the backlog on sales or product sales or service revenue might be?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Maybe, but let me explain why we come up with something that says first order of 10,000 against the fleet of 200,000. Why it kind of looks like that? There is a long lead item in those components that, it is like four months or five months. So what happens is the OEM is always giving you orders to keep you running four, five months ahead. So you get -- so what you get is a 10,000 in order to get you started in August against a fleet that's much larger. But in fact you continually get these purchase orders as you continue to put up the fleet. Because putting it out a year or two in advance doesn't do them any good.

So just to be clear, that's the way JB Hunt was done. That's the way Hub Group was done. That's the way every deal gets done. So I -- to answer your question, I don't know if the backlog is 200, is the backlog the 10, I don't know.

Ric Prentiss -- Raymond James & Co. -- Analyst

Okay. We'll see you down here in Orlando next week. Take care. Thanks guys.

The next question will be from David Gearhart of First Analysis. Please go ahead. Mr. Gearhart. Your line is open, you may be muted on your side.

David Gearhart -- First Analysis -- Analyst

Sorry about that. Thank you for taking my questions. My first question for you is just a housekeeping question. Did you provide the AIS revenue for the quarter? Because I think you mentioned $11 million for the year and it would imply, I'm not (ph) having the full number that it's down quarter-over-quarter. So I just wanted to clarify what the number was for the quarter?

Michael W. Ford -- Chief Financial Officer

No, it was flat quarter-over-quarter.

David Gearhart -- First Analysis -- Analyst

Okay. Flat. And then Marc, throughout the year, you were providing forecasted number of net additions 350,000 to 400,000 for the year, you came in at 348,000 for the year, slightly below that. So just wondering if you could quantify the impact for Q4, if that's being pushed into 2019. And if you can give us an update on kind of what you're expecting for the sub number for the year, if possible?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, I think, we're expecting 70,000 for Q1, because the hardware is going to be similar to Q4 and we shipped about 75,000 units in Q4 of hardware. I think, that's the struggle with the timing on the hardware. I think, if everything kind of goes off flawlessly, which it never does, and we're shipping all these container units and bunch of trailer units and all the stuff we're looking at, it would be well over 100,000 in the back half of the year. But the timing is what's pulling back us our ability to give you full-year hardware guidance. So it's the same problem.

David Gearhart -- First Analysis -- Analyst

Okay and then lastly from me. Just one of your initiatives, I know, that you've been working on, is rationalizing your acquired platforms kind of standardizing on the Blue Tree platform and just wondering where you are with those efforts?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

So seven platforms, web platforms are going to move into one. We call it Project Synergy. And I think all along the plan is to have that available in Q2. But all new customers are already being deployed on it. So there is the conversion, but in terms of new customers are already being deployed that way. So in Q2, what's going to happen is people that have been on the old platforms are going to have visibility on both platforms. They're going to be able to run them both concurrently and while we're going to keep those old platforms alive, we're not going to do any more development on it.

David Gearhart -- First Analysis -- Analyst

Got it. That's it from me. Thanks so much.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Sure.

Operator

The next question will be from Mike Malouf of Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Please go ahead.

Eric Des Lauriers -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

Hi guys. This is Eric Des Lauriers on for Mike. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, if you could just dive a bit more deeply into ARPU? I know there is obviously a mix difference between you're Blue Tree and inthinc products and your container products. But I was wondering if you could kind of give us your take on how -- where you expect the bottom to be come down pretty steadily for the past four quarters. And just wondering if you guys see that trend continuing or if this Q4 range is about bottoming out? Thanks.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Well, I think those Blue Tree products, while the backlog keeps building and the workload for the engineers keeps building, Q4 didn't have an actual lot of shipments. We're getting more orders, we're getting more excitement, but we still have a huge amount of integration that the engineers are doing. So you didn't get any of the impact. But when I said -- when we say a quarter of 70,000 net adds, those are net adds. So the gross adds it could be north of 100,000 and then you add some new churn and over the last year you turned on 70,000 of those AT&T units at these super low ARPUs. And then your churn could be $4 ARPUs, $5 ARPU, $6 ARPUs. So those units kind of cancel each other out. The rest of your subscribers you're putting on have to eat up the difference, and it's been ticking away from -- ticking away from ARPUs. And I think that's literally what you've been seeing in the ARPU.

So the -- I think, there's maybe one or two partnership deals with AT&T, that we're still looking out of the six that I talked about on the call today. One of them is an AT&T deal and six of them are not. So as opposed to one of these deals that's kind of turned upside down, when you're ARPU shrink. But you have you know very low costs. The deals that are coming forward ORBCOMM is the lead on these deals. So the economics are kind of turns right side up like a normal ORBCOMM deal. So I think that should be helpful.

Eric Des Lauriers -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

Okay. So do you think that this sub 5 range that we've seen in the back half of the '18 should, basically touch the bottom out and then start to trickle up again or is this kind of like the new normal do you think?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

I hope so. I think, that's the case. The only reason I'm hesitating is the Blue Tree units, I think those are the ones that are -- they're going to come in the back half of the year. We're pretty certain of that. So I think, that's going to help us. And then, I think we're going to close 400,000 or 350,000 units on the container side. And if they all zoom into this year, good news is, wow, you're going have some great revenues. (Inaudible) is they are a a lower ARPU than the average and if it kind of get some split over the course of the next two years, it could be more balanced. So I think, it still depends on the mix. But I just want to emphasize that regardless of what the ARPUs are -- there is not a single sub that's a bad sub. If you look at some of these licensing subs, where the ARPUs are all the way down at $1. There's no cost on those. There is no -- in the cost of service line there's nothing there. So it's a great sub. A $30 with the $6 cost is a better sub, but it's still -- from a margin perspective, it's a good, but it's not as good as the service one. So I'm kind of routing for all of them and let the chips fall where they may.

Our ARPU has been dropping over time because of pricing concerns. It's all mix.

Eric Des Lauriers -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst

Sure. Yes. That definitely makes sense. I was just trying to get a gauge of where do you expect the mix. Thanks guys. I appreciate the color.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Thanks.

The next question will be from Mike Latimore of Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

Pavan -- Northland Capital Markets -- Analyst

Hi guys. This is Pavan (ph) on for Mike Latimore. I have two questions. What percentage of your shipments now are from newer low-cost products?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

I'm sorry, say that again. The new products?

Pavan -- Northland Capital Markets -- Analyst

What percentage of your shipments now are from newer low-cost products?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. So in my script, let me say 50%. But of that 50%, the satellite products are complete, the GT1200 which is the cargo product was -- we only shipped 3,500 of them, because that's all we built last quarter in time, so that was -- I don't know 25%. If you look at the PT 6000, which was the reefer product, it was about 50% and the cargo products for the most part that was just hundreds of units, but we're not shipping the old ones. So it was 100% of a very, very low number, but I guess if you were to just rough estimate, average all those things out, it would be about half.

So there is a long way to go. I mean, Mike said something, I went and did the math, because if I was struggling to believe it and then we're kind of parked here with our Chief Accounting Officer that was splitting out the numbers. We did $9 million of the old products at high-teen margins. And then the other 50% -- whatever we did it averaged to 27.5%.

Pavan -- Northland Capital Markets -- Analyst

Okay, thank you. So my second question is related to Chinese tariffs. Are you seeing any difficulty in sourcing components or like -- is there any impact, which we could expect on the income statement going forward?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

China kind of scares me. I think the good news in China is we've got upside there. We're in the middle of installing an earth station and we're going we're going to go into China, assuming that whatever these issues are, by the time we get installed it will work out and if not, it's not like like an incredible investment, but I don't think there's anything built into our plan or our guidance today that -- some tariff or something is going to blow up in China. We've got upside there. There's very little business there today. There's almost no downside, but our plan is to go forward.

Pavan -- Northland Capital Markets -- Analyst

Yeah. Thank you. That's all for me. Thank you.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Sure.

(Operator Instructions) Your next question will be from Chris Quilty of Quilty Analytics. Please go ahead.

Chris Quilty -- Quilty Analytics -- Analyst

Thanks. Marc, it sounds like you've done a tremendous transition on the hardware side, but I know you've always got some new tricks in your back pocket. Can you talk about what is next or what you have in development in terms of hardware and is it having already done cost reduction, are you targeting new markets or new applications, what's the emphasis on the hardware side?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Well, the emphasis on the hardware is, I don't know, it feels like each each one has a different story. And Chris, you've been -- this is 50th call. So I'm guessing this is your 50th call. So, like -- and I know you're -- you've got such great expertise in satellite, but our goal on the satellite side is -- I think the satellite business across the entire IoT is growing -- it's growing, but it is not growing like the cellular side is growing and the reason it's not growing is as you know, it's not features. I mean, gee, you've got a platform, that's going to last for an awful lot longer than 2G converting to 3G or 3G converting to LTE.

Plus, you get all the benefits of global coverage. I think everyone would want to you satellite, but that being said, the price per byte and the price for the hardware, it's always been a very difficult comp for satellite and why satellite struggled and when you can take 600 components and put it down on one chip. The idea is to make satellite affordable. Blue Tree -- Blue Tree is super cool. It's a in the in-cab side and it is a perfect customer for dual mode, but they never were able to do dual mode before, because if they sourced it from one of our competitors, then the cost of just the 15% of the time they would have used satellite would have been greater 5x what the cellular was and then you were burdening it with this great hardware and then we figure to ourselves.

As opposed to 10% of the in-cab business being satellite, what is the price point that makes it 30%? What is the price point that makes it 50%? What is the price point that makes it 100%? And how could we get there, right? That is the -- that is the purpose there. The other big one is, this container business, Maersk, went first. They are up to 350,000 to 400,000 units now with the acquisition of Hamburg Sud. Everyone's going to do something, it feels like over the next year or two years, we think we're going to win the lion's share of that business. And it's funny, I'm sitting there with these customers and it's not, gee, your competitors here and you're there and what makes you excited. That's not what we're seeing at all. What we're seeing is, this is the price that -- makes this a positive return for us. And this is the go forward or not go forward.

It's almost like that discussion that we had with JB Hunt. And we went, pulled the cost out of it, ripped it apart and the good thing here is the volumes are so damn high, right. So you have the economies of scale. So that is part of it. And then secondly, we did a -- we took a long time to take a look at the model and took a step back and -- yeah, we had a little hardware blip this quarter. It's not going to matter, but you have this hardware blip in the quarter. But what's really -- look at what's happening here, right. You had some sales that weren't profitable last year and you've like more than doubled your -- you more than doubled your margins at a small decrease in hardware, and I think it all day. All day, right. Of course, you do.

And I think in order to get running on all three cylinders, in order to get the margins back in line, to get our cash in line because, well, we had too many skews and in order to get the revenues up, we took 2018 to -- I mean this is the year of the product and these things are really cool.

Chris Quilty -- Quilty Analytics -- Analyst

Got you. And Mike, I mean, clearly you're focused on cash flow -- free cash flow generation, but at some point what becomes the primary goal here in terms of delevering to a certain level or do you start to look at tack-on acquisitions once again?

Michael W. Ford -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. I think we will -- we're going to get on too fast, right? We're going to generate as much cash as we can between now and when our debt comes due. And we can start to pay it down. But between now and then, we're going to -- we'll have -- we'll have positive operating cash flow, even positive free cash flow I believe from this point going forward. So, two years from now, when it's time to make our final decision about what to do with our debt, if we are in an economy where there are acquisition bargains, there are attractive technology we want to buy, we'll go down the acquisition path. If there are not any good bargains there, then we'll consider we can -- we will consider restructuring our debt.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

I don't think you're thinking far different than what we are, Chris. We are just looking at the math. 2020, your (inaudible) disappears and you've got a 4% penalty to refinance; 2021, it's 2% and 2022, It's -- there's no penalty. So that's just a whole lot of math, right?

Chris Quilty -- Quilty Analytics -- Analyst

Yeah.

Michael W. Ford -- Chief Financial Officer

Because of our increased EBITDA, our cash is on the balance sheet -- our leverage ratio, as I mentioned those earlier. They will be much more attractive by the time it's -- we are ready to make a decision about what to do with our debt. So we're going to have more options this time around than we did last time.

Chris Quilty -- Quilty Analytics -- Analyst

Great. And final question here. When you look at the company structure, you've had a lot of consolidation of hardware and manufacturing in the EMS providers is the structure of the company in terms of number of facilities and capabilities, where you want it, do you see a need to expand or are there areas where you can make some cuts?

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

I think in terms of where we are, there are definitely areas of excellence that have evolved in the company based on the acquisitions. Some offices have been shrunk down, other ones have been built up. But if you look at ORBCOMM as a whole, if you want to know where ORBCOMM does it's hardware, it's in Ottawa, Canada. May be supported by some other building, but there are 145 people in Canada and predominantly they do hardware engineering.

The largest office ORBCOMM has believe it or not, it is not in Dulles, Virginia, it's in Hyderabad, India. Hyderabad is about 160 employees and that is where the overwhelming majority of customer service and where most of our web design is. Our in-cab products are really designed out of go away. There is so damn talented there. We couldn't consider moving them. And then our space operations are in Dulles, Virginia. I think, we've really kind of built, even through acquisition, the people that came through the acquisition are not necessarily doing exactly what they were doing then. So I think that's worked out pretty well for us.

Are there efficiencies out there? Yes, there's always efficiencies out there and I think, we can find them. I mean, if you're thinking that you know the Company goes from 860 employees to 500 and to be able to support the growth that we're looking to achieve, not likely. But that being said, if we're wrong, and the business isn't what we think it is, then there is certainly opportunities there.

Chris Quilty -- Quilty Analytics -- Analyst

One final, if I can. You just had the announcement a couple of days ago with the Rehrig Pacific and the poorly named Analytics Services, which is sort of a generic name. But clearly that looks like something that you're selling now as a separate service software platform. Can you add a little bit there of color in terms of -- does this become a branded packaged product or is it just an add-on to existing customers in terms of capability and can that help drive some of service margins up.

Marc J. Eisenberg -- Chief Executive Officer

Yes. So -- let me start by saying, if you have a better name for it, you know my -- you've got email, you've got text, you've got my phone number, whatever you need. But I get it's a bit of a buzzword these days. But we really are doing it. I mean for Rehrig, it's pretty neat. They've got this -- garbage is a good busines, right. They monitor these garbage trucks and they're monitoring it by the second. When they miss a stop, they know precisely where it is and how to reroute and go around. I mean it's pretty incredible what they're able to do and we were put up against some of the biggest companies that you've heard of. And we were able to get the timeliness and get that data spun much quicker than they were. So I think that's pretty neat.

But for Rehrig, it looks like a sub-times ARPU deals. It does. Because it's not really a telematics deal, it's something that we're doing on top of what they already have. So, there is no telecommunications, but it's just software times ARPU. And I think, when there is something unique, that's kind of the model, it could be a flat fee or something. But I think that is a portion of the business. The real part of -- not the real, but the other part of the business is taking some of our best practices and some of the data that we have across entire fleets and helping companies with best practices, helping customers with gee. I mean, there is everything you want to know about reefers.

There's is only one company that knows at all and that's ORBCOMM or that business or how long the average time that you are sitting there waiting to unload or be picked up or whether you're using the amount of time you use continuous cool versus start-stop, and driver efficiency over time. I mean there's so much stuff that we already know that we are almost -- those are the next generation stuff that we're building. And I think, we're perfectly happy to continue offering to a refrigerated customer, let's say, the product that they have today, but maybe for another $2 or $3 of ARPU. They can kind of get the LinkedIn plus as an example.

Chris Quilty -- Quilty Analytics -- Analyst

Great. Thank you for the color and good luck with that.

Cheniere Energy Inc (NYSEMKT: LNG)

Q4 2018 Earnings Conference Call

, 10:00 a.m. ET

Operator

Good morning and welcome to the Cheniere Energy Incorporated Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call and Webcast. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Randy Bhatia, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

Randy Bhatia -- VP of Investor Relations

Thanks, operator. Good morning and welcome to Cheniere Energy's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. The slide presentation and access to the webcast for today's call are available at cheniere.com. Joining me for today's call are Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO, Anatol Feygin, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer and Michael Wortley, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all listeners that our remarks, including answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements.

And actual results could differ materially from what is described in these statements. Slide 2 of our presentation contains a discussion of those forward-looking statements and associated risks. In addition, we may include references to non-GAAP financial measures such as consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measure can be found in the appendix of the slide presentation. As part of our discussion of Cheniere Energy Inc's results, today's call may also include selected financial information and results for Cheniere Energy Partners LP or CQP. We do not intend to cover CQP's results separately from those of Cheniere Energy Inc.

The call agenda is shown on slide 3. Jack will begin with an overview of our 2018 operating and financial highlights and perspective on 2019 and beyond. Following Jack's comments Anatol will provide an update on the LNG market and Michael will review our financial results. After prepared remarks we will open the call for Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to Jack Fusco, Cheniere's President and CEO.

Jack Fusco -- President and CEO

Thank you, Randy and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to be here this morning to review our significant accomplishments from a very successful 2018. To share my optimism for the continued success as we look forward to 2019 and beyond. 2018 was a truly remarkable year for Cheniere. On last year's call I described 2017 as our breakthrough year which is certainly was. In 2018, we maintained our momentum achieving excellence in reaching new heights in virtually all phases of our business.

From commercial success achieved by signing over 7 million tons per year, a new long-term SPAs. To the FID of Corpus Christi Train 3 in May and the start up of Corpus Christi Train 1 few months later. To continued financial discipline and simplification of our corporate structure. We've achieved those and much more and in doing so have cemented our reputation as a reliable full service LNG operator which delivers on its promises to its customers, employees and stakeholders.

In 2018, we executed on our strategic growth plans, operational plans and financial plans and the results of our execution are apparent in the financial results we reported earlier this morning. Slide 5 presents some key highlights of the fourth quarter 2018. There are a couple of achievements I'd like to highlight from this slide. We generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of over $630 million and the the distributable cash flow of approximately $130 million. And produced and exported a record 80 cargoes on the quarter almost a cargo a day. In addition, we reached the commissioning milestone of our first cargo at both Train 5 at Sabine Pass and Train 1 at Corpus Christi.

As of year-end we had exported four commissioning cargoes from Train 5 at Sabine Pass and two from Train 1 at Corpus Christi. Our substantial commercial momentum continued in the fourth quarter, as we signed long-term SPAs with both Polish oil and Gas Company and Petronas for over 2.5 million tons per year in aggregate. We look forward to successful long-term relationships with our newest SPA customers and expect these SPAs to support our growth plans.

Story continues

The market for LNG contracting remains active and we continue to pursue additional long-term commercial arrangements with new and existing counterparts worldwide. Turning now to slide 6, a look of some of 2018s most notable highlights. Financial results for the first year 2018 came in at the top end of our guidance ranges for both consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow. As we generated more than $2.6 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and approximately $600 million in distributable cash flow for the full year.

Michael will cover these results in more detail. But our financial performance in 2018 improved throughout the year. And we are pleased to deliver full-year financial results at or above our upwardly revised guidance range. In 2018, we executed two important market transactions that I'll highlight briefly. First, we closed the merger with CQH in which we opportunistically and economically, simplified our corporate structure. Our corporate structure remains complex and we would prefer to be simpler, however, we will remain opportunistic and only pursue further simplification transaction to the extent they are economic LNG shareholders.

In addition to the CQH transaction in 2018, we also refinanced the remaining term loans at CQP into the bond market. Economically addressing the nearest term maturity in our complex and further demonstrating our commitment in managing our balance sheet throughout the corporate structure. Operationally in 2018, we produced and exported a total of 273 cargoes which required over 1 quadrillion BTUs of gas to our terminals. Our teams in gas supply and operations made the significant operational and logistical achievement look easy and their dedication and commitment to excellence are significant contributors to our reputation as a reliable operator.

Strategically 2018 was an incredible success, as we made a positive final investment decision on Train 3 at Corpus Christi and originated over 7 million tons per year of new long-term SPAs, giving us sufficient visibility on Train 6 at Sabine Pass that enables us to finalize the EPC contract. An issue limited notices to proceed on that project late last year. Having that project under way, the limited notice to proceed is strategically important for us. As we have cost and date certainty on Train 6 ahead of a formal FID which is where efforts are concentrated today.

The FID of Train 6 is one of my key priorities for 2019 which I'll address on slide 7. On this slide I have included a few key priorities which highlight that our focus remains centered on growth, execution and being disciplined toward the capital. We are focused on completing the remaining steps necessary to achieve FID of Train 6 which we expect to occur over the coming months. As we have previously communicated we expect to finance Train 6 with approximately 50% debt and 50% equity, which is consistent with our strategy of deleveraging through growth.

Ahead of that FID, Bechtel is hard at work on Train 6 and making excellent progress at its scope of work. Bechtel now estimates that Train 6 is approximately 14% complete, highlighted by over that 3300 piles already driven as part of the site preparation. Beyond Train 6, we are focused on progressing Stage 3 at Corpus Christi through the permitting process which we are permitting for approximately 9.5 million tons of additional LNG capacity. This project is moving through the process very well. We expect to have all the required regulatory approvals in place by the end of 2019.

We expect to bring three trains into commercial operations during 2019. Train 5 at Sabine Pass and the first two trains at Corpus Christi. As we have done with all the trains to date, we expect these three to be brought online safely, ahead of schedule within budget. Completing commissioning and start-up as well as commencing long-term contracts associated with new trains, is a significant undertaking and requires a tremendous amount of work and coordination among Cheniere, our EPC partner Bechtel in our foundation customers.

These efforts are especially critical for 2019, as we will be starting up three trains and commencing long term SPAs for Train 5 at Sabine Pass, Train 1 at Corpus Christi and I am focused on maintaining our track record for seamless transitions from construction to operations. The performance test for Train 1 at Corpus Christi has been successfully completed and we expect substantial completion to occur in the next few days.

Last priority, I'd like to highlight is our plan to communicate the capital allocation policy. This is a high priority for the executive team who are working closely with our advisors and our Board of Directors to ensure we develop a durable flexible policy that enables us to allocate capital. The most effective impactful way for our shareholders. We look forward to communicating it to the investment community in the coming months. As I said earlier, 2018 was a remarkable year for Cheniere. And we are proud of the accomplishments we achieved throughout the year, we have many more successes we're pursuing both in 2019 and beyond. And my confidence in our ability to continue delivering on our promises underscored our people and the relentless focus on execution that continues to define Cheniere. And now, I'll turn it over to Anatol, who will provide an update on the market.

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Thanks, Jack, and good morning everyone. Please turn to slide 9, 2018 was a banner year for LNG in many regards. Globally 9 Trains started service increasing global supply by roughly 30 million tonnes. The largest year-on-year increase since 2009 when Qatar began to bring its mega trains online. New and expansion trains in Australia, Russia and the U.S. push total global supplies over the 320 million tonne mark, according to preliminary data. In the U.S., exports from our facilities totaled nearly 19 million tons during the year, a 33% increase over 2017. The Sabine Pass Train 4 started commercial deliveries in March and Train 5, which is currently undergoing commissioning exported its first cargo in November. Also in November, we saw start-up of the first greenfield LNG terminal in the lower 48 U.S. as Train 1 at our Corpus Christi facility started producing LNG and exported two commissioning cargoes before the end of the year.

We expect LNG production from our facilities and others in the U.S. to continue ramping up in the coming months and contribute to further enhancing the reliability, flexibility and liquidity of the global LNG market. Strong global LNG supply growth was met with robust demand in 2018, that led to some late year market rebalancing. Demand growth in Asia absorbed virtually all of the incremental supply, the step up in global production, especially in the fourth quarter when the global complex added more than 10.5 million tonnes year-on-year. Ensured adequate supply availability for Asia and the rest of the world as mild winter temperatures kept price spikes in check and supported an uptick in imports into Europe which added over 4 million tonnes year-on-year in 2018.

The graph on the top right displays the fourth quarter of 2018 demand compared to that what we saw in fourth quarter of 2017. As you can see China along with the rest of Asia had strong year-on-year increases in imports. For the month of November, China overtook Japan as the world's top importer although the position went back to Japan in December. Total European demand increased nearly 7 million tonnes in the quarter, which as I mentioned was partially supported by mild weather in Asia, new LNG supply coming online and high shipping rates that incentivized Atlantic source cargoes to target Europe.

I'll come back to weather in Europe in just a minute. Global gas price benchmarks in the fourth quarter saw higher levels and increased volatility compared to the same period in 2016 and 2017. However, even with a brief spike in Henry Hub prices in December. The U.S. benchmark continue to trade at a heavy discount compared to other global gas price indices. Despite a mild winter and a reduction in the storage deficit seen earlier in the year. TTF prices traded more than a $1.50 higher than levels seen during the same time a year ago.

Similarly, fourth quarter Asian spot prices settled at more than $3 higher on average year-on-year though the premium decreased over the course of the quarter. Please now turn to slide 10. More than 20 countries, almost half of all LNG importing countries had record annual LNG import levels in 2018 including China, South Korea, India and Pakistan. In addition to record import levels China and Pakistan also set records for LNG demand growth rates in 2018.

The graph to the far left highlights how remarkable China's demand has been over the past two years. China alone absorb more than 50% of the worldwide incremental supplies in 2018 adding 16 million tonnes above the 2017 level. China remains an important demand center for our product and the country's need for natural gas and LNG is expected to continue to rise as the country balances its economic growth needs and environmental commitments.

South Korea's steady demand over the last two years has also been impressive. Demand growth was largely due to low nuclear utilization as well as lower coal-fired power generation resulting from policies intended to improve air quality. Looking ahead to 2019 for South Korea, LNG consumption taxes are set to decrease while coal taxes are set to increase which of course is expected to be supportive of LNG demand. Pakistan which began importing LNG in 2015 has shown consistent in growing demand and regasification build-out in the early 2020s could make Pakistan a significantly larger importer than it is today.

The middle graph shows the total accumulation of population weighted heating degree days for the heating season in Asia. Populous areas of East Asia have seen mostly minor cold spells this winter and the month of January finished on an extremely mild note. Asia's heating degree days an indicative of factor of weather-driven demand ran close to average at best for much of the early part of the winter. Nonetheless, prices remained fairly robust, compared to last year. The graph on the far right shows spot prices in relation to crude oil for the past three years. Price levels in the first half of '18 were higher than in 2017 and particularly more bullish from June to November probably due to China's early buying ahead of the winter in order to secure more LNG and avoid shortages and price spikes in the winter.

High Asian LNG storage levels, combined with the arrival of new supply in the fourth quarter and a fairly mild winter resulted in more moderate prices in the fourth quarter. Please turn to slide 11 where I'll highlight the European market. LNG imports to Europe reached record levels in December. European LNG imports during the first three quarters of 2018 were actually lower year-on-year. But the fourth quarter showed very strong levels for a number of reasons. Storage levels were at a 17-year low after the 2017-18 winter in Europe leaving the region to play catch-up throughout the year.

The relative tightness in the global LNG market through the first three quarters left limited opportunities for storage replenishment. Early buying and mild temperatures in Asia left that region adequately supplied and elevated shipping rates. High coal and carbon prices and an uptick in global LNG production incentivized flows into Europe in the fourth quarter. Nuclear maintenance and domestic supply declines also supported imports. The middle graph shows a total accumulation of population weighted, heating degree days for the heating season in Europe through January 24.

Europe has also seen mild weather this winter, particularly in December making the regions heating degree days below average in the fourth quarter. Cooler temps in the back half of January have helped bring Europe's temperatures closer to average for the season which should help with the weather sensitive demand. However, given all of the factors encouraging LNG flows into Europe, we do not view the increase is entirely weather driven.

The graph on the far right displays storage levels on the left and TTF prices on the right axis. As mentioned earlier, the store situation Europe faced coming out of the winter of 2017 exerted upward pressure on TTF prices. Europe entered the third quarter with storage levels near the bottom of the 5-year range which contributed to upward pressure on TTF prices. In the fourth quarter, prices were still more than $3 an MMBTU, higher the level seen in the fourth quarter of 2017. Although they have moderated particularly after October settlement.

Europe is undergoing a structural shift in the overall dynamics of its gas market, which makes it an increasingly attractive region for both our long-term and shorter term LNG strategies. There is debate in Europe heightened in recent weeks about limiting coal use and achieving climate targets that could have a significant positive impact on Europe's appetite for LNG in the longer term. In the near term a number of the issues that were in play in the fourth quarter could remain in 2019. Potentially, resulting in continued robust European LNG imports again this year. I'll now turn the call over to Michael to review our financial results.

Michael Wortley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Thanks Anetol and good morning everyone. Turning to slide 13 for the fourth quarter, we generated net income of $67 million consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $634 million and distributable cash flow of approximately $130 million. Our results for the quarter were positively impacted by higher than forecast LNG volumes and revenue and lifting(ph) margins. As well as lower than forecast O&M expenses. For the full year, we generated net income of $471 million consolidated adjusted EBITDA of over $2.6 billion, distributable cash flow of approximately $600 million.

As Jack mentioned consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow for the full year were both at the top of the revised guidance ranges we provided on our third quarter call. Exported 285 TBtu of LNG from our liquefaction projects during the fourth quarter, of which 21 TBtu were commissioning volumes. Total volumes exported were higher than exports in the third quarter due to commissioning volumes from Sabine Pass Train 5 and Corpus Christi Train 1 and higher seasonal production from the four trains in operation at Sabine Pass.

Approximately 72% of the volumes exported during the quarter are 260 TBtu were listed by our third party long term SPA customers and the remaining 79 TBtu were lifted by our marketing functions. Long-term SPA customer volumes were consistent with prior quarter and marketing volumes were higher due to increased production and commissioning volumes. The full year and we exported 976 TBtu from our liquefaction projects, of which 21 TBtu were commissioning volumes. Approximately 77% of total volumes 756 TBtu were lifted by a third-party long term SPA customers and 220 TBtu were lifted by our marketing functions.

In the fourth quarter, we recognized an income 242 TBtu of LNG produced at Sabine Pass, consisting of 263 TBtu loaded during the quarter, plus 3 TBtu or one cargo loaded in the prior quarter, but delivered and recognized in the current quarter. Last 25 TBtu or 7 cargoes sold on a delivered basis that were in transit as of the end of the fourth quarter. We also recognized an income 40 TBtu or 12 cargoes of LNG that were sourced from third parties. The full year, we recognized an income 973 TBtu of LNG produced at Sabine Pass and 84 TBtu of LNG that were sourced from third parties. Five commissioning cargoes from Sabine Pass Train 5 in Corpus Christi Train 1 totaling 17 TBtu of LNG were recognized on our balance sheet as an offset of $140 million to LNG terminal construction in progress during the fourth quarter. One commissioning cargo exported during the fourth quarter was on the water at year-end and will be recognized as an offset to construction in progress during the first quarter of 2019.

Net income attributable to common stockholders for the fourth quarter was $67 million or $0.26 per share consistent with the third quarter. Increased operating income due to additional LNG volumes recognized in revenue was offset by increased derivative loss related to interest rate swaps. Full year 2018, we generated net income attributable to common stockholders of $471 million or $1.90 per share on a diluted basis. An increase of more than $860 million from a net loss of 393 million in 2017.

Increase in net income was primarily due to increased income from operations as a result of additional trains in operation at Sabine Pass. Decreased loss on modification or extinguishment of debt, increased derivative gain and decreased net income attributable to non-controlling interests, partially offset by increased interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. During the fourth quarter we amended our existing revolving credit facility. Increasing total commitments to $1.25 billion and extending the maturity date to December 2022.

This undrawn revolving facility enhances our liquidity position and provides a backstop for Corpus equity funding obligations. Turn now to slide 14 where I'll review our 2019 guidance and touch on the highest priorities for 2019. Jack mentioned earlier, we remain focused on delivering results and today we are reiterating our full year 2019 consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.9 billion to $3.2 billion. A distributable cash flow guidance of $0.6 billion to $0.8 billion. We are also reconfirming our full year 2019 CQP distribution guidance of 235 to 255 per unit.

Our actual results could be impacted by changes to train completion timing or LNG market pricing. Before turning the call over to Q&A, I'd like to briefly review our top three financial priorities for 2019. First is to achieve financial results within these guidance ranges. Second priority is to complete the debt financing transaction for 50% of the total cost of Sabine Pass Train 6. (inaudible) that process and it is an essential step prior to reaching FID. Jack also mentioned this that our final key priority for this year is to develop and communicate capital allocation strategy. A process, which has been under way for several months now.

As we have previously indicated, we expect our capital allocation plan to support our ability to invest in growth, enable us to maintain investment grade credit metrics at the projects and ensure that consolidated leverage is at an appropriate level and return capital to shareholders in a way most appropriate (inaudible) our shareholders. We expect to communicate this policy to the investment community in the coming months. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your time and your interest in Cheniere. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions.

Questions and Answers:

Operator

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We'll now take our first question from Christine Cho from Barclays. Please go ahead.

Christine Cho -- Barclays -- Analyst

Good morning, everyone.

Michael Wortley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Good morning, Christine.

Christine Cho -- Barclays -- Analyst

I know it's early for Corpus Christi Stage 3 and it depends on the contracts, but how are you thinking about targeted financing for it, especially as you are in the process of developing your capital allocation policy. Should we also think of it as 50-50 bet equity similar to Train 6?

Michael Wortley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, Christine. It's Michael. That's how we're thinking about it, continue to deleverage through growth, with no more than 50% debt on all incremental projects and maybe you can bring that down over time.

Christine Cho -- Barclays -- Analyst

Okay and then I think on the last quarter call you said that 2.5 to 3 mtpa was the assumption for early cargoes this year. Has the contracting for this book increased since last quarter and how should we think about your strategy around this, as we move through the year? And should we still think $5 margin for the uncontracted portion, this is what we should assume?

Michael Wortley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yes, this is Michael again. So I think the number is more like 6 million tonnes. I think is of post COD volumes with another 1.5 million on top of that a commissioning volumes which won't hit the P&L. I don't know exactly how the portfolios evolved over the past few months, but certainly we've been selling one thing to keep in mind is we don't like to sell volumes until we know we have them, right until we go through this commissioning process. There's always uncertainty about exactly when the train is going to come on. So we don't want to get out of our skies having placed a lot of volume prior to getting the train.

So with that starting to become behind us as Jack mentioned Corpus passed the performance test recently. So we have more certainty there. So the guys will definitely be more active in putting those volumes away. In terms of market you guys can all see the screen like we can. I told you for the unsold piece of our portfolio we were assuming $4.5 to $5.5 margins when we did our budget, three or four months ago. Clearly that has come in, probably almost $2 and so we gave you that sensitivity on the last call that said, for every dollar move in margin it affect our EBITDA by $130 million. So you can do that math. So if we were in upper half of our guidance range three or four months ago certainly were lower in that range today, but still within it.

Christine Cho -- Barclays -- Analyst

Okay, thank you so much.

Operator

We'll now take our next question from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.

Jeremy Tonet -- JPMorgan -- Analyst

Good morning. Just wanted to build on SPL 6 a little bit more here and see what else is needed for positive FID seems like a contractual support is largely there. Is it just lining up the financing and then also looks like the EPC contract price $2.5 billion is a bit lower than what you had pressed PL5 and just wondering what drives the deltas there.

Jack Fusco -- President and CEO

Hi, Jeremy. Thanks. SPL 6 we're extremely excited about as I mentioned on my talking points we've released Bechtel with limited notice to proceed. So we've locked in the price. We've locked in the schedule in regards to that and Bechtel is making extremely good progress as you know. There's a lot of synergies with having the workforce just roll off of five into six. Additionally, what you're seeing are with the cost of 6, we think it's extremely competitive just like Corpus Christi Train 3 and we were able to utilize not only the synergies of having the workforce, already mobilized in the equipment already there to move right into train 6, but also into utilizing some of the existing infrastructure that it affords us having the brownfield site. So we've got the infrastructure that was already built for the first five trains that we've rolled into Train 6 and that's part of the cost reduction. Michael, I don't know if you have anything to add.

Michael Wortley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, I mean on the financing that we're progressing that as we speak. As I said on the last call, as Jack said, we have Bechtel working right there full speed ahead, we know price, we know schedule, we don't owe them a full mtpa until all of the summer. And so, as I said on the last call, we're just kind of waiting to see what contracts come in and what the best portfolio is to really attached to that train for financing purposes and since the last call you saw Petronas come in, it's a very clean FOB deal, which we like to put down at the project.

So we have three or four months to see what else comes in and then decide the optimum mix and close that financing. But that's not slowing us down in anyway because we're under way on Train 6 and then I'd add to Jack's comment on remember when we built Train 5, the first four trains leveraged a lot of infrastructure that we had at the regas facility all the utilities and things like that with Train 5, we had to really add all of that and we did that in anticipation of Train 6. So Train 5 was always going to be the higher cost train ,Train 6 was is far more attractive on a cost perspective, because so much infrastructure is in place from the Train 5. So yeah just like Train 3.

Jeremy Tonet -- JPMorgan -- Analyst

That's helpful, thanks. Just wanted to switch gears over to ESG seems like this is the greater focal point for the marketplace for investors going forward here. And we're just wondering if you could tell us how Cheniere thinks about these issues? How you're positioning yourself and how you guys see yourselves stacking up versus other energy infrastructure company?

Jack Fusco -- President and CEO

So we're very excited here recently organizationally, we were able to bring on a Fiji George who is from Southwest who's got a lot of experience in ESG type programs and he's been spearheading our effort, as well as Chris Smith, who is our Senior Vice President of External Affairs in Washington DC, and you all may know Chris he was Assistant Secretary of Energy under the previous administrations. So we think we need to be a leader in it as you know we feel like we're on the right side of the equation when it comes to ESG we think natural gas is the solution. It's economic, it's secure and it's sustainable and what you see around the world is a policy shift I think it's going to be a secular shift in the way energy is utilized worldwide and I think you're going to see natural gas and liquefied natural gas take a much more prominent role in that.

Well, we will be rolling out our ESG methodology and program here very, very soon. Anatol, do you have anything there?

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

No, just exactly as you said, we're focused, we are looking to leverage our position on the gas procurement side as well as our ability to supply this clean reliable fuel to the rest of the world and have the rest of the world achieve that type of carbon dioxide reductions that the U.S. has enjoyed over the last decade.

Jeremy Tonet -- JPMorgan -- Analyst

That's all from me. Thanks for taking my question.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Michael Webber from Wells Fargo Securities. Mr Webber. Please go ahead, your line is open.

Michael Webber -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Thanks. Hi, good morning guys, how are you ?

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Good morning.

Michael Webber -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Jack, just wanted to start off with you a market-based question, overnight we saw tensions escalate in Pakistan and India, because obviously I have some exposure there to India. I'm just curious, can you maybe you run the risk and the impact your business, can you maybe walk us through the impact theoretically of a force majeure there on your import contracts if we saw a replay of 1999 or a broader conflict. And then maybe I guess within the context of kind of walking through that -- volumes just gets put into the spot market and make them on the back end. I know it's early but seems pretty pressing so..?

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Yes, there is no force majeure Michael right it's FOB, so our contract with GAIL they pick up at the flange as Sabine Pass, and they can take it wherever they want to take it and that's one of the benefits of the U.S. LNG and the Cheniere model. So from that perspective, we don't see anything meaningful one way or the other.

Michael Webber -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Okay, that's it wouldn't be applicable to an FOB-based contracts that basically, what you're saying ?

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

It's not, no we would expect them to honor their contract and we would enforce our contract but so far relationship with GAIL is extremely strong, and we will continue to try to meet their needs so.

Michael Webber -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Okay now that's helpful I appreciate that. And then maybe just around the competitive dynamics in and around the U.S. Gulf I guess it's been again a bit more crowded in the last quarter or two with FID at Golden Pass and VG kind of knocking on the door I guess maybe a little bit more insight. I guess within the industry in terms of where those deals are getting done, do you have a better sense yet around whether you've been able to price or able to command a premium for your volumes relative to your peers in U.S. Gulf, and if so maybe kind of a vague sense on where you think that is ?

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

So a couple of things, one, I think when you see a lot of other folks that want to have a position like Cheniere and then it just reconfirms that our business model, our position is second to none right worldwide and so I'm very, very excited about that as you know we were a first mover and we've executed extremely well right, you can compare us to just about everybody else in the U.S. and see that our construction effort has been second to none. Our operating ability in the hand off from construction operations has been second to none, our ability to produce real volume in a growing demand market has been second to none so I feel very good about our ability to execute.

And I do think our full-service model and our ability to deliver anywhere around the world has afforded us a slight premium to were the spot market is clearing today.

Michael Webber -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Okay, thanks for the time guys. I appreciate it.

Operator

We'll take the next question from Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers, please go ahead.

Craig Shere -- Tuohy Brothers -- Analyst

Good morning guys.

Hi Craig, Michael In May, 2018 at your Analyst Day I think you guided that on a 9 train program that you won't required to think about debt amortization out of operating cash flows at both the MLP, SPL level and also at the LNG Corpus Christi level to late 2020s, can you kind of share what maybe all equity funding of $300 a ton upsizing of all the liquefaction trains and the possible successful addition of a 50-50 Corpus Christi Phase 3, would do to that would push amortization requirements under the 20s and 30s ?

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Yes, absolutely I don't know what the exact date is that we'd look to get into the details on that when we hit the road probably after our next call to roll-out capital allocation and Train 6, the Train 6 numbers and probably add some Stage 3 numbers into the whole model but absolutely I mean it's every piece of equity differs that amortization date.

Craig Shere -- Tuohy Brothers -- Analyst

Yes speaking of Phase 3, since Corpus Train 3, you signed four agreements with a total of five in a quarter mtpa which obviously is more than you could possibly need for 4.5 6, how much do you feel like you already have in the bag so to speak Corpus Phase 3 and what minimum percentage of the 9.5 mtpa, would you like to Train 6 contracted before perhaps an FID next year ?

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Yes, I mean, we definitely have more contracts than we need for Train 6 for sure we've drawn down kind of some of our CMI inventory to service some of that, but the plan would be to, we would think that piece of our business competitive advantage to keep some capacity there. How much do we need on Stage 3 I think we're running a couple of cases, one where we built the whole thing and one where we built, half of it and certainly we're making our way toward at least building, half of it but not quite there yet so.

Jack Fusco -- President and CEO

And I would say, Craig, we're extremely excited about Corpus Christi, and our ability to expand, we think there are no constraints with the site, there's no constraints with natural gas pipeline capacity coming into the side, the amount of infrastructures is there and then our location to the Permian should be a real advantage -- all the way around so that we're not going to slow down on the growth side I think I've got some of the best originators in this industry, and we're going to capitalize upon that.

Craig Shere -- Tuohy Brothers -- Analyst

That sounds great. Jack, if I could kind of dovetail on the those comments do you see prospects related to Corpus Phase 3, for signing both supply and off take agreements linked to Brent or perhaps a Texas-based gas (inaudible)?

Jack Fusco -- President and CEO

Anatol you want to take that.

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Thanks, Jack. Thanks, Greg yes, I think one of the things that was surprising in some sense amazing in the LNG market in 2018 was that the majority of the contracts that were executed were Henry Hub linked and obviously it was us and our neighbors at VG that had the that success, the world has got comfortable with this as an attractive model it offers liquidity, price transparency and it has seen a number of times now when if Henry Hub has a quick excursion to prices above $3 it comes down very rapidly and continues to be very competitive with Brent linked and other contracts. We continue to think that that is the right flag to fly, your question about alternative indices that's a very long part and in our view of the world isn't ready to price meaningful volume. Aguadulce(ph) while it's something that you and we know well just does not have the liquidity, transparency term structure that would make it marketable internationally.

Michael Webber -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

That's very helpful. Very quick last one for Michael, I think May last year at Analyst Day, you said $1.9 billion of incremental forecast equity funding for Corpus Christi Trains 1 to 3 with things progressing seemingly better than expected. Any range of how much that might come under?

Michael Wortley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

I don't think we're ready to I mean Train 3 has a long way to go. So I would stick with that number for now. Train 6 we're going to end up with probably close to $300 million of contingency though. And so that will get rolled into Train 6 to help meet our 50-50 debt equity to Train 5 we had excess contingency which will roll into Train 6 to achieve our 50-50 debt equity. But on Corpus side stick with the numbers we put out in May.

Michael Webber -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Great. Thank you.

Operator

Will, now take our next question from Danilo Juvane from BMO Capital Markets.

Danilo Juvane -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst

Thanks and good morning. My first question is for Michael. You have pretty clear visibility to the contractive portion of your cash flow profile, just curious with that in mind, how you sort of evaluating the various capital allocation decisions going forward?

Michael Wortley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, we do have a lot of visibility. Again, we'll roll that out in a few months, probably after our next call will hit the road and talk about it. But it's pretty straightforward for us, there's three buckets. Right there is the growth bucket, the balance sheet bucket and the shareholder returns bucket. And I can tell you we're really excited about the growth. So that's going to be a big number as we look at not only Train 6 but stage 3, reinvesting in the business is the best use of our money at the returns. We think we can generate and then we'll have to decide if we want to do something else on the balance sheet, relative to what we've already said publicly. So we're thinking through that and then there's probably some money left over for some kind of shareholder return, flexibility is going to be key for us. We will keep that in mind as we think about bucket number 3. But look to put some real numbers to that here in the coming months.

Danilo Juvane -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst

And as you think about bucket number 3. Is that something that you think you'd be able to actually implement this year or farther out to assuming some sort of a run rate and (inaudible).

Michael Wortley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, we'll see. I mean, probably both, but we'll see.

Danilo Juvane -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst

Okay. I thank you for that other question is for Jack. You spoke earlier in your prepared remarks about being opportunistic to a CQP simplification I mean it seems that there will be a little bit more difficult to achieve versus what you were able to do with CQH. How should we think about how you ultimately end up rolling up the MLP. Thank you.

Jack Fusco -- President and CEO

I think that I said it fairly clearly we're going to be very opportunistic. The math doesn't work and we're going to have a complicated structure for the foreseeable future and until we convince all of you that our growth really is there. I think we'll get hopefully get you'll comfortable and we can actually execute what we say and that we're a conservative bunch overall. But right now the exchange ratio just don't work.

Danilo Juvane -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst

Got you. Last question from me. With respect to Stage 3 have we ultimately just abandoned midscale , that seems to be, let's talk about now. There seems to be shift in zones just having sort of conventional trains going forward. How should we think about that?

Jack Fusco -- President and CEO

No, we are moving full speed ahead with our midscale solution right now which is our Corpus Christi stage 3 sorry not train 3, stage 3 that would filing, which we have in front of FERC right now.

Danilo Juvane -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst

Those are my question. Thank you.

As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen. Please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up and rejoin the queue for additional questions. Our next questioner comes from Jean Salisbury from Bernstein. Please go ahead.

Jean Ann Salisbury -- Bernstein -- Analyst

Hi, good morning. How much advanced locking in is there of pricing for spot cargoes. Have we seen the full effect of the fourth quarter winter gas spike on margins or it will sum up your next quarter.

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Well. Thank you. It's Anatol, it's really a mix as Michael said, we have three trains coming on with a fair amount of timing uncertainty on cargoes and we're not in the business of going short in the market. We, as we've said to you before, we do have some tranches, obviously we have early cargoes associated with some term deals that we've executed over the last year, as well as some medium-term deals for '19 and '20, but for competitive reasons, we're not going to get into the specifics of the volumes quarter by quarter.

Jean Ann Salisbury -- Bernstein -- Analyst

Okay, fair enough. And then, do you see a risk in 2019 that have everything starts up as scheduled some U.S. LNG facilities won't be running at full capacity for parts of the year.

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

It Anatol again. I really cannot envision that scenario. Actually, I have to say I can't envision the first premise of that scenario either. But even if that did play out, the probability that on a marginal basis, there is no value in exporting a $2.5 Henry Hub molecule to a strong global market is pretty close to zero to me.

Jean Ann Salisbury -- Bernstein -- Analyst

Okay, that's all from me. Thank you.

Next question comes from Fotis Giannakoulis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.

Fotis Giannakoulis -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Yes, hi. Thank you all. Anatol, I have one question for you. The last three FIDs they can be reached without long term SPAs from the respective parties. Is this a new trend and how does this change the the long-term dynamics of the market and your potential margins and growth initiatives beyond the stage 3 of Corpus Christi.

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Thanks Fotis. It's not a surprise to you or to us, it's a global and competitive market and lots of places have attractive molecules that they want to monetize with eight different capital allocation algorithm and different risk tolerance than we do. So we are always expecting what in the U.S., we may have called a producer push component, the LNG market calls it the equity lifting model. Those are projects that we always believed would be able to get off the ground, whether that's East Africa, Western Canada, Arctic Russia et cetera and where we are expecting fully expecting to compete with them. We have been competing with them and there weren't a surprise to anyone in 2018 where we had pretty close to a record year. So we love the hand that we're dealt, we love as Jack said the business model and the track record that we've built and we're confident that we'll be able to leverage that into continued success. But it is a competitive market.

Fotis Giannakoulis -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

So from your answer. Shall I take that your strategy of backing every new expansion, with long-term SPAs will remain intact or this new FIDs might change your risk appetite.

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Well, look, we told you a couple of years ago, our model was continued to refine that we think that the range of CMI having the warehouse staff 5% to 20% sort of as the side boards of volume in it is a very good number and we're still comfortable with that and we've had good success. As Michael mentioned, we've in essence drawn down that inventory will look to reallocate volumes to that in order to continue to prosecute the type of bridging volume and secure reliable attractive value proposition that we've been successful with. So there is no reason to change what's been working and is expected to continue working for the foreseeable future.

Fotis Giannakoulis -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Thank you very much, Anatol. Congratulation for the great year.

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Thanks, Fotis.

Our next question comes from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.

Michael Lapides -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Hey, guys. Two questions, one on the last quarterly call, you kind of updated the range of potential output. Our capacity for each training kind of raise the high end. Can you talk to us about kind of how you get comfortable with hitting that high-end and is even upside to that level. I'd love response on that and then I've got a follow-on about the balance sheet.

Jack Fusco -- President and CEO

Michael, it's Jack. Yeah. So from an operating perspective. I would say that we are very comfortable now with the upper end of the range that we gave all of you. We have some de-bottlenecking initiatives that we have plans of achieving this year with some of our turnaround and maintenance schedules and you should expect us to revise our output but I think most of you are probably on Genscape and can see our gas flows into our facility and noq hat we're very close to 5 Bcf/d right now so we're very, very pleased with the way our trains have been performing.

Michael Lapides -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Got it. And then one quick one on the balance sheet, just curious how do you think about, let's say, once you get Train 6 online and that's we're talking a couple years down the road what you think about as a normal credit metrics that you'd like to achieve kind of a long run target or a long-run goal and whether that is measured on an FFO to debt or debt to EBITDA perspective ?

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Before Michael answers that question, I just want to make sure already this morning with the L&T of Train 6 that the price in the schedule are fixed and not a risk for us so we haven't had any cost overruns yet we don't expect to start now on our Trains number 8 and 9. So I just want to make sure I got that clear.

Michael Lapides -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Understood. I've known you for a long time have, I've not seen, you have very many cost overruns in the 12 to 15 years.

Anatol Feygin -- Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer

Go ahead Michael.

Michael Wortley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

The balance sheet, the rating agencies, look at it several different ways the projects they care about debt service coverage ratios and then deconsolidated numbers consolidated numbers and for us, I think we had, we need to keep it simple and just communicate like everybody else, which is just a consolidated debt-to-EBITDA number.

And so that over the long run I think that's what we'll start to look at more and more though the rating agencies are more nuance given our multiple levels of debt.

Michael Lapides -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Do have a kind of a mental target in mind of where you'd like that debt-to-EBITDAR number to be Train 6 is up and running ?

Michael Wortley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Well they are the part of our grant roll-out in a few months currently we're at 5 times to 6 times consolidated probably on the upper end of that range from what we said last time so that's what we'll stick with for now.

Michael Lapides -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Got it. Thank you, Michael, much appreciated guys.

Our final question today will come from Alex Kania from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.

Alex Kania -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst

Thanks. I just wanted to touch on the commentary related to maybe the financing package for Sabine Pass 6 Michael, I think you talked about thinking about optimizing what contracts you which has that facility are you talking mainly about the CMI contracts that you've already got secured or maybe are you, is there kind of discussions far enough along in another FOB type contract that you may want to wait to see play out for you, you finalize that ?

Michael Wortley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yes, I mean we have a free option right now which is that we don't have to give full mtpa summer so yes, we just wait and see what happens I mean I like our position now if we had to make a decision tomorrow I don't think we have any problem with that but given that we have free time to wait working hard yes, I mean we'll wait and see if anything else comes down the pipe between now and then we have Vitol and PETRONAS which you're FOB deals and then we have a fair amount of does deals so yes we'll just wait.

Clement made his first post to Instagram Wednesday since he resigned as a Conservative MP in November.

Wednesday’s post includes a picture of him standing in the new House of Commons with a statement thanking his followers for getting him through the “dark valley” after the scandal broke.

In November Clement admitted he shared explicit images online with someone he believed to be a consenting female adult but who then turned around and demanded he pay 50,000 euros to prevent the images from going public.

He initially claimed it was a one-time lapse in judgement but when it became clear it wasn’t, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer asked him to resign from the party caucus.

Clement now sits as an independent and says he is getting back to his duties as the MP for Parry Sound-Muskoka.

“I had a severe personal crisis and it manifested itself in the irrational behaviour that became apparent and for which I take full responsibility,” Clement says on Instagram.

He also says he was “getting the counselling I needed and working on my family life” during his time away from office.

Earlier this year, two men in the Ivory Coast were arrested and charged with trying to blackmail Clement.

The RCMP is continuing to work with the Ivory Coast’s cyber crimes unit.

209,Empty,2019-02-28T14:22:43Z,"In dramatic testimony that lasted nearly four hours, Jody Wilson-Raybould broke her silence with a detailed account of efforts by Trudeau and top aides to persuade her to step in and end prosecution of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.","In dramatic testimony that lasted nearly four hours, Jody Wilson-Raybould broke her silence with a detailed account of efforts by Trudeau and top aides to persuade her to step in and end prosecution of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. She argues it amounted to interference in the judicial system, though concedes it wasn’t illegal, while Trudeau says he was trying to prevent job losses in his home province of Quebec.

Justin Trudeau is facing the most explosive crisis of his administration after his former attorney general detailed a months-long campaign by the Canadian prime minister’s office to quietly end a legal problem for an iconic Quebec construction firm.

The public airing of grievances will inflame the scandal, which has driven the governing Liberals lower in national polls. The ordeal dredges up ghosts of the party’s past, which is marked by hand-in-glove ties with corporate Canada — particularly in Quebec. The political fallout, however, is difficult to predict. Trudeau’s path to re-election runs through the largely French-speaking province, where his defence of SNC-Lavalin is being applauded.

Her testimony shook the core of the Trudeau’s team, naming him, his finance chief and his most senior aides. The Conservative leader trying to unseat Trudeau in this fall’s election called for his resignation, but the prime minister stood his ground and rejected Wilson-Raybould’s version of events.

“I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere,” the former attorney general said Wednesday afternoon. Wilson-Raybould, who quit cabinet this month, also said she faced “veiled threats” about what might happen if she refused to order an out-of-court settlement.

“I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,” Trudeau said Wednesday night in Montreal, where he was celebrating a Liberal Party byelection victory. “Our government will always focus on jobs and our economy.”

SNC-Lavalin had been pushing for what’s known as a deferred prosecution agreement to end a criminal case dating back more than a decade, related to corruption charges. The company’s stock plunged the most in six years Oct. 10 when it revealed that the Public Prosecution Service of Canada ruled out a negotiated settlement that would have staved off a trial. Settling out of court would also help the company, which employs about 9,000 people in Canada, avoid a ban on bidding for federal government contracts.

Wilson-Raybould pulled back the curtain on the effort to change that decision and help the company, in testimony that was aired on national television in its entirety. She spoke to lawmakers only after Trudeau waived privilege to allow her to do so, and believes she wasn’t even legally able to intervene.

Inner circle

She said the prime minister and his aides wanted to end the case in part to prevent the company’s relocation — and also to avoid electoral fallout for both the federal Liberals and the party’s provincial wing. Wilson-Raybould said she resisted intervening because she wanted to uphold the principle of judicial independence and the rule of law, but officials ignored her repeated instructions to stop raising the issue.

The former attorney-general identified a series of phone calls and meetings between her or her staff, and Trudeau or several of his top advisers. They include chief of staff Katie Telford; former principal secretary Gerald Butts, who resigned this month; and senior aides Mathieu Bouchard and Elder Marques. She also cited communications with Finance Minister Bill Morneau and his chief of staff Ben Chin.

One of the meetings was with Trudeau himself, in September. “The prime minister raised the issue immediately. The prime minister asked me to help out, to find a solution here for SNC,” Wilson-Raybould said. She said she’d told him she had made up her mind.

London calling

“The prime minister again cited the potential loss of jobs and SNC moving,” while also stressing that he represents an electoral district in Quebec. She said Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, the country’s top bureaucrat, also warned her the company “will likely be moving to London” without her intervention.

Discussions continued. Wilson-Raybould said Bouchard at one point said bluntly: “We can have the best policy in the world but we need to get re-elected.”

She met Butts in December in Ottawa, and was already frustrated by what she called “the barrage of people hounding me and my staff.” She pushed back. “I raised how I needed everybody to stop talking to me about SNC, as I had made up my mind and that the engagements were inappropriate.”

She read a text-message conversation with her chief of staff, Jessica Prince, who was relaying a conversation with Butts and Telford. Wilson-Raybould said Prince was told by Butts “there is no solution here that does not involve some interference.” She said Prince told her Telford said: “We don’t want to debate legalities anymore.”

Opposition reaction

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, who is Trudeau’s top rival, demanded the prime minister step down over the revelations. Jagmeet Singh, leader of the third-place New Democratic Party, called for a full public inquiry.

Wilson-Raybould was ultimately moved in a cabinet shuffle last month, before the scandal broke. Trudeau at first sought to downplay it by saying Wilson-Raybould’s presence in cabinet should speak for itself. She resigned the next day.

To be sure, she said she didn’t believe Trudeau or his aides broke the law, but that their interventions were inappropriate. Wilson-Raybould also said no one ever flatly directed her to intervene. Trudeau has echoed that. The former attorney general said she didn’t think it was inappropriate to discuss the potential of job losses early on, but became inappropriate to continually do it, and to raise the political ramifications of the situation.

SNC-Lavalin has said it’s no longer focused on getting a remediation agreement, but instead on fighting the case. It’s also facing legal proceedings that allege it delayed disclosing that it would not get an offer of a deferred prosecution agreement, from Sept. 4 to Oct. 10. SNC-Lavalin said Wednesday the prosecutor’s “final decision” was only made Oct. 9.",Trudeau stares into abyss after former AG’s explosive testimony,Thestar.com,https://www.thestar.com/business/2019/02/28/trudeau-stares-into-abyss-after-former-ags-explosive-testimony.html
210,Empty,2019-02-26T00:12:00Z,Politicians pledge to act 'to prevent a disaster...that we may regret forever',"Three ministers have urged Theresa May to take a no-deal Brexit off the table as they threatened to back a House of Commons move to force a delay if her deal was voted down.

Richard Harrington, Claire Perry and Margot James said the government should say it would seek a way to extend Article 50 to avoid leaving the EU without a deal on 29 March if there was no agreement.

Writing in the Daily Mail, they warned against being “swept over the precipice” on March 29, and said: “It is a commitment that would be greeted with relief by the vast majority of MPs, businesses and their employees.

One possible post-Brexit immigration scheme could struggle to channel workers towards less attractive roles - while another may heighten the risk of labour exploitation, a new report warns. PA 2/8 Customs union A key point in the negotiations remains Britain's access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union. Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does?

Alamy 3/8 Northern Ireland-Irish border Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. To ensure borderless travel on the island, the countries must be in regulatory alignment and therefore adhere to the same rules as the customs union. In December, the Conservative Party’s coalition partners, the DUP, refused a draft agreement that would place the UK/EU border in the Irish Sea due to its potential to undermine the union. May has promised that would not be the case and has suggested that a “specific solution” would need to be found. Getty 4/8 Transition period Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit. The talks, however, have reached an impasse. Though May has agreed that the UK will continue to contribute to the EU budget until 2021, the PM wants to be able to select which laws made during this time the UK will have to adhere to. Chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said the UK must adopt all of the laws passed during the transition, without any input from British ministers or MEPs. EPA 5/8 Rights of EU citizens living the UK The Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear. May insists that those who arrive during the transition period should not be allowed to stay, whereas the EU believe the cut-off point should be later. Getty 6/8 Future trade agreement (with the EU) Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU.

The newspaper also claimed that 15 ministers would be ready to resign to stop a no-deal Brexit.

The threat came after Ms May suggested she could try to take her EU Withdrawal Agreement through parliament before it had been formally approved by the other 27 member states.

Amid growing pressure to delay Brexit with just 32 days left on the clock, the Prime Minister insisted it was “within our grasp” for Britain to leave the EU with a deal on 29 March.

European Council president Donald Tusk revealed that he had discussed the legal and procedural process for extending the two-year Article 50 withdrawal negotiations with Mrs May when he met her in Egypt on Sunday.

Mr Tusk said delaying the UK’s withdrawal beyond March 29 was now a rational solution, warning that the only alternative, if MPs could agree a deal, was a chaotic Brexit.

Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte, who had talks with Mrs May in the Red Sea resort of Sharm El-Sheikh on Monday, said the UK needed to wake up.

Mr Rutte told the BBC: “The Netherlands is one of your best friends. What you guys are doing – leaving the EU in this time of insecurity in the world, instability in EU – is the wrong decision.

“It’s four weeks until the end date and still the UK has not agreed a position.

“So, now we are sleepwalking into a no-deal scenario. It’s unacceptable and your best friends have to warn you.

“Wake up. This is real. Come to a conclusion and close the deal.”

Despite also facing pressure from pro-Europe Tories for a delay, the Prime Minister insisted in a press conference at the end of a summit of EU and Arab nations that she was sticking to her timetable.

“It’s within our grasp to leave with a deal on March 29 and that’s where all of my energies are going to be focused,” she said.

Challenged over whether MPs would be able to vote on any additional assurances she secured from Brussels before they had been formally signed off by the EU27, Mrs May told reporters: “It is possible to do it either way.”

Rejecting calls for a delay, the prime minister said: “An extension to Article 50, a delay in this process, doesn’t deliver a decision in Parliament, it doesn’t deliver a deal. All it does is precisely what the word ‘delay’ says.

“Any extension of Article 50 isn’t addressing the issues. We have it within our grasp.

“I’ve had a real sense from the meetings I’ve had here and the conversations I’ve had in recent days that we can achieve that deal.”

Mr Tusk said it was “absolutely clear” that if there was no majority in the Commons to approve a deal, Britain faced ”chaotic Brexit or extension”.

“The less time there is until March 29, the greater the likelihood of an extension,” he said.

“This is an objective fact. Not our intention, not our plan, but an objective fact.

“I believe that, in the situation we are in, an extension would be a rational solution, but Prime Minister May still believes she is able to avoid this scenario.”

Mrs May said she had good meetings in Egypt with Mr Tusk, Mr Rutte, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Irish premier Leo Varadkar and Italy’s Giuseppe Conte.

“What I sense in all my conversations with my fellow leaders, both here in Sharm el Sheikh and in recent days, is a real determination to find a way through which allows the UK to leave the EU in a smooth and orderly way with a deal,” she said.

The meetings came after the PM admitted she would not get a Brexit deal in time for MPs to hold a “meaningful vote” this week.

She said she would put her deal to Parliament by March 12 at the latest – 17 days before Britain is due to leave the EU.

The PM faces the prospect of another potentially damaging Commons revolt on Wednesday, when MPs are expected to mount a fresh attempt to block a no-deal break and extend Article 50.

A cross-party group of MPs immediately confirmed they would table an amendment, giving the House the power to demand a delay to Brexit if an agreement was not in place by March 13.

In recent days, three pro-EU Cabinet ministers – Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark – signalled they could be prepared to back the amendment if there was no breakthrough in negotiations.

There was speculation that up to 100 Tory MPs, including as many as 20 ministers, could be prepared to join them as patience among MPs opposed to no deal is stretched to breaking point.

Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who drew up the amendment with Conservative former minister Sir Oliver Letwin, said it would become the “real meaningful vote” on the Brexit deal.

She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The Government doesn’t feel to me to be behaving like a responsible government at all at the moment – the idea that we could be only a few weeks from Brexit and we still don’t know what kind of Brexit we are going to have and we’re not even going to have a vote on it until two weeks before that final deadline.

“I don’t see how businesses can plan, I don’t see how public services can plan, and I think it’s just deeply damaging.”

Mrs May confirmed that Brexit negotiators would return to Brussels on Tuesday for further talks with the EU’s Michel Barnier.

211,Empty,2019-02-27T18:34:31Z,‘Neither Andrew Scheer nor Maxime Bernier uttered one word of concern about the racists now firmly associated with the United We Roll convoy. Their silence was deafening.’,"What exactly is going on? At a time when extremism, white supremacy, anti-Semitism, homophobia, Islamophobia and violence targeting minorities is peaking world-wide, those charged with safeguarding us from these horrors seem to be engaged in willful blindness or worse. Examples abound. Here in Canada the so-called “United We Roll” (UWR) movement, ostensibly a ragtag group of truckers emanating from western Canada and advocating for oil pipelines, rolled onto Parliament Hill last week. While undoubtedly many were focused on the pipeline issue, it’s hard to neglect the fact that the convoy was born out of the racist “Yellow Vest Canada” (YVC) movement.

Indeed, the Canadian Anti-Hate Network tried to ensure that media, government officials and others were aware of the unavoidable links between YVC and UWR. Before the convoy arrived on Feb. 19, we publicly explained that UWR was in fact originally to have been called the “Yellow Vest Convoy.” When it became clear that YWV embraced overt racism, had engaged in online death threats including calls for the arrest and death of the Prime Minister, supported anti-Muslim hate groups including Canadian Combat Coalition, Soldiers of Odin, and Worldwide Coalition Against Islam, it was clear that a name change was necessary. Thus the Yellow Vest Convoy became “United We Roll.” Sadly, however, too many were still associated with the racism emanating from YVC.

The hatred and images of violence from YVC were not hidden. Much of it was directed at Canadian Muslims. That included conspiracy theories blaming local Fort McMurray Muslims for starting the wildfire in order to build a super mosque. David Selvers, from Sault Ste. Marie, is but one example of bigots attracted to YVC/UWR. He is a Holocaust minimizer, anti-Semite and Islamophobe. So vile were his social media postings that the city of Sault Ste. Marie and others disassociated itself from Selvers Crane business. In fact, even UWR had to distance itself from Selvers given the ugly publicity he was generating. Sadly, the Yellow Vests movement has now been entirely co-opted by the far right. In Canada, neo-Nazis like Paul Fromm and Brian Ruhe attend their rallies. Faith Goldy, a self-proclaimed propagandist for the alt right movement, spoke at their first Toronto rally and was a featured speaker at the UWR rally last week on Parliament Hill. Lately in France the Yellow Vest movement has engaged in antisemitic and anti-immigration rallies. Yet, despite the rebrand, despite the close alliances with the racism violence and bigotry of YVC, convoy organizer Glen Carritt still claimed his group identified with the yellow vests and welcomed them to the convoy. Carritt was not the only one to welcome YVC and other convoy members to Parliament Hill. Andrew Scheer, federal leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, along with Maxime Bernier, leader of the new ultra-right “People’s Party,” hopped on the same bandwagon used by Faith Goldy to support and bring greetings to the small group of convoy protesters.

No question they had every right to do so. What is deeply troubling, however, was that neither Scheer nor Bernier uttered one word of concern about the racists now firmly associated with the convoy. Their silence was deafening. Even worse, given opportunities to correct the record, Scheer has remained tight-lipped. It’s this form of willful blindness that gives fresh air to the aspirations and hopes of neo-Nazis, antisemites, xenophobes and Islamophobes.

Article Continued Below

When political leaders choose expediency and vote counting over denouncing the evil in front of their eyes, the spiral towards hate and bigotry becomes ever larger. It was only two years ago that Alexandre Bissonnette, a young man inspired by the same hatred seen espoused by some members of the UWR convoy, walked into a Quebec City mosque and murdered six Canadian Muslims at prayer, wounding many others. It was only a few months ago that David Bowers, also motivated by anti-immigrant rhetoric and convinced that the Jews were to blame for the decline of America, murdered 11 innocent Jews at prayer in Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue. Our nightmares have now turned to reality. Groups like YVC and their supporters within the UWR convoy only give strength to those like the Bissonnettes and Bowers of this world. Worse yet, political leaders who ignore such hatred are not just willfully ignorant but clearly stand with the victimizers against the victims. Bernie M.

Brightfield's report, released last September 2018, their headline was: ""Hemp CBD Market to Reach $22 Billion By 2022: Outpacing the Rest of the Cannabis Market Combined"". That was an unexpected figure given prior projections, but the company has repeatedly stood by its projections. The company publicly responded: ""Many were surprised to see our team release numbers that, on their surface, appear to be very much out of step with those seen prior to the release of our 2018 CBD study. We recognize that these estimates are shocking, and we stand by them. Hemp-derived CBD has been gaining huge momentum in the shadows of its oft-spoken about cousin, marijuana, allowing its growth to be largely overlooked - both by analysts in the nutraceuticals industry, medical industry, and cannabis industry We believe the hemp CBD market is going to skyrocket and is here to stay. Readers can rest assured that our experienced analysts and a vast pool of data support these market sizes and growth figures, despite the risks, barriers, and competitors facing hemp CBD products.

We have interviewed hundreds of people in the industry, surveyed thousands of consumers, conducted market analysis across literally millions of data points. We are a team of highly conservative analysts and we did not take this lightly – (we) honestly believe that these are conservative numbers. We have no rose-colored glasses in terms of the bizarre and challenging regulatory framework that surround this industry, it will always be two steps forward, one step back. There are sure to be some problematic regulations and bumps along the way. But there is too much momentum, too much demand and too much potential for this industry not to explode.""

Richard Harrington, Claire Perry and Margot James said the government should say it would seek a way to extend Article 50 to avoid leaving the EU without a deal on 29 March if there was no agreement.

Writing in the Daily Mail, they warned against being “swept over the precipice” on March 29, and said: “It is a commitment that would be greeted with relief by the vast majority of MPs, businesses and their employees.

The newspaper also claimed that 15 ministers would be ready to resign to stop a no-deal Brexit.

The threat came after Ms May suggested she could try to take her EU Withdrawal Agreement through parliament before it had been formally approved by the other 27 member states.

Amid growing pressure to delay Brexit with just 32 days left on the clock, the Prime Minister insisted it was “within our grasp” for Britain to leave the EU with a deal on 29 March.

European Council president Donald Tusk revealed that he had discussed the legal and procedural process for extending the two-year Article 50 withdrawal negotiations with Mrs May when he met her in Egypt on Sunday.

Mr Tusk said delaying the UK’s withdrawal beyond March 29 was now a rational solution, warning that the only alternative, if MPs could agree a deal, was a chaotic Brexit.

Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte, who had talks with Mrs May in the Red Sea resort of Sharm El-Sheikh on Monday, said the UK needed to wake up.

Mr Rutte told the BBC: “The Netherlands is one of your best friends. What you guys are doing – leaving the EU in this time of insecurity in the world, instability in EU – is the wrong decision.

“It’s four weeks until the end date and still the UK has not agreed a position.

“So, now we are sleepwalking into a no-deal scenario. It’s unacceptable and your best friends have to warn you.

“Wake up. This is real. Come to a conclusion and close the deal.”

Despite also facing pressure from pro-Europe Tories for a delay, the Prime Minister insisted in a press conference at the end of a summit of EU and Arab nations that she was sticking to her timetable.

“It’s within our grasp to leave with a deal on March 29 and that’s where all of my energies are going to be focused,” she said.

Challenged over whether MPs would be able to vote on any additional assurances she secured from Brussels before they had been formally signed off by the EU27, Mrs May told reporters: “It is possible to do it either way.”

Rejecting calls for a delay, the prime minister said: “An extension to Article 50, a delay in this process, doesn’t deliver a decision in Parliament, it doesn’t deliver a deal. All it does is precisely what the word ‘delay’ says.

“Any extension of Article 50 isn’t addressing the issues. We have it within our grasp.

“I’ve had a real sense from the meetings I’ve had here and the conversations I’ve had in recent days that we can achieve that deal.”

Mr Tusk said it was “absolutely clear” that if there was no majority in the Commons to approve a deal, Britain faced ”chaotic Brexit or extension”.

“The less time there is until March 29, the greater the likelihood of an extension,” he said.

“This is an objective fact. Not our intention, not our plan, but an objective fact.

“I believe that, in the situation we are in, an extension would be a rational solution, but Prime Minister May still believes she is able to avoid this scenario.”

Mrs May said she had good meetings in Egypt with Mr Tusk, Mr Rutte, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Irish premier Leo Varadkar and Italy’s Giuseppe Conte.

“What I sense in all my conversations with my fellow leaders, both here in Sharm el Sheikh and in recent days, is a real determination to find a way through which allows the UK to leave the EU in a smooth and orderly way with a deal,” she said.

The meetings came after the PM admitted she would not get a Brexit deal in time for MPs to hold a “meaningful vote” this week.

She said she would put her deal to Parliament by March 12 at the latest – 17 days before Britain is due to leave the EU.

The PM faces the prospect of another potentially damaging Commons revolt on Wednesday, when MPs are expected to mount a fresh attempt to block a no-deal break and extend Article 50.

A cross-party group of MPs immediately confirmed they would table an amendment, giving the House the power to demand a delay to Brexit if an agreement was not in place by March 13.

In recent days, three pro-EU Cabinet ministers – Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark – signalled they could be prepared to back the amendment if there was no breakthrough in negotiations.

There was speculation that up to 100 Tory MPs, including as many as 20 ministers, could be prepared to join them as patience among MPs opposed to no deal is stretched to breaking point.

Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who drew up the amendment with Conservative former minister Sir Oliver Letwin, said it would become the “real meaningful vote” on the Brexit deal.

She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The Government doesn’t feel to me to be behaving like a responsible government at all at the moment – the idea that we could be only a few weeks from Brexit and we still don’t know what kind of Brexit we are going to have and we’re not even going to have a vote on it until two weeks before that final deadline.

“I don’t see how businesses can plan, I don’t see how public services can plan, and I think it’s just deeply damaging.”

Mrs May confirmed that Brexit negotiators would return to Brussels on Tuesday for further talks with the EU’s Michel Barnier.

The most immense and dangerous public scandal in American history is finally cracking open like a ripe pomegranate. The broad swath of the Trump-hating media that has participated in what has amounted to an unconstitutional attempt to overthrow the government are reduced to reporting the events and revelations of the scandal in which they have been complicit, in a po-faced ho-hum manner to impart to the misinformed public that this is as routine as stock market fluctuations or the burning of an American flag in Tehran.

For more than two years, the United States and the world have had two competing narratives: that an elected president of the United States was a Russian agent whom the Kremlin helped elect; and its rival narrative that senior officials of the Justice Department, FBI, CIA, and other national intelligence organizations had repeatedly lied under oath, misinformed federal officials, and meddled in partisan political matters illegally and unconstitutionally and had effectively tried to influence the outcome of a presidential election, and then undo its result by falsely propagating the first narrative. It is now obvious and indisputable that the second narrative is the correct one.

Those who perpetrated this coup must be indicted, tried and imprisoned. Yes, that should include Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, who involved all 17 of our security agencies in this plot at the direction of Obama, who issued an EO to those agencies as a signal to begin the operation. THAT was the infamous “insurance policy.”

The Greatest Constitutional Crisis Since the Civil War

The most immense and dangerous public scandal in American history is finally cracking open like a ripe pomegranate. The broad swath of the Trump-hating media that has participated in what has amounted to an unconstitutional attempt to overthrow the government are reduced to reporting the events and revelations of the scandal in which they have been complicit, in a po-faced ho-hum manner to impart to the misinformed public that this is as routine as stock market fluctuations or the burning of an American flag in Tehran.

For more than two years, the United States and the world have had two competing narratives: that an elected president of the United States was a Russian agent whom the Kremlin helped elect; and its rival narrative that senior officials of the Justice Department, FBI, CIA, and other national intelligence organizations had repeatedly lied under oath, misinformed federal officials, and meddled in partisan political matters illegally and unconstitutionally and had effectively tried to influence the outcome of a presidential election, and then undo its result by falsely propagating the first narrative. It is now obvious and indisputable that the second narrative is the correct one.

The authors, accomplices, and dupes of this attempted overthrow of constitutional government are now well along in reciting their misconduct without embarrassment or remorse becausein fired FBI Director James Comeys formulationa higher duty than the oath they swore to uphold the Constitution compelled them. Orin fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabes wordsthe threat was too great. Nevermind that the nature of the threat was that the people might elect someone he and Comey disapproved of as president, and that that person might actually serve his term, as elected.

A Long List of Offendersand Offenses

The extent of the criminal misconduct of the former law enforcement and intelligence chiefs is now notorious, but to make the right point here, it has to be summarized. The fact that the officially preferred candidate lied to federal officials about her emails and acted in outright contempt of Congress and the legal process in the destruction of evidence, was simply ignored by the FBI director, who announced that she would not be prosecuted, though he had no authority to make that determination.

The dossier of salacious gossip and defamatory falsehoods amassed by a retired British spy from the lowest grade of intelligence sources in Russia, commissioned and paid for by the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee, was circulated to the media by high public officials and cited in illegal and dishonest applications to authorize surveillance of the campaign of the other presidential candidate. A special counsel was empowered on the false pretext of the necessity to get to the bottom of Trump-Russian collusion in the election, of which there was and remains no evidence, because it did not occur and was a complete partisan fabrication.

The special counsel then packed his staff with militant Clinton partisans, and acted very late and only when his hand was forced by the media to remove two officials who referred in texts to each other to the Bureaus ability to smear and provoke the impeachment of the winning candidate as an insurance policy against his filling the office to which he was elected.

Large sections of the media colluded with the Democratic campaign and produced the doctrine that anything was justifiable, no matter how dishonest, to destroy the incoming presidents reputation and damage him in public opinion polls to legitimize attempts to remove him from office. Large sections of the media deliberately deluged the public with stories they knew to be false about the new president and referred to him in terms of unprecedented vituperation in what purported to be reportage and not comment.

This unorganized but widespread campaign of defamation was taken up by a great number of ordinarily newsworthy celebrities and was accompanied by false, unresearched stories denigrating President Trumps supporters, such as the false claims about Catholic school students treatment of an elderly native American and the false claim that actor Jussie Smollett had been beaten up and reviled by Trump supporters. The former intelligence chiefs of the nation under President Obama repeatedly have accused this president of treason, the most heinous of all crimes, and have asserted with the authority of their former positions that the Russians determined the result of the 2016 presidential election. They knew this to be entirely false.

Distracting Public Attention

The special counsel has failed to find any evidence of the collusion and electoral interference that was the justification for establishing his inquiry, and the Democrats are already expressing disappointment in his failure to produce such evidence when the leading Democratic members of congressional investigative committees still robotically claim to have at least prima facie evidence of such collusion.

The dishonest attempt of much of the opposition and what even left-leaning media-monitoring organizations record as 90 percent of the national media, continued for more than two years to try to condition the country to believe that the president had committed the high crimes and misdemeanors required by the Constitution for impeachment and removal from office.

The special counsel, apart from smearing the president, distracted public attention from or tended to justify the ever more evident misconduct of the presidents enemies. And we now know that Comey, despite his higher duty, lied to the president about his not being a target of an FBI investigation, illegally leaked to the New York Times the contents of a self-serving memo he purloined from the government, and lied to Congress by claiming 245 times in one sitting to be ignorant of recent matters that no one of sound mind could have forgotten.

And now we have Andrew McCabes proud confirmation that he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein not only continued the illegal counterintelligence investigation of President Trump, but actively discussed methods of securing his removal from office by deliberate misuse of a variety of laws, including the Emoluments Clause, the 25th Amendment to deal with mental incompetence, and the Logan Act of 1799, which has never been used successfully and has not been tested in 150 years.

Make Those Responsible Pay at the Polls

This entire monstrous travesty is finally coming apart without even waiting for the horrible disappointment of the special counsels inability to adduce a scrap of evidence to justify his replication of Torquemada as an inquisitor and of the Gestapo and KGB at rounding up and accusing unarmed individuals who were not flight risks. The collapse of this grotesque putsch, under the irresistible pressure of a functioning attorney general and Senate committees that are not hamstrung by NeverTrumpers, will cause a revulsion against the Democratic Party that will be seismic and prolonged.

The disgrace of their misconduct is profound and shocking. Richard Nixon, against whom there is no conclusive evidence that he broke any laws (although a number of people in his entourage did) never did anything like this. J. Edgar Hoover in 47 years at the head of the FBI and its predecessor organization, never tried to meddle in a presidential election. Those responsible will pay for this, including at the polls.

Without realizing the proportions of the emergency, America has survived the greatest constitutional crisis since the Civil War. All those who legitimately oppose or dislike the president, including traditional high-brow Republicans who find him distasteful, should join in the condemnation of this largely criminal assault on democracy, and then, if they wish, go out and try to beat him fair and square, the good old-fashioned way, in a free election. But they must abide by the elections result.

216,Empty,2019-02-28T12:32:04Z,The California-based company has been accused of using software manipulation to introduce features that restrict traffic to some sites.,"An ex-Facebook employee claims the social media platform is censoring content from some conservative publishers and commentators.

The California-based social media giant has been accused of using software manipulation or 'special features' to 'deboost' traffic to certain sites and individuals, especially near elections.

Facebook has denied the allegations - and claims the ex-employee was fired a year ago for 'breaking multiple employment policies'. The individual now works for the publication that published the exposé - Project Veritas, a right-wing activist group.

The unnamed ex-employee was hired as a content review analyst in Facebook's intellectual property department and was responsible for copyright and trademark claims.

But during her employment at the tech firm, she says, she found a feature known as 'actiondeboostlivedistribution' attached to some conservative media outlets.

She claimed this is responsible for throttling the circulation for the users it is attached to and directly interferes with posts. It is capable of disabling notifications and shares for example.

The strategy also includes 'drastically limited bandwidth,' auto logouts for people trying to upload content and posts failing to upload without any valid reason.

Screenshots released by Project Veritas show what it claims to be evidence of the demoting and effective censorship of content by Facebook. The anonymous whistle-blower said: 'They believe the election of Donald Trump was a fluke, it shouldn't have happened' (stock image)

She revealed this was one of the 'methods of suppression' Facebook employed to prevent the widespread distribution of some media.

A live video would be branded ActionDeboostLiveDistribution by Facebook and this would suppress the content.

The activist group also claims there is no evidence that liberal outlets are subjected to the same rules.

It claims this is evidence of anti-conservative bias.

Facebook's response is that this is not true and instead the violation and subsequent suppression is as a result of broadcasting non-live videos and claiming they are live.

This is a violation of Facebook's terms and conditions.

The whistle-blower claims the label would be applied to 'several different conservatives pages'.

She revealed she has found evidence of it on the sites of Mike Cernovich, Steven Crowder and the Daily Caller.

Mike Cernovich is a prominent right-leaning social media personality and serves as a host on InfoWars, the show operated by Alex Jones which was banned on Facebook, Apple, YouTube, and Spotify last year.

Steven Crowder is a conservative political commentator in the US and Canada and the Daily Caller is a conservative American news and opinion website.

Project Veritas founder James O'Keefe, who narrates the video, said Facebook's practices are intended to affect right-wing users the hardest.

Mr O'Keefe has a chequered history with video production when his previous work on ACORN (Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now) and NPR (National Public Radio) were found to be inaccurate.

He was also arrested in 2010 when he, along with three accomplices, tried to break into a federal building disguised as a telephone repairman.

He was later sentenced to three years of probation and 100 hours of community service.

Facebook has refuted the allegations and says the ex-employee, who collected the information out of curiosity and not as part of her job, skewed its internal protocols.

'We fired this person a year ago for breaking multiple employment policies and using her contractor role at Facebook to perform a stunt for Project Veritas,' a Facebook spokesperson told The Verge.

'Unsurprisingly, the claims she is making validate her agenda and ignore the processes we have in place to ensure Facebook remains a platform to give people a voice, regardless of their political ideology.)'

Facebook also stands accused by the ex-employee of targeting moderate right-leaning individuals and groups by labelling specific terms as offensive and censoring them.

These include, she claims, phrases such as SJM and MSM for social justice media mainstream media - which are used regularly by independent conservative outlets but not by left-leaning groups.

The insider stated in the Project Veritas interview : 'It was clearly kind of designed… aimed to be the right-wing meme culture that's become extremely prevalent in the past few years.

Project Veritas also posted online documents supporting the insider. Facebook stands accused by the ex-employee of targeting moderate right-leaning individuals and groups by labelling specific terms as offensive and censoring them (stock)

'And some of the words that appeared on there were, using words like SJW and MSM, the New York Times doesn't talk about the MSM. The independent conservative outlets are using that language.'

Project Veritas also posted online documents supporting the insider.

The anonymous whistle-blower added: 'They believe the election of Donald Trump was a fluke, it shouldn't have happened.'

The Facebook insider believes a data science manager at the company, called Seiji Yamamoto, is the mastermind behind the 'dethrottling'.

She claims his 'news feed reduction strategy' stems from Mr Yamamoto's concerns over hate speech and content near the perimeter.

Mr Yamamoto's report also featured a line referred to the process of 'red-pilling', something it referred to as a 'destructive behaviour'.

Project Veritas says this term is a phrase indicating 'bluntly showing the truth'.

FACEBOOK'S PRIVACY DISASTERS December 2018: Facebook comes under fire after a bombshell report discovered the firm allowed over 150 companies, including Netflix, Spotify and Bing, to access unprecedented amounts of user data, such as private messages. Some of these 'partners' had the ability to read, write, and delete Facebook users' private messages and to see all participants on a thread. It also allowed Microsoft's search engine, known as Bing, to see the name of all Facebook users' friends without their consent. Amazon was allowed to obtain users' names and contact information through their friends, and Yahoo could view streams of friends' posts. As of last year, Sony, Microsoft, and Amazon could all obtain users' email addresses through their friends. September 2018: Facebook disclosed that it had been hit by its worst ever data breach, affecting 50 million users - including those of Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg. Attackers exploited the site's 'View As' feature, which lets people see what their profiles look like to other users. Facebook says it has found no evidence 'so far' that hackers broke into third-party apps after a data breach exposed 50 million users (stock image) The unknown attackers took advantage of a feature in the code called 'Access Tokens,' to take over people's accounts, potentially giving hackers access to private messages, photos and posts - although Facebook said there was no evidence that had been done. The hackers also tried to harvest people's private information, including name, sex and hometown, from Facebook's systems. Facebook said it doesn't yet know if information from the affected accounts has been misused or accessed, and is working with the FBI to conduct further investigations. However, Mark Zuckerberg assured users that passwords and credit card information was not accessed. As a result of the breach, the firm logged roughly 90 million people out of their accounts earlier today as a security measure. March 2018: Facebook made headlines earlier this year after the data of 87 million users was improperly accessed by Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy. The disclosure has prompted government inquiries into the company's privacy practices across the world, and fueled a '#deleteFacebook' movement among consumers. Communications firm Cambridge Analytica had offices in London, New York, Washington, as well as Brazil and Malaysia. The company boasts it can 'find your voters and move them to action' through data-driven campaigns and a team that includes data scientists and behavioural psychologists. 'Within the United States alone, we have played a pivotal role in winning presidential races as well as congressional and state elections,' with data on more than 230 million American voters, Cambridge Analytica claims on its website. The company profited from a feature that meant apps could ask for permission to access your own data as well as the data of all your Facebook friends. The data firm suspended its chief executive, Alexander Nix (pictured), after recordings emerged of him making a series of controversial claims, including boasts that Cambridge Analytica had a pivotal role in the election of Donald Trump This meant the company was able to mine the information of 87 million Facebook users even though just 270,000 people gave them permission to do so. This was designed to help them create software that can predict and influence voters' choices at the ballot box. The data firm suspended its chief executive, Alexander Nix, after recordings emerged of him making a series of controversial claims, including boasts that Cambridge Analytica had a pivotal role in the election of Donald Trump. This information is said to have been used to help the Brexit campaign in the UK. It has also suffered several previous issues. In 2013, Facebook disclosed a software flaw that exposed 6 million users' phone numbers and email addresses to unauthorized viewers for a year, while a technical glitch in 2008 revealed confidential birth-dates on 80 million Facebook users' profiles.

Mr Yamamoto's accused these sites of converting 'normies' to their point of view and Project Veritas called these people 'apolitical or uninformed people'.

The internal documents do shed light on some of the social media firm's attitudes towards content management.

One of its presentations dating back to 2017 suggested a 'Twilight Zone' for suspected trolls where activities online are hampered by what appear to be bugs.

Issues logging in, mysterious diversions to the homepage and problems logging in are all part of this dark region on the fringes of Facebook.

Another tactic Facebook considered employing was the use of naming and shaming.

For example, threatening to inform Facebook friends when someone has posted something 'egregious'.

It would potentially show a message that reads similar to 'John Smith's account has been suspected for 7 days because he shared hate speech in [a group].'

It adds: 'Fear of being outed as a miscreant is what regulates behaviour in real like and we should re-introduce that to the online world.'",Facebook is 'actively suppressing posts from conservative media sources',Daily Mail,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-6755527/Facebook-actively-suppressing-posts-conservative-media-sources.html

218,Empty,2019-02-27T20:21:38Z,"Alberta's NDP government is planning a new auction for renewable energy capacity that is aiming to move it closer to its 2030 target of getting 30 per cent of its electricity supply from wind, solar and other green sources.","Alberta's NDP government is planning a new auction for renewable energy capacity that is aiming to move it closer to its 2030 target of getting 30 per cent of its electricity supply from wind, solar and other green sources.

The government announced plans on Tuesday to add another 400 megawatts of renewable electricity capacity to its energy mix by way of an auction that mandates that the winning project or projects benefit Indigenous communities.

The auction will be the fourth auction of renewable electricity capacity as the oil-rich province creeps closer to its 2030 target, the government said in a statement. Currently about 10 per cent of Alberta’s electricity generation comes from renewable sources, the statement added.

That includes 6.7 per cent from wind and 3.2 per cent from hydro. Solar is a much smaller player, while coal still accounts for almost half of the market, data provided by the provincial government showed. Pricing for renewable and non-emitting alternatives are now at least comparable and in some cases cheaper than fossil fuel sources in Alberta, research shows.

At least 1,500 megawatts of the additional green capacity will be developed in partnership with Indigenous communities, which is enough to power 700,000 homes.

Guy Lonechild, the chief executive of First Nations Power Authority, said he commended the government “for taking the meaningful action necessary to create jobs and attract new investment that fosters relationships between Indigenous communities and industry.""

The government said it had directed the Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO) to prepare for the auction, with further details expected in mid-2019.

The program aims to bring in $10 billion in private investment and ensure Alberta has 5,000 megawatts (MW) of green generation capacity by 2030, although industry experts suggest less than half of that investment would go into the provincial economy.

A study the Canadian Wind Energy Association (CanWEA) commissioned assumed that the likely outcome of the renewable electricity auction series, which make low cost a priority, would mean 4,500MW of the total additional capacity would come from wind and the remaining 500MW from solar.

The assumption that consulting firm Delphi Group made on CanWEA’s behalf that wind projects would account for 90 per cent of the total additional capacity meant that by 2030, they would have spent $8.3 billion to get that 4500MW up and running.

But of that total wind power investment, much of the initial upfront cost is to buy turbines and blades, said Evan Wilson, the regional director of the industry group, which represents companies from startups to multinational corporations across the wind energy supply chain who are participating in Canada’s electricity markets.

Those are massive pieces of machinery made by companies from elsewhere in Canada, the United States, and worldwide, he said.

Of the total wind industry investment to build projects in Alberta, the CanWEA/Delphi assessment (PDF) calculated that $3.6 billion would go to companies in Alberta.

There are just under 1,500 MW of operating wind capacity in Alberta, Wilson said.

Technically, the province's definition of renewable energy follows that of federal agencies including Natural Resources Canada, which includes moving water (otherwise known as hydro), heat from the earth (geothermal), and sustainable biomass, a certified system that generally involves energy generated from the burning of wood chips. So far, only wind projects have won contracts in the first three Alberta auctions.

Wind and solar are growing

The CanWEA/Delphi research from 2017 calculated that it cost around $175 million to build 100MW of new wind power capacity, and that $113 million of that would go to equipment, while the remainder covered transport, materials, labour, environmental assessments and other costs.

Wilson said the auction process had enabled price discovery which shows how competitively priced wind and solar projects are in Alberta, adding that he expects solar to win some of the program's contracts as its costs also fall.

The government said on Feb. 15 that a solar electricity contract to supply more than half of the Alberta government's needs would be delivered at an average price of 4.8 cents per kilowatt hour (kW-h, or $48.05 per MW-h at up to 146,431 megawatt hours (MW-h) of electricity per year).

The government had previously said it planned to bring on five more renewable energy projects by mid-2021, with an average weighted price of 3.9 cents per kilowatt hour. That is just above the record low price of 3.7 cents set when the inaugural program launched last year with 600 megawatts worth of projects, and compares to a 2016 Ontario procurement that had a weighted average price of 8.5 cents per kilowatt-hour.

The historic average price of electricity from all sources of generation in Alberta from 2002-2018 was 7.3 cents per kilowatt hour, the government said.

Election looming

The governing New Democrats of Premier Rachel Notley are girding for an upcoming spring election against United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney, who has questioned the degree to which humans are causing climate change and argued that the province should be doing more to promote and support its oil and gas industry. The Notley government is touting its Made-in-Alberta plan, which it says charts an independent course for the province that supports that existing industry while preparing for success in the low-carbon economy.

Environment Minister Shannon Phillips said the government's renewable electricity program was responding to calls from ""investors, power companies, and communities"" for investor certainty. It also responds to questions from Indigenous communities, leaders, and business interests who want to know how many megawatts are in play.

She said Alberta is ""absolutely"" on track to hit its 2030 target, with its electricity system operator having identified how to add extra megawatts as coal-fired generation is phased out, and a range of alternatives including natural gas and wind filling the void.

Phillips said that the fourth round will drop a condition from an earlier round requiring 25 per cent Indigenous equity participation in a project after hearing from Indigenous communities that it was not always possible.

""Some cannot quite make the 25 per cent equity contribution, so we want to make sure to be flexible and responsive"" to that feedback, she said. The government also wanted to ensure that communities that have a lot of land and renewables opportunities on reserve but face other hurdles such as lack of transmission or distribution assets get support, she said.

""We're not saying a specific equity amount, as we did in round two,"" she said. ""What we are saying is it will require an Indigenous benefit component, and we're going to work that out with the communities in consultation as we put those new megawatts on the system.""

Phillips said that because Alberta has renewable sources of energy that are cheaper and can be developed privately, benefits can be spread to landowners such as southern Alberta farmers and municipalities, not just large power generators.

""It means that the new green economy, that diversification is benefiting all Albertans in a way that is meaningful, in a way that provides substantive economic benefits to communities that have historically been excluded from those economic benefits.""",Alberta creeps closer to 2030 renewable energy target,Nationalobserver.com,https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/02/27/news/alberta-creeps-closer-2030-renewable-energy-target
219,Empty,2019-02-25T19:00:57Z,Democratic candidates for the 2020 nomination must come out against the filibuster.,"It would take decades before senators realized that without such a motion, there was no way for a simple majority to forcibly end debate, what we now call “cloture.” It was possible for a single member to block anything he opposed, and it took unanimous consent to stop him.

The filibuster was born. But the small size of the Senate and informal rules around deliberation meant it wasn’t used in earnest until the late 19th century, as American politics became more polarized around party and ideology, and informal rules around speaking and debate could not accommodate the increased pace of activity in the chamber.

The modern filibuster began to take shape in 1917, when President Woodrow Wilson used war demands to pressure the Senate into adopting cloture and a supermajority threshold for ending debate (at the time, it required two-thirds of the Senate ). But even with reform, the filibuster remained a powerful tool for “tedious delays” and “contemptible compromises of the public good.”

In the 20th century, recalcitrant senators used the filibuster to block or delay anti-lynching laws, bans on poll taxes, bans on literacy tests, and other civil rights laws. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was nearly killed by a filibuster. In recent decades, routine use of the filibuster has made it difficult for presidents to pursue their agendas and for Congress to pass major legislation. In turn, it has obscured democratic accountability and made voters feel less efficacious — when voting majorities to power isn’t enough to change the way things are, it’s fair to wonder if electoral politics is worth the trouble.

We are long past the days of large, bipartisan majorities for ambitious, far-reaching legislation. Just three Republican senators backed the 2009 stimulus and not one voted for the Affordable Care Act. Critics see this as evidence these laws were too liberal, but in truth it reflects structural change in American politics. The parties are polarized and ideologically coherent; they offer fundamentally different visions for the direction of the country. A President Booker or Klobuchar might seek Republican support for their agendas, but they won’t likely find it. The legislative path for their policies — to say nothing of a Green New Deal or universal child care — will go entirely through the Democratic Party.

As it stands, Democrats would be lucky to win a Senate majority in 2020, much less the supermajority needed to end a filibuster. For the party to have any hope at actually implementing its agenda, the filibuster needs to be either reformed or eliminated. And the first step toward that is litigating the issue in public to help voters see the cost of preserving this rule, which could put pressure on other senators if a movement forms to end it.

The Senate was built to govern, not to spend its time in endless deliberation, and the legislative filibuster makes that difficult, if not impossible. It does so in ways that typically disadvantage progressives and reformers, and which will cripple the next Democratic administration, as it nearly did the previous one. Any potential political danger — Republicans could easily attack an anti-filibuster push as the first step toward taking away our cars, cows and airplanes — is outweighed by the power that comes with being able to credibly connect the election outcome to a particular policy. Give me the votes, and I’ll give you this plan.

If Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand or any of the other Democratic candidates are actually serious about their policy agendas, the only choice they have is to abandon their attachment to this arcane procedure and lead their party to a firm consensus against a rule that was never supposed to exist.

The voter, Rahul Parsa, who teaches at Iowa State University’s business school, said he told Ms. Harris at a gathering of Asian and Latino activists that she needs to think of the Democratic Party in the Midwest like a struggling retail business — and that she should seek out not just the regular customers, but those who are not loyal supporters as well .

“Kamala needs to find out why the people voted for Trump, what are their issues?” said Mr. Parsa, adding that he had one overarching demand for the burgeoning field of would-be nominees: “You need to bring some states in the Midwest.”

Enlarge this image toggle caption Charlie Neibergall/AP Charlie Neibergall/AP

New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, one of half a dozen Democratic senators running for the White House, is reintroducing a bill on Thursday that would fundamentally end the federal government's prohibition on marijuana.

The Marijuana Justice Act, which was first introduced by Booker in August of 2017, seeks to make marijuana legal at the federal level by removing it from the list of controlled substances, while also expunging the convictions of previous marijuana drug offenders and reinvesting in low-income and minority communities that were particularly hard hit by the federal government's war on drugs.

Some other senators running for president are co-sponsors of the legislation, including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., as well as Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, who is considering a bid.

Two key senators from the Midwest are not listed as co-sponsors: Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who's also running for president, and Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who is mulling a 2020 bid.

Ten states plus Washington, D.C., have legalized some amount of recreational marijuana, and 33 states plus D.C. allow medical marijuana.

Warren introduced a bipartisan piece of legislation last year with Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., to prevent the federal prohibition on marijuana from applying to states that had already legalized it. But Booker's legislation, which she supports, is a more sweeping change.

The bill is retroactive and would apply to people currently serving time for marijuana-related offenses.

The support for Booker's proposal among fellow Senate Democrats vying for the White House is a sign of how much the party has shifted in recent years, and the degree to which candidates feel they need to bolster their progressive credentials in a crowded Democratic field.

It's also an indication of the overall appetite for progressive policies in the 2020 Democratic primary race.

Sanders re-introduced the Raise the Wage Act last month, which would increase the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 per hour. It was co-sponsored by nearly every Democratic senator considering a run for the presidency: Booker, Brown, Gillibrand, Harris, Klobuchar, Merkley and Warren.

223,Empty,2019-02-28T11:02:50Z,"Former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said this week he was ""very close"" to deciding whether to make a 2020 White House bid and will run only if he thinks he can win the Democratic Party's nomination.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said this week he was “very close” to deciding whether to make a 2020 White House bid and will run only if he thinks he can win the Democratic Party’s nomination.

He is not alone in questioning if he is the man for the moment.

The clamor for Biden to join the pack seeking to challenge Republican President Donald Trump has quieted as the Democratic field has grown more crowded and diverse, according to interviews with more than two dozen strategists, activists, party organizers and voters.

Opinion polls show Biden, a former U.S. senator from Delaware who served two terms as former President Barack Obama’s vice president, remains popular. But the Democratic Party may no longer need him in order to be competitive against Trump.

“I love Joe Biden. He’s a great guy and a great politician,” said Jerry Shriner, a Democratic National Committee member from Idaho. “I wish he were the president right now. But I’m not sure I wish he is president in 2021.”

Democrats are in the early stages of an internal debate about how best to challenge Trump in next year’s presidential election, weighing factors like electability, ideology and identity.

The strength of the field - expected to include at least six sitting U.S. senators, plus several current or former governors, U.S. House of Representatives members and a former Cabinet secretary - is a factor in Biden’s calculations, those close to him say.

He will be more likely to remain on the sidelines if he feels a strong candidate capable of beating Trump is emerging.

But a source close to Biden said: “If I had to guess, he’s probably going to do it.”

Biden associates have held discussions with potential staffers and supporters who could serve political strategy, grassroots organizing and digital campaign roles, according to two sources. One source said those conversations were necessary to quickly ramp up a formal campaign operation should Biden decide to run.

Some party activists say, however, that Biden has not reached out to broad donor networks to gauge the level of monetary support he could expect.

Biden, who mounted failed presidential campaigns in 1998 and 2008, said at an event in Delaware on Tuesday that he did not want a third bid to be “a fool’s errand.”

“What I don’t want to do is take people’s time, effort and commitment without there being a clear shot I could be the nominee,” he said. “I think I can.”

‘TOO OLD’

Biden chose not to run in 2016 when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was widely considered the heavy favorite for the Democratic nomination. Some political analysts have since speculated he could have won industrial battleground states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin that proved crucial to Trump’s surprise victory.

Biden’s high name recognition among Democratic voters means he likely can afford to wait longer than lesser-known candidates to enter the 2020 race. But even that comes with a risk.

“The longer he waits, the more people are going to start to want to follow some of the new and younger voices they’re hearing,” said Bret Niles, the Democratic Party chairman in Linn County, Iowa.

Biden’s age, ideology and record already are drawing scrutiny. If elected, he would be 78 when he was sworn in.

“Joe Biden is too old,” said Mary Donough, 60, a Democrat from Des Moines, Iowa, who plans to participate in her state’s crucial nominating caucus next year and wants a younger candidate to challenge Trump.

“There is just more energy there,” she said.

Biden’s backers will argue his age represents experience, said a former aide who asked to speak on background in order to explain internal talking points.

“Voters look at Donald Trump and they look at what we’re missing, which is someone who understands the institution, someone who is an adult, someone who is seasoned, someone who respects the institutions,” the former aide said.

If Biden does run, the chair of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel, said on Thursday that Trump and the Republican Party would attack his work as vice president under Obama.

“Go ahead and run,” McDaniel told the Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Maryland. “Run on your record of stagnant wages, of jobs leaving this country, of manufacturing jobs fleeing United States of America, of bad trade deals, of bad foreign policy.

The Democratic Party undoubtedly has moved left since the last time Biden appeared alone on a ballot in 2008, when he was re-elected to the Senate by Delaware voters for his seventh term.

“Times have changed,” said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. “Does he meet the moment?”

Green, whose group supports the candidacy of U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, lumps Biden in with white, male, moderate Democrats who have faltered in recent elections, like Phil Bredesen, who lost his U.S. Senate race in Tennessee last year.

Biden also will have to answer for his record.

He chaired the 1991 confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and was criticized for not doing enough to protect Anita Hill, who accused Thomas of sexual harassment. Biden has since apologized and said he should have done more to shield Hill from attacks by Republicans.

Unions remain unhappy about the free-trade deals advocated by the Obama administration, and liberal progressive groups point to the bailout of Wall Street banks during the financial crisis that provided no help to distressed homeowners.

Sharon Holle, who has been working to organize for Biden in Iowa ahead of his decision, argued his experience would appeal to Democrats nervous about the country’s direction under Trump.

“People are scared,” Holle said. “We’re in a crisis right now. We need somebody we can trust.”","As Biden weighs 2020 bid, Democrats ask: 'Does he meet the moment?'",Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-biden-idUSKCN1QH1EX

(CNN) On Tuesday, House Republicans will take a crucial vote that will mark what the party is becoming at this crossroads in American history. President Donald Trump has invoked national emergency power to secure federal funds for a wall that Congress refused to pay for. He has done so based on an alleged crisis at the border that almost no reputable expert agrees is real.

""The President's actions are at odds with the overwhelming evidence in the public record, including the administration's own data and estimates,"" proclaimed 58 prominent ex-national security officials who oppose what the President is trying to do. They made this assertion -- to be entered into the Congressional Record -- in a 13-page joint statement issued Monday.

Even some Republican loyalists understand that if President Trump takes this step to finance a border wall, future presidents in both parties will have sufficient justification to enact policy to tackle their goals, including initiatives on climate change, without congressional support.

Congress has the power to stop President Trump if it wants to; it doesn't need the courts to step in. If the House and Senate vote for a resolution revoking this use of emergency power, with sufficient votes to override an expected presidential veto, Trump has to back down. Under the National Emergencies Act of 1976 , Congress gave itself the power to restrain the president.

But President Trump is tweeting out warnings to his fellow Republicans. ""I hope our great Republican Senators don't get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security,"" he tweeted Monday morning. In a follow up , he asked: ""Why on earth would any Republican vote not to put up a Wall or against Border Security. Please explain that to me?""

The good news for President Trump is that the odds are on his side. Most Republicans won't go along with Speaker Nancy Pelosi or Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Although a handful of Republicans have indicated they opposed the emergency declaration, most have not. The Democratic-controlled House is expected to pass legislation reversing Trump's emergency order, but it is not even likely that the resolution will make its way through the Senate, where the Republicans hold power.

This vote is the latest in a series of critical moments since January 2017 in which congressional Republicans have shown themselves to be the foundation of the Trump presidency rather than passive bystanders. Republicans have made active decisions that strengthened the President's hand or allowed him to use his authority in unprecedented fashion because it seemed to serve their political interest.

When Republicans did not censure President Trump after his stunning failure to fully condemn the neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, the party showed that it had the President's back . When the party ended his controversial first year by voting in favor of Trump's massive corporate tax cut, it handed him a crucial legislative victory at a key point in his presidency -- one that greatly improved his standing with the Republican electorate.

When then-House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes released a memo making pointed accusations about the motives of the FBI, he and the Republicans on his committee joined in on the President's ongoing assault on law enforcement institutions -- an apparent attempt to discredit the investigations into his campaign and presidency.

Most recently, the Republicans allowed President Trump to shut down the federal government for the longest period in American history , even though the Senate had reached an agreement over the budget, so that the administration could score political points with the base. Government workers went without pay so that the party could start setting up for the 2020 campaign.

In announcing the deal to reopen the government, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced his support for the President turning to emergency power -- only days after expressing his staunch opposition to such a move.

This week's vote might be the most important of all these enabling moments. If the Republicans don't vote to stand between Trump and this aggressive use of presidential power, they are giving consent to the President to unilaterally siphon money from programs that Congress has funded into a program that Congress refused to support.

The Federal Trade Commission is launching a new task force focused on the tech industry, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, with a broad anti-trust mission that will “include re-examining mergers that already have been approved by the government.”



FTC Chairman Joe Simons wrote in a statement, “The role of technology in the economy and in our lives grows more important every day. It makes sense for us to closely examine technology markets to ensure consumers benefit from free and fair competition.”

The agency wrote that the task force will be staffed with career officials and is modeled on the 2002 Merger Litigation Task Force, which had roles in reviewing both hospital mergers and enforcement in retail business. FTC officials did not discuss specific companies that might be examined by the new force, the Journal wrote:

The new task force will be drawn from existing staff, and include 17 FTC attorneys. While FTC officials said they couldn’t discuss specific cases they would be examining, they said they would consider breaking up deals that are creating harms. “In general with consummated mergers we have the full panoply of remedies,” said Bruce Hoffman, the director of the FTC’s competition bureau. That could include breaking up merged firms or requiring a spinoff of specific units, he added, assuming the FTC can meet its legal burden of showing harm.

However, obvious potential targets are tech titans like Facebook, Google, and Amazon. The former has bought up numerous competitors such as WhatsApp and Instagram, and the FTC is reportedly mulling slapping it with a massive fine for potential violations of a 2011 deal with the agency on user privacy. Google has rapidly bought up swathes of the digital ad business and owns YouTube, and along with Facebook is estimated to control well over half of the U.S. digital ad market. Amazon has regularly faced accusations of anti-competitive behavior. All three companies, as well as other major tech firms, have faced calls to break them up or at least soften their edges.

“The FTC, if it is to remain relevant, needs some way of assessing the evident competition problems in the tech sector and taking action when necessary,” Columbia University law professor Tim Wu told the Journal. “The FTC needs to get past its laser-focus on consumer prices, and figure out what competitive harm means in today’s tech markets.”

Donald Trump’s administration threatened to investigate Facebook, Twitter, and Google last year, accusing them of silencing and discriminating against conservative voices online.

While claims of bias and censorship by big tech companies are by no means exclusive to any one side of the political spectrum, the narrative coming from Trump and the broader GOP has included repeated and baseless accusations tech companies are controlled by liberals and serve as de facto arms of the Democratic Party. (Trump, for one, has promoted this idea with wild-eyed claims of “SHADOW BANNING” on Twitter, doctored videos purporting to show Google blacklisting his speeches, and diatribes against Facebook.) Last year, Attorney General Jeff Sessions convened a meeting of federal and state law enforcement officials, reportedly trying to focus their energy on investigating those claims of left-wing bias instead other concerns like handling of user data.



Those efforts, so far, have amounted to little more than empty threats, and there’s no indication at this moment that the FTC’s new commission has anything to do with them. (In fact, the FTC has been examining these issues separately for some time.) Per Wired, there is actually some concern from tech critics that the agency won’t even rouse itself to do much of anything on the more legitimate antitrust concerns.

Matt Stoller, a fellow at the anti-monopoly Open Markets Institute, told Wired that the FTC has taken no real antitrust action to date on big tech and he was “scornful of the new seating arrangements, because the FTC has consistently proven they do not want to wield power.”

“They want to hold hearings. They want to get their friend economists and antitrust lawyers to fly into DC and talk to each other,” Stoller added. “They don’t want to do their No. 1 job, which is to police markets for unfair and anticompetitive behavior.”

227,Empty,2019-02-26T11:00:04Z,Is it time for the U.S. to confront other great powers — or to retreat?,"Mr. Trump shares some of these inclinations. “Great nations do not fight endless wars,” he proclaimed in the State of the Union. He has pledged to pull most ground troops out of Syria and is pursuing negotiations with the Taliban in Afghanistan. On the whole, though, most advocates of restraint find little to like in Mr. Trump’s militarized foreign policy. They see a president who has attempted to assert American dominance over the world, boosting the defense budget, escalating military interventions in the Middle East and Africa, and imposing new sanctions on Iran and now Venezuela.

Yet they also see an opportunity to constrain the United States’ military adventurism by opposing the war powers of an unprincipled and unstrategic commander in chief. On Feb. 13, antiwar forces scored a victory when the House voted to end military support for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen. If the resolution passes the Senate, it will mark the first time Congress has invoked the 1973 War Powers Act in order to bind the president to remove American forces active in hostilities abroad.

The bill also offers a template for further withdrawals, according to its Senate sponsors, Democrat Chris Murphy, Independent Bernie Sanders and Republican Mike Lee. “Since 9/11, politicians have become far too comfortable with American military interventions all over the world,” they have written. The next step may be to repeal the Authorization for the Use of Military Force passed after the Sept. 11 attacks, which successive presidents have used to justify almost unlimited warmaking in the greater Middle East.

Restraint is advancing on the left of the Democratic Party, but it’s not yet clear whether it can pierce the center as domestic proposals like Medicare for All have done. Calls to cut military spending, advanced by Mr. Sanders and House progressives, have not quite become a core principle of the progressive movement. And advocates of restraint tend to become less vocal and unified when they turn beyond the Middle East. The sponsor of the House’s Yemen resolution, Representative Ro Khanna, has distinguished himself by supporting diplomacy with North Korea and opposing regime change in Venezuela, but he stands apart. The restraint coalition would benefit from taking a similarly global view if it is to advance a comprehensive alternative to the status quo.

The Coming Clash?

Does the future belong to great power competition or restraint? Partisans of each camp have good reason to feel the wind at their back. Decades of policy failure have converged with the daily eruptions of President Trump to throw open the question of what America’s place in the world should be.

What’s more, the two camps have not quite trained their sights on each other. That is partly because advocates of great power competition in the establishment remain obsessed with Mr. Trump, while advocates of restraint have been marginalized for so long that they need to pick their battles. One can even glimpse the outlines of a tacit bargain between them, breaking down geographically: As restrainers try to end wars in the Middle East, centrists pivot toward the Pacific, where the adversaries are larger but war less likely.

For now, savvy politicians can adopt both positions at once. Ms. Warren, for example, denounces Chinese and Russian behavior at the same time that she promises to remove troops from Afghanistan and “cut our bloated defense budget.” And Democrat-leaning experts not previously outraged by America’s Middle East entanglements now bemoan them as distractions.

228,Empty,2019-02-26T15:21:22Z,A sham referendum can't hide the fact that the Communist Party retains its monopoly on power and the Cuban people remain in chains.,"A sham referendum can't hide the fact that the Communist Party retains its monopoly on power and the Cuban people remain in chains.

Maybe you heard: Communist Cuba is on the road to freedom.

That’s what Cuba’s rulers want you to think after the Cuban people overwhelmingly approved a new constitution on Sunday. But the opposite is true. Cuba’s rulers have only cemented their control, and the Cuban people are no closer to freedom today.

Just look at the process that created this new constitution, which was anything but democratic. It began last summer when the National Assembly established a commission to draft the text. The Assembly claims to represent the Cuban people, but its most recent election fielded a party-approved candidate in each of its 612 races. The electorate could only vote yes or no. Every Communist candidate won.

As for the commission, it consisted of 33 hardline Communist loyalists, chaired by none other than First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba Raul Castro. Its only goal was to safeguard the tyrannical one-party state, which it accomplished by drafting a charter that makes socialism in Cuba “irrevocable.”

Ultimately, the new constitution is little more than a public-relations stunt. Like the Soviet constitution of old, it has freedom-friendly language on paper that disappears in reality.

More commentary: Venezuela was my home, and socialism destroyed it. Slowly, it will destroy America, too.

Green New Deal’s 55 promises that have little to do with climate change: The full list

Are you really into socialism? You're probably not.

For example, the document ostensibly recognizes private property for the first time. This is a meaningless clause considering the constitution also reiterates the “irrevocable” role of central planning and state control over production and land use. Nor can there be any meaningful protection of private property in a country that refuses to recognize the concept of individual rights.

Cuba's fake rights

Similarly, the text appears to restore the presumption of innocence in Cuban courts and the right to legal representation. This, too, is a dead letter. All lawyers and judges serve at the pleasure of the Communist Party and follow its dictates. The regime also routinely ignores those due process obligations that already exist in Cuban law, including the right to petition the authorities with grievances, and has arrested and imprisoned thousands of political prisoners without formal charges in recent years.

Finally, the constitution seems to place constraints on Cuba’s president, restricting the position to two consecutive terms and creating a new and co-equal office of prime minister. But the true ruler of the country — as in all Marxist systems from China to North Korea — is the party’s first secretary. In Cuba, it’s Raul Castro. There are still no checks and balances on this all-powerful position; the Castro family continues to control every facet of Cuban life.

These and other so-called reforms are little more than a colorful new paint job on the same rusty old Communist architecture. The structure underneath is still a totalitarian state that bans political parties, imprisons and harasses dissenters, and denies the Cuban people’s most basic human rights.

Nothing will change

Tellingly, the constitution omitted any reference to the freedom of conscience. The regime actively tried to prevent Christians from speaking out or even participating in the referendum.

Then again, the referendum itself was a ploy by Havana to legitimize its rule and disarm foreign critics. It left pro-freedom Cubans in a lose-lose situation. They could either vote no in an election with a pre-ordained outcome or refuse to participate altogether, giving the regime a lopsided victory either way. The U.S. media is lauding the 9% who voted no — a historic high — but that number is highly suspect for a dictatorship that craved a democratic veneer. Havana could very well have pulled it out of a hat.

Meanwhile, for the Cuban people, nothing will change.

The regime will laud this new step in the revolution’s struggle, even as its subjects struggle to survive in a nation defined by poverty. Last week, I spoke with Rosa María Payá, a Cuban activist whose father Oswaldo Payá founded a movement opposed to the Communist Party. The regime assassinated him in 2012, and now his daughter tells me the new constitution only “guarantees the perpetuation of the dictatorship.”

Rosa María believes the Cuban people deserve a real referendum, which she advocates through an initiative known as Cuba Decide. Tens of thousands of her fellow citizens have joined her to call on Havana to hold a yes-or-no vote — not on a Communist constitution, but on the Communist Party itself.

The regime will never let such a vote happen because it fears nothing more than the Cuban people. Instead, it staged a rigged referendum to fool the world and fortify its rule. The new constitution is a charter of renewed tyranny, not liberty, and so long as the Communist Party reigns in Havana, Cuba will never be free.

“There’s a consensus,” Biden told an excited crowd during an appearance at the University of Delaware. “The most important people in my life want me to run.”

Andreas Gebert / Reuters Former Vice President Joe Biden says his family wants him to run for president in 2020 but he hasn't made up his mind yet.

He did not explicitly say he was running. In fact, the 76-year-old lifelong politician conceded he may not be popular enough to win over the Democratic Party of 2020. Yet roughly 10 months before the first primary votes are cast, Biden sent an unmistakable message to prospective rivals and voters alike that the already-crowded Democratic field is far from set.

Should he run, he would instantly become a front-runner, the best-known option for primary voters and perhaps the best-respected by elected officials and donors, who in many cases have a decadeslong relationship with the longtime Democratic leader. Biden’s potential rivals had little to say publicly about his latest comments on potentially joining the field, but in private, their camps conceded that he would be a political force who could scramble the evolving field.

Biden could erode Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ popularity with working-class voters in the Midwest, California Sen. Kamala Harris’ standing with African-American voters in South Carolina and New York billionaire Michael Bloomberg’s claim to the political center.

“Uncle Joe is absolutely beloved within the Democratic Party and for good reason,” said Zac Petkanas, an aide to former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. “However, this isn’t a popularity contest. Not only is he going to have to prove he’s got fresh, bold ideas, but that he’s tough enough to stand up to Trump.”

While he would be the oldest U.S. president ever elected, toughness has never been an issue for Biden, a native of working-class Pennsylvania, who suggested last year that he would “beat the hell” out of President Donald Trump for his comments about women if the two were in high school.

It is unclear, however, if Biden’s profile, politics and policies are in line with today’s liberal base, a relatively small slice of the electorate that holds outsized sway in presidential primary elections.

Biden would stand out as an old white man just months after Democratic voters sent the most diverse class to Congress in history. He would also be viewed as an establishment-minded moderate unwilling to wholly embrace litmus test issues like free universal health care, free college and the so-called Green New Deal.

“He is the biggest, best-known candidate in the race,” said veteran Democratic strategist Gary Pearce. “Personally, I have mixed feelings. For all the respect I have for him, I don’t know if he’s the right thing for the Democratic Party right now.”

Still, Trump allies have long considered Biden among the most formidable possible general election opponents given his working-class appeal. Despite more than four decades in Washington, most of it as a Delaware senator, he has long played up his upbringing in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

Biden also has far more international experience than his would-be Democratic opponents — and the president. At a global security conference in Germany this month, he told an international audience that an American leader “stands up to the aggression of dictators.”

Yet he has struggled to develop a strong base of political support in two previous presidential runs.

Veteran Iowa Democratic strategist Brenda Kole noted that Biden has never run as a former vice president — particularly one so closely associated with popular former President Barack Obama.

“Ultimately, if he can make the case that he is the best candidate to beat Donald Trump, and I haven’t heard a convincing case yet from the vast field of candidates so far, he could break through,” Kole said.

With his family behind him, Biden said Tuesday he’s still determining whether he can mount a high-powered campaign to win the nomination and defeat Trump. He acknowledged that he’s not sure his “alleged appeal” is real.

“I don’t want this to be a fool’s errand,” he said, noting that his personal decision not to align his candidacy with a super PAC could create financial challenges.

Biden told The New York Times he’d launch his campaign after March if he decides to get in.

In the meantime, Biden allies are reaching out to campaign operatives in early-voting states including New Hampshire and South Carolina to gauge their willingness to join Biden’s team. On Tuesday, operatives in both states said chatter continues, though no formal job offers had been extended.

South Carolina Democrat James Smith, the party’s nominee for governor in 2018, said Tuesday that he’s compiled a list of possible hires for the former vice president.

“I believe he’s getting ready to say the word,” said Smith, who was endorsed by and campaigned with Biden last year.

In Iowa, Biden is the most recognized and preferred in early polls. Yet activists report a hunger for new faces, as evidenced by big crowds at recent events for Harris and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Midwesterners such as Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown are also making a play for Iowa voters, though Brown has yet to announce whether he’s running.",Joe Biden Says He’s ‘Close’ To Making Decision About 2020,Huffpost.com,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-biden-2020-decision_n_5c760fd2e4b08c4f5555466b

What does the Alabamian writer Rick Bragg mean when he says in the introduction to your new book, Bending Toward Justice, that there are too many ghosts in Alabama?

There is often an undercurrent of racial tension in the state that people have a hard time getting over. And they really have a hard time talking about.

Just this month there was an editorial in an Alabama newspaper calling for the Klan to ride again. How can this be?

It’s like the ghost that appears in your worst nightmare. It comes to the front, and you realize that yes, we have gone very far, but we’ve got a ways to go. There are people in this state, and this country, that have feelings about race that are very, very strong.

Your book is about the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in 1963, which resulted in the deaths of four girls, and your role in bringing some of the bombers to justice as a prosecutor. Why write a book about this now?

It’s important with cases like this to have a written history of how it all came together and how things have changed so people can look at it and understand it. Second, I think we are backsliding on civil rights and voting rights. We saw it in the courts with the Shelby County v. Holder decision [which struck down part of the 1965 Voting Rights Act], but we’re also seeing it in a broader sense.

A cynic might say that you’re publishing this book now to remind voters of your civil rights bona fides. Would you like to address that?

Well, yeah, I can see that. But this book has been in the works for a long time.

You won your Senate seat in a close special election against Roy Moore, a controversial figure facing sexual-assault allegations. Do the Republicans just have to nominate a normal person in 2020 to defeat you?

That underestimates the people of Alabama. It’s a fairly tribal state, but you’re basically saying to folks that they don’t think, and they’re not going to look at candidates. Anybody I run against is going to run so far to the right, they will essentially be a lapdog. There will be people who want that, but I just give the people a lot more credit.

Given that your time in public office may be short, why did you choose to make your first speech on the Senate floor about gun violence?

To bring attention to the fact that there are measures that we can do while we still respect the Second Amendment, with regard to background checks, the “boyfriend loophole” and reporting. I thought that message coming from a gun owner and an avid hunter might resonate more than the usual suspects’.

Do you think Donald Trump will be re-elected in 2020?

I think folks will underestimate him, simply because of the way he conducts himself. I do worry that there’s too many in the Democratic Party who think, “Oh, we can’t lose this.” Well, we can.

Do you have a favored candidate to beat him?

You’ve got to have a candidate that talks to the heartland of America. It’s no secret I think Joe Biden fits that bill better than anyone. We tried the chaos thing and I just don’t think it’s working. We’re looking for a transitional candidate, who respects the institutions of government, who believes they work for all people, not just himself.

Is it true, as your book’s intro claims, that you’re a terrible fisherman?

I love Rick Bragg, but he says some things that you just can’t rely on. There is an element of jealousy with him.

Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett said Monday that he would support Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City and the founder of Bloomberg LP, if he were to run for president.

Buffett made the comments on Monday morning in an interview on CNBC's Squawk Box.

Both men are among the richest people in the world.

Warren Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, said Monday that he would support Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City and founder of Bloomberg LP, if he were to announce a 2020 presidential bid.

""If Mike Bloomberg announced tomorrow that he was a candidate, I would say, 'I'm for him,' and I think he would be a very good president,"" he said in an interview with CNBC's Becky Quick.

""He and I disagree on some things, but I think that he knows how to run things. I think that he's got the right goals for America, he understands people, he understands the market system, and he understands the problems of people that don't fit well into the market system.""

Buffett, who on Saturday released his annual letter to shareholders, told CNBC that he wasn't a Democrat through and through, though over the last three decades he's voted for more Democrats than Republicans.

""I'm not a card-carrying Democratic, but I never have been,"" Buffett said. ""I've voted for a fair number of Republicans, I've given money to Republicans.""

Both Buffett and Bloomberg are among the richest people in the world, according to Forbes. Buffett's net worth, as of Forbes' 2018 ranking, was $84 billion, while Bloomberg's was $50 billion.

While it's long been rumored that Bloomberg would run for the highest US office, he told the Associated Press in early February that he would decide by the end of this month if he would enter the race. He officially registered as a Democrat — again — last October.

Bloomberg has rejected the notion that he likely wouldn't enter the 2020 presidential race if Joe Biden, the former vice president, announced a bid.

""My decision doesn't depend on what other people are going to do,"" Bloomberg told the AP. ""My decision depends on whether or not I think I can make a difference.""

In his interview with CNBC Buffett also voiced his displeasure about Howard Schultz, the former CEO of Starbucks, announcing he would consider running for president in the upcoming election.

""If he ran as an independent, I think he would take votes away from any Democrat, including Bloomberg, if he were running, so I think it would be a real mistake for him to run,"" Buffett said. ""I think, generally, third-party candidates, they're going to hurt one side or the other, and they're more likely to hurt the side that they actually favor, because they're closer to that view.""

He added: ""I hope no third-party candidate runs that pulls any significant amount of votes. I mean, there will always be a couple of people that file, but I think third-party candidates can thwart, actually, the will of the people.""

232,Empty,2019-02-25T13:35:03Z,Britain's parliament last month demanded Prime Minister Theresa May renegotiate a Brexit divorce deal that the other members of the European Union say they will not reopen.,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s parliament last month demanded Prime Minister Theresa May renegotiate a Brexit divorce deal that the other members of the European Union say they will not reopen.

With just 32 days until the United Kingdom is due by law to leave the EU, the options include a disorderly Brexit, a delay to Brexit or no Brexit at all.

May is pursuing a renegotiated deal, but faces a growing threat that she will need to choose to delay Brexit or be forced to do so by British lawmakers.

Below is a summary of what is due to happen next:

“HIGH NOON”- FEB. 27

On Tuesday, May will make a statement updating lawmakers on her progress and lawmakers will have an opportunity on Wednesday to debate and vote on the way forward.

Several lawmakers in May’s Conservative Party, including some ministers, have indicated this will be the last chance they give her to find a way through the impasse.

Opposition Labour Party lawmaker Yvette Cooper plans to use that debate to seek lawmakers’ support for legislation that would force the government to decide between leaving without a deal or extending the Article 50 negotiation period if it has not had a deal approved by March 13.

VOTE ON A REVISED DEAL - BY MARCH 12

May has promised to bring back a revised deal to parliament and hold a vote on whether to approve it by March 12.

Before a vote on the exit agreement in January, which May lost heavily, parliament held five days of debate. It is not clear whether there would be another lengthy debate this time.

May is required by law to get parliamentary approval for any exit deal.

EU SUMMIT - MARCH 21-22

EU leaders are due to meet in Brussels. This could be an opportunity for an eleventh-hour deal or it would be the last chance to agree an extension of the Article 50 negotiation period and delay Brexit to avoid no-deal disruption. If the summit goes badly and there is still no deal in sight then May will have to decide whether to delay or go for a no-deal Brexit.

LAST WEEKEND - MARCH 23-24

If a deal is seen as viable at the summit, officials could work through the weekend to nail down the details with a final deal - and a possible extension to June 30 conditional on British parliamentary approval - announced on Sunday, March 24-Monday, March 25.

FINAL WEEK - MARCH 25-29

If a deal could be clinched, then the British parliament could vote on it, possibly on March 26. The European Parliament could ratify the deal that week.

EXIT DAY - MARCH 29?

If May does not get a deal approved by parliament by March 29, Britain faces a disorderly exit or may be forced to seek an extension of Article 50 to give more time to reach an agreement. It is not certain the EU would agree to this.

Some lawmakers, including opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, have said it is now “inevitable” that the government will have to seek an extension, as there will not be enough time to pass the legislation for Britain’s exit before March 29.

The leader of Britain’s lower house of parliament, Andrea Leadsom, has said the date might need to be pushed back by a couple of weeks.

EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ELECTIONS

The bloc will vote to elect a new European Parliament on May 23-26. The new chamber would sit from July 2, a date that is shaping up to be the EU’s limit for any extension of Article 50.

The EU says Britain would have to organize European Parliament elections on its soil if it were to delay Brexit beyond that as otherwise its people would be deprived of their democratic representation while still being in the EU. The bloc fears Britain would not do that.

Some in the EU also fear that, should Britain vote, it would elect a staunchly eurosceptic representation to the European Parliament that is already expected to have a larger contingent of EU critics influencing the bloc’s policies.

The main centre-right group, whose leaders include German Chancellor Angela Merkel, could also lose its place as the biggest in the European Parliament; UK Labour seats could help the European Socialists overtake the People’s Party, from which British Conservatives broke away to sit separately.

DELAYED BREXIT - JUNE 30 OR LATER

If a Brexit extension is sought, one date being talked about in Brussels is June 30, the Sunday before the new European Parliament sits at 10 a.m. (0800 GMT) on July 2. Some argue for an exit before May 23, the day Britain would otherwise be due to hold an EU election.",Factbox: Through the Brexit Looking Glass - What happens next?,Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-whatnext-factbox-idUSKCN1QE1P3

Politicians love introducing tax-cuts, because they're reliable vote-getters, even if they're structured to blow up later by giving massive breaks to the super-rich and more modest breaks to middle-class voters, resulting in mounting deficits and eventual service cuts.

But Trump has managed the impossible: he signed trillions of dollars of tax-cuts into law and lost in the polls as a result.

Trump managed this feat by handing middle-class and poor people tax bills instead of refunds, while cutting in a tiny number of super-rich people for unbelievably large breaks (and the 99% will get stiffed even harder in 2027, when their taxes go up again).

Bill Black proposes a tantalizing thought-experiment: what if Trump had spread the tax breaks around, giving, say, $5,000 to every household with a combined income of less than $75,000? What if he tailored the breaks to his base, farmers, old people, blue-collar workers (while stiffing poor people)?

Not only would this have stimulated the everloving fuck out of the US economy -- wage stagnation and austerity has left the US with tons of underutilized labor and plant that could churn out tons of goods for these people to buy without any inflation to speak of -- but the Democratic leadership would have hated it, because Pelosi, Schumer and the rest of the ""paygo"" crowd are crazy deficit hawks who don't want any unfunded liabilities in federal budgets.

The result would have been a huge PR win for Trump and a massive PR hit for the Democratic establishment. It might have even cost Pelosi the speakership, leaving Trump with a less canny adversary over the next two years.

More importantly, it would have given Trump -- who is much broker than he lets on, and dependent on shady lenders for his funding because no real bank will touch him after all those bankruptcies -- a solid base of his own, separate from the plutocrats who benefited from the tax breaks.

The last sentence understates the scale of political benefits that would have come to Trump had he fulfilled his campaign promise to slash middle-class taxes. It leaves out how much the so-called Democratic centrists’ opposition to such a tax cut would have added to Trump’s popularity while reducing support for Democrats in the 2018 congressional elections. The ‘New Democrats’ and the House Democratic leadership are fervent supporters of “paygo” limitations on budget expenditures. They are far to the right of Republican members of Congress on this issue. More precisely, Republican members of Congress overwhelmingly pretend to care about budget deficits and federal debt only when the President is a Democrat. ‘New Democrats,’ ‘Blue Dog’ Democrats, and Democrats who join “Problem Solvers” and other groups religiously oppose deficits even when increasing the deficit is the best economic action. The result of the ‘centrist’ Democrats’ war against even desirable deficits is that they would have fought and died to oppose a real middle-class Trump tax cut. They would have predicted that it would produce a disaster. Their predictions about the grave and imminent peril of increasing the deficit, as always, would have proven false. Trump would have emerged with his own popularity greatly expanded and enhanced as his greatest rival’s popularity greatly diminished. The Republicans would have held the House, and possibly expanded their majority there and added to their Senate majority. Trump would have demonstrated that he was the expert on the economy, taxes, and the deficit. Pelosi would have demonstrated her recurrent failure to understand the economy, taxes, and the deficit. She would likely have been defeated in 2018 in the Democratic vote for minority leader. Pelosi is a skilled legislative leader, with terrible, closely related, blindspots on deficits and the urgency of dealing with climate change. She acts as if we cannot afford to save the planet by acting decisively against global climate change now. That view is horrific economics and public policy. Similarly, she would have been at her worst in arguing that Trump was endangering the Nation by creating a real trillion-dollar middle-class tax cut. She would have been the face of the Democratic Party in the 2018 elections – the woman and her Party that tried to keep your middle-class family from receiving a $5,000 tax cut. When the economy reacted positively to the resultant stimulus, her humiliation, and that of her Party, would have been complete. Given what Trump knows now about Pelosi’s skill in legislative infighting he should be able to weigh the “opportunity cost” of not using a real middle-class tax cut to maintain control of the House and to discredit and ultimately cause the Democrats to remove Pelosi from leadership. Trump’s cowardly and corrupt surrender to his puppet masters on the tax cut and infrastructure allowed the Democrats to gain control of the House. That made it possible for Pelosi to become Speaker again and to rain down the blows on Trump that have made his life miserable.

In a congressional testimony before the US House of Representatives committee, Cohen accused Trump of being “a racist”, “a conman” and “a cheat”.

The testimony is part of an investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is looking into ties between Trump’s campaign officials and Russia. It is also looking into other ways Russia may have influenced the 2016 presidential polls. Russia is also accused of attempting to meddle in the 2016 Brexit referendum.

In December 2018, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison for multiple offences, including lying to the US Congress and for facilitating bribes to two women who allegedly had affairs with Trump. In August 2018, Cohen had pleaded guilty in a New York court to eight counts of tax crimes, making illegal campaign contributions and admitted that he made pre-election payments.

Cohen claimed that Trump’s longtime political advisor Roger Stone in July 2016 had told him that he had been speaking to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange and that there would be “massive dump” of emails that would affect Trump’s opponent, Hillary Clinton’s, presidential campaign.

He also claimed that Trump wanted him to lie about a property deal in Moscow amid his presidential campaign for 2016 elections. “At the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there’s no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing,” Cohen said. “In his way, he was telling me to lie.”

Cohen claimed that Trump had also asked him to pay off an adult film star, Stephanie Clifford, with whom Trump had had an affair, Reuters reported. Cohen submitted a copy of $130,000 wire transfer made during the closing days of the presidential campaign to Clifford, whose screen name is Stormy Daniels.

Cohen said while Trump has publicly courted white supremacists and bigots, “in private, he is even worse”. “He once asked me if I could name a country run by a black person that wasn’t a ‘shithole’,” he told the committee, according to BBC. “This was when Barack Obama was president of the United States.”

He claimed Trump had also said that black people would never vote for him “because they were too stupid”. Since becoming the president, Trump has become the worst version of himself, Cohen said, adding that Trump is “fundamentally disloyal”.

“Donald Trump is a man who ran for office to make his brand great, not to make our country great,” Cohen said. “He had no desire or intention to lead this nation – only to market himself and to build his wealth and power.”

Meanwhile, the US president, who is currently in Vietnam to attend a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, hit back at Cohen saying the lawyer was “lying in order to reduce his prison time”.","'Trump is racist, a conman and a cheat,' says his former lawyer in US congressional testimony - Scroll.in",Scroll.in,https://scroll.in/latest/914855/us-trump-is-racist-a-conman-and-a-cheat-says-his-former-lawyer-in-us-congressional-testimony

Without elaborating, Buffett said he and Bloomberg disagree on some things.

However, he added, ""I think that he knows how to run things. I think he's got the right goals for America. He understands people. He understands the market system. And he understands the problems of people"" not in the market.

Bloomberg, 77, is seen as a possible 2020 candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Bloomberg ran as an independent during his last successful campaign, when was re-elected mayor for a third term in 2009. He was a Republican in his first two terms. Bloomberg switched his party affiliation from independent to Democrat in October.

In a recent email to CNBC, top Bloomberg advisor Howard Wolfson hinted at how much his boss would look to invest into his own potential campaign.

""Mike spent more than $100 million in his last mayor's race. Last time I looked, NYC is a fraction of the size of the country as a whole,"" Wolfson said.

For years, Bloomberg had flirted with an independent run for president. But he now believes it would be a mistake. In a January statement, after former Starbucks chief Howard Schultz floated a possible third-party run, Bloomberg said, ""In 2020, the great likelihood is that an independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up re-electing the president. That's a risk I refused to run in 2016 and we can't afford to run it now.""

In Monday's interview, Buffett said he agrees with Bloomberg that a Schultz third-party would take votes away from any Democrat.

Making no evaluation of Schultz as a potential candidate, Buffett added, ""I think generally [that] third-party candidates, they're going to hurt one side or the other, and they're more likely to hurt the side that they actually favor, because they're closer to that view, and so they pull more people away that would otherwise go with the second-best with that view.""

""So I hope no third-party candidate runs,"" he added. ""I think third-party candidates can thwart, actually, the will of the people.""

Buffett was interviewed from the floor of the Berkshire-owned Nebraska Furniture Mart, following Saturday's release of his widely read annual shareholder letter.

Correction: This story was revised to correct when Bloomberg registered as a Democrat. It was last year.

237,Empty,2019-02-26T15:12:18Z,Somewhat,"For Democratic candidates now, the question is not so much whether to support a plan to make college more affordable, but what the right approach is for doing so. The details—whether there is an income cap for eligibility; whether the government covers tuition costs up front before grants; whether there are merit or GPA requirements—will determine who will benefit the most, and who will pay for such a plan.

A subtle tweak from Kamala Harris this past January encapsulates the coming debate over the scope of the party’s proposals. The senator from California, while making formal what many had suspected—that she would be running for president—tweaked her language in a slight but potentially significant way. She was supporting free college, but not just any free college: She was pushing for debt-free college. “I am running to declare education is a fundamental right,” she said, “and we will guarantee that right with universal pre-K and debt-free college.”

What was the difference? Free college is a catchall term for a range of college-affordability plans. There are “tuition-free” programs, where the government—or an institution—covers tuition but not the other expenses, such as books, housing, or food; then there are debt-free college plans, which aim to address all those other costs. Harris was getting specific; and she was doing so with the kind of free-college idea—debt-free—that equity advocates tend to prefer.

Oftentimes, tuition-free models are “last dollar,” which means that the government covers tuition after all other grant aid—such as Pell Grants, which are federal grants for low-income students—is applied. Oftentimes those grants cover the full tuition at community colleges, and students aren’t able to use that money for things like books, housing, or food. These are things that they may ultimately have to take on debt to afford. “Progressive candidates need to be talking about debt-free college instead of just free college, and going beyond tuition for low-income students,” Tiffany Jones, the director of higher-education policy at the Education Trust, an advocacy group for low-income students, told me.

Harris’s declaration was a departure from her language in 2016, when she first introduced a plan, toward the end of her Senate campaign, to make community college tuition-free for all, and four-year college tuition-free for families making less than $140,000 a year; it was even a departure from weeks prior, when she pushed for tuition-free college. Her development signaled, perhaps above all, how the Democratic Party has evolved on college affordability.

Read: Why is college in America so expensive?

The United States has a long history of college-access and -affordability policies—the first Morrill Act, the GI Bill, etc.—that did not provide equitable access or universal affordability, particularly for minorities. Advocates hope that a similar mistake won’t be made with a potential national free-college policy, and that debt-free college becomes the new gold standard.",The College Affordability Crisis Is Uniting the 2020 Democratic Candidates,Theatlantic.com,https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/02/2020-democrats-free-college/583585/
238,Empty,2019-02-27T09:11:35Z,"Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has won a second term at the helm of Africa's most populous state and top oil producer, the electoral commission chairman said on Wednesday, following an election marred by delays, logistical glitches and violence.","ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari comfortably won a second term at the helm of Africa’s largest economy, election authorities said on Wednesday, but his main rival planned a fraud challenge after a vote marred by delays and violence.

The 76-year-old former military ruler took 56 percent of votes against 41 for his closest challenger, businessman and former vice president Atiku Abubakar of the People’s Democratic Party.

Atiku, 72, said he would go to court to contest the results due to a litany of “premeditated malpractices”.

Buhari has a daunting to-do list, from reviving an economy still struggling to recover from a 2016 recession to quelling a decade-old Islamist insurgency in the northeast.

Some 327 people died in election-related violence since the campaign began in October, 67 of them during or after Saturday’s vote, according to the Situation Room monitoring group and security sources.

The violence included insurgents’ attacks to disrupt voting, and clashes between gangs and security forces around poll centres.

Buhari, of the All Progressive Congress party, said he would reform the economy, combat graft and improve security, and urged supporters not to gloat or “humiliate” the opposition.

“We will continue to engage all parties. Our government will remain inclusive and our doors will remain open,” he said while receiving his election certificate.

Atiku rejected the outcome, saying one obvious red flag was that states in the northeast ravaged by insurgents’ attacks generated much higher voter turnouts than peaceful states.

“It is clear that there were manifest and premeditated malpractices in many states which negate the results announced,” he said.

That presaged a legal battle in a terrain where Nigeria’s most senior judge was controversially suspended by Buhari last month after allegations he breached asset declaration rules.

The move brought criticism that the government was meddling with judicial independence.

OVERTURNING RESULTS “VERY UNLIKELY”

The opposition’s fraud accusations have heightened tensions in the region’s most populous nation and biggest oil producer where six decades of independence have seen long periods of military rule, coups and secessionist wars.

But the controversy could also just peter out, as happened recently after a presidential vote in Democratic Republic of Congo. “A legal challenge is very unlikely to overturn the official result,” said John Ashbourne, economist at Capital Economics in London, of the Nigerian election.

The president garnered 15.2 million votes to Atiku’s 11.3 million, on turnout of just 35.6 percent, the electoral commission said.

The vote was delayed by a week after the commission was unable to get ballots and results sheets to all areas.

U.S. observers said that probably reduced turnout.

Buhari campaigned on pledges to fight corruption and overhaul Nigeria’s creaking road and rail network.

Analysts said he may find it easier to pass policies after Bukola Saraki, the former Senate president, lost his senatorial seat in local elections also held on Saturday.

Saraki nominally controlled parliament under the ruling party banner, but bitter disputes with the presidency saw the lawmaker often working to frustrate bills and budgets proposed by Buhari. He decamped to the opposition last year.

“Buhari is likely to get a friendlier Senate president, which could mean more efficient executive-legislative coordination,” said Amaka Anku, Africa director at Eurasia Group.

Buhari also has to deal with the threat from militants in the oil-rich southern Niger Delta region. The Niger Delta Avengers, whose attacks in 2016 pushed the economy into its first recession in 25 years, want their area to get a greater share of oil revenue it produces and had backed Atiku.

The Avengers had warned on Feb. 14 that they would cripple the economy if Buhari was re-elected. The group has not carried out any substantial attacks since January 2017.

“We would have to see if the Avengers will act on their threat. However, these militants are up for sale, so as long as they are granted their privileges they may not be a problem,” said Malte Liewerscheidt, West Africa analyst at Teneo.","Buhari re-elected as Nigerian president, Atiku vows legal challenge",Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-election-idUSKCN1QG11U

It’s home not just to the wave of IT offshoring firms of the 1990s and early 2000s, but also to some of the most interesting unicorn tech startups in the world, including Freshworks, Paytm, Oyo and of course Flipkart, which sold to Walmart last year for $16 billion.

India though is also at something of an economic crossroads. Unlike China, which as we discussed yesterday faces a conflict between open entrepreneurship and strict party control in its next stage of development, India must build up its indigenous startups while also opening up to the global economy.

That economic balancing act will be tough. As James Crabtree, a long-time writer of the Financial Times based in Mumbai, argues in his book The Billionaire Raj, India faces a triple threat of “inequality and the new super-rich, crony capitalism, and the travails of the industrial economy” as it seeks to move the country into middle-income status.

You’re reading the Extra Crunch Daily. Like this newsletter? Subscribe for free to follow all of our discussions and debates.

Crabtree, who built up access among India’s traditional business elite over many years, sees a nation that is starving for more government capacity. India has transitioned in a few short decades from a moribund economy languishing under a sclerotic and byzantine bureaucratic model (sometimes referred to as the “license raj”) into an increasingly open and competitive market for goods and services.

Yet, success outside of a scant few industries — namely IT services — has been undergirded by political access and the trading of favors. Crabtree chronicles a whole crop of entrepreneurs from across the country in industries as far afield as mining to liquor to aircraft to show the constant intermixing of Indian business and Indian politics.

That crony capitalism is at the heart of what he dubs today’s “billionaire raj” — a government that isn’t for the ultra-rich so much as it lacks any capacity whatsoever to stand up to its worst excesses and corruption. The book is one part travelogue, one part analysis, and one part biographical bookshelf that together paint a complicated portrait of India’s growth ambitions and challenges to scale.

Given where India’s fortunes have been made the past few decades, the book mostly ignores the tech industry, save for fleeting mentions scattered about. But I asked Crabtree in an interview last week where he saw the country headed, and how technology might underpin that.

“People thought that India was going to become the next hot market for Silicon Valley tech money after China, but it doesn’t look like that will be the case,” he explained. Unlike China, which created friction in market entry for foreign tech companies, India has been reasonably open. “The biggest search engine in India is Google, the biggest social network is Facebook,” he noted. “They don’t make much money in India, but they have spectacular user growth.”

“When I lived in Mumbai, there was a big tech investment wave in the after wave of the Alibaba IPO,” he explained. “There were these great hopes that India would follow the sort of hockey stick growth” seen in China. Yet, the country’s demographics don’t back that up. “India has a tiny middle class — 10-20 million” using a reasonable definition of the term “middle class.” That group is simply not large enough to support the valuation dreams underpinning some of India’s most-discussed unicorns. “Growing users is really easy, but growing revenues is just much more challenging,” he said.

The challenge ahead for India is that a form of economic nationalism is increasingly popular in Delhi. We have covered a bit of this change around data localization / sovereignty, but it is certainly much wider than those policies. “I think there is a slow but steady trend toward closure that is partly to do with India’s domestic politics” and partly due to international climate, Crabtree explained. The thinking is that, “China has produced Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu [… but] India hasn’t produced any major global stars yet.”

Fueling that rift is a sense that foreign tech giants “don’t pay much in the way of tax, they are not Indian companies” and that they “haven’t behaved particularly well.” Crabtree was referring specifically to Facebook’s Free Basics program, which became deeply controversial in the country, although those feelings are not limited to just Facebook.

India has a massive election coming up in just a few weeks, which will decide whether current Indian prime minister Narendra Modi stays in power. Beyond just policy, Crabtree sees a major challenge for all foreign tech companies, but particularly those operating social networks. “The stakes are very high for how social media manages the stresses and strains of a competitive and potentially nasty Indian political campaign,” he said. “If they are blamed for something that went wrong… this would be immensely damaging.”

India has the potential to be the single largest democratic free market economy in the world. But it needs to simultaneously cut down on its corruption, create jobs for millions of new entrants to the labor economy every year, stand up a new generation of digital-first behemoths, all the while balancing the needs of an incredibly diverse and cacophonous democracy buffeted by global markets and tastes. That’s ultimately a tall order, but if India wants to migrate from a “billionaire raj” to an “entrepreneur raj,” it will have to do all of that — at once.

Talking about borders: Talent-friendly immigration driving tech north of the border

Written by Arman Tabatabai

Yesterday, we talked about the growing difficulty of the H-1B visa application and approval process in the US, and how it threatens America’s long-term entrepreneurial edge. In a prime example of the connection between immigration policy and technology leadership — the FT put out a deep-dive analysis on the rapidly growing Toronto tech and startup scene, with much of the expansion attributable to Canada’s talent-friendly immigration policies.

Canada applies the “give grads a visa with their diploma” approach many have preached for in the US, providing multi-year work visas to foreign students upon graduation. And while the US continues to make the individual application process more difficult, Canada has streamlined its process. Applications for highly-skilled workers, as well as their families, are processed within just a couple weeks.

While there are clearly several intertwined factors behind the growth of Toronto as a tech hub, talent is certainly one of them, with the city having added nearly 100,000 jobs in a five-year period. Toronto offers a case-in-point precedent of how cities can use immigration to gain a technological edge, and why the United States’ misdirected crackdown is undermining its own.

Intel cancels agreement with China chipmaker in fight for next generation chip dominance

Written by Arman Tabatabai

Intel continues to shift its strategy as it tries to improve its position for next-generation chip leadership. At the MWC conference in Barcelona, Intel announced that it was terminating a multi-year partnership with one of China’s premier state-backed mobile chipmakers, Unisoc. As part of the original agreement announced roughly a year ago‚ Intel would share its new 5G modem chips with Unisoc to help Intel increase its lagging market share in China, while providing Unisoc technological know-how needed for it to compete with more-advanced competitor offerings.

Like many breakups, the two sides are saying the decision was mutual and not a result of the political tension between the US and Chinese governments. However, the Nikkei Asian Review reports that insiders say the US’ recent harsh tone with Chinese tech and semiconductor companies definitely played a role in the decision.

As we discussed yesterday, Intel has a lot of catching up to do after years of complacency and will now have to find a different avenue to make up ground in the Chinese market. Unisoc is also certainly feeling the pain of the lost knowledge transfer, as market share can disappear quickly in a highly competitive industry where IP is often the secret sauce. The cancellation of what seemed to be a mutually beneficial deal reinforces the fact that the fight for next-generation semiconductor dominance is just as much political as it is financial, if not more so.

Pavel Alpeyev at Bloomberg has a deep-dive highlighting the rapid expansion of Japanese corporate venture capital. The trend is permeating the country’s largest companies across all industries, with the number of Japanese corporate venture arms increasing by more than 8x since 2015. The Japanese market has traditionally been viewed as an unfriendly environment for startups, but the growing availability of capital and support from Japan’s all-powerful incumbent corporations makes building a company seem more feasible. ~ Written by Arman Tabatabai

Near Baghouz (Syria) (AFP) - US-backed forces evacuated over 40 truckloads of people from the Islamic State group's last Syria redoubt on Monday, as they sought to clear out civilians before a final push to crush the jihadists.

The Syrian Democratic Forces has slowed down its offensive on the final pocket due to the presence of civilians, with just a scrap of the IS ""caliphate"" remaining from a territory that once spanned Syria and Iraq.

An AFP correspondent saw at least 46 trucks crammed with men, women and children approaching an SDF outpost, 20 kilometres (12 miles) north of the jihadist bastion.

One vehicle was packed with women clad in black and men who covered their faces. Wounded people were also among the latest evacuees.

Holdout IS fighters and civilians, mostly relatives of jihadists, are trapped inside less than half a square kilometre in the village of Baghouz near the Iraqi border.

The Kurdish-led SDF evacuated nearly 5,000 men, women and children from the jihadist redoubt on Wednesday and Friday, but none over the weekend.

Earlier on Monday, SDF spokesman Mustefa Bali, said thousands remained inside the IS pocket.

""According to what we heard from those who have left, there are nearly 5,000 people still inside,"" Bali told AFP.

At the SDF screening point outside the village, SDF fighters expressed hopes Monday's arrivals would be the last.

""We want it to be over,"" one of them, 29-year-old Mazloum, told AFP.

""Every day we say today is the day but we hope it will all end today and not tomorrow,"" he said.

- 'Potent threat' -

Kurdish foreign affairs official Abdel Karim Omar said the SDF would announce the end of the IS proto-state ""in the next few days"".

""But this does not mean that we have eliminated terrorism, which must be eradicated at the roots,"" he said.

Beyond Baghouz, IS still has thousands of fighters and sleeper cells across several countries.

In Syria, it retains a presence in the vast Badia desert, and the jihadists have claimed deadly attacks in SDF-held territory.

Iraq's President Barham Saleh warned Monday the jihadist threat remains high, despite gains made against IS over the past year.

""We've seen in the past that the mission is yet to be accomplished,"" Saleh said in a Paris speech, evoking the infamous 2003 Iraq claim by former US president George W. Bush.

""You have many, many extremists in many pockets in Syria, causing a potent threat to Syria, Iraq and the Western world,"" he said.

- Secret transfers -

Thousands of suspected IS fighters have attempted to blend in with civilians fleeing the crumbling ""caliphate"".

According to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, around 46,000 people, including thousands of jihadists, have streamed out of the Baghouz pocket since early December.

The SDF screens those exiting at an outpost outside the village to weed out potential IS fighters.

After being vetted, women, children, and men not suspected of belonging to the extremist group are transported north to the Kurdish-run camp of Al-Hol, while suspected jihadists are sent to SDF-held detention centres.

""The international community is not currently taking responsibility towards the large number of people leaving the last IS pocket, especially children,"" said Omar, describing Al-Hol as overwhelmed by the arrivals.

At least 78 people, mostly children, have died on the way to the camp or shortly after arriving in recent weeks, according to the International Rescue Committee.

The Observatory on Monday said 1,400 people, mainly IS relatives, were secretly transported from orchards on the outskirts of Baghouz to neighbouring Iraq during the past 24 hours.

Kurdish foreign affairs official did not confirm the transfer, but denied the SDF was responsible.

""In principle, we do not hand over any person passing through our territories to Iraqi authorities or any other party,"" Omar said.

Such transfers can only happen if they were trucked from Baghouz ""by another party"", he explained, without specifying.

Baghdad on Sunday said the SDF have transferred 280 Iraqi nationals accused of fighting alongside IS to Iraqi authorities.

The Iraqi president said Monday his country's courts would prosecute 13 suspected French jihadists, who were turned over to Iraq after being captured by the SDF.",Syria force carries out major evacuation from last IS holdout,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/syria-force-carries-major-evacuation-last-holdout-162952545.html
241,Empty,2019-02-26T15:03:38Z,The New York City mayor addressed 40 people at a union hall—and stepped on Bernie Sanders’s toes.,"This time around, it’s Bernie Sanders he’s rebuffing. In 2018, he asked Sanders to administer the oath of office for his second term and repeatedly gushed about him, and even attended a gathering of the Sanders Institute last November in Burlington, Vermont. His response to Sanders announcing his second run last week: scrambling a trip of his own to Sioux City and Des Moines.

Read: The equalizer—Bill de Blasio vs. inequality

De Blasio could have been prepping to introduce Sanders as a favorite son in Brooklyn on Saturday for what will be the kickoff rally of the second campaign, not far from where the senator grew up and near the neighborhood the mayor used to represent on the city council. The senator’s campaign probably would have been open to that and to the buzz it would have produced about the strength of his 2020 campaign. Or he could be looking to horse-trade his endorsement with one of the many other candidates seeking to prove their own progressive credentials, and build up his power that way.

Instead, de Blasio ducked behind the doorway, just out of sight, until he could make his entrance in the union hall where those 40 people had come to see him on Sunday afternoon. He’d spent the morning doing a photo-op meeting with Tom Vilsack, the former governor and part-time Democratic gatekeeper and elder statesman, and another with Des Moines Mayor Frank Cownie, who later pointed out that New York City is bigger than 41 states and that the mayor comes with an “everyday perspective” of how government affects people’s lives.

Reihan Salam: Bill de Blasio and Gavin Newsom may give restrictionism new life

He waited for his big introduction, piping up “I’m ready!” at one point, and then walked in from the back of the room.

“It’s a very personal reality,” de Blasio explained to reporters about his decision to come to Iowa on Saturday. He didn’t have a timetable for deciding whether he would run, he added on Sunday. He has to talk to his family.

He urged the people who came to the event hosted by the Asian & Latino PAC to invest in wind power (there are turbines all over the state), told them to stop talking about Donald Trump (most Democrats running haven’t been mentioning the president much at all), and recommended that Democrats reach out to farmers (other Democratic presidential hopefuls have been doing events at farms).

It was a New Yorker’s view of what’s happening in Iowa and the rest of the country, and his insistent sense that he knows what to do about it from the people he’s talking to more than a thousand miles away.

He drew the biggest applause when he said Democrats need to get smarter about being bolder, for the sake of their politics and their values. Tax the rich, he said. Don’t let Republicans make Democrats out as the party of the elites.

Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari won a second term to lead the most populous country in Africa, the country's elections authority said Wednesday, while his main opponent promised to challenge the result in court.

Buhari defeated Atiku Abubakar, a former vice president and businessman, by about 4 million votes.

Turnout was nearly 35 percent of Nigeria's 82 million registered voters, the electoral commission said.

""I thank the millions of Nigerians who voted to re-elect me as your president for the next four years,"" Buhari said in a statement. ""I am deeply humbled and profoundly grateful to you for judging me worthy of continuing to serve you and for your peaceful conduct.""

Just hours before it was set to begin on Feb. 16, the electoral authority delayed the vote by a week, citing logistical challenges. Turnout likely fell after many Nigerians took lengthy bus rides across the country to vote in their hometowns, but could not afford to return the following weekend.

On Wednesday, Abubakar called the election result a ""sham"" and said he would challenge it in court. He accused soldiers in some Nigerian states of turning ""their guns on the very citizens they were meant to protect."" He also said it was a ""statistical impossibility"" that there was higher voter turnout in areas ""ravaged by the war"" against terrorist groups, like Boko Haram, and there were voting disruptions in his party's strongholds.

Abubakar's party, the People's Democratic Party (PDP), called for fresh elections in four states.

""I think it's very unlikely that the election may be repeated, but it depends on the courts,"" political analyst and editor-in-chief Mannir Dan-Ali of Nigeria's Daily Trust newspaper told NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton. ""But it's sometimes long drawn, it can take quite a while before the whole challenge is seen through.""

At least 53 people have died in election-related violence, according to a report by SBM Intelligence and cited by The Associated Press. Buhari said the ""elections were relatively peaceful,"" but that ""troublemakers in a handful of states attempted to disrupt an otherwise orderly process"" and he was ""very sad at the grievous loss of lives.""

In his victory statement, Buhari said his priorities for his next term would be to intensify efforts to bolster Nigeria's security, restructure the economy from its dependence on oil and fight corruption.

With a population of more than 200 million, Nigeria is Africa's most populous country and largest economy, but it remains heavily dependent on oil revenues. ""The country is still emerging from a recession and needs to jump-start the economy,"" Quist-Arcton reports from Abuja.

Buhari, 76, was first elected in 2015 on an anti-corruption platform. He previously ruled the country as a military strongman in the 1980s before re-emerging in politics, saying he embraced democratic values.

Despite Buhari's attention to corruption, Nigeria continued to rank high in perceptions of corruption in the last few years, according tracking group Transparency International's 2018 index. The group said Buhari ""took a number of positive steps in the past three years,"" but ""these efforts have clearly not yielded the desired results. At least, not yet.""

The other pressing issue for Buhari to address is the ongoing violence in the country's northeast connected to the Boko Haram insurgency and conflicts between herders and farmers in central Nigeria.

By Ginger Gibson and James Oliphant

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said this week he was ""very close"" to deciding whether to make a 2020 White House bid and will run only if he thinks he can win the Democratic Party's nomination.

He is not alone in questioning if he is the man for the moment.

The clamor for Biden to join the pack seeking to challenge Republican President Donald Trump has quieted as the Democratic field has grown more crowded and diverse, according to interviews with more than two dozen strategists, activists, party organizers and voters.

Opinion polls show Biden, a former U.S. senator from Delaware who served two terms as former President Barack Obama's vice president, remains popular. But the Democratic Party may no longer need him in order to be competitive against Trump.

""I love Joe Biden. He's a great guy and a great politician,"" said Jerry Shriner, a Democratic National Committee member from Idaho. ""I wish he were the president right now. But I'm not sure I wish he is president in 2021.""

Democrats are in the early stages of an internal debate about how best to challenge Trump in next year's presidential election, weighing factors like electability, ideology and identity.

The strength of the field - expected to include at least six sitting U.S. senators, plus several current or former governors, U.S. House of Representatives members and a former Cabinet secretary - is a factor in Biden's calculations, those close to him say.

He will be more likely to remain on the sidelines if he feels a strong candidate capable of beating Trump is emerging.

But a source close to Biden said: ""If I had to guess, he's probably going to do it.""

Biden associates have held discussions with potential staffers and supporters who could serve political strategy, grassroots organizing and digital campaign roles, according to two sources. One source said those conversations were necessary to quickly ramp up a formal campaign operation should Biden decide to run.

Some party activists say, however, that Biden has not reached out to broad donor networks to gauge the level of monetary support he could expect.

Biden, who mounted failed presidential campaigns in 1998 and 2008, said at an event in Delaware on Tuesday that he did not want a third bid to be ""a fool's errand.""

""What I don’t want to do is take people’s time, effort and commitment without there being a clear shot I could be the nominee,"" he said. ""I think I can.""

'TOO OLD'

Biden chose not to run in 2016 when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was widely considered the heavy favorite for the Democratic nomination. Some political analysts have since speculated he could have won industrial battleground states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin that proved crucial to Trump's surprise victory.

Biden's high name recognition among Democratic voters means he likely can afford to wait longer than lesser-known candidates to enter the 2020 race. But even that comes with a risk.

""The longer he waits, the more people are going to start to want to follow some of the new and younger voices they're hearing,"" said Bret Niles, the Democratic Party chairman in Linn County, Iowa.

Biden's age, ideology and record already are drawing scrutiny. If elected, he would be 78 when he was sworn in.

""Joe Biden is too old,"" said Mary Donough, 60, a Democrat from Des Moines, Iowa, who plans to participate in her state's crucial nominating caucus next year and wants a younger candidate to challenge Trump.

""There is just more energy there,"" she said.

Biden's backers will argue his age represents experience, said a former aide who asked to speak on background in order to explain internal talking points.

""Voters look at Donald Trump and they look at what we’re missing, which is someone who understands the institution, someone who is an adult, someone who is seasoned, someone who respects the institutions,"" the former aide said.

If Biden does run, the chair of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel, said on Thursday that Trump and the Republican Party would attack his work as vice president under Obama.

“Go ahead and run,” McDaniel told the Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Maryland. “Run on your record of stagnant wages, of jobs leaving this country, of manufacturing jobs fleeing United States of America, of bad trade deals, of bad foreign policy.","As Biden weighs 2020 bid, Democrats ask: 'Does he meet the moment?'",Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/biden-weighs-2020-bid-democrats-ask-does-meet-110250067.html
244,Empty,2019-02-27T04:30:03Z,Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari was declared the clear winner of a second term in Africa's largest democracy Wednesday.,"(ABUJA, Nigeria) — Nigeria’s president was declared the clear winner of a second term in Africa’s largest democracy early Wednesday, after a campaign in which he urged voters to give him another chance to tackle gaping corruption, widespread insecurity and an economy limping back from a rare recession.

While many frustrated Nigerians had said they wanted to give someone new a try, President Muhammadu Buhari , a former military dictator, profited from his upright reputation in an oil-rich nation weary of politicians enriching themselves instead of the people.

Speaking shortly after the announcement of the official results and as many Nigerians awakened to the morning prayer, Buhari told colleagues that he was “deeply humbled” by the win. He also said he regretted the loss of dozens of lives in election-related violence.

Supporters began dancing in the streets of the capital, Abuja, on Tuesday night as vote counting stretched his lead from the weekend election to nearly 4 million votes over top opposition challenger Atiku Abubakar, a billionaire former vice president who made sweeping campaign promises to “make Nigeria work again.”

Buhari received 15.1 million votes, or 55 percent, the electoral commission said in making its official declaration. Abubakar received 11.2 million, or 41 percent. The average national turnout was 35.6 percent, continuing a downward trend.

In a failed last-ditch effort to stop the official declaration, Abubakar’s party claimed that election data had been manipulated and demanded fresh elections in four of Nigeria’s 36 states.

Buhari’s party rejected the accusations. It also called on Abubakar, who hasn’t made a public appearance since Saturday’s election, to accept his loss gracefully and concede. “Let this nation move forward,” campaign spokesman Babatunde Fashola said.

“There’s no opposition that will roll over and play dead. Anybody that lost an election will always complain,” Hameed Ali, the ruling party agent attending the vote declaration, told reporters.

The election, once described as too close to call, suffered from a surprise weeklong postponement and significant delays in the opening of polling stations. While election observers called the process generally peaceful, at least 53 people were killed in an attack claimed by the Islamic State West Africa Province extremist group and other violence, analysis unit SBM Intelligence said.

It remained to be seen whether Abubakar will follow through on pledges to accept a loss, or challenge the results. A former U.S. ambassador to Nigeria, John Campbell, said the troubled election had given the candidates grounds to go to the courts. That route could take months.

Many Nigerians have prayed for peace. They were surprised in 2015 when President Goodluck Jonathan took the unprecedented step of conceding to Buhari before official results were announced. It was the first defeat of an incumbent president by the opposition in the country’s history.

“Jonathan set the benchmark on how electoral outcomes should be handled,” Chris Kwaja, a senior adviser to the United States Institute of Peace, a U.S. government-backed institution promoting conflict resolution worldwide, told The Associated Press. “Accept defeat in the spirit of sportsmanship. This is a critical vehicle for democratic consolidation.”

Nigerians were praised for their patience and resilience in this bumpy vote.

In the GOP-majority Senate, three Republicans already back the measure, just …","(Bloomberg) -- Senate Republicans must now decide whether to stop President Donald Trump from using an emergency declaration to pay for his border wall, and support from just four GOP members might be enough to send him a measure blocking his plan.

But Trump has promised to issue his first veto if a resolution of disapproval reaches his desk, and Congress appears far short of the votes for an override.

The Democratic-controlled House voted 245-182 Tuesday for a resolution designed to stop Trump from taking billions from other parts of the federal budget to build his promised wall. In the GOP-majority Senate, three Republicans already back the measure, just one short of the number needed to adopt it if the 47 Democratic caucus members stick together. Neither chamber is close to the two-thirds majority needed for an override.

By law, the Senate will have 18 calendar days to consider the House measure, H.J.Res. 46, or act on its own version.

The issues underpinning the emergency declaration likely will feature prominently in the 2020 elections -- with Trump asserting Democrats don’t want to secure the U.S. border with Mexico, and Democrats saying the president is wasting money on an ineffective and purely symbolic tool to keep undocumented immigrants out of the U.S.

The resolution also highlights a power struggle between Congress and the White House over how much control the legislative branch should cede to the executive branch.

Diverting Funds

Republicans leaders defended Trump’s emergency declaration to redirect Defense Department funds without congressional approval as necessary to defend the southern border. House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California called the resolution a “purely political statement.”

“Not only does the president have the legal authority to declare this national emergency under two federal statutes, the move is far from unprecedented,” McCarthy said in a statement, noting 31 national emergencies that are still in effect.

Presidents have issued almost 60 declarations since the National Emergencies Act was enacted by Congress in 1976. The law requires Congress to review the declaration as a check on executive power, and Senate adoption of the House resolution would be the first time Congress has voted to end an emergency declaration.

There has been bipartisan unease with Trump’s move to shift money outside of the normal congressional process to fund a border wall he promised supporters during the 2016 campaign.

Setting Precedent

Republican Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky was one of 13 House Republicans who joined Democrats in backing the resolution.

He said he supports Trump and agrees with the need for a border barrier, but supported the resolution “in order to be consistent in preserving the constitutional structure of our republic.” Massie and other Republicans have warned about the precedent set by Trump’s declaration, which future presidents could use to redirect government funds to their preferred policy goals.

“There is a crisis at our border, but it’s not an emergency when Congress doesn’t spend money how the President wants,” Massie said on Twitter. “The President’s constitutional remedy is to veto spending bills that aren’t suitable to him, yet he has chosen to sign many bills that did not fund the wall.”

Trump signed the first spending bill of his presidency last year, even though he complained that Republican majorities in both chambers didn’t appropriate enough for the wall. He then surprised GOP leaders in December by rejecting a Republican spending bill that included $1.3 billion for a border barrier, which caused the 35-day lapse in government funding that forced some federal agencies -- including the Department of Homeland Security -- to close.

That impasse was resolved when Trump agreed to sign a bipartisan spending bill that provided the $1.4 billion for physical barriers on the border, including 55 miles of new construction. At the same time, he signed an emergency declaration to shift $3.5 billion from military construction accounts to the border wall.

Trump is also attempting to tap $600 million from the Treasury asset forfeiture fund, and $2.5 billion from a Defense Department anti-drug program -- moves that don’t rely on the emergency order.",Republican Senators’ Choice: Back or Oppose Trump on Border Emergency,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/house-votes-block-trump-apos-233428611.html

“I don’t think any of them have,” the California Democrat told the magazine.

She had it wrong, though: The committee’s nine Democratic members took a combined $198,000 from fossil fuel industry political action committees connected to oil, gas, mining and utilities in the 2018 midterm elections, as HuffPost previously reported. The bulk of that sum, $117,000, went to Rep. Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.), making up 6 percent of all his contributions, according to the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics.

The committee, created after the Democratic Party won a majority in the House of Representatives last year, aims to promote policies to combat climate change. No Republicans have opted to serve on it. Activists believe members should refuse fossil fuel money as a sign of their independence from the industry that has attempted to stall climate action while contributing greatly to the problem.

“This is about [finding] people who care very much about the issue and know very much about the issue,” Pelosi said of the panel.

Some committee members have made efforts to distance themselves from fossil fuel companies. Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.) signed a pledge promising not to take money from those or any corporate PACs, with others planning to follow suit. Rep. Kathy Castor (D-Fla.) divested up to $100,000 worth of shares of a mutual fund with fossil fuel utility holdings in January after a watchdog group called her out.

“We’re thinking big on this,” Pelosi said. “We’re not holding [it against] somebody if she got a utility contribution within her lifetime.”

She added: “I mean, my daughter is really on everybody’s case about taking contributions, so I know the program. But I just want the best possible people.”

According to Castor, the committee will work “in the spirit of the Green New Deal,” progressive Democrats’ proposal to move to 100 percent renewable energy over a decade with a jobs guarantee.

It's time to wake up and smell the coffee.

Since late January, Twitter has suspended several accounts that pretend to support Howard Schultz's political ambitions but are actually pushing other agendas. On Thursday, Twitter suspended three more accounts for violating its policies.

Schultz hasn't officially announced he's running for president, but the businessman has said he's considering an independent run for the White House. Since his announcement in late January, several accounts pretending to support the former coffee shop executive have popped up on Twitter.

On Thursday, Twitter suspended the accounts @GaysForSchultz, @PresSchultz2020, and @HowardJSchultz. The @HowardJSchultz account described itself as ""Millennials for Schultz."" Before they were suspended, all three accounts were posting content from the ""alt-right,"" a loosely knit movement of white nationalists and neo-Nazis.



The @GaysForSchultz account responded to tweets about Ruth Bader Ginsburg conspiracy theories, while the @PresSchultz2020 account posted anti-Muslim content alongside posts supporting Schultz's presidential ambitions.



The three accounts violated Twitter's ""Fake Accounts"" policy, according to a person familiar with the suspensions. While parody accounts of Schultz are still on Twitter, these three accounts were considered ""fake and misleading.""

Schultz didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Creating fake social-media profiles tied to politics isn't new. During the 2016 US presidential election, Russian operatives made fan pages on Facebook and accounts on Twitter supporting third-party candidates, such as Jill Stein, with the intention of pulling votes away from Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate.

In late January, Twitter suspended the accounts @Blacks4Schultz and @GOP4Schultz, the former for operating multiple accounts. The @Blacks4Schultz account had a stock-photo image of an African-American man with ""Howard"" edited onto his shirt.

The most prominent account was ""@Women_4_Schultz,"" an account created by Jacob Wohl, a conservative activist who bragged to USA Today about his plans to create fraudulent Twitter profiles and promote candidates considered less likely to defeat President Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election.



Wohl's fake accounts, along with his own Twitter profile, were suspended last week for violating the social network's policies, ""specifically creating and operating fake accounts,"" a Twitter representative said.



The strategy was taken right out of Russia's disinformation playbook, by setting up fake accounts to allege support for candidates who have a weaker shot at the White House, Ben Nimmo, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's digital forensic research lab, said.

The other suspended Schultz accounts aren't tied to Wohl, according to a person familiar with the situation.

Some accounts pretending to support Schultz are still active on Twitter. The social network allows parody profiles as long as they don't violate Twitter's rules.



That could be why Wohl's @Women_4_Schultz account was suspended while @WomenForSchultz, a parody of former Trump attorney Michael Cohen's ""Women for Cohen"" account, still remains.

Social networks are gearing up for a flood of disinformation as the 2020 US presidential election draws closer.



It proved to be an effective tool for Russian operatives in 2016, and US intelligence officials now consider disinformation a global threat.



The slow drip of Schultz accounts getting suspended is just a small example of the flood of disinformation social networks are expecting over the next year.

""One of the main worries after the Russian operation was exposed was that users in America would copy it,"" Nimmo said. ""We've already seen reported attempts in the Alabama special Senate election, targeting potential Republican voters. Now it looks like we're seeing similar activity targeting Democrats. It's a bad sign before 2020.""

A record 14 candidates are on the ballot.

Most of the candidates announced they were running after two-term Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced in September that he wouldn’t seek a third term. The field includes eight people of color and ten who have never held elected office.

Here’s what you need to know about Tuesday’s race:

In this May 9, 2018 file photo, former Chicago Police Board President Lori Lightfoot announces her bid for mayor of Chicago at the Hyatt Regency Chicago. (Photo: Abel Uribe, AP)

1) Tuesday’s vote is likely just the beginning.

Under Chicago’s election rules, if no candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote, the top two vote-getters will face off in an April 2 runoff.

No candidate is polling at more than 14 percent, according to a survey published Sunday by 270 Strategies. Six candidates were within the poll’s margin of error of 3.7 percent of finishing in the top two.

If the race is as close as polling suggests, it could take the Chicago Board of Election some time to sort out winners and losers.

In this Feb. 8, 2019 file photo, Bill Daley speaks during a news conference in Chicago. (Photo: Teresa Crawford, AP)

2) At least six candidates appear to have a legitimate shot.

The top three candidates – former federal prosecutor Lori Lightfoot, former U.S. Commerce Secretary Bill Daley and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle – finished within less than half a percentage point in the 270 Strategies Poll.

Lightfoot, who served as president of the Chicago Police Board and the city’s Police Accountability Task Force, has cast herself as a reformer and independent who will take on a culture of corruption in city hall.

Daley, who was commerce secretary under President Bill Clinton, chief of staff under President Barack Obama and a top executive at JP Morgan, says his high-level experience in government and business makes him the ideal candidate to confront the city’s financial problems. Chicago has $28 billion in unmet pension obligations. Daley is the son of the late Mayor Richard J. Daley and brother of former Mayor Richard M. Daley.

Preckwinkle has the backing of the powerful Chicago Teachers Union. She’s also the president of the county’s Democratic party, giving her a strong base of support.

Three other candidates – Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza, former Chicago school board president Gery Chico, and businessman Willie Wilson – are within striking distance of the frontrunners, according to the 270 Strategies poll.

Mendoza, who the poll shows at 10 percent, has focused largely on reducing violent crime, checking property taxes and improving schools.

Gery Chico, at 9 percent, has served in a variety of high-level city positions and ran a lucrative law practice that has represented clients doing business with Chicago. He was chief of staff to former Mayor Richard M. Daley, head of the city’s school board and president of Chicago’s park district.

Willie Wilson, the son of a Louisiana sharecropper, grew up in poverty and had only a seventh-grade education, but went on to own several McDonald’s franchises and found a medical supplies company. Wilson, at 9 percent, has cast himself as a pro-business candidate who would work reduce taxes for city residents and corporations.

3) Corruption is casting a shadow over race.

Chicago is no stranger to corruption. More than 30 city aldermen have been convicted of political corruption since 1973.

But the political scandal unveiled by federal prosecutors in January has cast a shadow over Tuesday’s mayoral election.

Authorities say Democratic Alderman Ed Burke, a 50-year veteran of the City Council and chairman of its powerful finance committee, tried to shake down officials of a company that operates dozens of Burger King franchises in Illinois.

Four of the most competitive candidates in the race – Preckwinkle, Mendoza, Chico and Daley – have all drawn scrutiny for longstanding ties to Burke. They've all sought to distance themselves from the longtime power broker.

Preckwinkle received more than $100,000 from a Burke-sponsored fundraiser last year. Mendoza was married at Burke’s home. Burke endorsed Chico, who worked as an aide to the alderman 30 years ago. Daley's family has received about $30,000 in political donations from Burke over decades.

4) Rahm opts not to try for third term.

Emanuel amassed more than $10 million campaign contributions for this election, but would have faced a difficult campaign had he decided to seek a third term.

Emanuel entered office in 2011 with one of the most impressive political resumes of any big-city mayor: He was a top adviser to President Bill Clinton, served three terms in Congress, chaired the House Democratic Caucus and became President Barack Obama’s first White House chief of staff.

As mayor, he boasted of record high school graduation rates in the city last year, significant investment in the Chicago Transit Authority, and success recruiting several large corporations to relocate to the city.

But he saw his standing in the city’s sizable African-American community sink following the court-ordered release of chilling police video that showed a white officer, Jason Van Dyke, firing 16 shots at a black teen, Laquan McDonald, on a city street.

Van Dyke was convicted of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery. He was sentenced last month to 81 months in prison.

5) The winner could make history.

Lightfoot, Preckwinkle or Amara Enyia would be Chicago’s first black female mayor. Lightfoot would be the city's first openly gay mayor. Mendoza or Chico would be the city's first Latino mayor.

A win by Daley would continue the dynasty of one of the nation's most powerful political families. Bill Daley’s father, Richard J. Daley, was mayor of Chicago for 21 years, and his older brother, Richard M. Daley, spent 22 years as mayor.

In explosive public testimony before Congress, Donald Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen cast the president as a “racist” and a “conman” who engaged in criminal activity after taking office as president to cover up an illegal hush money payment to an adult film actor.

Appearing before the House oversight committee on Wednesday, Cohen became the first Trump associate to allege that Trump had prior knowledge that his longtime adviser, Roger Stone, was communicating with WikiLeaks during the 2016 election regarding the release of hacked Democratic Party emails.

He also said Trump was aware of the infamous Trump Tower meeting between members of his presidential campaign, including his son Donald Trump Jr, and a Russian lawyer with ties to the Kremlin, which was arranged under the pretense of receiving damaging information about Hillary Clinton.

Cohen’s testimony marked a rare opportunity for millions of Americans to bear witness to the account of a central player in multiple investigations ensnaring the president and his inner circle. Cohen acted for more than a decade as the president’s fixer – a role in which he became intimately familiar with both Trump’s personal and professional affairs.

It highlighted how the US president faces legal and political peril on at least two fronts – the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US election and possible ties between the Trump campaign and Moscow, as well as a criminal conspiracy to violate campaign finance laws through the payment of hush money.

“Today, I am here to tell the truth about Mr Trump,” Cohen said in his opening statement.

“I am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr Trump’s illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience,” he added. “I am ashamed because I know what Mr Trump is. He is a racist. He is a conman. He is a cheat.”

Cohen pleaded guilty in November to crimes that including lying to Congress and is scheduled to go to prison in May to begin a three-year sentence. Speaking in a measured tone, Cohen described his testimony as a step on “path of redemption” and apologized to the panel for his previous lies.

Trump, who arrived in Hanoi this week for a summit with the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, accused Cohen of “lying in order to reduce his prison time”.

[Trump] wrote a personal check for the payment of hush money as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws Michael Cohen

Cohen testified publicly for the first time in detail about a six-figure sum that was paid to adult film actor Stormy Daniels to prevent her from speaking out about an alleged an affair with Trump. Cohen presented checks he said were signed by the president and his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, to reimburse him for the hush money payments totaling $130,000.

“The president of the United States thus wrote a personal check for the payment of hush money as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws,” Cohen said.

He told the panel Trump knew of and approved each step of the payments, and said the president committed other illegal acts that he was unable to discuss because they were under investigation.

Cohen added that he was instructed by Trump to lie about the alleged affair to the president’s wife, Melania Trump, stating: “Lying to the first lady is one of my biggest regrets because she is a kind, good person.”

The finding that Donald Jr was directly involved in the scheme to pay off Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, could mean the president’s son faces legal jeopardy. Federal prosecutors in New York, who have had copies of the checks and other records for months, say the payments violated campaign finance laws.

That investigation, which is being overseen by the southern district of New York, is also examining a six-figure payment made to Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who also alleged an affair with Trump, by the National Enquirer. The tabloid, which is owned by the president’s close friend David Pecker, purchased the exclusive rights to McDougal’s story and then refused to publish it in a practice known as ‘catch-and-kill’.

Cohen said he presided over ‘several’ similar arrangements, while telling the committee: “These catch-and-kill scenarios existed between David Pecker and Mr. Trump long before I started working for him in 2007.”","Donald Trump 'a racist, a conman' who committed crimes as president – Cohen",Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/donald-trump-apos-racist-conman-184232983.html

Within 24 hours of his official kickoff, the Vermont senator had raised a staggering $6 million, quadruple the previous known first-day record, and within a week, his campaign had signed up more than 1 million volunteers. All that excitement is already showing up in the polls, where Sanders had been running second in a still-hypothetical field for most of the past year. According to Morning Consult, which is surveying primary voters daily, Sanders picked up 6 percentage points in the past week and, as of Tuesday, clocked in at 27 percent support nationally, moving him into a statistical dead heat for first place with Joe Biden, who remains on the sidelines. Bernie’s closest declared rival, meanwhile, is Kamala Harris, who sits in a distant third place with 10 percent support.

Sanders’ impressive start would not have been possible without the foundation he laid during his insurgent challenge to Hillary Clinton in 2016. It was then that the self-styled democratic socialist amassed the network of supporters that begat last week’s initial burst of donations and volunteers. And it was then that he transformed himself from a Phish Food–flavored fringe character into a national politician with near-universal name recognition.

But unfortunately for Sanders, he’s carrying over something else from his remarkable 2016 campaign: baggage.

Over the weekend, Sanders felt compelled to make a semipublic plea for his allies to be on their best behavior during the Democratic primary, or in his words, to “engage respectively with our Democratic opponents—talking about issues we are fighting for, not about personalities or past grievances.” It served as a tacit acknowledgement of something Sanders conceded more openly in the 2016 campaign but that continues to dog him: that some of his most ardent supporters have a nasty streak that Clinton die-hards have not forgotten and the political press corps cannot get enough of. “I want to be clear that I condemn bullying and harassment of any kind and in any space,” Sanders wrote in his recent email.

It’s not entirely clear that the festering 2016 resentment matters outside the Beltway.

The lingering bad blood between the Sanders and Clinton camps then spilled more fully into public view Monday by way of a Politico story headlined “Ex-Clinton Staffers Slam Sanders Over Private Jet Flights,” in which former Clinton staffers complained that the campaign had to pay to fly Sanders on private jets while he was stumping for Clinton in the general election. Much of the sniping was done under cover of anonymity, but the harshest words were on the record. “I’m not shocked that while thousands of volunteers braved the heat and cold to knock on doors until their fingers bled in a desperate effort to stop Donald Trump, his Royal Majesty King Bernie Sanders would only deign to leave his plush D.C. office or his brand new second home on the lake if he was flown around on a cushy private jet like a billionaire master of the universe,” said Zac Petkanas, who led Hillary’s rapid response team in 2016. Michael Briggs, Sanders’ 2016 campaign spokesman, fired back, calling Clinton’s team “total ingrates” and “some of the biggest assholes in American politics.”

The insult-slinging was ostensibly about private jets, but in reality it was a proxy for the larger debate that continues to bubble up inside the Beltway in Year 3 of Donald Trump’s presidency—namely, how much Sanders’ primary challenge damaged Clinton’s candidacy and whether he subsequently did all he could to heal the intraparty wounds before the general election. The fact that Monday’s spat was about Sanders’ mode of travel to Clinton rallies illustrates how unproductive this feud is. It’s about whether Sanders did enough to help the first female nominee of a major party in U.S. history—not whether he helped her at all. Likewise, it calls to mind the running debate over Bernie Bros, who simultaneously exist and don’t exist in the numbers Sanders’ critics suggest: Did Bernie do enough to rein in the worst impulses of his most combative fans, and is he doing enough now? As narrow as these rifts are, they’re unlikely to ever be bridged by the two entrenched sides.

The good news for Sanders is that it’s not entirely clear that the festering 2016 resentment matters outside the Beltway. His favorability rating within the Democratic rank and file suggests the vast majority of primary voters have either forgiven, forgotten, or never noticed the rift in the first place. In the Morning Consult poll, for example, 75 percent of Democratic voters said they had a favorable opinion of Sanders, while just 15 percent said they had an unfavorable one. Those numbers are nearly as good as Biden’s (76 percent to 12 percent) and far better than every other potential rival, none of whom have faced the same kind of he’s-not-even-technically-a-Democrat complaints that get lobbed at Sanders from the party faithful.

If the old Clinton and Sanders camps continue to relitigate those old grievances, however, the squabbles could complicate Sanders’ attempts to defend himself from the more specific criticisms leveled at his first presidential campaign, which include the alleged mistreatment of female staffers and his lackluster appeals to black voters, particularly in the early nominating contests back when his leadership team was predominantly white. Sanders has taken steps to address both—he apologized to his female campaign staffers publicly, and he’s now more explicitly drawing a connection between economic inequality and racial inequality than he did in 2016—but the complaints will almost certainly re-emerge in a primary where gender, race, and identity are dominant themes. Sanders may have to lug his 2016 baggage with him into 2020, especially if a candidate of color and/or a woman emerges as his most direct challenger. The question, though, is whether his campaign will have so much momentum that he won’t feel the weight of it.",Bernie’s Baggage From 2016 Could Drag Down His 2020 Bid,Slate.com,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/02/bernie-sanders-campaign-clinton-2016-baggage.html

Or will the party remain as divided as Republicans were in 2016?

One indication will be whether Democratic elected officials and other influential party members seek to winnow the field by endorsing a narrow range of candidates. Confronting a similarly large field in 2016, Republican “party elites” never achieved any sort of consensus, with many potential endorsers sitting on the sidelines or not offering more than tepid support for establishment-friendly candidates such as Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio. Meanwhile, Donald Trump emerged as the GOP nominee despite not receiving a single endorsement from a sitting Republican governor or member of Congress until after his wins in the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries.

So as we did in 2016, FiveThirtyEight will be tracking endorsements for the Democratic presidential nomination. We’ll also add the Republican nomination if it eventually appears that someone will give Trump a real run for his money, but we aren’t doing that just yet. Instead, we’ll be focusing on a universe of more than 900 potential Democratic endorsers, a more comprehensive list than we evaluated in 2016, including at least a few possible endorsers in every U.S. state and territory.

We’ll detail the procedures for tracking endorsements separately, but here’s some background about why we’re doing this and why we think it’s valuable both as a journalistic exercise and as a tool to help predict which Democrat will win.

Despite 2016, the party still mostly decides

The 2016 Republican campaign raised questions about the value of endorsements as a measure of success in the presidential primaries. Indeed, we raised a lot of those questions ourselves after being unduly skeptical of Trump’s chances of winning the nomination until around the time of the Iowa caucuses.

In our coverage of the 2016 primaries, we were heavily invested in the hypothesis articulated in the book “The Party Decides: Presidential Nominations Before and After Reform,” by the political scientists Marty Cohen, David Karol, Hans Noel and John Zaller. The book, which is also backed by other political science scholarship, argued that the preferences of party elites, as expressed by endorsements, tend to lead voter preferences. If party elites achieve consensus on a candidate, that candidate tends to win the nomination, even if he or she initially receives only tepid support in the polls, the book argues. And even if those elites can’t achieve consensus, parties rarely nominate candidates who aren’t at least minimally acceptable to the party establishment, it implies.

Trump was an extremely problematic data point for this hypothesis, as well as for our own expectations about how the nomination process was supposed to work. In the past, parties usually went for candidates who could be entrusted to enact the party’s agenda, but who also helped to maximize the chances of winning the general election. Trump was just the opposite of that: He bucked Republican orthodoxy on many issues, but he also polled poorly among independents and swing voters. So given the information available in early 2016, Trump looked like the worst of both worlds to the Republican establishment.

So why bother tracking endorsements at all? Well, partly because whether or not they predict anything, we think it’s useful descriptive data — creating a fossil record of how the Democratic Party was behaving in 2019 and 2020. It also makes for a good reality check. One can make assertions about which candidates are backed by the party establishment and which ones aren’t, and these claims are common in media coverage of the campaigns. Tracking endorsements raises the bar by requiring tangible evidence for those claims, however. It’s potentially noteworthy, for instance, that the supposedly establishment-friendly New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand doesn’t have any endorsements yet, while Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders already has almost as many as he did in 2016.

But also, to put it bluntly, we think a lot of political analysis is dumb. And a lot of the reason it’s dumb is because people are too quick to draw conclusions from just one or two cases. In fact, the “Party Decides” hypothesis has a fairly good track record overall. As poorly as the theory fared in the 2016 GOP nomination, it had done exceptionally well in the 2012 Republican race, when the party-backed Mitt Romney fought back a series of insurgent candidates (Newt Gingrich, Herman Cain) who surged in the polls but didn’t have staying power. That doesn’t mean the candidate leading in endorsements will automatically win the nomination, or even necessarily be an odds-on favorite. But endorsements are one of the more useful instruments to have in your toolkit if you’re taking a multifaceted approach to covering the primary.

The modern presidential nomination system emerged in advance of the 1972 election, when the Democrats’ McGovern-Fraser Commission adopted a series of reforms that gave voters a more direct say in electing delegates to the national convention through primaries and caucuses. From 1972 to 2016, the parties went through 16 nomination processes — nine for Democrats and seven for Republicans — that did not involve their own incumbent president running for re-election.

The argument of “The Party Decides” is that, despite the McGovern reforms, voters usually agreed with the party elites anyway. Indeed, in these 16 elections, the candidate who was leading in endorsements the day before the Iowa caucus won 10 nominations, or 63 percent of the time.

The endorsement leader usually wins Leaders in endorsement points in nomination processes where no incumbent president was running for that party, 1972-2016 Year Party Endorsement leader before Iowa Did they have a clear endorsement lead?

Endorsement leaders in 1972 and 1976 are based on “The Party Decides.” Sources: “The Party Decides,” News accounts

But look at the data in more detail, and a more subtle pattern emerges. In 11 instances since 1972, there has been a clear front-runner in endorsements as of the Iowa caucuses. That front-runner won the nomination nine times, the lone exceptions being Hillary Clinton in 2008 and Ed Muskie in 1972. In five other instances, there was no clear consensus among endorsers, and the endorsement leader was at best a first among equals. Only one of these five candidates (John McCain in 2008) won the nomination.

So in some ways, the question is not so much who gets the most endorsements but whether a consensus forms. Sometimes, party elites’ preferences are murky initially, but a clear front-runner emerges before Iowa: The most notable examples of this are Mitt Romney in 2012 (who at earlier points in time was neck-and-neck with Texas Gov. Rick Perry in endorsements) and Bill Clinton in 1992. A consensus can also emerge after Iowa and New Hampshire and potentially predict how contentious the rest of the nomination process will be. John Kerry got a huge surge in endorsements after winning Iowa and New Hampshire in 2004 and went on to secure the Democratic nomination with relative ease; in contrast, the Iowa and New Hampshire results in 2016 only seemed to freeze Republican endorsers, and the outcome of the GOP nomination remained fairly uncertain until late April or early May.

And although endorsements aren’t perfect, they do roughly as well as polls at predicting the nominee. Below is a comparison of the endorsement leader before Iowa and the leader in national polls at the same point in time.

Endorsement leaders in 1972 and 1976 are based on “The Party Decides.” Sources: “The Party Decides,” News accounts

In 11 of the 16 nomination races, the pre-Iowa polling and endorsement leaders were the same. Differences have become more commonplace in recent years — in three of the five incumbent-free nomination processes since 2008, the polling and endorsement leader was not the same — which may suggest an increasing divide between voters and elites, especially within the Republican Party, or which may just be a fluke of a small sample size.

In the five cases where polls and endorsements differed, endorsements were right twice (Romney in 2012 and McCain in 2008), polls were right once (Trump in 2016), and in the final two instances (the Democratic nominations in 1976 and 1988) a third candidate who was neither the polling nor the endorsement leader won. Given the small sample size, I wouldn’t call that a “win” for endorsements over polls, but I would say it’s at least a draw.

So the party usually does get its way. But it also usually agrees with voters in the first place — or at least it can live with their choices — and it’s not so clear what happens in the event of a disagreement. Maybe the voter-centric model of the 2016 Republican primary is the new normal, but we’ll need to see more evidence of that before we can say for sure. In Democratic primaries for governor and Congress in 2018, establishment-backed candidates prevailed a high percentage of the time, despite the media’s fixation on exceptions such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York’s 14th Congressional District.

I haven’t talked much about which Democrats have received the most endorsements to date because it’s awfully early in the process and so far less than 10 percent of all Democratic endorsement points have been claimed. Furthermore, the large majority of the endorsements that have been made so far are from within the same state as the candidate, e.g. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz backing Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. So far, however, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker has the most endorsement points, with Klobuchar and California Sen. Kamala Harris essentially tied for second. Sanders’s initial total, while well behind the other three, is also fairly promising for him given that he received so few endorsements in 2016.

That pretty much covers it. If you have any questions, or see any endorsements we’ve missed, please drop us a line. Otherwise, we hope you’ll check in regularly to see who’s winning the endorsement primary.",We’re Tracking 2020 Presidential Endorsements.

Read more: Live updates and analysis from Michael Cohen’s testimony to Congress.

Cohen is also making public copies of checks he received that he and federal prosecutors in Manhattan have said are reimbursement for hush money he paid to silence adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, who claimed an extramarital affair with Trump. At least one of the checks, dated August 1, 2017, was personally signed by Trump.

Cohen said the check was written from the president’s personal bank account, after he took office, “to reimburse me for the hush money payments I made to cover up his affair with an adult film star and prevent damage to his campaign.”

Cohen has pleaded guilty to charges of illegal campaign contributions related to the payments.

Read Michael Cohen’s prepared testimony.

As the House Oversight and Reform Committee opened its hearing on Wednesday, Cohen also was poised to tell the panel that Trump knew during the 2016 presidential election that his ally Roger Stone was talking to Julian Assange of WikiLeaks about a release of hacked Democratic National Committee emails.

“I am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is,” Cohen intends to tell the committee at a public hearing on Wednesday, about the man who he once said he’d take a bullet for. “He is a racist. He is a con man. He is a cheat,” Cohen said in the prepared testimony.

Cohen, who has pleaded guilty to nine felonies, including lying to Congress, and is headed to prison, also is planning to tell the committee that Trump “did not directly tell me to lie to Congress” about the timing of talks to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.

“That’s not how he operates,” Cohen said in the prepared remarks.

Campaign Conversations

But Cohen asserts that in conversations with Trump during the 2016 campaign, “at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there’s no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing.”

“In his way, he was telling me to lie,” he wrote.

“I lied to Congress about when Mr. Trump stopped negotiating the Moscow Tower project in Russia. I stated that we stopped negotiating in January 2016,” Cohen wrote in his statement. “That was false -- our negotiations continued for months later during the campaign.”

Cohen, in his testimony, says he has first-hand knowledge of -- and even some documentary evidence for -- a number of questionable and even potentially illegal Trump activities.

One of the biggest accusations involves the 2016 WikiLeaks release.

Telephone Call

“He was a presidential candidate who knew that Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about a WikiLeaks drop of Democratic National Committee emails,” Cohen plans to say, recalling a telephone call to Trump from Stone when he was in the room that was put on speaker.

“Mr. Stone told Mr. Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange and that Mr. Assange told Mr. Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign,” Cohen writes. “Mr. Trump responded by stating to the effect of “wouldn’t that be great.”

So, too, he is planning to provide the committee three years of Trump’s financial statements, from 2011-2013, which he gave to Deutsche Bank to inquire about a loan to buy the Buffalo Bills.

Inflated, Deflated

Cohen intends to testify that “it was my experience that Mr. Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed among the wealthiest people in Forbes, and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes.”

He described his role in the Trump circle as “always stay on message. Always defend. It monopolized my life.”

“Mr. Trump is an enigma. He is complicated, as am I,” Cohen said. “He has both good and bad, as do we all. But the bad far outweighs the good, and since taking office, he has become the worst version of himself. He is capable of behaving kindly, but he is not kind. He is capable of committing acts of generosity, but he is not generous. He is capable of being loyal, but he is fundamentally disloyal.”",Cohen to Call Trump a Liar and Offer Documents to Back His Story,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/cohen-plans-tell-house-panel-065231973.html
254,Empty,2019-02-28T14:43:02Z,Activists and politicians in Europe think they've finally found a way to help stop the spread of false information on social media.,"An overwhelming majority of Europeans would support a radical new measure that would require social media companies to direct all users who have seen false information toward fact-checks, according to new polling from global advocacy group Avaaz. The initiative is intended to prevent the spread of “fake news” on Facebook and Twitter as governments come under growing pressure to regulate social media.

Research shared exclusively with TIME shows that 86.6% of people support Avaaz’s new proposal known as Correct the Record, which activists and politicians say could be the most effective way to stop “fake news” from spreading online.

Under the Correct the Record initiative, social media companies would have to make sure that all users who see false information on their feeds are also later presented with fact-checks — whether in the form of a notification telling them something they’ve seen may have been misleading, or a pinned post in their newsfeed with a link to a fact-check by a “verified” organization.

The proposal is one of the first concrete suggestions for how to combat the spread of disinformation online, at a time when false news is increasingly affecting the outcome of elections and fueling violence around the world.

The international activist network Avaaz, in collaboration with the polling group YouGov, surveyed more than 5,000 people in Germany, France, Spain and Italy on the subject of Correct the Record. In each country, at least 81% and as many as 92% of respondents said they either “agreed” or “strongly agreed” that social media companies should “work with independent and trusted fact checking organizations to provide all users who have been exposed to widespread false or misleading content with verified corrections.”

“Correcting the record is a legal responsibility that newspapers have to meet in many countries,” Ricken Patel, the executive director of Avaaz, tells TIME. “When they print false information, they have to print corrections. Part of Correct the Record is just bringing that journalistic tradition of correction into social media.”

European Union officials have also welcomed the Correct the Record proposal. “We need rapid corrections, which are given the same prominence and circulation as the original fake news,” said Julian King, the E.U. security commissioner, after being briefed on the proposal late last year.

Facebook, one of the key targets of the proposal, has not yet provided a formal response to a TIME request for comment. The company does already have partnerships with fact-checking bodies around the world. “Misinformation is bad for our community and bad for our business. It’s why we’re investing significant time and resources to fight it,” the company wrote in a 2018 blog post.

But the matter is increasingly urgent as European Union elections approach in May, and activists say Facebook is not doing enough. Of the Avaaz survey’s respondents, 77.8% said they believed fake news and “politically motivated disinformation” posed a threat to the legitimacy of those elections, and 84.8% said they believed social media companies should be regulated.

“We have found a tremendously receptive audience for Correct the Record as an idea, across the spectrum, from academics to regulators to experts, to the social media executives themselves, to political party leaders,” Patel, tells TIME. “You name it, I have not found strong arguments against this solution.”

But some activists raised concerns that Facebook could not be trusted to partner with fact-checking organizations. “This measure is a good starting point, but only as long as there’s democratic accountability,” says Kyle Taylor, the director of the campaign group Fair Vote U.K. “It’s not safe to outsource truth to a private company.”

Snopes, the popular online fact-checking website, pulled out of a fact-checking arrangement with Facebook earlier in February, citing dissatisfaction that the arrangements were benefiting Facebook at the expense of the “whole web.”

“The work that fact-checkers are doing doesn’t need to be just for Facebook — we can build things for fact-checkers that benefit the whole web, and that can also help Facebook,” Vinny Green, Snopes’ vice president of operations, told Poynter. Others raised concerns about reports that Facebook had hired a PR firm to spread anti-Semitic tropes about George Soros. “They’ve essentially used us for crisis PR,” Brooke Binkowski, a former Snopes editor, told the Guardian.

Christoph Schott, a campaign director at Avaaz, says Facebook’s current fact-checking arrangements are a step in the right direction, but are not enough. Only a small percentage of those who see “fake news,” he says, ever come into contact with a post debunking it. “They don’t inform the other maybe 95% of users,” he tells TIME. Correct the Record, he says, would change that.

Damian Collins, the U.K. lawmaker who eviscerated Facebook in a 111-page report published in mid-February and called for regulation to limit “fake news” on social media, also supports the proposal. (In response to that report, Facebook said it was open to “meaningful regulation.”)

“Support for the Correct the Record measure highlights the growing concern about disinformation on social media and the threat this poses to our democracy,” Collins tells TIME. “The big tech platforms should do more to act against known sources of disinformation and to warn users when they may have been exposed to it. We know they have the technical capability to do this.”

It remains unclear how Correct the Record” can be implemented in practice. Avaaz has presented the proposal to Facebook, Twitter and Google executives, as well as to governments — who could use the idea as a basis for new laws. Social media companies may also attempt to avoid regulation by self-imposing such measures.

In plans submitted to the E.U., NATO, and European governments, Avaaz suggests a five step plan of “define, detect, verify, alert and correct.”

They suggest that social media companies should provide a way for users to flag content for checking, and that a piece of disinformation should be flagged when independent fact-checkers verify that content is misleading. Once they have debunked the content, “each user exposed to verified disinformation should be notified using the most visible notification standard,” according to a policy document presented to E.U. and NATO leaders.

“Facebook has always said ‘we’re open to legislation, if it’s the right legislation,’” Patel, the Avaaz executive director, says. He hopes the company will soon see that it’s smart to rebuild trust in the brand. “This is Facebook’s moment of truth. The E.U. elections are coming. Is it going to be another version of the U.S. election in 2016?”

255,Empty,2019-02-25T19:33:38Z,Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are trying something different.,"Barack Obama before attending fundraisers in 2012. (AP Photo/David Tulis)

Wealthy donors were a big part of how Barack Obama became president. Employees of Goldman Sachs were rivaled only by those of the University of California in powering his record-breaking fundraising totals in 2008. As the insurgent candidate wrestled control of the Democratic Party from the establishment—including frontrunner Hillary Clinton—that year, his inspiring speeches and consistent opposition to the Iraq War were obviously defining elements of a historic candidacy. But so were the eye-popping donations. He broke and then broke again the records for fundraising in a given month, setting the tone for the general election against John McCain with a $66 million haul in August of that year. And while small-dollar donors and the activist base they symbolized were instrumental in his success, Obama also glad-handed at plenty of fancy, exclusive receptions for rich donors both during and after his 2008 victory.

For Democrats hoping to follow in his footsteps, that path toward victory now looks a lot less appealing.

When Bernie Sanders ran for president four years ago, he made a point of largely shunning traditional high-dollar fundraisers, insisting he didn't need or want billionaires' money. It also might have been true that he couldn't get it: The self-declared democratic socialist from Vermont wanted to break up big banks like Goldman, hike taxes on the rich, and dismantle some of the late capitalist infrastructure that he argued was behind soaring income inequality and a broken, for-profit healthcare system. Sanders actually did have the occasional supporter on Wall Street, but with populist anger at Obama's failure to prosecute bankers behind the financial crisis still raging, and the lingering effects of the mortgage crisis and Great Recession still tangible, Sanders could forgo the most lucrative fundraising events and rely on a steady stream of mostly online support from fans. That strategy already seems to be panning out for him this go-around: Sanders raised nearly $6 million in the first 24 hours after announcing his 2020 candidacy last week.

Now Elizabeth Warren is making a point of joining him on the high road. As the New York Times reported Monday, the 2020 contender announced she would skip private, VIP-style fundraisers. She also plans to avoid the ""call time,"" the term for the common practice of politicians working the phones to plead for money from rich people.

""That means no fancy receptions or big money fund-raisers only with people who can write the big checks,” Warren said in an email to her fans. “It means that wealthy donors won’t be able to purchase better seats or one-on-one time with me at our events.""

This makes sense given that Warren has for years positioned herself as opponent of the ultra-wealthy and Wall Street.

""Her ceasing VIP fundraisers with mega donors is consistent with the messaging she's been using in campaign, and at this early point in the race, the energy is focused on generating excitement from the base and distinguishing each candidate's campaign from the rest of the pack,"" said Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the influence watchdog the Center for Responsive Politics.

As Krumholz noted, it's also fair to assume she isn't actually passing on all that much money here; the party's wealthiest donors might be predisposed to back, say, Kamala Harris, or Kirsten Gillibrand, or Cory Booker, or (if and when he gets in) Joe Biden. All of them have been dinged by the left for relatively neoliberal stances on some issues, even if they have also inched leftward and embraced policies like Medicare for all and the Green New Deal to stay abreast of activist orthodoxy. (Gillibrand also declared she wasn't going to take money from corporate PACs, though she'll apparently still take money from individuals connected to the finance industry.)

Which brings us to what this is really about: Warren is sending a message, like the one Sanders has been sending for years now, to the party's most engaged partisans. After all, her move came just a week after the Times reported that a coterie of her rivals, including Amy Klobuchar, Sherrod Brown, and Cory Booker, ""auditioned"" before super-wealthy Obama donors, hoping to win their support.

It remains to be seen how much the larger universe of Democratic voters actually cares about who a candidate's donors are. But polling for years now has tended to find large majorities of Americans think the government is too focused on the needs of the rich and not enough on the poor and middle-class, and that money holds too much sway in their democracy.

Warren and Sanders are helping lay down a marker for their competitors, who will have to defend their own practices of holding fundraisers and taking money from industries the Democratic base isn't a fan of. Fundraising has been a consistent issue among those involved in Democratic politics, with a contentious fight over donations from the oil and gas industry unfolding last year in the Democratic National Committee. (The DNC ultimately decided to accept such donations.) In 2008, Obama made a show of skipping out on corporate PAC and lobbyist money, though he obviously wasn't actually missing out on all that much. In 2016, Clinton seemed to be on the side of accepting donations from anyone who would give them, leading to attacks from Trump about her family foundation's work and her paid speeches before audiences of bankers—even as he soaked up dark money donations from self-interested financial titans.

Whether Trump's attacks were fair, this time around the Democratic nominee may be someone who rejects the whole system of donors that Clinton was enmeshed in. If nothing else, the party is set for a real debate—with Warren and Sanders in particular poised to pressure their rivals—about who gets a voice in their government, and how much that voice costs them.

""It's a battle,"" Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, VICE contributor, and critic of the party's coziness with entrenched financial power, said in an email when I asked if Warren's move meant Obama donors were losing control of the party. ""To paraphrase Churchill: It isn't the beginning of the end, but it is the end of the beginning.""

DES MOINES, Iowa ― “Can you tell me your mother’s name?” Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) asked from across the table. The woman she was speaking to, Monica Reyes, a 28-year-old with DACA status, had traveled to the Iowa Capitol on a blustery Saturday morning in February to let the senator know how much her immigrant mother had done for her growing up. And now Reyes wanted to know what the senator could do for people like her mother if Harris is elected president. Harris would eventually give Reyes her position on the matter, criticizing the Trump administration for “trying to create a scapegoat” out of Mexicans and reiterating her support for comprehensive immigration reform, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA). But before she did that, she wanted to know the name of Reyes’ mother. It’s Brenda, Reyes said. “I think it’s important,” Harris replied, “that we speak her name.

Flipboard “Her story is the story of so many people, and I applaud her.”

Stephen Maturen via Getty Images Sen. Kamala Harris is positioning herself more as a common-sense fighter, but her trip in Iowa made clear that voters are still expecting their candidates to have detailed policy ideas and know the issues inside and out.

The audience applauded as well. Over the course of her first full-on tour around Iowa this weekend, Harris’ ability to boil such political moments down to the personal garnered many of her largest cheers. The next day in Bettendorf, she spoke about the pain of watching her mother battle colon cancer before she died in 2009. “It requires physical strength, emotional strength, mental strength, but what that should not require of anyone is that you also have to figure out how you’re going to pay those medical bills,” she said to loud applause. Dan Audi, a 54-year-old maintenance supervisor who is considering Harris, Sen. Sherrod Brown (Ohio) and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), said after the Bettendorf event that he appreciated Harris’ “positive, happy persona.” “You can be a fighter without being angry,” he added. But after the previous morning’s event, Reyes said, she couldn’t help feeling that Harris’ answer fell short. The former California attorney general is positioning herself more as a common-sense fighter, sans the wonkiness of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), but her trip in Iowa made clear that voters are still expecting their candidates to have detailed policy ideas and know the issues inside and out. “I felt like she maybe needs to know a little more about the current and past policies on immigration to be able to better answer the question that I gave her,” said Reyes, a co-founder of the immigration advocacy group Dream Iowa, as Harris stood nearby. “Not just her but all of the presidential candidates.” Iowans have long taken their responsibility seriously as the first state to hold a Democratic nominating contest every presidential election. Elementary schools teach children about the complicated caucus process, instilling in many of them a sense of democratic duty, said Sean Bagniewski, the chairman of the Polk County Democrats. “It is ingrained in you, as an Iowan, that one of your roles in America is to vet and screen and vote for presidential candidates,” he said. But a year out from the 2020 Iowa caucuses, many feel an even higher sense of obligation to make sure they put the correct candidate on track in the presidential primaries, peppering candidates — including Harris, Warren and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) — with questions that can border on the uncomfortable. “The whole country is depending on us to have smart, wide-open conversations,” said Sue Dvorsky, a former Iowa Democratic Party chair. Regardless of the various shifts in the primary process, the state’s influence remains indisputable. Every Democrat to take first in Iowa has gone on to win the primaries after 1992, when an Iowa native, Tom Harkin, bested an Arkansas governor named Bill Clinton at the caucuses. The stakes are also more than clear with a wide-open Democratic field and growing ideological fissures in the party, not to mention President Donald Trump. Democrats around Iowa appear to understand the urgency of the moment as well. Bagniewski said he recently helped set up a last-minute event for another presidential candidate, Gillibrand, and 50 to 60 people were expected to attend, but about 300 showed up.

This weekend, it was Harris’ turn to cycle through Iowa, and crowds once again turned out in droves for her first full tour around the state. According to one of her aides, 760 people braved the cold to watch her speak in Ankeny on Saturday ― so many that the organizers had to rush out more chairs as the event began. The next day, 750 showed up in freezing temperatures to watch her speak in Bettendorf. Early polls of likely Iowa caucusgoers have placed her far ahead of Gillibrand and roughly in the top tier with former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Some who attended the events, like 20-year-old Jordan Milligan of Upper Iowa University, have already decided Harris is their candidate. “She’s the one,” he said. But many other attendees were undecided, there more to vet than to cheer. That even included some who attended the gatherings in Harris T-shirts, like Justin Comstock, a self-employed 43-year-old who said he was “window shopping” last Saturday. “I’m coming into it with an open mind and expecting to see if the hype’s there or not,” said Comstock, who said he’s also intrigued by Klobuchar. “We’ll probably go see everyone,” said Jim Woods, 67, who spent 25 years at the Davenport Fire Department before becoming a teacher. “This is Iowa. They just come through.” As much as Iowa Democrats have high expectations of themselves to pick the right contender, they expect even more of their candidates. Like Reyes, many Iowans take pride in their willingness to ask tough questions, said Jeff Link, one of the state’s top Democratic strategists. That isn’t exactly new. He still remembers riding around the state with then–Vice President Al Gore as his state director during the 2000 presidential election. “It was just mind-boggling the kinds of questions he would get,” Link said. “They’re not just going to ask about corn.”

Some of the questions thrown at Harris were light, like the man in Ankeny who preceded his question by telling her he also puts hot sauce on his greens, and she received loud applause for her shots at Trump (“The first thing is to not conduct trade policy through tweets,” goes one well-practiced line) and for toeing the Democratic line by pushing for universal background checks for gun sales, free college, “Medicare for all” and her proposed LIFT Act, which would hand middle-class households up to $500 per month. But over the course of the weekend, she also fielded pointed questions on topics such as Puerto Rico, agricultural technology, foreign policy and the environment. In Ankeny, a young man asked whether she would support abolishing the Senate filibuster, adding, “Just give me a really articulated defense on wherever you come down on that issue.” “That’s a great question!” Harris replied, before joking, “Let’s change the subject!” (She then said she felt conflicted on the issue.) In Bettendorf, a man in the crowd wanted to know where she stood on Israeli-Palestinian relations and whether she would release off-the-record comments she made to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee last year. When she didn’t answer the AIPAC part of the question, he yelled it out again, leading her to say, “Sure,” while the microphone was away from her mouth. (Her team later released a transcript to HuffPost.) Even an opening question from a young girl named Nora, who was sporting a “Future president” T-shirt, proved far from a softball, as she asked Harris how she would deal with the $22 trillion national debt. “It’s like not being invited to a birthday party but still having to bring a gift,” the young woman said. The last time Harris touched down in Iowa, in January, one of her answers to a question led to a small national controversy, when she suggested at a CNN town hall that she supported eliminating private health insurance. (A spokesperson said a day later that she is open to more moderate health insurance fixes as well.) This time around, she impressed many of the people who spoke to HuffPost. “She’s done her homework,” said Mary Campos, 89, a co-president of the Brown and Black Presidential Forum. “She’s ready to answer questions.” Richard Lynch, 51, said he supported Sanders in 2016. While he said that Harris “sidestepped” some of the questions she was asked, he added that he welcomed all candidates moving into Sanders’ space. Asked if he believed Harris had done that, he cited her support of “Medicare for all,” saying, “It sounds to me like the answer is, yes, she’s moving into the space he created, and frankly, I’m not sure it should be his space, per se.”

By Andy Sullivan

(Reuters) - Special Counsel Robert Mueller and other U.S. prosecutors have been investigating whether President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign conspired with Russia and whether the president unlawfully tried to obstruct the inquiry.

U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded Russia interfered in the presidential election with a campaign of hacking and propaganda to sow discord in the United States and damage the Republican Trump's Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Russia denies it. Trump has denied collusion and obstruction of justice.

Here are some key figures in the investigation.

DONALD TRUMP JR.

Trump's eldest son set up a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York with a Kremlin-linked lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, and other Russians who had offered damaging information on Clinton. In an email after being promised the Clinton ""dirt,"" Trump Jr. wrote ""I love it."" When news of the meeting broke in July 2017, Trump Jr. issued a statement saying the meeting was set up to discuss adoption policy, not politics, before later admitting he had been expecting intelligence on Clinton.

President Trump's advisers eventually said the president dictated the misleading statement put out in his son's name, after initially denying his involvement.

JARED KUSHNER

Trump's son-in-law has served as a senior adviser to him as both candidate and president. Kushner initially did not list any Russian contacts on his application for a White House security clearance, but subsequently revised those forms to reveal he had participated in the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting and discussed setting up a secure communications line at the Russian Embassy in Washington after Trump won the November 2016 election with Sergei Kislyak, then-Russian ambassador to the United States.

JEFF SESSIONS

Sessions, a longtime U.S. senator from Alabama, served as a campaign adviser and then Trump's first attorney general. During his Senate confirmation hearings he said he did not meet with Russian officials during the campaign, but later admitted he had met at least twice with Kislyak. Under pressure, he recused himself from oversight of the Russia investigation, which at the time was led by the FBI and later by Mueller. The recusal angered Trump, who eventually fired Sessions in November 2018.

MICHAEL FLYNN

A retired U.S. Army lieutenant general, Flynn was a top campaign adviser and served as Trump's first national security adviser until he was fired after only weeks on the job for lying about his conversations with Kislyak in December 2017, after Trump won the election but before he took office. Flynn discussed U.S. sanctions with Russia and asked the ambassador for help with a U.N. vote, according to court filings. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and has been cooperating with investigators.

Before he joined Trump's campaign, Flynn sat next to Russian President Vladimir Putin at a Moscow dinner in December 2015 celebrating RT, a pro-Kremlin Russian-owned English language media channel.

PAUL MANAFORT

Manafort served on Trump's campaign from March to August 2016, including three months as chairman, ensuring Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination during the party's convention in Cleveland. During that time, the Republican Party softened its support for arming U.S. allies in Ukraine.

He participated in the Trump Tower meeting with Russians who offered damaging information on Clinton.

Manafort's lawyers said that after the convention he shared election polling data and discussed a way to end the Ukraine conflict with Russian Konstantin Kilimnik, a former business associate who Mueller's team has called an agent of the Kremlin.

Manafort faces decades in prison for crimes relating to his work earning millions of dollars as a political consultant and lobbyist for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine. He was found guilty of bank and tax fraud and has pleaded guilty to separate lobbying violations. A judge ruled on Feb. 13 that Manafort violated his plea agreement with prosecutors by repeatedly lying to Mueller's team.

RICK GATES

Manafort's longtime lobbying associate served as deputy campaign chairman and worked on the transition after Trump was elected. Gates pleaded guilty to lying to investigators and was a star witness in Manafort's 2018 trial, testifying that he helped his boss file false tax returns and hide millions of dollars offshore. Gates has continued to cooperate with the investigation, according to court filings.",A scorecard of key players in U.S. special counsel Russia probe,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/scorecard-key-players-u-special-counsel-russia-probe-180655001.html

Prospective candidate Sen. Kamala Harris is among the top targets. | AP Photo/Elise Amendola 2020 Elections Top Democrats want 2020 candidates to sign non-aggression pact Early state chairs lead effort to lay out norms and rules Democratic presidential campaigns should follow with regard to disinformation tactics.

Democratic Party chairs in the four early presidential states are working to convince the 2020 presidential candidates to avoid waging social media disinformation warfare against each other.

The effort began this week with a letter to state party chairs across the country broadly laying out the issue with an ultimate goal of establishing what amounts to a non-aggression pact, according to a copy of the letter obtained by POLITICO.

Story Continued Below

“We would like your support in recommending the ASDC [Association of State Democratic Committees] work towards developing a collaborative approach to battling disinformation, illicit campaign tactics, bots, trollfarms, fake accounts, altered text, audio, and video, any and all inauthentic speech in our Presidential Primary process,"" wrote the four chairs, including New Hampshire's Ray Buckley, Iowa's Troy Price, South Carolina's Trav Robertson and Nevada's William McCurdy.

""The Association of State Democratic Committees, the Democratic National Committee and the Presidential campaigns can and must work together in preventing the pollution of our discourse.""

The letter continues: ""Further, we want the campaigns to commit to report illicit activity they uncover to social media platforms, and when necessary, to law enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security.""

COUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now. Stay in the know. Follow our presidential election coverage. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.

The letter marks a significant attempt to shape the tactics and tenor of political discourse as the Democratic primary plays out on digital platforms. The intent is to forge an agreement laying out norms and rules the campaigns should follow with regard to disinformation tactics and cybersecurity.

Collectively, the four early state chairs — in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina — play an outsized role in the presidential primary campaign. They hold considerable political clout with the campaigns, which are attempting to build followings and curry favor in each of those states.

Last week, POLITICO reported a widespread disinformation campaign targeting 2020 candidates is already underway on social media. An analysis of Twitter data showed the main targets over a 30-day period appeared to be Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas), four of the most prominent announced or prospective candidates for president.

The campaign included fake, racist and sexist memes targeting the candidates over various social media platforms, some of it designed to divide and sow chaos within the party.

The move this week by the early state chairs aims to spur a broader discussion among the 2020 contenders about the issue, and to convince them to refrain from targeting one another in similar ways. The goal is to have 2020 campaigns agree to forego illicit online campaign tactics like those used against Democrats in the 2016 presidential campaign, including the use of fake social media accounts, the spread of disinformation, hacking and the use of hacked materials.

There’s also discussion about candidates calling out supporters for taking part in that activity.

Mary Mancini, state chair of the Tennessee Democratic Party, said she received the letter and welcomed the discussion. She added that she hopes any pact would go beyond just 2020 presidential campaigns.

“I think that’s a critical problem in our country and just another way that our voting rates, the franchise, gets polluted and corrupted,” Mancini said. “It’s just one in a long list of issues that negatively affect people who are trying to vote.”

Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price said he and other party chairs have discussed a variety of ways to avoid the use of illicit tactics by the 2020 campaigns.

“I think after what happened in 2016 and what we saw of the foreign state actors play in the race, we want to make sure our process is as fair and transparent as possible,” Price said. “We’re wanting to make sure the primary is really, truly a conversation about the values of our country. We want to make sure that continues to be the case throughout the primary.”

Simon Rosenberg, who ran the campaign to counter disinformation for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee during the 2018 midterms, has led the call for the pact among the 2020 campaigns and the Democratic National Committee. Rosenberg noted that political parties in Europe recently agreed to such a non-aggression pact with regard to disinformation warfare.

“If we know the campaigns aren’t doing it, it’s going to be much easier to find it and make it go away. If this becomes widespread, it will become truly impossible to root out what’s coming from foreign powers,” Rosenberg said in an interview.

“There’s something bigger than all of us here, and that’s our democracy. Democrats should make a clear stand, understanding that if we don’t set clear norms and rules soon, we could see a proliferation of this illicit tactics that could do permanent and lasting harm to our democracy and other democracies throughout the world.”

Not long ago Republican senators could be counted on for thunderous speeches and scathing statements condemning an imperial and lawless president.

Arkansas' two Republican Senators, Tom Cotton and John Boozman accused the president of ""unprecedented executive overreach"" when his administration offered government support for a wind farm in their state.

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, irked over an executive order on immigration, took to mocking the president in a speech that quoted the Roman senator Cicero: ""How long is that madness of yours still to mock us?"" Cruz demanded. ""When is there to be an end to that unbridled audacity of yours, swaggering about as it does now?""

Today, however, many of those same senators have lost their sense of outrage. Their efforts to stand against presidential overreach have been muted. Their principled statements in defense of Congress as a coequal branch have been forgotten. Their high principles, their keen sense of right, their proud defense of democracy — well, never mind all that.

What prompted this abrupt and jaw-dropping reversal is the simple fact that a Republican president, Donald Trump, has succeeded a Democratic one, Barack Obama.

As early as this week or next, the Senate is expected to vote on a plan to block President Trump's declaration of a national emergency to fund his border wall (the one Mexico was supposed to pay for.) That declaration is far more of an abuse of power than any committed by Obama, including his sweeping action granting protection from deportation to roughly a third of all undocumented immigrants. That order, which went by the acronym of DAPA (Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents), was quite rightly struck down in court.

Trump's move runs roughshod over Congress' power of the purse. Under the Constitution, Congress has the power to decide how and where federal tax dollars are spent. Trump's emergency declaration takes federal tax dollars for military construction and other purposes and retargets them at Trump's border wall, a priority Congress has declined to fund at anything like the level Trump demands.

So far, four Republican senators have said they would vote to block the president's power grab. One of them, Rand Paul, of Kentucky, says that at least 10 would eventually. If so, that would be a far stronger showing than the mere 13 of the 197 Republicans in the House of Representatives who already voted to block Trump.

Regardless of the stronger showing of backbone among Republican senators, their votes are not expected to be enough to override Trump's certain veto. A strong showing by Republican senators will be a rebuke to the president and hopefully a sign of things to come if the president continues to defy constitutional norms.

But the fact remains than the overwhelming majority of Republicans are likely to cave. They can't help it. They are afraid of Trump.

If a future Democratic president declares an emergency on gun control or climate change, it will be hard for these Republicans to take principled stands without invoking laughter. On that day, it will be clear that when Republicans sided with Trump, after mounting such a stink about Obama, they not only wounded their party, they undermined their country and the Constitution.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's crusade to take on the Washington establishment is now a comic book specially crafted for the cross section of comic fans and political junkies. Alexandria Cortez and the Freshman Force: New Party Who Dis, out May 15 from Devil’s Due comics, features the stories of AOC and other progressive women shaking up the halls of Congress, created by dozens of artists from across the country.

“The stories run the gamut from cute and sweet, to cathartic venting stories, to just irreverent fun plots, all with the general theme that this is a pro-AOC, pro-new Congress project,” Devil’s Due publisher Josh Blaylock told VICE. As of yet, there's no over-aching plot the stories build toward, but each give their own interpretation of this current moment in politics. In a page given to TMZ, AOC is a super-jacked wrestler who defeats her former Democratic opponent Joe Crowley in the ring and then bumps into an even-more-jacked Nancy Pelosi with a six-pack in the locker room.

Ocasio-Cortez wasn't involved in making the book, but when TMZ tracked her down in the halls of Congress on Wednesday to get her take she said, ""It’s an honor people would put so much of their time and talent into that all on their own. I’m especially honored that they’re donating the proceeds to Raices Texas [a non-profit that provides legal services to immigrants and refugees] for immigration protections. So that part of the project, if it can benefit communities that need it, that’s really amazing."" When asked what she thought about being a wrestler in one of the stories she said, ""I’m just a normal person doing her best. If I can be that for a little girl somewhere where she can see herself being a superhero, I think that’s important for all of us to see we all have a super hero inside of us.""





The comic's subtitle, ""New Party Who Dis,"" is from an AOC tweet she sent in January responding to old-school former Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman, who told Fox Business he “hopes she’s not the future” of the party.

""That was an awesome lightning-in-a-bottle moment,” Blaylock said. ""It was hilarious to see Joe Lieberman, a perfect example of this tired old outdated system, commenting on the future, and Ocasio-Cortez with such a millennial response."" But what really “lit a fire” under Blaylock to work on this project was a tweet from AOC in which she quotes the popular Watchmen graphic novel, sending comic fans into a frenzy. The tweet was in response to a quote tweet that linked back to a Politico article with the headline ""Exasperated Democrats Try To Reign In Ocasio-Cortez."" She wrote: To quote Alan Moore: ""None of you understand. I’m not locked up in here with YOU. You’re locked up in here with ME.”

""When I saw her Alan Moore quote, on top of her jumping into a feed of a guy playing Donkey Kong 64 to talk about trans rights, and seeing that she’s a League of Legends fan, I thought there’s too much nerd press going on here,"" Blaylock said. ""If we don’t do this right now somebody else is going to beat us to it.""

Blaylock got the book on the radar of comic book stores just in time for a May release and started calling up dozens of friends in the comic world. ""The response was immediately great. We have a great diverse group of talent,"" he said. ""We have people from all over the country, and I’m excited to see everything coming in."" Contributing artists are also some of the biggest heavy-weights in the industry, like Jill Thompson, known for her work on Wonder Woman comics, and Tim Seeley, whose working on G.I. Joe and Transformers comics.

The comic, which according to the website is printed on recycled unpaid medical bills, features witty references and hot takes on a cast of political characters, from entrenched players like Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders, and Mitch McConnell, to Ocasio-Cortez’s fellow wave-makers Ayanna Pressley, Massachusetts's first black congresswoman, Kyrsten Sinema, the first openly bisexual Senator, and Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, the first Muslim women elected to Congress. The first two Native American congresswomen, Sharice Davids and Debra Haaland, are also part of the ""Freshman Force."" It's currently a one-off project with two different cover image options, one where AOC rocks a superwoman-esque 'fit tackling an elephant to the ground, and another where she hits the same moves in a power suit.



The book is meant to capture the excitement of those ready for a change of guard in Congress. “I feel like we’re having an intervention, like someone sitting a family member down saying, ‘Look we have a problem and we need to fix it right now. There’s no more tip toeing around these issues,’” Blaylock said.

“There are so many issues that so many of us have wanted to see addressed that have been completely ignored by all politicians it seems,"" added Blaylock. ""And now to have 100 people in there—obviously we haven’t heard from all of them—but just to see such a good mix of representation and hear conversations happening now about topics we’re really all concerned with, I like to say it’s been a jolt of smelling salts to a comatose system.”

Michael Cohen on Wednesday delivered a sharp warning to Donald Trump and the Republican party that the president faces legal and political peril on at least two fronts.

First, the Trump-Russia investigation.

Cohen became the first Trump associate to allege that, in 2016, Trump knew in advance that his eldest son, Donald Jr, was meeting Russians promising dirt on Hillary Clinton – and that WikiLeaks would be releasing emails stolen from Democrats by Russian operatives.

Moreover, Cohen hinted that Robert Mueller, the special counsel currently wrapping up a two-year inquiry into whether Trump’s team coordinated with Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, may have proof.

Cohen was asked by Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Florida Democrat forced to resign as party chairwoman over the WikiLeaks disclosures, how they could corroborate his explosive allegations, which are based on remarks he says he overheard in Trump’s office.

“I suspect that the special counsel’s office and other government agencies have the information you’re seeking,” Cohen said. Trump denied both allegations in his written answers to questions from Mueller.

Cohen also reiterated that Trump lied repeatedly to the American public during the 2016 campaign by saying he had no dealings with Russia. In fact, Cohen has told prosecutors, Trump was keenly pursuing a lucrative tower in Moscow until June 2016.

Trump’s former fixer cautioned that he could not prove the “collusion” with Moscow that the president vehemently denies. Still there was, Cohen said, “something odd” about the affectionate back-and-forth Trump had with Vladimir Putin in public remarks over the years.

“There are just so many dots that seem to lead in the same direction,” he said.





Michael Cohen was a lawyer for Donald Trump from 2006 until 2018. He was a vice-president of The Trump Organization, and was part of Trump’s campaign team for the 2016 presidential election. Considered a close friend and confidant of the US president, Cohen faced criminal charges for his work for Trump.

In August 2018 Cohen pleaded guilty to eight counts of campaign finance violations, tax fraud, and bank fraud, admitting that on the eve of the 2016 presidential election he made a $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels, and arranged for a $150,000 payment to the former Playboy model Karen McDougal.

Cohen also admitted lying during campaign about a Trump property deal in Russia. He is one of of five of Trump’s presidential aides to have been found to have broken the law.

He was sentenced to three years in prison in December 2018, and was also ordered to pay nearly $2m in fines and restitution requirements.

Having previously described himself as “the guy who would take a bullet for the president”, when sentenced, Cohen said “I have been living in a personal and mental incarceration ever since the day that I accepted the offer to work for a real estate mogul whose business acumen that I deeply admired. I know now, in fact, there is little to be admired.”

The 52 year old is married with two children, and has, over the years flipped between being a member of both the Democrats and the Republicans. He is expected to report to jail in May 2019.

The extent to which Mueller’s findings will be made public is unclear. Justice department policy is that a sitting president may not be charged with crimes. But Democrats have vowed to get their hands on the full report – and launch impeachment proceedings if necessary.

Second, Cohen continues to implicate Trump in a criminal conspiracy to violate campaign finance laws – and on Wednesday dragged Donald Jr in as well.

Cohen released copies of cheques signed by both Trumps that, he said, were reimbursements for payments he made to buy the silence of Stormy Daniels, a pornographic actor who alleged she had an affair with Trump.

Federal prosecutors in New York allege the payments amounted to an illegal scheme, using undisclosed funds to protect Trump’s presidential campaign. Cohen, who is due to go to prison in May for three years, pleaded guilty to involvement in the scheme – and alleged that Trump directed him to commit the campaign finance crime.",Cohen's explosive allegations suggest danger for Trump on two fronts,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/cohen-apos-explosive-allegations-suggest-183909245.html

Feinstein was confronted by the climate advocacy group, Sunrise Movement, accompanied with dozens of children to convince her to vote “yes” on the Green New Deal.

But it didn’t go the way those children thought it would.

Not only is Ocasio-Cortez facing a lot of pushback from Republicans and some Democrats, she’s even being criticized by people who are actually further left than she is.

According to Green Party member Howie Hawkins, Ocasio-Cortez didn’t even come up with the idea of the Green New Deal. In an interview with the New Republic, Hawkins said, “I’m the original Green New Dealer.” Dario Hunter, another party member, accused the freshman congresswoman of severely watering down the language of the proposal, saying, ""It pales in comparison to ours.”

263,Empty,2019-02-27T10:35:56Z,The Democratic socialist star came to D.C. to ‘swing for the fences’ and fix America,"If Democrats had wanted to troll the GOP, they could hardly have cooked up a better legislator than Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She, of course, is the Northeast-educated, Bernie-supporting, wall-protesting, community-organizing daughter of a working-class Puerto Rican family. Born in the Bronx, she was — until right around the time that she took the primary in New York’s 14th District from a 10-term incumbent — waiting tables and bartending at a taco joint called Flats Fix. Her striking features are almost impossibly symmetrical, her outlook millennial, and her answers pointed and well-constructed. Today, she wears a hot-pink pantsuit, which wouldn’t bear mentioning — this being 2019 and all — if it weren’t for the obvious fact that a hot-pink pantsuit intends to announce itself.

It’s barely lunchtime in Washington, D.C., and Ocasio-Cortez has already attended a rally to end the government shutdown and taken to Twitter to, among other things, call out the Daily Caller for its cozy relationship with white supremacists, call out Tucker Carlson for his cozy relationship with the Daily Caller, remind everyone to “#LegalizeIt” and “demand justice for communities ravaged by the War on Drugs,” and take media outlets to task for reporting on fake nudes of her with headlines that obscure whether they were fake (@DailyCaller, “This is not an apology”). When our conversation is interrupted by her need to hustle to the House floor for a vote, we continue it the next day in a gilded room in the Capitol, not far from Nancy Pelosi’s office — though far enough for Ocasio-Cortez to get momentarily lost and set on by tourists, who all wanted selfies with Congress’ social media star. True to form, she gave the people what they wanted.

When was the last time you experienced sexism?

[Mimes looking at watch] Um, 10 a.m.

Oh, no, really?

I mean, that [fake nude photo] tweet, you know? It’s so funny. I’m like, “Man, I do do a lot of Instagram stories, but I don’t remember doing that.” But it speaks so much to the work that we still have to do when it comes to women’s rights. When the president says that he has sexually assaulted women, they just shrug their shoulders, but when there’s a rumor that a woman may have had the audacity to take a photo of herself, they’re up in arms. I’d like to say ‘Don’t respond to it,’ but we cannot pretend that these far-right outlets are not driving some of the most subversive and destructive narratives, and we cannot pretend like those narratives have not gained steam. They have hijacked the presidency.

And the political conversation.

Exactly. And so I may not want to respond to it. We may not like the fact that these things that were not worth our time 10 years ago are worth our time now, given the subversive power they’ve built. But I think that they are worth a response.

In your ability to galvanize your supporters through social media, you have been compared to Donald Trump.

Well, I think that there’s this rush to make that comparison, but any time media fundamentally changes, the first movers to recognize that change — and to learn it and to adapt to it — tend to have that first-move advantage. So this is less about personality, less about Trump, and more about who has had the first-mover advantage. But there are similarities. People who succeed in social media follow similar tenets. In order to resonate with people, you have to tell them what you mean, you have to be willing to make mistakes, you have to be willing to be vulnerable and learn as you go.

You originally wanted to be an OB-GYN. Why did you make the switch?

I had spent time living in West Africa while I was an undergrad, helping midwives deliver babies in the Sahara, and I contracted malaria while I was there. In the developing world, malaria is an economic disease. It’s a disease that impacts so many people as to be actually impacting national GDP, so I started thinking about these health issues as more macro-economic public-policy issues.

But I was personally impacted when my father passed away in the heat of the financial crisis, and I graduated college and was waitressing. The thing that people don’t understand about restaurants is that they’re one of the most political environments. You’re shoulder-to-shoulder with immigrants. You’re at one of the nexuses of income inequality. Your hourly wage is even less than the minimum wage. You’re working for tips. You’re getting sexually harassed. You see how our food is processed and handled. You see how the prices of things change. It was a very galvanizing political experience for me.

When you quit your waitressing job, what did you tell your boss? Were you like, “I’m quitting because I’m gonna be in Congress”?

Yeah, I was keeping mum about my campaign for a long time but…

You were doing double duty.

Oh, yeah, probably a whole year, at least. Some of the people that I worked with knew because they were my friends, and one day the general manager of the restaurant overheard somebody talking about me running, and he came over and said, “Is it true?” I kinda nodded. And he just gave me this big hug and was like, “Let me know what you need.”

You’ve taken the mantle from Pelosi when it comes to absorbing the heat for the Democratic Party. Does it get to you?

I was cracking up because I was actually talking to a Republican House member on the floor, and he’s like, “Are you a communist?” And then he was like, “It’s OK if you are.” And I just started laughing because that is exactly how Fox News wants to go.

But do you court the controversy? Are you trying to engage in a dialogue where you are going toe-to-toe with Trump?

I do think that we’ve been taking it too much. I think we’ve been tolerating the intolerable. And I remember, you know, just being a constituent, like, “Where’s the fight back on some of these issues?” What the president is trying to do is undermine truth itself. Just because I’m pushing back on reporters calling women unlikable doesn’t mean that I think their outlet itself is “fake.” There’s a huge difference between checking a narrative and checking an actual institution. That’s how you get climate deniers being treated just as seriously as venerable scientists.

So when it comes to welcoming [controversy], I think it’s fine. Frankly, part of change is conflict. And I told this to other members too: If they want to direct their firepower to me, then whatever. I’m in a very blue district. Better me than someone else. For the most part, it doesn’t bother me. The last 24 hours have gotten to me because their hysteria is now getting manifested in sexism and bigotry. That’s where I will fight back.

Would you vote to impeach Trump?

Yeah. No question. No question. I don’t even know why it’s controversial. I mean, OK, it’s not that I don’t know why it’s controversial. I understand that some people come from very tough districts where their constituents are torn. But for me and my community in the Bronx and Queens, it’s easy.

Everyone wants it.

Yeah, everyone wants it.

You have only been here about a week or so, but have you had any conversations with Republicans about why they stick by him?

Well, in the Republican Party, there’s a hostage situation going on. There are a lot of Republicans that know what the right thing to do is — not just on impeachment but on a wide range of issues — and they refuse to speak up.

Because it would be political suicide.

Because to them, yeah, they can’t do it. To me, it’s an unacceptable position, because we’re not in the realm of politics anymore. These are not questions of politics. These are questions of society. These are questions of equal treatment. These are questions of civil rights.

Wouldn’t you rather have Republicans in office who know what the right thing is behind closed doors versus those people speaking up and losing their seats to people who are truly in agreement with Trump?

The problem is that if they vote the same way, what does it matter? I don’t care what’s in your heart if how you are voting is the same as someone who is actually racist. At the end of the day, they think that their intentions are gonna save them, but the actual decisions you make matter. I am tired of people saying, “I’m gonna vote the same way as bigots, but I don’t share the ideology of bigots.” Well, you share the action and the agenda of bigots. We need to hold that accountable.

How much of what you’re talking about is trying to move the Overton window [the range of ideas accepted in public discourse] so that Democrats can compete with the way Republicans have moved it?

A huge part of my agenda is to move the Overton window, because it’s a strategic position. I’m a first-term freshman in an institution that works by seniority. Procedurally, it is kind of like high school. You’re the new kid on the block. So, as a freshman, you have to look at the tools available to you, and in my first term, if we have the opportunity to frame the debate, then that is one of the ways to have the most power. If I’m here for four days, then the most powerful thing I can do is to create a national debate on marginal tax rates on the rich.

How much have you hung out with Bernie Sanders since you’ve been here? Have you gone out to get a beer?

Well, we haven’t gotten a beer since I’ve gotten here, but [during my campaign] I was able to pick his brain and ask him for advice.

What was his advice?

One of the functional pieces of advice was just that you spend a lot of time in your committee, so it’s really important to pick a subject that you’re passionate about.

And you just got named to the Financial Services Committee.

Yeah, it’s not official yet, but it’s looking pretty good. That was in my top three picks. It’s a pretty powerful committee in terms of what it can regulate. I’m excited about it.

What would you like to see accomplished in 2019?

What we have to do is redefine what the climate movement is about, and we have to re-define it in the scope of environmental justice. For so long, people have thought of climate-change legislation as saving polar bears, but they don’t think of the pipes in Flint. They don’t think of the air in the Bronx. They don’t think of coal miners getting cancer in West Virginia. When we talk about defining the scope, we have to talk about climate as a social-justice issue, as an economic-justice issue and as an environ-mental issue. We really want to lay some stakes in the ground that say, “If your legislation is not dealing with jobs, if it’s not dealing with infrastructure, if it’s not dealing with bringing justice to frontline communities, then it’s not a Green New Deal.” And we have a majority in the House, so why not swing for the fences?

I hope that works.

I know, me too. Call your representative.

You are my representative! [Laughs]

Yeah, that’s right!

Don’t worry, I’ll be calling. You initially said that you wanted to see more options when it came to House leadership. When and how did that change?

Well, no real options came up. And then I started to see a resistance to then-leader, now-Speaker [Pelosi] coming from the more conservative flank of her party, trying to take this narrative of “Oh, yeah, we need change,” but trying to take this change into a more kind of corporate-sponsored direction. Nancy Pelosi was the most progressive candidate in that field. That, first and foremost, is what I’m going to support.

Do you see common ground?

Absolutely. One thing that is notable about the speaker is that she does believe that the Democratic Party should be a progressive party. She is in the difficult position of having to juggle all of these different wings within the party, but her personal politics are very progressive. I have not found an issue where we are really opposed.

Have you had some one-on-one interactions with her?

Yeah, I have sat down with her several times and emphasized how important climate is to the agenda. She was one of the first Democrats to really push this issue years ago.

Do you worry that she’s been in politics so long that she will be too quick to compromise?

I do think that as a party we compromise too much. I don’t think it’s necessarily all on her, because she can only push as much as she can coalition-build. That’s why I see a special responsibility in my role in kind of shifting the conversation, so that all the members feel a little bit more pressure, because we’re amplifying what voters already feel. I was running in a district that was deep blue, and the representation that we were getting was not as progressive as the actual electorate. When [congresspeople] start feeling more of that conversation coming from their districts, they’ll have more liberty to move, which will then give the speaker more liberty to compromise less and push harder. Especially when it comes to the environment, but also on a wide range of issues.

What would you be willing to compromise on?

I don’t want to compromise where we’re going, but I’m willing to compromise on how we get there. I believe in single-payer health care, so that every American is covered with physical, mental and dental health care that is free of cost. That’s my vision. If I lobby the caucus enough so that our most conservative members fight for a public option, that’s a huge win.

Do you worry about splintering the party, this idea that you’re not just trolling Republicans, you’re also trolling Democrats? You’re doing all kinds of trolling! [Laughs]

Well, I don’t worry about splintering the party, but as I’ve said in the past, we can’t just be a party of the most basic rights. It shouldn’t be a political statement to say we should all be treated equally. The fact that that is partisan upsets me. I believe that both parties need to be on the same page when it comes to racial justice, queer rights, marriage equality, all of it. These should not be partisan issues, they should be universal rights. And so we need to champion those things, but we need to go a lot further. Especially when it comes to expanding our rights to economic dignity.

Many Americans are really worried about the economic state of this country, where people working full-time jobs cannot support their families. It’s astounding to me that this is not seen as a national crisis.

Well, we have never gotten out of desperate situations in this country with a scarcity mindset. We have never austerity’d our way to prosperity, ever. It’s never happened. The only way we got out of the Great Depression is through a massive injection of public investment, and also a massive expansion in public ambition and the idea of what is possible in America. We’re not gonna get out of this through incrementalism. We need moonshots.

What do you think you know that the old guard doesn’t?

One of the things that I bring to the table is a visceral understanding that people under 40 have been shaped by an entirely different set of events. We’ve literally grown up in different Americas. They were shaped by a Cold War America, a post-World War II America; and we are an Iraq War America, a 9/11 America, a hyper-capitalism-has-never-worked-for-us, Great Recession America. People are used to talking about millennials as if we’re teenagers. We’re in our thirties now. We’re raising kids and getting married and having families, and we have mortgages and student-loan debt. It’s important that [Congress is] in touch. People tend to interpret this as me railing against older people and being ageist. But that’s not what this is about. It’s a problem of representation. We don’t have enough intergenerational representation. We largely have one generation. That’s not to say that one generation should be out of power, it’s that others should be here as well.

Do you still have student-loan debt?

Of course I do, yeah! I’m 29 years old.

What’s the last thing that made you really angry? And how do people harness that anger so that we can make it productive?

Especially women. Because we’re not allowed to be angry.

Exactly. Or ugly or fat or opinionated.

Yep. You’re just allowed to be pretty and quiet. And then as a woman of color, too, it’s even more of a stereotype. Where even if you’re not being angry, they’ll attribute anger to you.

Right.

The last time I was pissed was the president’s bullshit border address, watching this guy just be racist from the Oval Office. I saw it as a defilement. In terms of how we channel it, we just take that anger and that energy and use it to say, “This is why we need the moonshot.”

Do you worry that in pushing the Democratic Party more left, you’re only going to polarize the country more?

I think it’s wrong to say that what I’m proposing is polarizing the country. What we are seeing now is a ruling class of corporations and a very small elite that have captured government. The Koch brothers own every Republican in the Senate. They own ’em. They don’t cast a vote unless their sugar daddies tell ’em what to do. But 70 percent of Americans believe in Medicare for all. Ninety percent of Americans believe we need to get money out of politics. Eighty-something [percent] believe that climate change is a real, systemic and urgent problem. Sixty-seven percent of Americans believe that immigrants are a positive force in the United States of America. I believe that I’m fighting for the American consensus.

You told Anderson Cooper you want people to underestimate you because that’s how you won your primary. When is it safe to let that go and unabashedly take charge?

People like to make these disparaging statements, like, “Oh, she’s good at Twitter. Is she gonna be an actual legislator?” I think it’s fine at the outset to be underestimated in that capacity. Where I do tell people to come correct is when they try to paint me as unintelligent, as unsubstantive. That’s when you see me fire back. When you call Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris “unlikable,” that’s an unsubstantial, unsubstantive, fluff, bullshit, misogynistic word to use. Unlikable? What is that? It’s not a policy critique. Paul Ryan was a con man for 10 years, and he was called a wunderkind for policies that were designed to just gut working families dry. But I’m the charlatan. So . . .

You’re 29, and you’re in Congress. Where do you go from here?

I have no idea. I mean, I go where people tell me to go, and I mean, like, the People.

Not just any people.

Near Baghouz (Syria) (AFP) - US-backed forces evacuated over 40 truckloads of people from the Islamic State group's last Syria redoubt on Monday, as they sought to clear out civilians before a final push to crush the jihadists.

The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have slowed down their offensive on the final pocket due to the presence of civilians, with just a scrap of the IS ""caliphate"" remaining from a territory that once spanned Syria and Iraq.

An AFP correspondent saw more than 46 trucks crammed with men, women and children, approaching an SDF outpost, 20 kilometres (12 miles) north of the jihadist redoubt.

One vehicle was packed with women clad in black and men who covered their faces. Wounded people were also among the latest evacuees.

Holdout IS fighters and civilians, mostly relatives of jihadists, are trapped in less than half a square kilometre in the village of Baghouz near the Iraqi border.

The Kurdish-led SDF evacuated nearly 5,000 men, women and children from the jihadist redoubt on Wednesday and Friday, but none over the weekend.

Earlier on Monday, SDF spokesman Mustefa Bali, told AFP that thousands remained inside the IS pocket.

""According to what we heard from those who have left, there are nearly 5,000 people still inside,"" Bali said.

At the SDF screening point outside the village, SDF fighters expressed hopes that Monday's arrivals would be the last one.

""We want it to be over,"" Mazloum, a 29 year-old SDF fighter told AFP.

""Every day we say today is the day but we hope it will all end today and not tomorrow,"" he said.

- 'Secret' transfers -

Kurdish foreign affairs official Abdel Karim Omar told AFP on Monday that the SDF will announce the end of the IS proto-state ""in the next few days"".

""But this does not mean that we have eliminated terrorism, which must be eradicated at the roots,"" he said.

Beyond Baghouz, IS still has thousands of fighters and sleeper cells across several countries.

In Syria, it retains a presence in the vast Badia desert, and the jihadists have claimed deadly attacks in SDF-held territory.

Thousands of suspected IS fighters have attempted to blend in with civilians fleeing the crumbling ""caliphate"".

According to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, around 46,000 people, including thousands of jihadists, have streamed out of the Baghouz pocket since early December.

The SDF screens those exiting at an outpost outside the village to weed out potential IS fighters.

After being vetted, women, children, and men not suspected of belonging to the extremist group are transported north to the Kurdish-run camp of Al-Hol, while suspected jihadists are sent to SDF-held detention centres.

The Observatory on Monday said that 1,400 people, mainly IS relatives, were secretly transported from orchards on the outskirts of Baghouz to neighbouring Iraq over the past 24 hours.

Kurdish foreign affairs official did not confirm the transfer, but denied that the SDF was responsible.

""In principle, we do not hand over any person passing through our territories to Iraqi authorities or any other party,"" Omar said.

Such transfers can only happen if they were trucked from Baghouz ""by another party"", he explained, without specifying.

Baghdad on Sunday said the SDF have transferred 280 Iraqi nationals accused of fighting alongside IS to Iraqi authorities.

Fourteen suspected French jihadists were among those transferred, an Iraqi government source told AFP on Monday.

Hisham al-Hashemi, an Iraqi expert with intimate knowledge of the issue, said the transfer had taken place in coordination with the US-led coalition fighting IS.

- Criticism of international response -

The mass outpouring of men, women and children from the IS foothold has overwhelmed the Kurdish-run Al-Hol camp, six hours north of Baghouz.

""The international community is not currently taking responsibility towards the large number of people leaving the last IS pocket, especially children,"" Omar said.

The International Rescue Committee said Friday that new arrivas had pushed the camp's population to over 45,000, exacerbating already dire conditions at the crammed facility.

At least 78 people, mostly children, have died on the way to the camp or shortly after arriving in recent weeks, the IRC said.

A warehouse fire on Friday caused by a gas cylinder explosion ""destroyed 200 family tents"" and five larger ones and injured 16 workers, it said.

The UN's humanitarian coordination office OCHA on Friday warned the camp was struggling to keep up with the flood of evacuees.",Syria force carries out major evacuation from last IS holdout,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/syria-force-carries-major-evacuation-last-holdout-144732631.html

SAN FRANCISCO — In a show of force aimed at locking down support in California — an early primary state critical to her 2020 hopes — Sen. Kamala Harris on Tuesday announced the backing of a score of Democratic California statewide officers.

The Harris campaign Tuesday is set to announce the backing of Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, state Secretary of State Alex Padilla, State Treasurer Fiona Ma, Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond and Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara, POLITICO has learned.

Story Continued Below

Harris’ latest endorsements in delegate-rich California, provided to POLITICO, come just weeks after Gov. Gavin Newsom announced his backing of her 2020 bid.

The crowd of endorsements is just the latest in Harris’ aggressive efforts to dominate California, the nation’s most populous state — in which a potential mother lode of delegates is at stake on March 3 in the Super Tuesday early primary. Harris, the former state attorney general, is the only Californian in the 2020 White House race, but Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell — who has family roots in Iowa and has visited the state more than 15 times — has edged closer to a run that he has hinted could be official by the end of April.

Last week, Rep. Ro Khanna, a prominent Democrat from Silicon Valley, announced he would co-chair the 2020 campaign of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

From California’s political ATM, Harris has been scooping up campaign cash in recent weeks at high-dollar fundraisers in Hollywood and the San Francisco Bay Area, but she must also compete with Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who have both been highly successful fundraisers in the state, for California donors’ attention. And California is now being crisscrossed by candidates like New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who was in Silicon Valley last weekend.

Earlier his month, Harris’ team rounded up the endorsements of 20 state Senate Democrats, including Senate President Pro Tempore Toni Atkins.

Along with the endorsements of four California members of Congress — Barbara Lee, Ted Lieu, Nanette Barragan, and Katie Hill — Harris now has the support of 21 of the state Senate’s 28 Democrats, 75 percent of the caucus. Newsom, Lee and labor/civil rights leader Dolores Huerta serve as California co-chairs for Harris’ campaign.

Kounalakis, the former ambassador to Hungary in the Obama administration, and California’s first female lieutenant governor, said in a statement, “Kamala paved the way for women, including myself, to run for elected office, and win. I couldn’t be more enthusiastic for her presidency.”

State Secretary of State Padilla said Harris, the former state AG, “has been out front on the issues that matter, including defending our right to vote, strengthening our nation’s security, and protecting immigrant communities. As president, she will uphold the American dream.”

Political observers said that Harris‘ early efforts to show her dominance in California are aimed at sending a message to other Democrats in the crowded 2020 race about her strength in the nation’s most populous state.

But some, including veteran Democratic strategist Garry South, have said that Harris’ aggressive efforts to rack up a show of support in her home state don’t guarantee her an advantage in the race, even with the early primary.

“The last [Democratic] Californian who ran for president and won the primary was Jerry Brown — in 1976,’’ he said.

Even as a former governor, Brown, who ran for president three times, failed to win the primary in 1980 and 1992. A more crowded Democratic field and lively competition from four other women in the race so far — Warren, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard — will make it even more challenging for Harris, he said.

The class of Democratic governors that swept to victory in three key Midwestern states has some advice for Democratic presidential candidates: Keep it simple. Don’t overpromise.

And most important, don’t ignore their states.

Story Continued Below

Democratic Govs. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania and Tony Evers of Wisconsin aren't known for fiery rhetoric. But in interviews with POLITICO on the sidelines of the National Governors Association’s winter meetings, the three Democrats — all from states President Donald Trump pried out of the Democratic presidential coalition in 2016 — stressed in uncharacteristically pointed language the importance of drilling down on issues that affect people every day, like health care, education and infrastructure, to reassemble a winning Democratic electoral map in 2020.

The governors’ incremental recommendations put them at odds with the ascendant left in the Democratic Party, which is pushing expansive environmental and health care policies like the Green New Deal and “Medicare for All.” But most of all, Whitmer, whose direct “fix the damn roads” campaign slogan helped her to an easy victory in 2018, said 2020 Democrats need to start just by showing their faces in the states that sent Trump to the White House. Hillary Clinton infamously spent little time campaigning in Michigan or Wisconsin after the primaries in 2016.

“What any candidate should do in any race, frankly, is to show up,” Whitmer said. “There’s no special, secret sauce there. It’s about having real conversations with real people, and when you do that you stay tethered to the things that matter. And that’s what people want.”

Wolf, who coasted to a second term in Pennsylvania, said Democrats need to make that face-to-face pitch to rebuild trust in their party.

“I think before anybody starts talking about issues we’ve got a trust problem,” Wolf said, adding: “If I’m 100 percent of where you want me to be on policy but you don’t trust me you won’t support me.”

“People voted in ’16 to blow it up,” Wolf continued. “And it’s up to either party to come back in 2020 with candidates who can convince voters that they can put it back together.”

Evers, the former education superintendent in Wisconsin who beat Republican incumbent Scott Walker by less than 30,000 votes last year, urged fellow Democrats to home in on health care, education, and infrastructure — and not to promise the moon.

“I think the important thing for me is someone that is willing to address those issues in a proactive way but also make people feel comfortable that they can actually accomplish something,” Evers said.

“Treat[ing] people with dignity and respect and not being hard-edged about everything — I think it’s important,” Evers added. “People like their leaders to be reasonable and find common ground.”

Winning back these three Midwestern states, which went Democratic in six straight presidential elections from 1992 to 2012 but flipped to Trump by less than 1 percentage point apiece in 2016, is the clearest path back to the White House for Democrats, though the party will also target some fast-changing states in the South and Southwest.

Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar has made her electoral success in Minnesota a key piece of her campaign, while appealing to white working-class Midwesterners is central to the rationales of Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and former Vice President Joe Biden as they consider presidential campaigns.

They would face intense competition from more strident ideologues in the Democratic presidential field, as did the governors now offering their advice to the candidates. Evers was never regarded as the most exciting candidate among eight in his Democratic primary in Wisconsin last year. Whitmer, meanwhile, fielded criticism for being too conservative on health care compared to her opponents for the Democratic nomination in Michigan, and Wolf has forged a relatively low national profile in his fifth year as governor of Pennsylvania, where he has largely stayed out of intraparty policy fights.

But even as their party gears up for an ideological and potentially divisive presidential primary, the governors preached unity among Democrats.

“I don’t think there’s a big fundamental disagreement of what we ought to do,” Wolf said.

Evers noted that health care was a winning issue for Democrats of all stripes in the midterms. “I’d continue that,” Evers said.

Their states have not gotten a huge amount of personal attention from Democratic presidential candidates so far this year, though Klobuchar recently made a stop in Wisconsin. But Whitmer said she will offer as much help as she can to candidates who want to come to her state.

“I’m going to invite every Democratic candidate who wants to come into Michigan, we’ll make sure they've got all the same access to all the same tools and they should show up and talk to people,” Whitmer said. “And that way, the people of Michigan can make a decision based on who they think is really going to show up for them in the White House.”",Midwest governors to 2020 Dems: ‘Show up’,Politico,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/26/midwestern-governors-2020-advice-1189400

268,Empty,2019-02-25T06:42:23Z,Elections are the hinge connecting social dynamics to India's liberal democratic structures.,"The paradox of the coexistence of democracy and mass poverty is deeper in India than in many other societies. Some of the common reasons why democracies do not care for their poor do not hold true for India.

First of all, the institutional design of Indian democracy (parliamentary system, asymmetrical federalism, flexible Constitution amendment) is not “demos-constraining” in that it does not put significant obstacles to the democratic popular will. There are not too many veto points that might account for the failure of floor-securing social policies to be legislated and implemented.

Some of the common reasons why democracies do not care for their poor do not hold true for India.

Second, the party system is intensely competitive with very high electoral volatility. The first-past-the-post system accentuates the effect of voters’ volatility into dramatic change in seats and government formation. Though the level of volatility has come down in this decade as compared to the previous one, a ruling party in an Indian state has just about a 50% chance of coming back to power. Parties cannot afford to be complacent and overlook issues that might concern a significant proportion of population.

Third, the state capacity in India is higher than most comparable poor countries; it still commands the force to impose its will and is not crippled by absence of resources to meet some of its key projects. All this makes it even more intriguing that the ruling parties/coalitions should not (be able to) muster adequate political will to carry out anti-poverty policies.

Finally, what makes it truly intriguing is that the poor have not opted out of democratic politics in India, at least not from routine participation in electoral politics.

…

Why elections have gained primacy in Indian democracy

Across countries in terms of the impact of the electoral system, the structure of political choices offered by the party system, the social basis of political preferences, agenda-setting and public opinion formation, the invisible role of issues and ideologies, interests and identities are seen to be the keys to making sense of elections.

Yet we simply assume that elections perform the same role everywhere. The end result of this similarity is that the experience of electoral politics in societies like India is interpreted in the light of the narrow historical experience of Western Europe and North America.

Hence the need to understand the distinctiveness of the Indian experience of elections.

One of the first things that strikes any observer of Indian elections is their centrality in India’s political life. Banners, posters, and crowds fill the streets; massive processions and rallies are a norm; the media is full of election news and every street corner is buzzing with political gossip. Though on a steady decline of late, this kind of visibility in Indian elections symbolises the pivotal role elections have come to play in Indian politics.

If tension between pre-existing social form and borrowed legal-political structure provides the basic frame for understanding Indian democracy, the history of Indian politics is an attempt by millions of ordinary people to write their own political agenda in an alien script.

An election is an occasion for the transfer of energy and resources from the “unorganised” to the “organised” sector of democracy.

An encounter such as this, if it is to lead to meaningful outcomes, requires bridges or hinges that connect the two different worlds.

The institution of elections came to perform this crucial role in India. It became the hinge that connected the existing social dynamics to the new political structures of liberal democracy, allowing for reciprocal influence. An election is often the site for a fusion of popular beliefs and political practices with high institutions of governance.

Thus an election is an occasion for the transfer of energy and resources from the “unorganised” to the “organised” sector of democracy. This is the moment when the legal-constitutional order of liberal democracy makes contact with the messy social and political reality of India. The “formal” sector is highly visible, it leads a legal-constitutional existence, it involves “civil society” groups and NGOs or a certain segment of political parties, it speaks a familiar modern language, mobilises secular identities and is easy to incorporate into a global register of democracy, even if it draws modest energy and participation.

Every political actor is aware of another “informal” sector, often seen as a source of embarrassment. Political organisations and movements that inhibit this sector speak a homespun hybrid language and fall back upon identity-based mobilisation. Though political practices in this sector lead an invisible, often paralegal, existence below the radar, this sector remains the most happening political site in terms of popular mobilisation and energy. The chasm that separates the two worlds and the absence or non-functioning of the other possible bridges has resulted in the unusual salience of the institution of elections.

This unique role is what accounts for the continued dynamism of the electoral process in India, while a number of other imported institutions and processes are floundering.

A festival of collective identity

Elections in India perform many more functions. For a postcolonial country like India, successful elections are still a symbol of a national political community, something of a festival of collective identity. For the poor and the marginalised, who are excluded from the normal functioning of the state, elections are an affirmation of their citizenship and are seen as a sacred ritual of political equality. Notwithstanding a robust media that routinely uses public opinion polls, elections are still the principal site for the dissemination of political ideas and information and also the only reliable method to gauge public opinion on the big issues facing the country.

Elections force political parties to consider ideas, interests, and entities that do not lend themselves to easy aggregation through instrumentalities of the “organised” sector. Thus, elections often appear as the only bridge between the people and power, as the only reality check in the political system.

Elections often appear as the only bridge between the people and power, as the only reality check in the political system.

Elections are also an occasion for settling, unsettling or resettling local equations of social dominance and the arena of struggles for social identity and dignity. Elections are a site for contestation for social dominance in a locality, leading to assertion by dominant social groups and protests by subaltern groups.

Attempts by clever political entrepreneurs to manufacture a social majority often involve building a local coalition of castes and communities. This often leads to an invention of community boundaries and sometimes the jerrymandering of settled boundaries. In a micro as well as macro setting, elections are an occasion for distribution and redistribution of resources. This is the time for patronage distribution as well as the occasion for the ordinary citizens to collect their “dues” from the political class.

All this accounts for the festival-like character of the Indian elections and the fierceness with which they are contested here. At the same time, this compression of multiple decisions into a single act also results in an under-emphasis on the representational functions of elections.

Doug Jones could be gifted another unlikely victory.

Moore, 72, a former state judge, made the rounds at last Friday’s Alabama Republican Party dinner gala. A few days later, a new political action committee run by Moore’s son, Caleb Moore, issued an email fundraising appeal.

Republican insiders, including conservative allies of President Trump, fret that Moore — derailed by sexual assault allegations in a 2017 special election that should have been an easy layup — might divide the party in the primary and advance to a rematch with Jones. On Wednesday, a Moore confidant pointedly declined to rule out that his buddy might run for Senate next year.

""That's a good question,” Dean Young, Moore’s close friend and adviser for the past two decades, told the Washington Examiner when asked if the former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court was preparing to challenge Jones. ""I'm not at liberty to say anything about that right now.""

If Moore runs, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate GOP campaign arm, would take action to block him from the nomination. Otherwise, the NRSC plans to stay out of the Alabama primary.

[Related: Alabama exploring whether Democratic disinformation cost Roy Moore a Senate seat]

""The NRSC’s official stance is ABRM: anyone but Roy Moore,"" said Kevin McLaughlin, the committee's executive director. ""The only thing Doug Jones and I agree on is that his only prayer for electoral success in 2020 is a rematch with Roy Moore.""

Jones narrowly defeated Moore nearly 15 months ago, earning the right to finish the remainder of the six-year term Republican Jeff Sessions won in 2014. Sessions had resigned to become Trump's first attorney general, a post he has since relinquished.

Rep. Bradley Byrne announced his run for Senate last week, becoming the first Republican to throw his hat into the ring against Jones.

Some conservative activists are hunting for a more Trump-friendly Republican, unhappy with Byrne's ties to the GOP establishment. But like the establishment, many conservatives are desperate to avoid another Moore candidacy. Rep. Mo Brooks, a member of the House Freedom Caucus defeated by Moore in the GOP primary in 2017, could satisfy the concerns. The Huntsville-area congressman is privately exploring another bid, despite public pronouncements to the contrary.

But to avoid the sort of divisive primary that led to his defeat and Moore’s nomination, Brooks would only run if he received Trump's endorsement or a pledge of neutrality. In the 2017 primary, Trump backed Luther Strange, who as Session’s temporary appointed successor was the incumbent and had the support of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

[Also read: Alabama is already waving goodbye to its 'fluke' Sen. Doug Jones]

""He's very interested in the race,"" a source close to Brooks said. ""He'd be the clear frontrunner."" Moore is a committed social conservative with a fiercely loyal following.

But even in Alabama, among the most pro-Trump states in the country, the former judge has struggled with rank-and-file Republicans uneasy with his brand of religiously infused politics. Moore fell short in GOP primaries for statewide office in the past, before finally winning one — the special Senate primary. He then promptly lost to Jones.

The new PAC launched by Moore’s son, a self-described political consultant, is an example of what worries establishment Republicans, and conservatives, about the judge.

The group is called Conservative States of America — and the graphic logo on an email fundraising appeal passed along to the Washington Examiner by a GOP consultant reads “C.S.A.,” the abbreviation used ubiquitously during the Civil War to refer to the Confederate States of America.

Caleb Moore, in an interview with the Washington Examiner, defended the name of the PAC and the logo. Moore’s son said the group is a multi-candidate PAC that is not affiliated with his father, although he would not rule out running independent expenditure advertising on Roy Moore’s behalf should he run for Senate.

""I don't even think he knows I'm raising money,"" Caleb Moore said of his father. Regarding the name and logo of the PAC, he said: ""People take things that are actually good and turn them into vices.""",Republican nightmare as Judge Moore signals might run again...,Washingtonexaminer.com,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/gop-nightmare-as-alabamas-roy-moore-signals-he-might-run-again

This is a week replete with challenges for President Donald Trump.

He faces a second summit with North Korea’s leader, a Democratic challenge to his emergency border declaration and public testimony from a key figure in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into alleged Russian election meddling, which could be nearing completion.

Mueller: Michael Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer who has said the president directed him to make illegal hush money payments, is set to testify on what he knows about the 2016 campaign. Border: House Democrats have set a vote for tomorrow on a resolution to block Trump’s emergency declaration to build a wall on the southern U.S. Border with Mexico. The measure will force Republicans to take a stand on whether the president exceeded his authority over federal spending. Summit: The president said yesterday he doesn’t expect to lift sanctions on Kim Jong Un’s regime, as he prepares for a summit with the North Korean leader this week on U.S. demands that Pyongyang end its nuclear program.

Another pressing issue has already been punted. Trump said late yesterday that he’ll extend Friday’s deadline to raise tariffs on Chinese goods, citing “substantial progress” in the latest round of trade talks in Washington.

Global Headlines

Venezuela standoff | U.S. Vice President Mike Pence will meet opposition leader Juan Guaido in Bogota today and plans to announce new actions against Venezuela that may include forms of economic or diplomatic pressure, according to an administration official. Guaido’s efforts to deliver aid convoys to Venezuela from Colombia this weekend were violently quashed by forces loyal to Nicolas Maduro, but nothing has really changed on the ground. The nation is still hungry, scared and wondering what comes next.

Raising the stakes | Theresa May again put off a final parliamentary ballot on her Brexit agreement, this time until March 12, as she seeks concessions from the European Union. But the delay risks further angering ministers who fear the premier’s strategy is pushing the country to the brink of a catastrophic no-deal departure. They’ll have a chance to force her hand on Wednesday, when lawmakers are due to vote on an amendment to delay Brexit to avoid the economic damage of crashing out.

War and peace | Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un might declare a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War during their summit this week in Vietnam, South Korea said. While the move may help fulfill the U.S. leader's pledge to cease “endless wars,” it also risks undercutting arguments for maintaining the American troop presence on the Korean Peninsula.

Taking a hit | Italian Deputy Premier Luigi Di Maio’s Five Star Movement suffered another blow in a regional vote, this time on the island of Sardinia, where exit polls showed the party’s support tumbled. That's bad news for the stability of the alliance with the League because of growing pressure on Di Maio to increase his influence and prove Five Star is getting something out of the governing coalition.

New direction | China’s Politburo laid out a broad outline on how the nation’s more than $40 trillion finance sector should transform itself through supply-side reform – and by further opening up the industry. The government's push to control risk appears to be giving way to a desire to support its economy, as signaled by comments President Xi Jinping made at the gathering of China’s 25 most senior leaders.

What to Watch Today

Nigeria’s electoral commission plans to start announcing state-by-state results from the tight presidential race between the incumbent Muhammadu Buhari and his main challenger, Atiku Abubakar.

And finally ... Algerians have been protesting against President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s decision to seek a fifth term in elections in April. In response to the peaceful rallies – which started Friday and are the biggest in the North African oil producer in years – the new head of the ruling FLN party, Mourad Bouchared, said God had sent the president, now in his 80s and ailing, to look after the country and reform it. Social media pundits saw the humor and the TweetCommeMouad hashtag appeared.

Ex-Clinton staff…","Mr. Rabin-Havt tried to tamp down long-term financial expectations for the Sanders campaign. “It will be remarkable to emulate those 2015 numbers again,” he said.

Separately, Mr. Sanders said during a town hall-style forum on CNN Monday night that he would release 10 years of tax returns “soon,” suggesting he would provide more transparency into his taxes than he did in 2016 when he only released one year of filings. Mr. Sanders said he did not release more returns then because “I didn’t win the nomination.”

“Our tax returns will bore you to death,” he said. “Nothing special about them.”

Money alone is not determinative in presidential politics. In the 2016 Republican primary, a super PAC supporting Jeb Bush burned through $100 million as Mr. Bush finished no better than fourth in any of the first three states. But money does pay for television ads and field staff, and Mr. Sanders’s fund-raising advantage will allow him to take risks and make investments others cannot afford.

“He can build a ground game not just in the first four primary states but into the Super Tuesday states,” Ms. Psaki said. “He can expand his playing field in places like California.”

The Sanders campaign shared new statistics on its donors so far, which skew younger than is typical. An internal analysis showed more than 108,000 of Mr. Sanders’s first day contributors were 39 years old or younger, and they gave a combined $2.5 million of the $5.9 million raised. The most common age for a Sanders contributor was 30. Relatedly, more than $3 million of the donations that first day came from mobile devices, a sign of both shifting habits and the relative youth of his donor base. The campaign did not provide a breakdown by gender.

Mr. Sanders has closely tracked his fund-raising haul, campaign officials said, and Mr. Rabin-Havt said that the senator wrote much of the campaign’s initial 1,400-word email announcement himself.

The email did not explicitly ask for money, instead directing people to sign a petition supporting Mr. Sanders.

However, she has $12 million in the bank left over from her Senate campaign run. | AP Photo/Elise Amendola 2020 Elections Warren creates purity test unseen in modern presidential politics The Massachusetts senator's swearing off of big fundraisers and donor calls puts the rest of the Democratic field in an uncomfortable spot.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s decision to block big donors from having special access to her presidential campaign amounts to voluntary disarmament – a major risk that could send precious dollars to competing campaigns.

But the Warren camp is betting the move to ban donor calls, private donor meetings and high-dollar private fundraisers will elevate her as the principled leader in a crowded primary race, one in which she has issued among the most stringent self-imposed presidential campaign finance restrictions in modern history.

Story Continued Below

“She is an outsider. She is a reformer. She is an anti-corruption candidate, and this is one of many steps she has taken to help cement that in the mind of voters,” a senior Warren aide told POLITICO. “By not doing the traditional big-dollar finance program, she will have a lot more time than other candidates to focus on organizing in the early states and other priorities.”

The self-imposed restrictions will undoubtedly leave money on the table from big donors who've supported Warren in the past.

But they could also help her make the case that she shouldn’t be dismissed as irrelevant or unviable when the first fundraising period closes on March 31. Warren is expected to significantly under-perform Bernie Sanders and other leading candidates.

The subject line of an email from Warren to supporters on Monday seemed to forecast fundraising disappointment: “This decision will ensure I'm outraised in this race.”

Warren already has $12 million in the bank, the amount left over from her Senate campaign run, giving her flexibility to build a nationwide infrastructure. Opposing campaigns privately point out that she raised that money with the help of big donors and the tactics she’s shunning moving forward.

Since 2012, Warren built up an extensive national network of donors that included regular donor-focused trips to the likes of Los Angeles, San Francisco, Austin or Chicago. She also took part in donor calls and meetings, though she dialed down the practice in 2018. She hasn't held any fundraisers since announcing her exploratory bid on Dec. 31.

Warren’s new position is the most aggressive anti-big money stance taken by a candidate in modern presidential history — extending beyond Bernie Sanders’ 2016 strategy, a transformational moment in small-donor fundraising.

ActBlue reports show Warren raised just under $300,000 in the 24 hours after her announcement. Sanders reported raising $6 million in the day after he jumped in.

Warren's announcement is an implicit concession that she's going to be out-raised, a key measure of strength for a presidential campaign. But her positioning as the true crusader against big money in politics could give her an advantage with voters — and potentially allow her to call out her Democratic rivals for falling short of her standard.

She would have the most difficulty criticizing Sanders, given that he held few private fundraisers during his 2016 run and has not indicated he will hire fundraisers to stage private meetings with donors during his 2020 bid.

Moneyed donors are unlikely to be completely shut out from Warren’s campaign. Her new rules would not preclude her from holding fundraising events with low-dollar entry fees. And Warren’s restrictions wouldn’t prohibit her finance team from calling big donors to ask for money, though those donors won’t be able to leverage time or access with her.

Notably, the policy would be loosened if she advances to the general election. In an email to supporters, she alluded to changing course against Republicans.

“By then we’ll be up against a Republican machine that will be hell-bent on keeping the White House,” she wrote. “They will have PACs and Super PACs and too many special interest groups to count, and we will do what is necessary to match them financially. That means investing — starting now — in each and every one of our state parties, and in our national party too.”

Former President Barack Obama drew a stir in political circles when he announced his own restrictions during his 2008 run, shunning any PAC contributions and those from federally-registered lobbyists.

“It was the first time anyone had done that before. Everyone freaked out about it. There was a lot of uncertainty around how that would play out,” said Ami Copeland, a former deputy finance director to Obama. “It was much more of a potent issue to utilize on the trail as opposed to hurting us.”

Still, Obama didn’t cut off personal access to high-dollar donors, a tactic Copeland called risky, given the desire by donors to have a personal interaction with a candidate. By not meeting with donors privately, Warren could risk losing out on opportunities to build off a donor’s larger local or national networks.

Copeland said Barack and Michelle Obama held 130 fundraising events in just one quarter during the 2008 Democratic primary, events that made up 80 percent of their total fundraising, he said.

Copeland said Warren’s strategy puts even more emphasis on small donors, a potentially volatile stream of financing in a field where more than a dozen candidates might be attempting to stand apart to drive those dollars.

“Operationally it’s going to be a really big challenge for them. It’s hard to put together a budget based on an unknown intake,” Copeland said. ""It’s not just her losing a class of donors, she’s also pushing them to other operations and other campaigns. That in the long-term will be an issue.""

Most candidates fundraise by tapping both small-dollar online donors and high-dollar fundraisers, where donors can cut checks of up to $2,800 during the primary. Candidates and campaign officials can also appear at fundraisers for super PACs, a practice adopted by both Barack Obama and Donald Trump’s campaigns.

Since announcing their presidential bids, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand and Cory Booker have all attended or said they plan to attend high-dollar fundraisers held in Hollywood, New York and San Francisco.

“This is bold and innovative and a way to show that you will not be bought by any special interest and that every voice matters,” said Adam Bozzi, communications director for the pro-reform group End Citizens United. “When people run for president, linking fundraising to their time and their attention is something that has happened for a long time.”

Competing campaigns saw her motives differently: In conversations with POLITICO, aides to multiple competing candidates said the Warren campaign was likely maneuvering to shield itself from low fundraising numbers after its launch, and pointed out there were potential holes in Warren’s policy that would still allow her to raise money from large donors. No candidates spoke on the record about Warren’s announcement.

“It’s blatant expectations-lowering” around Warren’s fundraising, said one aide on a Democratic presidential campaign. “If this is a values-driven decision, to then say she’ll revert back to taking big money during the general election feels odd.”

273,Empty,2019-02-27T00:44:44Z,"Although Cubans voted overwhelming to approve the Constitution, Sunday's vote saw a growing portion express dissent.","Cuban voters ratified a new Constitution on Sunday that legalises the free market in a vote that saw a growing portion of the population express dissent compared with the island's last constitutional referendum in 1976.

In Sunday's ballot, 86.85 percent voted in favour of the new Constitution while nine percent voted against it. Spoiled or blank ballots made up 4.15 percent of ballots cast.

Voter turnout was recorded at 84.4 percent, down from 98 percent who turned out in 1976 when 97.7 percent of voters ratified the Constitution.

""There's no longer political unanimity around government proposals,"" Raudiel Pena Barrios, adjunct professor of law at the University of Havana, told Al Jazeera. ""We should see this as an important minority of Cubans who hope for something more in the management of the state.""

The new Constitution legalises private property and promotes foreign investment, bringing it in line with economic reforms the Cuban government has implemented to encourage entrepreneurship and investment over the past several years.

Arturo Lopez-Levy, visiting professor at Gustavus Adolphus College in Minnesota who served as a political analyst for the Cuban government from 1992 to 1994, said such changes resolve a ""legal limbo"" around moves to liberalise the economy. This opens the door for further reform aimed at building a ""comprehensive mixed economy"", he said.

190226002347961

The updated charter also creates the position of prime minister to administer day-to-day state affairs and imposes age and term limits for the president.

Lopez-Levy calls these ""important instrumental changes within the one-party system"". For Pena Barrios, the new Constitution signals ""political continuity marked by novel aspects such as notable economic pragmatism"".

After casting his referendum ballot, President Miguel Diaz-Canel described the new Constitution as a bearer of ""continuity and unity"" in Cuba.

What does the vote mean for the opposition?

Critics argue the reforms are cosmetic. The power of the Communist Party within a one-party system remains untouched and citizens still do not have the ability to directly vote for a president, an issue thousands of voters raised in a three-month public consultation process.

But Lopez-Levy argued that any demands for deep political restructuring were pipe dreams from the outset.

190222174420643

""The process never had the intention of a transition to a liberal democracy,"" he said. ""The opposition and the groups that are pushing for this type of agenda have proven to be very isolated and with very limited political mobilisation capability.""

He cautioned that ""No"" votes, abstentions, or null ballots should not be equated with support for the Cuban opposition.

Pena Barrios doubts the dissident vote will work in the opposition's favour.

""The opposition in Cuba doesn't have sufficient political capital to identify with those who didn't support the text,"" he said.

'New political dialogue'

But many are optimistic the reforms and the process of drafting the new charter will help make room for continued debate among other sectors.

""The result points the way towards new political dialogue, or at least the need for it,"" Miguel Alejandro Hayes, editor of the blog La Trinchera and a contributor to other Cuban alternative media outlets, told Al Jazeera.

He believes it is unlikely such dialogue would include the traditional opposition. Instead, the government could engage with more moderate critics, though political will could still be lacking.

""There's an opposition that doesn't want dialogue, that approves of the blockade on Cuba, and that doesn't care about the cost of toppling the government,"" he said. ""These actors - the majority live outside of Cuba - don't have any credibility, and they are out of the scene,"" he added.

Pena Barrios argued that the official response to polarisation over marriage equality in the run-up to the referendum has demonstrated the government's openness to dialogue.

While an earlier draft of the Constitution legalised marriage equality, the final version left marriage to be defined in a separate referendum.

""Now comes the big challenge,"" Pena Barrios added, ""which is to fulfil the Constitution"".

The Cuban government is expected to implement various measures to complement the charter.

Hayes stressed the need for these new laws to ""be inclusive"" and ensure that ""political ideology is not cause for discrimination.""

""Everything proposed in the Constitution that is not explicit, everything that goes against the orthodox mentality, deserves attention because it is what runs the most risk of being forgotten or excluded,"" he said.

US-Cuba ties

Beyond the island, the Constitution is unlikely to smooth over relations with the United States.

Bilateral ties have deteriorated under President Donald Trump after the historic normalisation of frozen US-Cuba ties under Presidents Barack Obama and Raul Castro with the opening of embassies in Washington, DC, and Havana in 2015.

Trump has suggested deepening the more than half-a-century-old trade embargo on Cuba.

{articleGUID}

Lopez-Levy argued the time for fruitful debate on Cuba was before the referendum, and the US missed the opportunity. ""Trump doesn't have a policy towards Cuba, he has a policy towards the next election in Florida,"" he said.

Florida is home to two-thirds of the 1.2 million Cuban-American voters in the US. Although Cuban-Americans have increasingly turned towards the Democratic Party for more than a decade, according to the Pew Research Center, Cubans in Florida were twice as likely to vote for Trump compared with other Latinos.

In a statement on Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo dismissed the vote as a ""so-called referendum"" and claimed the charter blocked potential for economic reform by enshrining socialism.

""No one should be fooled by this exercise, which achieves little beyond perpetuating the pretext for the regime's one-party dictatorship,"" Pompeo said. ""The entire process has been marked by carefully managed political theater and repression of public debate.""

The new Constitution declares the socialist system ""irrevocable"" and states the state's central goal as ""the construction of socialism and advance towards a communist society.""",Cubans approve a new Constitution: What does the vote mean?,Al Jazeera English,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/02/cubans-approve-constitution-vote-190226224600240.html

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) …","Democrats in both the Senate and House are mobilizing against an effort by Republican leaders to undermine the Green New Deal, momentarily derailing attempts to create division and halt the resolution’s momentum.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) recently pledged to hold a vote on the Green New Deal resolution as soon as this week — rather than a display of support for climate action, the goal was to divide Democrats. In response, Senate Democrats are now rallying behind a unity resolution, separate from the Green New Deal, urging climate action.

Meanwhile, House Democrats are increasingly backing the Green New Deal resolution itself: nearly 40 percent of the caucus now supports the sweeping blueprint mandating rapid decarbonization of the U.S. economy over the next decade.

On Tuesday, all 47 Senate Democrats and independents announced that they will back a resolution calling for climate action separate from the Green New Deal proposal. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Sen. Tom Carper (D-DE), ranking member on Environment and Public Works Committee, are leading the effort. Although the text of the rival resolution does not seem to be currently available, it reportedly will declare people-driven climate change to be an enduring phenomenon and call for immediate government action, albeit with no timetables or targets.

The move appears to be an attempt to avoid directly voting on the Green New Deal itself, as McConnell had hoped, and as the name suggests, underscores unity over division.

“It doesn’t matter if you are from a coastal state or from a landlocked state, if you care about public health or the environment, or if you care about our economy or national security,” Carper said in a Senate floor speech Tuesday. “The fact is, every person living in this country will eventually see or experience the effects of climate change, if they don’t already today.”

The unity resolution follows several weeks of intense back-and-forth after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) first introduced the Green New Deal resolution on February 7. The blueprint is co-sponsored by a number of Democratic 2020 hopefuls in the Senate, but has failed to gain significant traction with much of the chamber.

In an effort to deepen divides between Democrats on climate action, McConnell declared two weeks ago that the Senate would hold a vote on the resolution. This was originally expected as early as February 28.

Democrats widely panned that tactic as a show vote but initially offered no indicator of how they might proceed. But last Friday, a video live-streamed by the nonprofit youth-led Sunrise Movement went viral, showing Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) engaging in a terse exchange with young activists who back the Green New Deal. The heated conversation sparked furor online and widespread condemnation from climate activists of Feinstein, who dismissed the Green New Deal as largely untenable.

The exchange illustrated divides among Democrats, but it has also served as a turning point for the party. Following the uproar, a number of Democrats indicated their intent to vote “present” during any Green New Deal resolution vote in the Senate — seemingly a ceremonial action to preserve party unity. Feinstein herself said Tuesday that she planned to vote “present” on the resolution.

All of this culminated Tuesday afternoon, however, with McConnell abruptly declaring that the vote would take place at some point before the congressional August recess. A spokeswoman for Carper told ThinkProgress that it was unclear when or if that vote might happen.

Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Brian Schatz (D-HI), and Martin Heinrich (D-NM) have since called on McConnell to hold a full day of debate on climate change before any Green New Deal vote occurs.

“We believe it is imperative the American people hear where both sides stand on this critical issue,” the senators wrote in a letter to the majority leader on Tuesday.

It is also unclear when or if the Senate Democratic unity resolution will see a vote.

Differing views on climate action

While Senate Democrats work to unite in the Republican-controlled chamber, House Democrats are increasingly embracing the Green New Deal. As of Wednesday, the resolution has 89 co-sponsors in the House — 38 percent of the Democratic caucus.

Advertisement

Unified support, however, is still far from guaranteed in the lower chamber. While a number of Democrats on key House committees back the Green New Deal, House Budget Chairman John Yarmuth (D-KY) said Tuesday that the upcoming 2020 fiscal budget non-binding resolution won’t call for a Green New Deal. But Yarmuth noted the climate resolution is important to many Democrats and said that he is still meeting with committee leaders to discuss their priorities.

Some Republicans, meanwhile, are also shifting their approach to climate change. Former Ohio Gov. John Kasich called on the party this week to address global warming and said he will push “centrist” climate proposals appealing to conservatives. Republicans are also increasingly receptive of carbon pricing and other more limited approaches to climate action.

Activists have panned that approach as too narrow in scope — a critique that extends to members of both parties who have been slow to embrace dramatic climate action as captured by the Green New Deal. Following Friday’s confrontation with Feinstein, Sunrise Movement co-founder and Executive Director Varshini Prakash said in a statement that “fundamental change” is needed in the Democratic Party and that those who have not embraced the Green New Deal “are out of-touch with the center of energy in the party.”

But Sunrise didn’t reserve its fire only for Democrats. On Monday, 42 youth activists with the group were arrested while protesting outside McConnell’s office with a group of more than 250 people, including Kentucky high schoolers.

“If I could say anything to McConnell, I would ask him: ‘Does it not weigh on you at all that your own constituents are facing the life or death consequences of climate change all across the state, yet you continue to side with fossil fuel CEOs?'” Destine Rigsby, a 17-year-old from Louisville, said in a statement.

Kamala Harris has nursed connections with the California’s biggest donors during three campaigns for statewide office and two more for district attorney in San Francisco. | Mason Trinca/Getty Images 2020 Elections Kamala Harris elbows out rivals as she courts California donors The California senator is trying to monopolize Democratic money in the donor-rich state, fueling her campaign and cutting off rivals.

Donor-rich California has long been known as the ATM of the Democratic Party. Kamala Harris wants to turn it into her personal armored truck.

The California senator and 2020 presidential candidate has nursed connections with the state’s biggest donors during three campaigns for statewide office and two more for district attorney in San Francisco. Now, Harris is working aggressively to turn those connections into commitments securing those donors before out-of-state presidential rivals have a chance.

Story Continued Below

Before the presidential race even started, Harris spent hundreds of thousands of dollars through her leadership PAC to prospect the California donor scene. She has already held more California fundraisers than any other candidate for president, seeking out the bundlers who raised massive sums for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. And with many top Democratic donors waiting for the crowded primary field to winnow before singling out a candidate for support, Harris’ efforts to win over her state’s money could not only boost her campaign but starve some of her rivals.

“She certainly is experienced as an executive, as a district attorney in San Francisco and again as the attorney general,” said San Francisco billionaire Doug Goldman, a donor who bundled money for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. “I think we would do damn well to elect Kamala Harris.”

Harris phoned Goldman, a longtime contact in the Bay Area, several weeks before her announcement to inform him of her plans and ask for his support, which he eventually gave after quizzing Harris on how she would approach the campaign. In addition to donating to Harris, Goldman plans to fundraise for her from his network of contacts, he said.

The stakes for California’s cash grab are immense. California was responsible for $522 million in candidates, parties and outside groups during the 2016 election, more than any other state, according to data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics.

While Harris has home-field advantage in California, other 2020 Democrats are playing off connections of their own. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who got his undergraduate degree from Stanford University, could be a major rival: He has raised money from Silicon Valley investors for both his past campaigns and a startup he helped found while he was mayor of Newark.

Booker attended his first Silicon Valley fundraiser since announcing his bid for president last weekend, at the home of Laura and Gary Lauder, a venture capitalist and member of the Estee Lauder family. Booker also got early support in his campaign from Steve Phillips, a major Bay Area donor who is gathering donations for a super PAC.

Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown and Montana Gov. Steve Bullock have made recent fundraised or met with donors while in California recently, too. But Harris already held two February events in Hollywood, hosted by David Cooley, the CEO and founder of the nightclub Abbey, and Jeff Shell, chairman of Universal Filmed Entertainment Group.

In mid-March, Harris will return to Hollywood, when actress Katie McGrath and filmmaker J.J. Abrams are hosting another soiree.

“She’s a first among equals,” said Andy Spahn, a Los Angeles fundraising consultant and adviser who is president of Gonring, Spahn and Associates. “It’s expensive to run statewide races here, it requires a pretty broad network of support. So she’s built that over the course of her campaigns which has enabled her to start quickly here.”

After winning her last election, her 2016 Senate race, Harris laid further groundwork with California contributors through her leadership PAC, campaign finance records indicate. She paid $289,000 to fundraising consultants based in California and spent tens of thousands more at California-based fundraising events in 2017 and 2018, including a $21,000 retreat at the The Lodge at Torrey Pines, a luxury hotel in La Jolla.

Since jumping into the presidential race, a February fundraiser in San Francisco provided an opportunity for Harris, her husband and her sister (campaign chairwoman Maya Harris) to mingle with more than 100 donors at Delancey Street, a foundation and restaurant that helps rehabilitate former prisoners and addicts. Philanthropist Roselyne “Cissie” Swig, a Democratic donor, sat in the front row as Harris spoke to the crowd, according to an attendee, warning them that the Democratic field would be crowded — but she was prepared to stand out.

Harris, like other candidates, is also working to build a following with online donors in addition to bigger donors who attend in-person events. Her campaign raised $1.5 million within 24 hours of its launch online from 38,000 individual donors, according to figures provided by the campaign. The campaign also increased its email list of supporters by 20 percent on its first day.

One of Harris’ earliest big-ticket supporters, major Hillary Clinton donor Susie Tompkins Buell, had known Harris for years but planned — like many other Democratic donors — to stay neutral in the primary. That changed after she attended Harris’ campaign launch.

“I was very hesitant to get involved. I wanted to pace myself, get that pageant going on and see who would be there,” said Buell, the San Francisco-based co-founder of Esprit clothing. “Then when I saw her at the rollout, I realized she’s what we need right now. We need fierce and we need joy and we need her experience.”

Buell now plans to raise money for Harris, and she said she’ll will be teaming up on occasion with Amy Rao, another former Clinton fundraiser who is the CEO of Silicon Valley-based Integrated Archive Systems.

“I think it’s really going to be a good group of candidates, I really do,” said Buell. “But she’s very loved here, Kamala is.”

Brasília (AFP) - Venezuela's opposition leader Juan Guaido vowed on Thursday to return home ""in the coming days... despite threats"" from President Nicolas Maduro's regime, as he continues a tour of regional allies to rally international support.

Guaido, recognized as interim president by more than 50 countries, met with Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro on Thursday afternoon while Paraguay's leader Mario Abdo announced Guaido would be in Asuncion on Friday.

After flouting a travel ban by Maduro's regime, Guaido went to Colombia last Friday where he met President Ivan Duque, US Vice President Mike Pence, Abdo and Sebastian Pinera of Chile.

Guaido was in Colombia to try to force desperately needed humanitarian aid -- which is also stockpiled in Brazil -- into Venezuela but was thwarted by a determined military blockade ordered by Maduro.

Guaido ""wants to show the Venezuelan people that he's being hosted by the president of Brazil... He wants to give the message that he's recognized"" as Venezuela's true leader, Brazil Vice President Hamilton Mourao said in an interview with Globo.

""I've received threats against me and my family, but also threats of imprisonment by the regime,"" Guaido said alongside Bolsonaro.

Guaido was to dine with Brazil's Foreign Affairs Minister Ernesto Araujo and then meet Abdo at 11:00 am (1400 GMT) on Friday at the presidential palace.

Venezuela is wracked by a humanitarian crisis that has seen poverty soar as millions of people face chronic shortages of food and medicine.

After years of economic chaos, its problems have been compounded by hyperinflation that the International Monetary Fund says will reach 10 million percent in 2019 -- leaving salaries and savings virtually worthless.

An estimated 2.7 million Venezuelans have left the country since 2015, the United Nations says.

The latest to join the exodus are members of Venezuela's military -- whose high command still backs Maduro. Colombian immigration officials said that more than 550 Venezuelan military members have deserted and sought asylum across the border.

- Fears of arrest -

Guaido stunned the world last month, proclaiming himself Venezuela's acting president after the National Assembly he leads declared Maduro a usurper and illegitimate over his May re-election which was widely criticized as fraudulent.

Guaido wants to oust Maduro and set up a transitional government ahead of new elections.

""We're fighting for free elections, as stipulated by the constitution, democratic elections,"" Guaido and Bolsonaro said in a joint statement.

Far-right leader Bolsonaro apologized for the support that two of his leftist predecessors -- Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff -- gave to Maduro.

Guaido told reporters that he would return home ""at the latest on Monday,"" although there are fears he might be arrested when he does.

Guaido would have to face justice when he returns because he ignored his ban on foreign travel, Maduro told US channel ABC News earlier this week.

Guaido's supporters were planning a welcome home party at the offices of the El Nacional newspaper in Caracas on Friday.

The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights exhorted Maduro's government to ensure no harm comes to Guaido, including by ""third parties.""

At the United Nations on Thursday, failure to take action on two competing drafts laid bare divisions among world powers over the way forward in Venezuela.

Russia and China vetoed a US resolution in the Security Council calling for new elections and unimpeded deliveries of humanitarian aid, while Russia's draft urging a political settlement ""through peaceful means"" failed to secure the required number of votes.

- Strengthening relationships -

Guaido arrived in Brasilia on a Colombian military plane early Thursday.

He met European diplomats in Brasilia to ""strengthen relationships with those countries that have recognized our efforts to recover democracy and achieve free elections,"" Guaido said on Twitter.

His team is studying the possibility of visiting Roraima state, the border area with Venezuela where four people were killed in weekend clashes with Maduro's security services, a source in his camp said.

Guaido says 300,000 people face death without the food and medicine supplies, much of them from the United States, stockpiled in its neighbors.

Eight out of 10 Venezuelan households are at risk of food shortages, a study by three Venezuelan universities found.

A concert organized by billionaire British entrepreneur Richard Branson last Friday raised $2.5 million in one week to help Guaido's aid effort, organizers said.","Guaido rallies support, vows to return to Venezuela 'despite threats'",Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/guaido-looks-reinforce-brazilian-support-ahead-venezuela-return-180728439.html
277,Empty,2019-02-27T17:30:00Z,"The bizarre election fraud scandal in North Carolina, explained","North Carolina state investigators laid out in detail last week an “unlawful,” “coordinated,” and well-funded plot to tamper with absentee ballots in a US House election that remains uncalled more than three months after Election Day — finally bringing clarity to one of the most bizarre election scandals in recent memory.

The state election board, after hearing four days of evidence indicating fraud and an attempt to conceal the scheme from state investigators, then voted to order a new election. Republican candidate Mark Harris has announced he won’t run in the upcoming campaign.

Now Leslie McCrae Dowless, the local political operative contracted by Harris’s campaign whose activities were at the center of the investigation, has been indicted on three counts of obstruction of justice, two counts of conspiracy to commit obstruction of justice, and two counts of possessing an absentee ballot in violation of state law, according to the Wake County prosecutor’s office.

During last week’s hearing, state investigators established their theory of the case — that Dowless directed a coordinated scheme to unlawfully collect, falsely witness, and otherwise tamper with absentee ballots — and workers who said they had assisted him in the scheme delivered damning testimony. The hearing’s first day ended with Dowless, under the advice of his attorney, refusing to testify before the election board.

In the following days, a top political consultant for Harris’s campaign and the candidate’s own son gave remarkable testimony of their own about the decision to hire Dowless. The consultant, Andy Yates, and John Harris both insisted Harris did not know what Dowless was doing and proved too trusting about the operative’s claims. Yet John Harris did say he warned his father that Dowless’s prior work on absentee ballots seemed like it could be illegal, a warning that went unheeded by the candidate. As his son closed his testimony with a few kind remarks about his parents, Mark Harris was in tears.

The proceedings lasted four days, with Harris taking the stand on the final day.

But before he did, the board revealed that Harris’s campaign had produced new evidence the night before Harris was to testify: previously undisclosed contacts between the candidate and Dowless. Harris’s attorneys said they had misunderstood the extent of the investigation’s request. Democratic attorney Marc Elias referred to the documents as “explosively important.” He asked the court to consider the way in which the evidence was released as “adverse interference” by the Harris team.

Harris then spent most of the final day being grilled about his relationship with Dowless, before he made the stunning admission that the evidence demanded a new election be held. He had been the apparent winner on Election Night over Democrat Dan McCready, by less than 1,000 votes.

The election board — made up of three Democrats and two Republicans — had finally reconvened after Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper named new members amid an unrelated legal dispute. They reviewed the evidence in the case over two days and then voted to call for a new election at the hearing’s conclusion.

Under state law, the board was able to call a new election if the basic fairness of the election was tainted. It didn’t matter whether the number of votes in dispute would have been enough to swing the outcome.

There will first be a new primary election, required by a recently passed state law, that will determine the Democratic and Republican candidates. The timing for the new elections will be announced soon.

What we’ve learned about the alleged ballot tampering at the state hearing

It’s important to remember two things about absentee ballots in North Carolina: Anybody can request one, and at the end of every day before the election, state officials publish a file of which voters requested an absentee ballot by mail and whether they have returned it to be counted.

A campaign could check that file every morning to know how many registered Republican, Democratic, and unaffiliated voters had requested and returned a mail-in ballot.

“From a mechanics point of view, this is a gold mine of information for candidates and their campaign,” Bitzer told me previously.

That treasure trove of data would have given Dowless and the people he worked with a detailed picture of how many absentee ballots were coming in every day from Republican, Democratic, and unaffiliated voters — and, by extension, how many absentee ballots they needed from their voters to keep pace with the Democrats.

Indeed, some of the workers who testified before the board Monday described Dowless discussing with other operatives how the state of the absentee ballot count. Harris even allegedly asked Dowless at one point about his apparent confidence in the state of play in the election.

Investigators working on behalf of the North Carolina election board started Monday’s hearing by laying out the contours of the ballot tampering scheme, which they say was led by Dowless, and then questioned Lisa Britt and several other women who worked for him.

Britt, who was Dowless’s stepdaughter for a time and said she remained close to him, said she believed that she and Dowless had done something wrong. But she insisted more than once that the GOP candidate, Harris, had not been privy to the plot.

Between the opening statement from investigators, Britt’s testimony and corroborating testimony from other witnesses, here is what we learned about the alleged ballot tampering scheme:

State investigators said Dowless had used absentee ballot request forms for prior elections to “pre-fill” forms for the 2018 election and sent out workers to find the voters so they could sign the forms and request a ballot — they described this as “Phase One.”

The workers allegedly presented the forms to Dowless and received a payment from him, based on how many they brought in, and then sent the forms to the board of elections.

At least 780 absentee request forms were allegedly submitted by Dowless or one of his workers.

For “Phase Two” of the operation, investigators said, Dowless sent out workers to collect the absentee ballots from voters.

Some of the ballots the workers collected had not been signed by witnesses or had not been sealed and the workers again took those ballots to Dowless and received payment in return.

Dowless held on to the returned ballots and instructed workers to falsely sign as witnesses for some of the ballots he collected, according to investigators.

To avoid raising the suspicions of state officials, the ballots were mailed in small batches, from post offices near the voters’ homes, and the workers made sure that the dates of their signatures and even the ink they used matched that of the voters.

Britt affirmed much of the investigators’ case in her testimony, testifying that she had collected ballots, that Dowless had instructed people to sign ballots they had actually not been there to witness, and that she had signed her mother’s name on some ballots so they would not raise suspicion from the state board.

Britt testified that if the ballots were left unsealed and there were elections left blank, she would fill in some of the empty offices — again, this was done to avoid arousing suspicion from state election officials. (She did say she had never filled in Harris’s name on a ballot, because voters would usually fill in at least the congressional race and a few others.)

Britt also testified that Dowless had reached out to her shortly before Monday’s hearing and provided her with a statement so she could plead the Fifth during her testimony.

Collecting an absentee ballot for another person and falsely witnessing a ballot — two of the allegations made in the witnesses’ testimony — are violations of state law, according to state investigators.

Britt, Andy Yates and John Harris have been emphatic that Harris was not aware of the plan. Investigators and Democratic lawyers still grilled Yates about his failure to identify Dowless’s prior criminal history while he was working for Yates’s firm on Harris’s campaign. John Harris also told the board that he had warned his father that Dowless might have conducted illegal electioneering in previous elections — but his father hired Dowless anyway.

State investigators also said they had not been able to conclude whether early voting numbers were improperly shared with third parties, one of the other allegations that had been made in the sworn affidavits that jump-started the fraud scandal.

The number of not-returned absentee ballots in the Ninth was unusually high

Most of the attention has focused on two counties in the Ninth: Bladen and Robeson, in the southeast corner of the state near the South Carolina border. Notably, each of the affidavits provided by Democratic attorneys involved voters in Bladen County, and one man said that Dowless himself had stated he was working on absentee ballots for Harris in the county.

Bitzer documented the unusual trend in those counties: They had a much higher rate of mail-in absentee ballots that were requested but not returned, compared to other counties in the Ninth District.

And at the district level, according to Bitzer’s calculations, the Ninth had a much higher rate of unreturned absentee ballots than any other district in North Carolina.

Bitzer also found that the share of votes Harris received from mail-in absentee ballots in Bladen was remarkably high. It was the only county where the Republican won the mail-in absentee vote, earning 61 percent to McCready’s 38 percent.

Strangely, though, based on the partisan breakdown of absentee ballots accepted in the county, Harris would have needed to win not only all the Republican ballots but also almost every single ballot from voters not registered with either party and a substantial number of Democratic ballots as well.

In other words, according to the data, Harris seems to have benefited from an oddly high share of votes in these two counties, where an operative of his was allegedly working. Now substantial evidence of ballot tampering has been presented at a state hearing that could, at its conclusion, lead to a new election being called in the North Carolina Ninth.",Republican operative indicted in ballot fraud scandal that led to new House election,Vox.com,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/2/18/18229711/north-carolina-election-fraud-leslie-mcrae-dowless-indictment

Speaking at a policy forum Wednesday hosted by the Congressional Western Caucus and chaired by Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ), longtime climate science deniers and opponents of the ambitious climate resolution expressed concerns that calls for climate action will push all politicians to the left.

One of the “dangers” of the Green New Deal, said Myron Ebell, director of global warming and international environmental policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, is that “by expanding the political spectrum of what’s in the debate, it’s moving the debate left and it’s creating a very large space for a certain class of people, many of them in the Republican Party, to start talking about how we need to have moderate solutions, or reasonable solutions.”

The Green New Deal resolution was introduced earlier this month by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA). The plan mandates rapid and widespread decarbonization of the U.S. economy. Calls for climate action have grown since the November midterm elections, but Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal — which has strong support from youth activists — has now forced lawmakers to grapple with climate change as a top political issue.

The featured panelists at Wednesday’s forum came from organizations with long histories of spreading misinformation about climate change and working to roll back environmental protections. This included speakers from CEI, the Heritage Foundation, the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT), and the American Energy Alliance. All of these organizations have opaque funding networks; donations in the past have come from the fossil fuel industry as well as Koch-funded foundations.

Marc Morano, CFACT’s director of communications, echoed Ebell’s concerns about the effect the Green New Deal might have on the broader landscape of climate politics, saying the resolution has become a “litmus test” for each Democratic presidential hopeful.

Indeed, at least six Democratic presidential hopefuls have voiced support for the proposal, which draws on decades of scientific findings. In particular, the resolution cites a 2018 report by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that warns of catastrophic consequences — from mass migrations and deadly heat stress to economic losses — if global temperatures rise past 2ºC above pre-industrial temperatures.

Morano, on the other hand, believes that the increased focus on the Green New Deal “has shifted the Democratic Party into serious, unscientific, nutty territory.”

As a result, he continued, “The greatest danger we face right now with the Green New Deal… is very simply the Republican Party coming up with the Green New Deal-lite.”

“We need to oppose it and oppose it firmly,” Morano said. “We don’t need to come up with the lite version of the plan.”

Among the potential policies panelists mentioned conservatives might propose as alternatives to the Green New Deal: a carbon tax and cap-and-trade policies.

“The only thing the Green New Deal could possible hope to achieve is to lull policy makers into accepting less draconian, but certainly damaging policies, like a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade program as quote, ‘reasonable alternatives,'” said Thomas Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance and a former Koch lobbyist.

Another speaker on the panel was former EPA deputy assistant administrator Mandy Gunasekara. Gunasekara resigned from the EPA just weeks ago to set up the Energy 45 Fund, which aims to promote “America First” policy approaches and educate the public and policymakers on the environmental successes of the Trump administration.

Repeating a popular line of attack from opponents of the Green New Deal, Gunasekara described the resolution as “Karl Marx’s Christmas list.” She then went on to argue that what’s “routinely overlooked is that the entire premise of the the Green New Deal ignores the United States’ current standing and leadership on environmental issues today.”

“Not only are we taking proactive steps to protect the environment and lower emissions,” she said, “we are doing it better than anyone else in the world.”

Gunasekara’s biography on the Energy 45 website, however, touts her as the “chief architect” of the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. It also credits her with orchestrating the repeal of the Obama-era Clean Power Plan. Prior to joining the Trump administration, Gunasekara famously handed a snowball to well-known climate science denier Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-OK) on the Senate floor in 2015 in an effort to disprove the existence of climate change.",Climate deniers reveal true fear about Green New Deal: That it will force Republicans to the left,Thinkprogress.org,https://thinkprogress.org/climate-deniers-republicans-green-new-deal-507c58ad32f9/

Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris — had said that they are open to the idea of the government paying reparations to black Americans as a restitution for slavery. The two candidates were cautious in their statements on the issue — both to the Times and in a subsequent Washington Post story — primarily emphasizing the history of racial discrimination in the U.S. Neither candidate laid out specific details about how they think a reparations program should work, and I’d be surprised if either of them put out a formal reparations plan — it’s a very unpopular idea. (More on that later.)

But it was notable that neither those two nor several other 2020 candidates contacted by the Times really wanted to firmly oppose reparations either, as past Democratic presidential candidates have. That shift away from outright opposition to reparations is another sign of how the Democratic Party is moving toward more progressive stands on racial issues.

But the reparations news made me curious: On which issues is the racial liberalism of the Democrats in line with the broader public — and where is it not? So I looked at the polling around different policies and rhetoric on racial issues. This is not a comprehensive examination, but an informal look at public opinion research since President Trump’s election.

Before we dive in, I should emphasize two things. First, it’s not new or surprising that ideas that we consider controversial don’t poll well. That’s kind of the point of bold ideas — they wouldn’t be bold if everyone already agreed with them. And, historically, racial liberalism in particular has often been unpopular — Martin Luther King Jr. may be almost universally revered now, but he was not in the 1960s. Secondly, there’s a difference between “unpopular” and “bad policy” and between “popular” and “good policy.” Some ideas that are unpopular may be right or effective — Ta-Nehisi Coates’s 2014 essay “The Case for Reparations” is very well-argued. I don’t want to suggest that just because a racial justice idea is unpopular that it shouldn’t be enacted.

I have divided these results into three categories: ideas or rhetoric that is broadly popular (more than 60 percent support from Americans overall), ideas that are unpopular (less than 40 percent support), and those that are somewhere in between.

Popular

This category includes vague notions of multiculturalism, ones that I assume most Americans support and that it would be hard to tell a pollster that you oppose. The policy ideas that are fairly popular, such as allowing felons to vote after they have finished their sentences, tend to be those that split Republican elites, with some opposing the ideas and others embracing them.

Here are the some of the popular ideas:

Racial and religious tolerance : 86 percent of Americans believe a significant part of being “truly American” is accepting people of diverse racial and religious backgrounds, according to a poll released this month by the Public Religion Research Institute and The Atlantic.

: 86 percent of Americans believe a significant part of being “truly American” is accepting people of diverse racial and religious backgrounds, according to a poll released this month by the Public Religion Research Institute and The Atlantic.

Mixed opinions

This section is generally made up of policies and rhetoric that splits the parties at the elite level — i.e., House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would likely support most of these items, but House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy would oppose them. That elite divide mirrors similar partisan divides in the electorate. Not coincidentally, this section includes more issues and policy questions that have been top-of-mind in U.S. politics over the past several years. (Views of the Black Lives Matter movement are a good example.) Similarly, general expressions of tolerance of all races and religions are popular, but Americans are more divided when you get more specific.

Here are some of these somewhat controversial ideas:

Being Christian is not essential to being American : About 56 percent of Americans say being Christian is not an important part of being truly American, according to the February 2019 PRRI report. (Thirty-nine percent said being Christian is important.)

: About 56 percent of Americans say being Christian is not an important part of being truly American, according to the February 2019 PRRI report. (Thirty-nine percent said being Christian important.)

: 51 percent of Americans have that view, when asked about each group individually, according to the 2018 AP-NORC poll. Agree with the views of the Black Lives Matter movement : 50 percent of Americans said they “mostly” agree, according to a 2017 Marist poll.

: 50 percent of Americans said they “mostly” agree, according to a 2017 Marist poll. It should be easier to immigrate to the U.S. : 49 percent of Americans agreed with that idea, compared with 32 percent who said that it should be harder, according to the Quinnipiac poll released in July 2018 .

: 49 percent of Americans hold this view, according to the Quinnipiac poll. The U.S. should not define itself as a country of Western European descendants : In the PRRI survey, respondents were asked to put themselves on a scale where one end is the statement that they “would prefer the U.S. to be a nation made up of people from all over the world” and the other end is the statement that they “would prefer the U.S. to be a nation primarily made up of people from Western European heritage.” Forty-seven percent said they mostly agreed with the first statement.

: A 2018 Washington Post/Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that 42 percent of Americans felt kneeling was appropriate, compared with 53 percent who disagreed. Racial discrimination, as opposed to personal actions, is holding back African-Americans who can’t get ahead: 41 percent agreed with this view, according to the 2017 Pew poll, while a plurality said that such Americans were largely responsible for their own condition.

Unpopular

This section is largely made up of ideas that are to the left of the consensus within the Democratic Party. Taking down Confederate monuments in public places, for example, splits Democratic voters, while Republicans are overwhelmingly opposed. This section is shorter than those above in part because pollsters don’t tend to ask about ideas that are not backed strongly by either party, since those have little chance of becoming reality.

Here some very controversial ideas:

Confederate monuments in public spaces should be removed : 39 percent support this view, according to a 2017 Quinnipiac poll.

: 39 percent support this view, according to a 2017 Quinnipiac poll. The number of immigrants in America should increase : 28 percent of Americans hold this view, according to a June 2018 Gallup poll, with 39 percent of Americans wanting immigration levels to stay the same and 29 percent wanting them to decrease.

: 28 percent of Americans hold this view, according to a June 2018 Gallup poll, with 39 percent of Americans wanting immigration levels to stay the same and 29 percent wanting them to decrease. Reparations : A July 2018 survey from the left-leaning Data for Progress found that 26 percent of Americans supported some kind of compensation or cash benefits for the descendants of slaves. A May 2016 Marist survey also found that 26 percent of Americans said the U.S. should pay reparations as “a way to make up for the harm caused by slavery and other forms of racial discrimination.”

A May 2016 Marist survey also found that 26 percent of Americans said the U.S. should pay reparations as “a way to make up for the harm caused by slavery and other forms of racial discrimination.” Abolishing the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency: 25 percent of Americans said they supported this idea, according to a July 2018 Politico/Morning Consult poll; 54 percent wanted the agency to remain.

Reparations, along with abolishing ICE, are very unpopular. This was not surprising to me, which is why I was surprised when I first saw the headline, “2020 Democrats Embrace Race-Conscious Policies, Including Reparations” in the Times. But the candidates’ actual comments were more in the vein of our first two categories — somewhat vague acknowledgements of the inequality that black Americans face. The challenge for Democratic elected officials, as the party leans into its racial liberalism, will be how to translate the public’s general pro-minority proclivities into policy. I suspect that Democratic presidential candidates will end up pushing policies that limit how aggressive ICE can be and that address the wealth gap between black and whites — but fall short of explicit calls for abolishing ICE or giving reparations.

But I think there is another potential outcome — Democratic elites moving Democratic voters and then the broader public toward more racially liberal positions. There are many factors behind the growing support for marijuana legalization, but one may be that liberal activists have successfully convinced the public that aggressive policing of marijuana use has resulted in unfair treatment of black Americans.",What Americans Think About Reparations And Other Race-Related Questions,Fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-think-about-reparations-and-other-race-related-questions/

Welcome to Jezebel’s Midweek Madness, where local menace Joan Summers has crashed Vanity Fair’s Oscars After-After-After-After Party to stage a one woman protest against Fit Tea Federation leader Kris Jenner.

Skimming right past the news about somebody named Blake Shelton and former Harajuku girl Gwen Stefani, let’s start with my favorite gossip of the week! Amidst the news that her fraud-obsessed husband might get deported, Teresa “Prostitution Whore!” Giudice was spotted with a 26 year old named Blake Schreck in Miami last weekend. While there isn’t much to this developing story, I’ve discovered that he:

There’s also a blurb on the Jussie Smollett case that centers the word of the Chicago Police Department. I’ll be abstaining from discussing this further, but would like to note that the CPD has fabricated evidence, murdered innocent civilians, and (allegedly) refused to further investigate the strangulations of 75 women since 2001. The speed at which this case has moved should not only worry you, but prove that the police have a vested interest in disproving the existence of this and future hate crimes. My third eye is open and I will not be fooled!



I’d also like to point out that the Tristan Thompson cheating rumors surfaced alongside the allegations that chaos merchant Kim Kardashian was in cahoots with Fashion Nova to rip off designer clothing. One could argue Kris Jenner leverages her children’s personal secrets in an effort to protect their wealth accumulation! Still, isn’t it sad that denim baroness Khloe Kardashian’s business arrangemen t relationship was shattered on Heterosexual Awareness Day? There’s also allegations that Stefani Joanne Ally Maine Angelina Germanotta’s father refused to support her marriage to Christian Carino in hopes she’d wife up Jackson Maine. I wonder what he thought of the forehead touch seen ‘round the world?

In worse news, Martha Stewart’s assistant organizes her enema closet and Kate Gosselin has a new dating show. Kate Plus Date, airing on TLC this fall, will chronicle her struggles with dating “in the public eye.” Remember, everyone: when you’re Dancing With The Star’s check dries up, reality television is an obvious fallback! I’m also obsessed with a source claiming John Cusack accidentally started a WhatsApp group message with 35 women on Raya. He apparently followed up his blunder with “Weird glitch, sorry!” Who wants to bet that his dating profile includes a “Must Love Dogs” joke?

Something that consistently shocks me about the coverage around the Sussex’s is the language employed by the tabloids. Here, “in their own words” actually refers to secondhand, anonymous sources. From a legal standpoint, it could be argued that “their” and “our” refer to the collective royal tipsters feeding the tabloids this gossip. It could also be debated that it’s a clever manipulation of language to fool you into believing Ok! has an exclusive interview with Harry & Meghan. Despite coming from an anonymous “insider”, here’s the preface to this cover story:

“Now Meghan is finally ready to set the record straight. For the first time, Ok! Can share what’s really happening behind Kensington Palace’s iron gates [...] ‘Meghan doesn’t want to address the rumors in public but feels it’s very important that people know the real story.’”

Meanwhile, Kiki Layne wore it better than someone allegedly named Camila Mendes, reminding us that If Beale Street Could Talk was robbed and no amount of “wearing it better” could right that injustice!

As reported last week, the gossip circuit is ablaze with rumors that chaos merchant Kylie Jenner is three months pregnant with Travis Scott’s baby. The bulk of the evidence for this particular rumor is a series of photographs outside a doctor’s office in Beverly Hills. “Insiders” also claim “Kylie’s always said she wants four kids, and she wants to have them all in her early 20s.” There’s also the allegation that Fit Tea Federation leader Kris Jenner refuses to let the SICKO MODE (ft. Drake) rapper marry her youngest cash cow. According to tipsters,

“She’s seen her daughters go through countless breakups and divorces, and being a divorceé herself, she’s skeptical about the idea of a marriage lasting forever.”

To clarify, there have been 5 official divorces and approximately 40 public “breakups” amongst Kris and her Kohorts. Somebody should give this incredibly interesting family with so much public heartbreak a television show!

We’re also told that Jackson Maine and Stefani Joanne Ally Maine Angelina Germanotta are set to “finally go public.” While there was certainly a forehead touch seen ‘round the world, the Oscars came and went without much scandal for the two. Still, Life & Style posits that A Star Is Born has cursed the relationships it touched: Bradley Cooper & somebody named Irina Shayk, Lady Gaga & Taylor Kinney, and now Lady Gaga & Christian Carino. I can’t wait to listen to a podcast on this in 20 years! Even better is a fantastic blurb on the record number of women quitting The Bachelor when faced with the prospect of marrying anthropomorphic bran muffin Colton Underwood. In his own words: “Every time I put myself out there, I get fucking rejected.” Maybe you should Investigate that, Colton!

What else? Melissa Gorga wants her own television show and Sharon Stone stormed off the set of a Chanel West Coast music video. (Who?) Jeremy Piven is allegedly strapped for cash after peddling his Malibu home for $4 million below the original price. Stand-up comedy isn’t for everyone, Jeremy! A few pages later is more fatphobic propaganda against Jessica Simpson and her totally regular pregnancy, proving that society might have progressed (slightly) but the tabloids never will! There’s also an interesting report that Luann De Lesseps, of Countess and Friends fame, might be headed back to jail after failing to prove she’s attending her mandated AA meetings. Please god, keep the cameras rolling!

Despite the obvious heartache with each new tale of abuse and trauma surfacing post-#MeToo, I’m praying that his victims find peace and resolution (and, if anything, justice.)

We consider an endorsement to be a public display or pronouncement of support that articulates or strongly implies that a candidate is the endorser’s current No. 1 choice for president. That’s a wordy description, but it makes a few important points:

The endorsement must be made publicly. A New York Times article saying that Senator Y is quietly backing Candidate X would not count, unless Senator Y has said or done something on behalf of the candidate publicly.

The endorsement need not be as explicit as a statement saying “I endorse Candidate X.” Introducing a candidate at a rally would usually count as an endorsement, for instance, depending on the context and tenor of the remarks.

Endorsers can’t cheat by endorsing multiple candidates at once; an endorsement only counts if it indicates a first choice. Endorsers may switch candidates at any time, however.

That first choice need not be someone who has officially entered the race. Hillary Clinton lined up dozens of endorsements before officially announcing her 2016 candidacy, for instance.

When it’s unclear whether someone intended to endorse a candidate, we’ll check with the offices of the candidate and the endorser about the context. We would also encourage candidates and endorsers to contact us directly to let us know about any new endorsements or any that we’ve missed. If the candidate and the endorser disagree about whether an endorsement has occurred, the endorser’s view will prevail.

Often, if you see someone listed as having endorsed a candidate and their public statements seem ambiguous, we’ve done additional reporting to confirm the endorsement. These were the same rules we used in 2016, and they didn’t cause too many problems, but there are always going to be issues we didn’t anticipate. But again, we would encourage both endorsers and candidates, as well as third parties, to contact us about any missing endorsements or any that seem to be in error.

The universe of potential endorsers we’re tracking in the 2020 cycle is larger than what we tracked in 2016, when we included only current governors and members of Congress. Different endorsers are worth different numbers of “endorsement points” to reflect the relative value of various endorsers, although the scale is flatter than the one we used in 2016. Specifically, it includes the following:

Current and former presidents and vice presidents (10 points). Current party leaders: Nancy Pelosi (House speaker), Steny Hoyer (House majority leader), James Clyburn (House majority whip), Chuck Schumer (Senate minority leader), Dick Durbin (Senate minority whip) and Tom Perez (Democratic National Committee chair) (10 points). Current governors, including governor equivalents from the U.S. territories and Washington, D.C. (8 points). Current U.S. Senators (6 points). Past presidential and vice presidential nominees (5 points). Former party leaders (5 points). Former 2020 presidential candidates who appeared in at least one debate and have since dropped out (5 points). Current U.S. representatives, including non-voting delegates from U.S. territories (3 points). Mayors of cities with at least 300,000 people (3 points). Officials holding statewide or territory-wide elected office, excluding positions (e.g. commissioners) that are held by multiple people at once (2 points). State and territorial legislatures’ majority and minority leaders (2 points). DNC members not otherwise covered by this list (1 point).

No set of categories and point values is going to be perfect; it doesn’t necessarily seem right that Hillary Clinton’s endorsement is worth less than that of Delaware Gov. John Carney, for instance. But 12 categories is already quite a few, and we don’t want to make too many one-off exceptions. Endorsers’ point values cannot be increased by qualifying for multiple categories; instead, endorsers are associated with the highest-ranking category they fit into on the list above. For instance, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine is treated as a senator (6 points) rather than a former VP nominee (5 points) because being a senator is worth more points.

Below is the number of current potential endorsers in each category, including both Democratic and independent (e.g. Maine Sen. Angus King) potential endorsers, except independents who are de facto Republicans. Republican endorsers will appear on the list if and when any of them endorse Democratic candidates for president. Note that the list can grow and shrink over time as, for example, vacant DNC positions are filled and offices change hands, since many of these categories assign values only to the whoever currently holds the position in question. If a senator resigns from office, for instance, their endorsement is no longer worth any endorsement points unless they fit into one of our other categories. (An exception: The candidate keeps the points if the endorser dies while holding the position.) Candidates cannot endorse themselves, so people who are currently running for president are removed from the endorsement pool until they drop out.",How Our Presidential Endorsement Tracker Works,Fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-our-presidential-endorsement-tracker-works/

Last week, Harris ended his bid to be certified the winner in North Carolina’s fraught 9th congressional district election after acknowledging he was the beneficiary of a large-scale election fraud scheme perpetrated by at least one person working for his campaign.

The North Carolina Board of Elections acted quickly, announcing the state must administer a new election to choose the district’s congressperson. Thanks to a new law rushed through the state legislature at the end of 2018, that process will begin with a new set of primaries for each party.

On Tuesday, Harris — who cited health issues in his decision to end the hearings by the Board of Elections — announced that he would not seek the GOP nomination this go around.

“After consulting with my physicians, there are several things that my health situation requires as a result of the extremely serious condition that I faced in mid-January,” said Harris in a statement on Tuesday. “Given my health situation, the need to regain full strength, and the timing of this surgery the last week of March, I have decided not to file in the new election for Congressional District 9.”

Harris’s abrupt conclusion of the Board of Elections hearing last week was curiously timed, coming just as the state was beginning to piece together evidence that Harris was in fact aware of an effort to interfere with absentee ballots in Bladen County. Local officials have suggested Harris might still be a focus of a potential criminal investigation after evidence was uncovered suggesting Harris knowingly sought the services of McCrae Dowless, a GOP strategist with a history of interfering in local elections by manipulating, withholding, or outright stealing absentee ballots.

In addition to his narrow edge in the general election, Harris won the original GOP primary last spring by an even tighter margin, again owed entirely to his performance in absentee votes. Former Rep. Robert Pittenger (R-NC) was unseated in the primary.

Harris also used his statement on Tuesday to throw his support to local Republican county commissioner Stony Rushing, a far right conspiracy theorist and avid gun supporter who was among the more vocal defenders of Harris throughout his legal battle.

In January, Rushing took to Facebook to claim that the elections board hotline received virtually no complaints from voters to report anomalies with their absentee ballots, insinuating that the state Democratic Party concocted allegations of fraud to steal the election. His false Facebook post was then cited by the executive director of the North Carolina Republican Party, who admitted to disseminating inaccurate information. Rushing repeatedly shared misleading or outright false social media posts related to the district race throughout the fraud investigation.

Akufo-Addo unseated Mahama in a 2016 election, capitalizing on an economy that was slowing due to falling prices for gold, oil and cocoa exports.

Mahama, who succeeded his deceased predecessor in 2012 and defeated Akufo-Addo in an election later that year, accepted defeat immediately in 2016, maintaining the West African country’s record of fiercely contested but peaceful elections.

The National Democratic Congress’s (NDC) ticket designated Mahama its candidate for the December 2020 vote at a party congress over the weekend, its director of elections, Elvis Ankrah, told Reuters.

Akufo-Addo, who is expected to stand for re-election as the candidate of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), campaigned in 2016 on promises to cut deficits following overspending by Mahama’s government that blew a $1.6 billion hole in the budget.

He has presided over an economic recovery, with growth of 6.7 percent in the first three quarters of last year.

The president's former ""fixer"" has already pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations over hush payments to Ms Daniels, and it raised the possibility that Mr Trump had taken part in a criminal enterprise while president.

In explosive testimony to Congress, Cohen said: ""The president of the United States thus wrote a personal cheque for the payment of hush money as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws.""

The cheque, dated Aug 1, 2017, was ""pursuant to the cover-up, which was the basis of my guilty plea,"" he said. He received a total of 11 cheques from Mr Trump over a year after making a $130,000 payment to Ms Daniels, Cohen said.

Cohen also claimed Mr Trump knew in advance that Wikileaks was going to release emails hacked from the Democratic Party during the 2016 election.

Cohen further stated that Mr Trump instructed him to lie to Melania Trump about the alleged affair with Ms Daniels.

He said: ""Mr Trump asked me to pay off an adult film star, with whom he had an affair and to lie to his wife about it, which I did.

Cohen broke with the president last year saying his first loyalty was to his ""family and country"" Credit: AP More

""Lying to the First Lady is one of my biggest regrets. She is a kind, good person. I respect her greatly and she did not deserve that.""

He also claimed the president implicitly instructed him to lie to Congress over a plan to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, and suggested that Mr Trump had advance knowledge of a controversial meeting between his son, Donald Jr., and a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower in New York during the campaign.

Cohen, who once said he would ""take a bullet"" for Mr Trump went on to deliver a character assassination of his former boss, saying: ""I know what Mr. Trump is. He is a racist. He is a conman. He is a cheat.""

He called Mr Trump a ""liar"" who was ""fundamentally disloyal,"" didn't care about the American people, and had campaigned on a ""platform of hate and intolerance"".

Cohen added: ""Donald Trump is a man who ran for office to make his brand great, not to make our country great. He had no desire or intention to lead this nation, only to market himself.

""Mr Trump would often say this campaign was going to be the 'greatest infomercial in political history'. He never expected to win.""

The former lawyer, who has been disbarred, has previously also been convicted of lying to Congress and financial crimes and starts a three-year jail term in May, but said he was seeking redemption by telling the full truth. He added: ""I am no longer your fixer, Mr Trump.""

Cohen voluntarily agreed to a request to appear before the Democrat-controlled House oversight committee.

The committee is investigating issues including the president's compliance with campaign finance laws, and his business practices.

The president, tweeting from Vietnam, accused Cohen of ""lying in order to reduce his prison time"" and Republicans on the House oversight committee furiously accused him of ""trashing"" the president because he didn't get a job in the White House.

Cohen told them how he had been in Mr Trump's office in July 2016 when Roger Stone, a self-described ""dirty trickster"", called the then Republican presidential nominee.",Michael Cohen presents cheque allegedly from Donald Trump to repay Stormy Daniels hush money,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/trumps-former-lawyer-reveal-witnessed-015546287.html

Matt Duss, Sanders' foreign policy adviser, spoke with INSIDER about the senator's global affairs priorities. Duss also addressed som…","It's been less than a week since Sen. Bernie Sanders announced he's running for president again and he's already dominating headlines about the 2020 race in a broad, diverse field of candidates.

Sanders in 2016 went from being a relatively obscure leftist figure to a household name and one of the most popular politicians in the country. His campaign for the presidency was ultimately unsuccessful, but he left his mark on both the Democratic Party and the country by making ideas previously considered radical in the realm of US politics fairly mainstream.

But as Sanders was frequently criticized in 2016 for having a somewhat jumbled approach to foreign policy. Early on, his campaign website didn't have a foreign policy section, and he stumbled on the topic during presidential debates.

Since 2016, however, Sanders has dedicated a significant amount of his time and energy to global affairs.

He's delivered two major speeches on foreign policy, one at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in October 2018 and another in September 2017 at Westminster College— where Winston Churchill gave his infamous ""Iron Curtain"" speech.

Sanders is also leading the charge on a Senate resolution to end US support for Saudi Arabia in Yemen.

Matt Duss, 46, has been at Sanders' side as his foreign policy adviser throughout this shift, and he'll be helping the senator craft his approach to global affairs along the campaign trail.

Duss, a staunch progressive who broke into the political world as a blogger, has gained prominence among left-leaning foreign policy wonks and added significant credibility to Sanders on matters of global import.

Read more: Bernie Sanders slams US support for 'despotic' Saudi Arabia in Yemen and bashes Trump over Khashoggi: 'No more! Enough death. Enough killing.'

Sanders' bold approach to domestic politics is reflected in his views on foreign affairs, which at times makes him a fringe figure in Congress. In recent days, for example, he's been criticized by some congressional Democrats for not recognizing Juan Guaidó as Venezuela's legitimate leader and for not referring to Nicolas Maduro as a dictator.

Duss spoke with INSIDER last week, offering an intimate view into how Sanders sees the world and what the senator will be prioritizing along the campaign trail. He also addressed the criticism Sanders has received on the subject of foreign policy, and why he feels much of it is unfounded.

Editor's Note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

INSIDER: Sanders faced a fair amount of criticism in 2016 for not having a clear foreign policy vision. How has Sanders evolved since and has he made it more of a priority?

Duss: He certainly has made it more of a priority. There's a great deal of evidence for that, not only in the statements he's made, speeches he's given, but also substantively and legislatively. The Yemen war powers resolution is the most prominent example of [Sanders] being more aggressive on the issue of foreign policy and adding it to the progressive agenda.

Coming out of 2016, we recognized that he had a much bigger platform, a much bigger opportunity to move things in a progressive direction and the importance of making foreign policy part of that, which is why he asked me to join the staff.

INSIDER: There are strong anti-interventionist sentiments on both sides of the aisle right now. Barack Obama was fairly critical of the US in a similar way back in 2008, but faced accusations of being unpatriotic as a result. Could Sanders face similar attacks?

Duss: He certainly will. We're seeing it right now with some of the attacks he's getting even from some Democrats on Venezuela.

But there are shared concerns amongst progressives and conservatives about American militarism, the costs, and many unintended consequences of this kind of interventionism that has guided our approach certainly since 9/11, but even before that.

The Yemen resolution, the fact that [Sanders] introduced it with Republican Mike Lee as an original co-sponsor as well as Democrat Chris Murphy — that's an illustration of this, right? Sen. Sanders and Sen. Lee don't agree on a great deal, but they strongly came together around this idea that not only do we need to take a hard look at some of these interventions we're supporting, but we also need to take a hard look and reassert Congress' constitutional authority over these interventions.

This is where you see a sharp difference between Trump's approach and Sen. Sanders' approach. Trump and a lot of the conservatives who support him see international relations in very zero-sum terms: If someone else is winning the US is losing; the US needs to dominate all these relationships.

Sen. Sanders does not see it in those terms, he sees it in very much a positive-sum way: We can all gain when we are working together, multilaterally. We have shared problems and challenges, so we need shared solutions.

INSIDER: You recently told The Nation what it meant to you when in 2008 you heard Obama say he didn't just want to end the Iraq War, he wanted to end ""the mind-set"" that got the US into the war in the first place. But once he entered the White House, Obama encountered a reality that made it difficult to deliver on his campaign's idealistic foreign policy vision. If elected, could Sanders face a similar reality as president?

Duss: That statement [from Obama] meant a lot to me and a lot of other young progressives that I know for a reason — it really captured something.

But let's remember that when Obama came into office he had a financial crisis. There was a lot going on and Obama had an idealistic idea of turning the ship on a number of things, including foreign policy. I don't ding him too hard for some of the decisions he made, they made a great deal of sense at the time. In retrospect, some of the decisions led to really problematic outcomes now, such as the decision not to investigate fully the use of torture or other things like that.

Any president has to deal with the world as it is when they take office. But what Sen. Sanders recognizes is building that kind of movement around this idea, and starting a much more robust conversation and a real political consensus about what America's role in the world should be.

Now that's challenging, right? Because foreign policy is not something that is very immediate to a lot of Americans for obvious reasons, but grounding it in this discussion about how we treat ourselves, how we treat our own society, what kind of society we want it, how that is reflected in our foreign policy is the way to go about it.

INSIDER: Congress essentially abdicated its war-making authority with the Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) in 2001 — which has since allowed presidents to wage an expansive, ill-defined, global war on terrorism with few obstacles. Will Sanders call for repealing the AUMF along the campaign trail?

Duss: He will be focusing on that. He has said that Yemen is important in itself because it's a humanitarian crisis. The US shouldn't be supporting the Saudi coalition.

There's the constitutional question of congressional oversight and of reining in these wars, and that relates to the broader set of issues about the 2001 AUMF and the global war on terror. He will be talking about these things.

INSIDER: Does the Yemen resolution have a realistic shot in the Senate? Does Sanders' forceful criticism of Trump jeopardize the fate of the resolution?

Duss: It does have a realistic chance. We have 51 of the 56 who voted with us in December — they're still in office. Plus we have two new members of the Democratic caucus, both of whom have indicated that they will vote with the caucus, which puts us at 53. We only need 51 votes to move through every stage of this process.

The Trump administration will put a lot of pressure on Republicans to peel off this thing. But it's the same resolution that passed two months ago. The humanitarian crisis [in Yemen] has only gotten worse.

INSIDER: Sanders' criticism of Israel, particularly on the debate stage in 2016, is notable for multiple reasons. He's Jewish and less susceptible to accusations of anti-Semitism. But it's politically risky. Does Sanders want to radically alter the US-Israel relationship or is he more concerned with the rights of Palestinians and related humanitarian issues?

Duss: I don't think he wants to radically reorient the relationship. He's been clear he supports Israel's right to exist, he supports the two state solution.

But going back to that debate you mentioned, his point about [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu] has been borne out many, many times. We just saw this week with Netanyahu literally forming an alliance with fascists, people who are identified as terrorists.

But the approach [Sanders] would support, and has supported, is one that is consistent with our relationships with other countries, which is to say: we support the rights of Israelis and Palestinians to live in security and dignity. And we have to recognize when policy, for example the settlements or the occupation, undermine those goals. So the US needs to speak clearly about that and when necessary we need to take steps to put pressure to stop those policies. [Sanders is] going to be willing to do that.

INSIDER: Sanders has been accused of being too soft on dictatorial leaders like Fidel and Raul Castro, Daniel Ortega, and more recently Nicolas Maduro. Is any of this criticism fair?

Duss: There are times where he's definitely pushed back on some of the reflexive hawkishness of the establishment. But he's always been consistently for human rights and self-determination.

His statement on Maduro, if you go back to what he initially said, reflects that. He's very clear about Maduro's abuse of his population and the corruption.

But that doesn't mean that we endorse Trump's approach here. It's making sure that the approach is consistent and grounded in a set of principles — human dignity, human security.

INSIDER: Sanders is also facing criticism for not recognizing Juan Guaidó as the legitimate leader in Venezuela, including from Democrats in Congress, as the US and many of its allies take a stand against Maduro. From the senator's perspective, how should the US approach the crisis in Venezuela?

Duss: No one is defending Maduro — the senator certainly is not doing that.

But coming out as Trump has done and sort of putting the US in the lead — just completely recognizing Guaidó as the president— and putting the US four-square behind the opposition, has the potential to create some possible outcomes that the US is not quite prepared for.

There are also other people the US could be talking to. It's unfortunate that the Trump administration did not pursue the opening with Cuba that the Obama administration started, because talking to Cuba right now could actually be really useful.

INSIDER: That's an interesting point because Trump is clearly open to dialogue with North Korea, and has defended the notion of talking to your enemies, even as he went after Obama over reopening dialogue Cuba and Iran. What's Sanders' view on this?

Duss: Sen. Sanders was perhaps the only member of the Democratic office to actually compliment Trump's last summit with Kim Jong Un for that reason. Talking is better than threats.

INSIDER: So, if we ultimately have a President Bernie Sanders, would we also see more dialogue with America's geopolitical adversaries?

Duss: We certainly would. We'd be clear about the values and the outcomes the US favors — self-determination and human rights, respect for people's dignity and their security.

But the fact is the US is extraordinarily powerful and we don't have to fear sitting down with anyone, whether it's the North Koreans, whether it's Iran, whomever.

INSIDER: Trump has a record of praising dubious world leaders and Sanders has referred to the president as an ""authoritarian."" Do you agree with the senator?

Duss: [Trump] is certainly behaving in authoritarian ways. There's some ways in which he is being constrained.

But certainly using the bully pulpit, the huge megaphone that he has on Twitter and elsewhere, to attack the press, to attack progressives, to attack all kinds of people — these have consequences.

We've seen violence against the media. We saw this guy who was just arrested planning this huge attack.

Leaders in other countries take notice of what the president of the US says. In talking to activists in other countries, there is no question in their mind that they feel that their oppression and [their leader's] use of these tools to control, oppress, and persecute their own people is being affirmed by the president of the US. That's a huge problem.

INSIDER: If you had to summarize Sanders' worldview as succinctly as possible, what would you say?

Duss: He sees the US as a kind of global facilitator by virtue of our enormous economic, diplomatic power. The US has the ability to bring parties, states, and people around tables to address common challenges that really no other country has.

That doesn't mean that the US needs to run to the head of every parade or be in charge of everything — certainly not. But the US does have a role to play in facilitating multilateral cooperation, conversation, and innovation.",Q&A WITH MATT DUSS: Bernie Sanders' foreign policy adviser breaks down the senator's progressive global agenda for 2020,Business Insider,https://www.businessinsider.com/matt-duss-bernie-sanders-foreign-policy-adviser-2019-2
287,Empty,2019-02-28T22:30:40Z,Theresa May’s and Jeremy Corbyn’s recent concessions should make the prospect of a chaotic Brexit in four weeks less likely. But a great deal of uncertainty remains.,"Brexit, at the moment, is an exercise in game theory. This week, both Prime Minister Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the Labour Party, grudgingly agreed to open the way for options that could help to break the current deadlock over the terms of Britain’s exit from the European Union. In May’s case, the option was a possible vote in Parliament to delay Brexit, which is now scheduled, ready or not, for March 29th; in Corbyn’s, it was a new referendum that might overturn Brexit altogether. Both May and Corbyn were acting because of rebellions within their own ranks, which escalated last week—when both Labour and Conservative M.P.s resigned from their parties—and threatened to spread. May reportedly made her offer because three members of her cabinet were about to quit, taking a dozen junior ministers with them.

On the surface, these concessions should make the prospect of a chaotic Brexit in four weeks less likely. But a great deal of uncertainty remains. Neither May nor Corbyn can necessarily deliver what they’ve offered. Neither even seems to really want to.

An impetus behind the M.P.s’ resignations was the belief that the British government was, as the Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, put it on Monday, “sleepwalking” toward a cliff edge—the no-deal Brexit. This would mean leaving the E.U. with no agreement in place—no clear rules for trade, for British citizens travelling to Europe, even for things like planes arriving and departing—and, if nothing is done, it will happen on March 29th. May did, in January, present Parliament with a deal that she had negotiated with the E.U., but it was voted down by a historic margin. A no-deal is no one’s preference, although some Tory hard Brexiteers are strangely drawn to it, as if mesmerized by the prospect of Britain standing alone. On Tuesday, May told Parliament, “I believe if we have to we will ultimately make a success of a no-deal.” She was interrupted by jeers and laughter.

Corbyn was the first to bestir himself, when he said, on Monday, that, if Labour’s own vague and unrealistic Brexit plan wasn’t approved by Parliament this week (and it was not), he could see supporting a second referendum. But he also said that he would “continue to push for the other available options”—whatever those may be. In the Brexit referendum, in June of 2016, Labour formally backed remain, but Corbyn didn’t do much to hide his antipathy for the E.U. He had to do something, though. A growing number of M.P.s are fed up with his failure to back a second referendum; with what they see as his toleration of anti-Semitism, which he denies; or, in many cases, with both. (On Wednesday, one of Corbyn’s close allies was suspended, after the Yorkshire Post published a video in which the ally says that the Labor Party has been “too apologetic” about anti-Semitism.)

Corbyn’s commitment might never have been tested, but, on Tuesday, May told Parliament that she was making “three commitments.” The first is another vote on her plan, with whatever tweaks she can get the E.U. to agree on, “by Tuesday, the 12th of March, at the latest.” (There had been rumors in the British press that she might give it a try a week sooner.) If Parliament then votes no again, there will be a vote by March 13th, which will ask members if they would support leaving, as scheduled, with no deal. Their answer should be a resounding no, assuming that everyone is acting rationally—though, when it comes to Brexit, an astonishing number of senior politicians are not. But, assuming that M.P.s vote down a no-deal exit, May will then allow a third parliamentary vote, on March 14th, on whether to ask the European Union for what’s called an Article 50 delay—pushing back the date of Brexit. By then, there will just be two weeks to go.

There are a lot of caveats here. It’s helpful, in mapping them out, to look at the exact wording of May’s “commitment,” which is to

bring forward a motion on whether Parliament wants to seek a short, limited extension to Article 50 and, if the House votes for an extension, seek to agree that extension approved by the House with the EU, and bring forward the necessary legislation to change the exit date commensurate with that extension.

What counts as a “short, limited” time frame? No one knows. Would May impose party discipline to get Tories to vote for the delay? She wouldn’t say. (In the same statement in which she promised the vote on an extension, she said, “Let me be clear: I do not want to see Article 50 extended.”) How about getting it “agreed” by the E.U.? That will be tricky. Each of the twenty-seven other member countries will have to agree to an extension, and any one of them can veto it. A number of European leaders, including Rutte, Pedro Sánchez, of Spain, and Emmanuel Macron, of France, have said that they will agree only if Britain presents an actual plan for what it will do with the extra time; they don’t want to just green-light another season of Brexit psychodrama. (There is a way for Britain to call the whole thing off unilaterally, thanks to a European Court of Justice ruling in December, but to do that it would have to tell the E.U. that it was truly abandoning Brexit, not just playing for time.) And the conditions that they might insist on—Spain has outstanding issues with Britain regarding the status of Gibraltar—could cause Parliament to balk.

For example, May could head to Brussels on March 15th with a mandate to ask for a two-month delay. (That would make a certain amount of sense, since the European Parliament elections are being held from May 23rd to the 26th, and there is a question of whether Britain would participate, if it is still, technically, in the E.U. at that time.) But E.U. diplomats might conclude that two months isn’t enough time to approve another deal, and might instead offer a six-month, or longer, delay, or one with conditions.

A key aspect of game theory is trying to assess your counterpart’s motives. British Brexiteers constantly talk about their conviction that the E.U. will “blink” in the negotiations regarding the question of the border with the Republic of Ireland, which will remain in the E.U.—this involves the so-called backstop. But the U.K. hasn’t actually given the E.U. anything coherent that they can blink at. The problem is that Britain wants both a hard border with the E.U. and a frictionless border with the Republic of Ireland. (Many of the U.K. commitments under the Good Friday Agreement peace accords rely on the openness of that border.) May’s government hasn’t explained how it wants that to happen, beyond dreamy talk about technology that does not yet exist. She has, in the past, rejected the idea of a special status for Northern Ireland, in part because the Tories rely on Northern Irish unionists for their parliamentary majority. So the withdrawal agreement contains the backstop, which means, in effect, that all of the United Kingdom will stay in a customs union, until Parliament comes up with a rational solution. The hard-core Brexiteers want, at the least, a time limit on the backstop—which would allow them to run out the clock. But that would leave Ireland in the lurch: it doesn’t want to undo the Good Friday accords, but it also doesn’t want to compromise its standing in the E.U. The latter concern is the reason that Ireland might even countenance a no-deal Brexit over a bad-deal-for-Ireland one. And yet the British, who have long believed that the Irish can’t do without them, live in the hope that Ireland will abandon the backstop, or that the E.U. will abandon Ireland—something the E.U. has said it will never do.

In an interview this week with the Irish radio program “Newstalk,” Leo Varadkar, the Irish Taoiseach, or Prime Minister, said of the British, “They don’t understand why we’re not leaving, too. They don’t understand why we won’t—to use their language—fall in line.” The answer, he continued, is that “we made a decision, as a country, a hundred years ago, to be independent. We made a decision, in recent decades, to join the European Union. . . . Our place is at the heart of the European Union, which we helped to build, and that means we’re going to travel a different road to the United Kingdom—but I think it’s going to be a better road.” (Varadkar added, “I think an extension would always be better than no-deal, but a deal would be better than an extension.”)

And how would all the extension machinations fit with the prospect of a second referendum? This is where the game theory gets particularly complicated. John McDonnell, a senior Labour leader, said, on Wednesday, that the Party would seek to offer the referendum question as an amendment in the March 12th vote on May’s deal. In other words, M.P.s could, in theory, vote not on her deal but on one amended to stipulate that, after being approved by Parliament, it must be approved by the public in another referendum. Presumably, ditching the whole idea of Brexit would be a second option on that referendum. Such a vote would provide some democratic legitimacy to the Brexit dénouement, whichever side won, and fulfill the E.U.’s desire that something would actually happen in the extra time.

But there would have to be a majority in Parliament for such an amendment, and Labour doesn’t have that—not yet, anyway. (There is also a significant pro-Brexit contingent on the left.) Indeed, Corbyn might offer the amendment just as a way of going through the motions, in the hope that May’s government will completely fall apart, leading to a new general election. That, too, might count as action, in terms of explaining to the E.U. why the U.K. needs more time. It might also count as a move from game theory to chaos theory. That’s one way to wake from a sleepwalk.",Postpone Brexit? Maybe Get a Do-Over?

Election Day, November 3, 2020, is 20 months over the horizon. Already, there are currently eleven declared candidates for the Democratic Party presidential nomination with another eight or ten waiting in the wings. With this gaggle of dedicated and oblivious leftists jockeying for position, there is no end to the radical proposals and concepts being bandied about. However, all these policy propositions have three common goals: the rapid erosion of personal freedom, an equally rapid acceleration of the United States into another failed socialist experiment, and the permanent assumption of power by the self-anointed elites on the left and the Democratic Party. Nothing reflects this programmed allegiance to socialism and the collective ignorance of the leaders of the Democratic Party more than the economic and societal proposals that have emerged and been endorsed by its presidential candidates over the past two months. On the surface they no doubt sound great to those who pay little or no attention to facts and reality. A philosophical discourse on the attributes of capitalism versus socialism oftentimes causes the eyes of the true-believers on the left to glaze over and their minds to go blank, but perhaps a financial reality check would be more meaningful.

The following grab bag of serious proposals by the Democrats, and their cost over ten years (in 2019 dollars), reflect the lunacy that has seized so many on the left: The Green New Deal: Cost of: Guaranteed Green Housing…$4.2 Trillion Zero Emissions Transportation System…$2.7 Trillion Low-Carbon Electricity Grid…$5.4 Trillion High Speed Rail System…$2.5 Trillion Federal Income Guarantee for all Americans…$44.6 Trillion Total………………. $59.4 Trillion Medicare For All (universal health care)… $32.6 Trillion Cost of Reparations for African-Americans… $14.0 Trillion Free College Tuition and Forgiveness of Students Debt…$2.4 Trillion Interest Expense due to higher borrowing and interest rates…$6.6 Trillion All the above are new proposals and spending which total $116.0 Trillion. However, there is still the issue of current government spending at the federal, state and local level. The Federal Government currently spends (minus health care and interest) $2.9 Trillion per year. Ten years of this federal spending (assuming a 1.5% real annual increase) …$31.1 Trillion Current state and local spending (less: health care) $2.95 Trillion per year. Ten years of this state and local spending (assuming a 1.5% real annual increase… $31.6 Trillion The unleashed and unhinged Democratic Party and their mad dash to bankrupt the country in combination with what is currently being spent totals: $178.7 Trillion over ten years. The annual total economic output of the nation is currently $20.0 Trillion (assuming a highly unlikely 1.0% real annual growth) or the nation would have economic activity of $211.0 Trillion over ten years. Government spending at all levels would devour 85% of the economic output of the nation. This year it will be 37%. The above calculus assumes that the economy could possibly maintain this level of output with all the spending listed above. With so little capital available to the private sector, and taxes on all productive members of society, by necessity at confiscatory levels, there would be, at first, a stagnant and quickly thereafter a rapidly declining economy. The vast majority of citizens would no longer be productive, as they would have guaranteed income from the government as long as the government was able to pay -- which would not be for long. The mind-numbed robots on the left often revert to the evergreen solution of “we can borrow the money.” Currently, the total government debt at the federal, state and local levels is nearly $26.0 Trillion, or 130% of the nation’s total annual economic output (or Gross Domestc Product). When a nation finds itself in debt to the tune of 200% of its annual GDP, and spending is out of control, borrowing becomes extraordinarily expensive and lenders hard to find. Therefore, this nation might be able to borrow another $14 to $20 Trillion over ten years, but that would barely make a dent in the above government spending demands. Besides, the monies would eventually have to be repaid or the assets of the nation sold to the highest bidder. The other glib answer by the left to the spending demands is “the government can print more money.” Yes, it can. But the as the quantity of money available increases, the more rapidly it loses value and more will be required in exchange for tangible goods or services,, which begets additional printing of money in a never-ending downward spiral. If all this sounds vaguely familiar it was what happened in Venezuela (among more recent examples). The candidates for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, the senior leadership of the party and its younger members, such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, are either mind numbingly ignorant, indoctrinated robots or they are so desperate for power that they will do or say anything they think will enable them to win elections. When their economic proposals are combined with their determination to transform the culture and legalize infanticide as well as eventually euthanasia, the Democratic Party is now a clear and present danger to all Americans.",The Obliviousness and Conniving of the Democratic Party,Americanthinker.com,https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2019/02/the_obliviousness_and_conniving_of_the_democratic_party.html

The Senate on Monday rejected a bill making it a felony for a doctor to harm or neglect an infant who survives an “attempted abortion,” part of a Republican effort to squeeze Democrats ahead of the 2020 campaign.

The vote split mainly along party lines, 53-44. Democratic Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Doug Jones of Alabama and Joe Manchin of West Virginia crossed the aisle to vote for it; no Republicans broke ranks. Sixty votes are required for the bill to advance.

Story Continued Below

“Evidently the far left is no longer convinced that all babies are created equal,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).

Ahead of the vote, the bill’s Republican sponsors and outside anti-abortion groups lobbying for its passage made it clear that the intent of Monday’s vote was to undermine the growing pool of Senate Democrats running for president.

In a speech just before the vote, bill author Sen. Ben Sasse quoted campaign stump speeches by Democratic Sens. Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand and independent Bernie Sanders vowing to look out for society’s “voiceless and vulnerable” and accused them of hypocrisy for opposing his bill’s regulations for the care of newborns.

""Was that all just clap track for the campaign trail and for soundbites? Or do people mean the stuff that they say around here?"" he said of his colleagues with White House aspirations.

Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group closely allied with Hill Republicans and the Trump administration, said Monday that it was “watching this vote closely to see whether leading Democratic candidates for president in 2020 will go on the record for or against infanticide.”

""This bill is important in itself but it‘s also important as a setup for the coming election, where there will be a stark contrast between the president of the United States and any one of the Democratic nominees,"" SBA List President Marjorie Dannenfelser said in an interview. She stood just outside the Senate chamber lobbying senators as they entered to cast their votes.

Sanders, Harris, Warren, Booker and Gillibrand all voted against the measure. Sherrod Brown, another Democratic senator exploring a White House bid, complained to POLITICO that the vote was held in bad faith.

""This is pure Mitch McConnell. It's all aimed at keeping his base in line, while the president grows increasingly unpopular,"" the Ohio Democrat said. ""We're not doing infrastructure, we're not doing health care. We're not doing anything that matters to help our country. It's just votes on abortion and other kinds of divisive votes he's going to bring.""

Democrats and reproductive rights advocates blasted the bill, saying it's already a felony to harm or neglect an infant and that the “medically irresponsible” bill would restricts doctors from making case-by-case decisions about what is best for infants and mothers.

""This bill is not about protecting infants, as Republicans have claimed — because that is not up for debate and it is already the law,"" said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.). ""This bill is government interference in women’s health care, in families’ lives, and in medicine on steroids.""

The bill was previously introduced in the House by now-Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.). Sasse first tried to force a vote on it earlier this month, capitalizing on a wave of outrage among conservatives after New York loosened its restrictions on third-trimester abortions and embattled Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam gave an interview defending similar efforts in his state.

Democrats led by Murray objected to that fast-track procedure and blocked a floor vote, prompting Republicans to vow to try again.

Susan B. Anthony list said earlier this month that even though the Senate lacks the votes to pass abortion restrictions, it should continue to hold votes to put pressure on Democrats and divide the caucus. The move is part of a larger strategy designed to maintain current abortion restrictions while revving up the GOP’s conservative base ahead of 2020 and courting independents who may be turned off by Democrats' position on abortion rights.

""We're seeing a gradual movement to hammer a wedge right into the middle of the Democratic Party, and at some point soon here, they're just going to have to cry mercy,"" Dannenfelser said.","Senate defeats anti-abortion bill, as GOP tries to jam Dems",Politico,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/25/senate-defeats-anti-abortion-bill-1185531

CPAC began its day with Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee, and North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows, a day after ex-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen’s testimony before the committee. Discussing the Cohen hearing, where Democrats pressed the former Trump adviser for dirt on the president, Jordan said: “This is step one in the Democrats’ crazy efforts to impeach the president of the United States.”

CPAC TO HIGHLIGHT FREEDOM AGENDA: 'SOCIALISM DOES NOT MAKE AMERICA GREAT'

“And the best they could come up with is this guy who is going to prison in two months for lying to Congress,” Jordan said of Cohen. “That’s their star witness. That’s their first big hearing.”

Meadows told the crowd he believes Democrats are “trying to lay the foundation” for impeachment by calling Cohen to testify.

FOR THE BEST CPAC MOMENTS, GO TO FOX NATION

“It’s not just impeachment,” the North Carolina Republican said. “It’s taking away everything that is foundational of who we are.”

He joked about New York Democratic Rep. Ocasio Cortez’s recent vow to pay her staffers a living wage by reducing the salary of senior staffers in her office.

“She’s really serious about it,” Meadows said. “Maybe she needs to put her money in there.”

The gathering comes amid the rise of democratic socialists like Ocasio-Cortez, and 2020 Democratic presidential candidates embracing progressive causes like “Medicare-for-all.”

“They are embracing socialism,” Meadows said.

He added, “We’ve got to get to a point where we celebrate capitalism and understand that in America, it doesn’t matter who you are, where you came from, that the American dream is available for everybody.”

The embrace of big-government policies by Democratic candidates already has become a defining feature of the 2020 presidential race, and something the Trump re-election campaign has been eager to highlight.

Jordan knocked Democrats for embracing policies like the “Green New Deal,” abolishing ICE and higher taxes for the wealthy. “This is how radical they are,” he said.

“When it gets down to President Trump against whoever the left nominates, President Trump is going to clean their clock in my judgment. He’s going to win. Understand just how radical they are,” Jordan added.

Former Trump adviser Sebastian Gorka echoed the comments in his own CPAC speech.

“What is America’s biggest problem? Not socialism in Russia, but in America!” he said, while likening the Green New Deal to a watermelon: “Green on the outside, deep, deep red on the inside.”

Meadows and Jordan also took aim at congressional probes into whether Trump’s campaign in 2016 coordinated with the Russians.

Speaking of Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Meadows said, “Here’s the interesting thing. He continues to go on over and over and over again that he’s got all this collusion evidence. What I say is: bring it on. Because we know that he doesn’t have anything.”

The annual conference of hardcore conservatives began Wednesday at National Harbor, where the theme is “What Makes America Great” – a not-so-subtle play on Trump’s campaign slogan.

Matt Schlapp, the chairman of CPAC sponsor the American Conservative Union, told Fox News that the conference plans to strike a sharp contrast with socialism by focusing on freedom and America's founding principles.

“The Democrats are flirting with this idea that the principles that founded this country are actually rotten and need to be cast aside,” Schlapp said in a recent interview with Fox News.

Thousands of attendees – typically including many college-aged conservatives – gather every year for the summit. President Trump is expected to address attendees on Saturday.

The White House is sending Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council and former television host, for an appearance Thursday. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao will also be coming from the Trump administration. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel is addressing attendees.

Lawmakers expected include South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, Utah Sen. Mike Lee, Georgia Sen. David Perdue and Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn.

As is tradition, the gathering will include a straw poll, which will ask people to assess the president’s performance. It will also poll the 2020 Republican primary, including possible GOP challengers to Trump. It will ask attendees who they think Democrats will nominate in the presidential race. And a new question this year asks attendees to rate the honesty of several specific media figures, organizers said.

Recent measures by governments across ex-communist Europe have created an increasingly oppressive intellectual climate. And the de-democratization of higher education and of science in general are just the first step toward putting experts in the service of broader anti-democratic goals.

BUDAPEST – The World War I exhibit at the House of European History in Brussels offers visitors an arresting sight. In a simple yet dramatic gesture, the museum has placed the pistol used in the June 1914 assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in a glass-paneled cabinet right in the center of the room.

The tour guide informed our group that, following much heated debate, the museum had agreed to change the objects on display from time to time, so that different countries could exhibit their most precious historical relics. But when I peevishly remarked that the pistol Gavrilo Princip used in Sarajevo is irreplaceable, the curator replied that four European museums claim to have the authentic pistol on display.

As much as I respect and defend the plurality of European national traditions, only one pistol, not four, triggered the outbreak of World War I. We cannot be “pluralistic” and “inclusive” when historical facts dictate a single right answer to a question. And such questions must be decided by experts who have been rigorously educated in the history (and trained in the historical sources) of a given era, not by those with a political agenda.

Such a view may seem like common sense. But scientists, their institutions, and the legitimacy of scientific knowledge itself are under increasing threat in several European countries. Freely elected governments have recently blocked financial support for research projects with no official explanation (Bulgaria), removed educational programs from the list of accredited university subjects (Hungary), and even eliminated entire disciplines (Poland).

These governments are disregarding centuries-old university traditions that were respected even during the communist era. But the powers behind such decisions are not interested in establishing historical or scientific facts. And they are ready to criticize, ridicule, or even threaten those who have already acquired such knowledge, or wish to do so.

We should reject the notion that the instigators of these attacks are ignorant and uneducated, and do not respect knowledge. Senior members of the Hungarian government that forced the Central European University, founded by the financier George Soros, to move to Vienna, and banned gender studies, had previously received scholarships from Soros’s Open Society Foundation to study in Oxford, New York, and elsewhere. These are highly educated people who know that knowledge is power, have a clear agenda, and are taking advantage of the fact that education in the European Union is the responsibility of national governments, not Brussels-based institutions.

These governments want to establish an educational system according to which the state alone decides which fields of research are necessary and socially important. In the long run, they probably also want the state to grant political loyalists the right to produce and transfer knowledge.

In other words, access to knowledge will cease to be a civil right. Political trustworthiness will determine who can teach and study what about a country and its past. This would mean the de-democratization of higher education and of science in general and putting “experts” in the service of broader anti-democratic goals. To prevent the latter, we must resist the former.

Democratic science policies build on the principle that access to science is a human right. Furthermore, they assume correctly that the knowledge produced through a democratic spirit of inquiry is of higher quality than that produced by someone who became an “expert” through political connections.

Many questions in the social sciences and humanities have straightforward answers. Ultimately, we should accept the verdicts of experts who have devoted their careers to a particular issue, and not those with political axes to grind.

We must, therefore, fight the disturbing trend of European governments giving themselves the right to decide scientific questions, and appointing loyal supporters to act as arbiters of truth. And we should question whether the new, ideologically-based governmental research institutes and universities in some of these countries have a rightful place in the network of European universities and research institutions.

Social scientists and other academics across ex-communist Europe are once again working in an increasingly oppressive intellectual climate. It must not be up to them alone to defend the democratic quest for knowledge against those who would decide by government decree which pistol was fired in Sarajevo.",Intellectual Freedom and Its New Enemies,Project-syndicate.org,https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/eastern-european-governments-attack-scientific-knowledge-by-andrea-peto-2019-02

Northeast Nigeri…","By Camillus Eboh and Felix Onuah

ABUJA (Reuters) - President Muhammadu Buhari took an early lead on Monday in initial official results from Nigeria's presidential election, but the party of his main challenger quickly rejected the tallies as ""incorrect and unacceptable"".

Saturday's election, which U.S. observers said had lost some credibility after being abruptly delayed by a week by officials citing organizational glitches, was expected to be Nigeria's tightest since the end of military rule two decades ago.

At stake is control of Africa's top oil producer and biggest economy. Northeast Nigeria has also been wracked by a decade-long battle with Islamist militants that has spilled into neighboring countries and led to the deployment of a regional task force.

Buhari, 76, is a former military ruler seeking a second term on an anti-corruption platform, while Atiku Abubakar, 72, a businessman and former vice president, has pledged to expand the role of the private sector.

Initial results released by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Monday put Buhari in the lead, having won in seven of Nigeria's 36 states, the commission said.

Atiku prevailed in four states and the capital, Abuja, which is not a state but treated as a separate district in elections.

Buhari led Atiku by 51 percent to 46 percent, according to a Reuters tally based on the figures given by the commission.

In provisional results announced in state capitals but not yet confirmed by the commission, Buhari had won four states to Atiku's one.

In the northern state of Kano, hundreds of people celebrated Buhari's provisional lead in what was billed as one of the key battlegrounds in this year's elections.

""Kano is for Buhari,"" Wahab Abdulawal, a trader, said.

Asked about the early results, Buhari told reporters: ""I don't want to depend on rumors. ... We will rather wait for INEC to announce the (full) results.""

But the chairman of Atiku's People's Democratic Party (PDP), Uche Secondus, said the election tallies announced so far were ""incorrect and unacceptable"".

""The results are being manipulated and canceled for APC to retain power,"" he told reporters, referring to Buhari's party.

Buhari's All Progressives Congress (APC) said in a statement that the PDP had ""embarked on a cynical plan to discredit INEC as a backup plan in the likely event of them losing the election"".

The outcome, expected this week, appears to hinge on which man voters trust most to revamp an economy still struggling from a 2016 recession.

A credible and relatively calm vote would open a new chapter in the checkered political history of Nigeria, where nearly six decades of independence have been tarnished by military coups, endemic corruption and secessionist movements.

But doubts rose when the election was postponed on Feb. 16, just hours before it was due to begin, with authorities citing problems in delivering ballot papers and results sheets.

'NEGATIVE EFFECTS'

The week-long delay in holding Nigeria's presidential election damaged public trust in the process and probably reduced Saturday's voter turnout, U.S. observers said.

The civil society group YIAGA AFRICA, which monitored the election, projected turnout at 36 to 40 percent.

Situation Room, a monitoring mission comprising over 70 civic groups, said on Sunday that as many as 39 people had been killed in election-related violence, and more than 260 in all since the start of the campaign in October.

Voting, however, took place ""in a generally peaceful environment"", said Hailemariam Desalegn, head of the African Union observer mission and a former premier of Ethiopia.

""There were scattered incidents of violence but it was not seen as pervasive on Election Day,"" said Derek Mitchell, president of the U.S. observer mission.

Previous Nigerian elections have been marred by violence among supporters of different political parties that at times sparked conflict between Christians and Muslims. Security forces are currently stretched by the Islamist insurgency as well as by communal violence and banditry in other areas.

Hours before polls opened, explosions rocked Maiduguri, capital of Borno state, epicenter of the insurgency. In neighboring Yobe, residents of the town of Geidam fled a militant attack around the same time.",Nigerian election's early tally puts Buhari ahead; opposition rejects it,Yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/nigerian-elections-early-tally-puts-buhari-ahead-opposition-002542618.html

Zoe Lofgren said H.R. 1 ""ends the dominance of big money in our politics. It ensures public officials work in the public interest."" | Alex Wong/Getty Images congress House Democrats forge ahead on electoral reform bill

House Democrats on Tuesday took a big step in fulfilling one of their major campaign promises of last year's midterms, advancing a sweeping voting rights, campaign finance and ethics reform package.

The House Administration Committee approved the bill — known as H.R. 1, or the ""For the People Act"" — by a 6-3, party-line vote.

Story Continued Below

“H.R. 1 makes it easier, not harder, to vote,” Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), the committee chair, said at the hearing. “It ends the dominance of big money in our politics. It ensures public officials work in the public interest.”

It is expected to come to the House floor in the coming weeks, according to a Democratic aide familiar with the proceedings and End Citizens United Executive Director Tiffany Muller, whose organization has been strongly pushing the legislation. The Democratic aide spoke on the condition of anonymity because the floor schedule for next week has not been finalized.

The bill will likely pass the House, having already secured 227 co-sponsors, all Democrats.

During the hearing, ranking member Rodney Davis (R-Ill.) and other Republicans bemoaned the speed with which the bill was headed to the floor, saying Republicans have not had a chance to work on the bill and that state election officials were not adequately consulted.

“This bill is being rushed to the floor of the House for political reasons instead of good policy,” Davis said. “I’m for open processes. You know what? This is an epiphany. All of you who said we didn’t have enough hearings on the tax bill or the health care bill? You were right. You were right! Why are you doing the same thing to us, when you take control?”

H.R. 1 contains a laundry list of voting reforms for which Democrats have long advocated. Included among the voting rights provisions are automatic voter registration, expanding early voting nationally, supporting D.C. statehood and requiring that House redistricting be conducted through independent commissions.

It also takes aim at the federal campaign finance system, overhauling the Federal Election Commission. The bill would also force so-called “dark money” groups to disclose donors, includes the Honest Ads Act (which requires digital platforms to maintain a public database of ads) and creates a publicly financed small-donor matching program for congressional and presidential campaigns.

Some provisions are seemingly targeted at President Donald Trump. One such provision would force presidential inaugural committees to disclose expenditures and another would require presidential and vice presidential candidates to publicly disclose 10 years worth of tax returns.

Republicans introduced 28 amendments throughout the hearing, all of which failed on a party-line votes.

Many of the Republicans’ amendments sought to strike provisions from the bill, saying parts of H.R. 1 amounts to federal overreach, while also raising concerns that the cost of the bill was unknown.

“H.R. 1 is a prime example of the Democratic party telling states that the federal government knows better than they do,” Davis said.

One of the most contentious amendments, introduced by Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), would prohibit the practice of “ballot harvesting” — where third party groups collect absentee ballots and turn them in. It is illegal in some states like North Carolina, and legal in others, such as California. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has previously blamed ballot harvesting for the GOP’s near wipeout in the Golden State.

“Most recently, we saw a new election ordered in North Carolina due to ballot harvesting allegations,” Walker said, introducing the amendment, referring to allegations of election fraud in North Carolina’s 9th District. In the district, a contractor for Republican Mark Harris both illegally collected and manipulated absentee ballots.

“I hate to break it to everybody, but that’s just not going to be relegated to North Carolina,” Davis said. “If you want to federalize everything else, why wouldn’t we stop this process?”

Democrats pushed back, saying Republicans were conflating a bad actor in North Carolina manipulating ballots with California voters being allowed to cast absentee ballots by mail up until Election Day, and the work of groups legitimately submitting ballots.

“I think the amendment to some extent, is illogical,” Lofgren said. “There have been no credible reports of fraudulent or otherwise illegal [activities] in California. I understand that many people outside of California were perplexed about why the count took so long. Those of us in California know why.”

The bill will eventually head to the Senate, where it will likely die. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has given several floor speeches opposing the bill, as well as writing an op-ed in The Washington Post decrying the bill as the “Democrat[ic] Politician Protection Act.”

The companion Senate bill is still being worked on, according to Muller, the ECU executive director. She told reporters Tuesday that she expected several potential 2020 presidential contenders in the upper chamber to sign on as co-sponsors.

And Democrats plan to hammer Republicans over the bill’s presumed failure. Many freshmen House Democrats ran on government reform in the midterms and expect the issue to be salient on the campaign trail in 2020.

“H.R. 1 is not going to be a flash in the pan,” freshman Rep. Max Rose (D-N.Y.) said earlier on Tuesday. “We’re going to constantly, constantly put before them the question of, ‘Whose side are you on?’”

“I think there is a sentiment in this town right now that, ‘We just got to get past this H.R. 1 s---, and then we can go back to normal order,’"" Rose added. ""No, there’s no going back. You’re not going to be escaping this because that’s our responsibility to the American people.”",House Democrats forge ahead on electoral reform bill,Politico,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/26/democrats-electoral-reform-bill-1188437

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal.

The resolution declares a sense of Congress that “climate change is real; human activity during the last century is the dominant cause of the climate crisis; and the United States and Congress should take immediate action to address the challenge of climate change.” But it's not nearly as detailed as the 14-page resolution put out by Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass.

Democrats are seeking a way to avoid voting for the Green New Deal. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he’ll bring up the controversial resolution for a vote before the August recess in order to put Democratic support for the measure on the record.

The Green New Deal calls for replacing fossil fuels with wind and solar, retrofitting homes and buildings, and overhauling the nation’s agriculture system to make it more sustainable and environmentally friendly. The resolution calls for providing healthcare, higher education, and jobs for all.

Most Democrats have distanced themselves from the ambitious goals of the Green New Deal and had planned to vote “present” on the measure.

[Opinion: Even Democrats and the Green Party are trashing the Green New Deal]

Democrats are angry that McConnell is bringing it up for a vote. The short resolution, introduced by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Tom Carper, D-Del., gives Democrats another option.

“In the days and weeks ahead, Senator McConnell intends to engage in a ploy to inflict damage on the Democratic Party and the entire climate change movement,” Carper said. “To the American people, hear this: We cannot and will not allow cynicism to win. Not now, and not with so much at stake. Climate action should not be an issue that divides us. That’s why Democrats are united behind this resolution and in support of policies that reduce our nation’s carbon footprint, help create a fairer, stronger economy and support those most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.”",Senate Democrats introduce alternative to the controversial Green New Deal - Washington Examiner,Washingtonexaminer.com,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/senate-democrats-introduce-alternative-to-the-controversial-green-new-deal

It makes an irrefutable case for the need for a Jewish homeland.,"The jolt to Labour seems to have galvanized the party to confront the seeping infiltration of anti-Semitism. Tom Watson, the deputy leader, has called on Corbyn to expel Labour members accused of anti-Semitism. They’ve tended to face mild reprimands, if that. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said there’d been “a lot of listening but not enough action.” Jon Lansman, a founder of the Momentum organization that has supported Corbyn, now says there is “a major problem” with “hard-core anti-Semitic opinion.” Where have these guys been in recent years during what Pat McFadden, another Labour M.P., described to me as “open season for the abuse of my Jewish colleagues”?

In a typical incident this week, a Labour M.P. who is a Corbyn ally, Chris Williamson, tried to express regret for saying the party had been “too apologetic” about anti-Semitism, only to claim in his “apology” that it is “often forgotten” how few cases of anti-Semitism there are. He has been suspended.

Under Corbyn, actions have usually lagged words. The party decided in 2016 that “Zio,” an insult used by the Ku Klux Klan, was unacceptable. Its use persists as an abbreviation of Zionist, itself turned into a dirty word.

“I am very proud and very relaxed about the fact that I openly support the creation of the State of Israel and the right for the Jewish people to have a homeland,” Berger said, noting that she’s a Zionist but “others have sought to hijack the word” and “we know” what “language can inspire and what actions it can result in.”

We do. This month, Yellow Vest protesters in Paris accosted Alain Finkielkraut, a leading French essayist and the son of an Auschwitz survivor. Their abuse included cries of “Back to Tel Aviv” and “France belongs to us.” A Jewish cemetery was desecrated. Anti-Semitic incidents rose 74 percent in France in 2018.

The eternal Jewish ogre resurfaces — a convenient scapegoat for economic resentments, precariousness, fear, frustration or Israel’s oppression of Palestinians. Corbyn, wittingly or not, has fed this poison, as his party is now realizing. He has made an irrefutable case for Israel through Labour’s abetting of revived European Jew hatred.

The fundamental link between European anti-Semitism, annihilationist at its apogee, and the decision of Jews to embrace Zionism in the conviction that only a Jewish homeland could keep them safe is something contemporary European theorists of a demonic Israel prefer to forget.

FILE PHOTO - Wu Den-yih, newly elected chairman of Taiwan's opposition Nationalist Kuomintang Party (KMT), arrives at a news conference in Taipei, Taiwan May 20, 2017. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu

China claims self-ruled and proudly democratic Taiwan as its own and has vowed to bring the island, which it regards as sacred territory, under Chinese control, by force if necessary.

While China has not broached the idea of a peace deal in years, the chairman of the Beijing-friendly Kuomintang, Wu Den-yih, said earlier this month the party could sign a peace deal with China if it won the hotly contested election.

Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said the island will not accept any deal that destroys its sovereignty and democracy.

China’s policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office, in the government’s first official response to the Kuomintang’s peace agreement proposal, said anything that benefits the interests of people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait should be promoted.

“As long as it benefits protecting the peace of the Taiwan Strait and increasing the peaceful development of relations, and pushes the peaceful reunification process of the motherland, it can be jointly investigated by both sides,” spokesman An Fengshan told a regular news briefing.

He did not directly mention the idea of a peace deal in his answer. China has not mentioned the idea since 2009, when then-premier Wen Jiabao unexpectedly raised it in his opening speech at the annual meeting of China’s parliament.

China translates the word “tong yi” as “reunification”, but it can also be translated as “unification”, a term in English preferred by supporters of Taiwan independence who point out that Beijing’s Communist government has never ruled Taiwan and so it cannot be “reunified”.

An said the DPP was seeking to stymie the wish of Taiwan’s people for peace across the Taiwan Strait, which would only harm the people of Taiwan’s interests and “ruin Taiwan’s prospects and future”.

Tsai’s party suffered stinging losses to the Kuomintang in mayoral and local elections in November.

Tsai, who says she wants to maintain the status quo, has said China must use peaceful means to resolve its differences with Taiwan and respect Taipei’s democratic values.

Beijing has regularly sent military aircraft and ships to circle the island on drills in the past few years and has heaped pressure on Taiwan internationally, including whittling down its few remaining diplomatic allies.

Sanders shakeup: Top staff leaves campaign... Delays tax return release... Hillary muses about opening... The Med…","By Yasmeen Abutaleb

WASHINGTON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives unveiled an ambitious proposal on Tuesday to move all Americans into the government's Medicare health insurance program, tapping into public frustration over the rising cost of healthcare that has become a key issue for the party as it seeks to gain control of Congress and the White House in 2020.

The bill, unveiled by Democratic Representative Pramila Jayapal from Washington state, would transition the U.S. healthcare system to a single-payer ""Medicare for All"" program funded by the government in two years. The legislation is the party's most high-profile and ambitious single-payer proposal in the new Congress and has more than 100 co-sponsors, many from the party's progressive flank.

It is unlikely to gain the support of any Republicans in the House or the Senate, who have derided single-payer healthcare as a socialist policy and oppose government interference in healthcare. It also remains unclear whether Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will bring the legislation up for a vote.

""Americans are literally dying because they can't afford insulin or they can't get the cancer treatment they need,"" Jayapal said on a call with reporters on Tuesday. ""There are some things that should not be provided through the for-profit market.""

Medicare currently serves about 60 million Americans who are age 65 or older, or disabled. Jayapal's legislation would eliminate the age threshold. The new Medicare would not require any beneficiaries to pay premiums or deductibles and would not charge patients co-pays or out-of-pocket costs after receiving care.

It does not include new or increased taxes or other additional revenues to pay for the healthcare overhaul. Jayapal said possible ways to pay for the bill include a tax on millionaires and billionaires, employer premiums and closing tax loopholes for the wealthy.

The idea of Medicare for All was first proposed by Independent Bernie Sanders in 2017 as a single-payer system that would largely replace private insurance. It gained traction among Democrats running for congressional office in 2018, and is now a central campaign issue for party members vying for the 2020 presidential nomination.

A Reuters/IPSOS poll in August found that 70 percent of Americans support some sort of single-payer system.

The health industry has opposed single-payer proposals, saying they would ultimately lead to less access to care. Critics include the American Hospital Association and America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), the health insurance industry's biggest trade group.

""This bill will hurt patients, consumers, and taxpayers: Americans will pay more, to wait longer, for worse care,"" AHIP said in a statement. ""Let's focus on real solutions that deliver real results, not a one-size-fits-all government system.""

The House proposal unveiled on Tuesday would not eliminate private health insurance entirely, as it would allow patients to purchase supplemental coverage. Many Americans under the age of 65 rely on private insurance provided by their employer.

A single-payer system is variously understood as one in which the government pays for healthcare for more people, or one where the governments owns health services providers and manages all aspects of care, such as in the United Kingdom.

Several U.S. Democratic lawmakers have introduced different versions of expanded Medicare, such as allowing people aged 50 and older to buy into the program.

The new House proposal would cover most aspects of patients' care, including primary care, hospital and outpatient services, prescription drugs, dental, vision, audiology, women's reproductive health services, maternity and newborn care.

298,Empty,2019-02-25T06:00:03Z,Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse spoke to Salon about the virtues of the Green New Deal... and why it isn't radical at all.,"Is Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a progressive Democrat from Rhode Island, ready to join the long and growing list of U.S. senators who are running for president in 2020? I asked him this, and his answer was emphatic: ""No."" The assistant who set up the interview told me the same thing in advance: Despite a surname that practically begs for headlines, Whitehouse isn't running. (At least not this time.)

This isn't to say Whitehouse plans on staying quiet. He has emerged as a leading Senate champion of the Green New Deal, — the ambitious package of environmental and economic reforms recently popularized by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. In one document posted on Ocasio-Cortez's website (and later taken down), the Green New Deal was defined by a set of goals: achieving ""net-zero greenhouse gas emissions,"" moving America to 100 percent ""clean and renewable energy"" and realizing Franklin D. Roosevelt's vision of an Economic Bill of Rights by guaranteeing good-paying jobs, health care, education and housing for all, along with economic security for those unable to work.

Not every Democrat supports all those goals, by a long shot. As Whitehouse made clear in our conversation, the Green New Deal is in an early developmental stage and its exact policy content is likely to evolve considerably. But for many progressives, the Green New Deal establishes a positive agenda that can helps the Democratic Party emerge as something more than a catch-basin for everyone who opposes Donald Trump.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell apparently believes that forcing an early vote on the Green New Deal may damage Democrats politically, and some Democratic presidential candidates have been notably reluctant to embrace it. Whitehouse believes it's time for his party to seize the moment ... and change the world in the process.

He plans on being there when this legislation is enacted -- but not as the person who signs it.

This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and context.

Republicans have been reacting with -- I think ""terror"" would be an accurate word -- to the concept of a Green New Deal. Sen. Tom Cotton said the media's coverage of it has been Stalin-like. A deleted summary from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's website was entered into the congressional record. Rep. Liz Cheney has attacking it. Why are they so scared of this/

Well, I think it is significant to watch the Republican heads explode over it and to hear the invective and falsehood that are thrown at it. It reminds me a little bit about when Democrats were trying to set up Medicare years ago, and Republicans who were fighting Medicare insisted it was socialized medicine. This is a little bit the 2019 replay of that same Republican playbook. I do think that the Green New Deal brings new energy to the climate debate.

What [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell is up to is to try to use the fact that we're still at an early stage in negotiating a climate bill amongst ourselves to try to foment division. When in fact, we have a very strong common Democratic purpose to work together to get a very significant climate bill passed.

What are your specific thoughts on the Green New Deal, in terms of your own individual interpretation of what it means and what should be included?

The Green New Deal at this point is only a resolution that hasn't even approached legislative language. Hearings have not yet been held. In the Senate alone, there are carbon-price bills on the Democrats side, ""Keep It in the Ground"" bills on the Democratic side -- a variety of smaller bills for different economic sectors that address climate change and the general prospect of a Green New Deal.

Our job as legislators is to walk through those various pieces of legislation, and pull something together that keep the 1.5-degree [increase] climate threshold that is most likely to actually get passed, and that maximizes all the collateral benefits for society in passing it as a significant climate bill.

Advertisement:

From what I've read, both on Ocasio-Cortez's website, and in just in general from the progressive commentators, this is about more than just addressing climate change. It's about radically overhauling how ordinary people live, providing a stronger social safety net for people who are in poverty, increasing the standard of living, guaranteeing benefits. It's really trying to realize Franklin Roosevelt's vision as embodied in the Economic Bill of Right from 1944. Is it really possible to accomplish that, in addition to accomplishing the environmental reforms necessitated by climate change?

Well, first of all, let me just back off a little bit on your last comment. I don't think what we're proposing to address climate change is radical. I think what's really radical is the Republican notion that climate change is a hoax, that it shouldn't be addressed, and that they are conveniently ignorant about the science and the facts. That, to me, is an extraordinarily radical proposition, and it may even be a worse than radical proposition once we understand the extent of fossil-fuel funding in the Republican Party.

I'm not going to accept being painted into the radical corner when we try to solve this problem, when I think the radical action here is the way that the Republican Party is misbehaving.

For what it's worth, I don't perceive fighting climate change as being a radical solution. But I believe it's important to try to, one might say, play devil's advocate in terms of acknowledging the arguments that will inevitably be made …

The socialized medicine argument about Medicare. We've seen this game before. We usually power our way through it. To the first part of your question, I would say that the Green New Deal has been expressed in an array of policy recommendations that have an extraordinarily worthy purpose, which is to offset the increasing income inequality in the country, and the increasing share of the country's political power and economic power which is controlled by a smaller and smaller number of extraordinarily wealthy people and families and corporations.

All of that, I think, makes a lot sense. Even Franklin Roosevelt didn't get his New Deal passed in one bill. It was more a statement of purpose. What we have to do, the same way Franklin Roosevelt had to do it, is work together with Congress to pass section-by-section laws that will solve the climate problem before it gets out of hand. After doing that, rebalance what the traditional balance of power has been in American politics and in the American economy. Arrest and reverse the slide in both of those areas of power and money to those that already have the most of it.

There's a reason the Tea Party were serious, and that voters supported Trump, and that voters came out to support Bernie [Sanders] and other authentic — recent in Trump's case — authentic, new and disruptive points of view. That’s because, I think people in America can see and feel and breathe that something is amiss in this country, but they don't have power in Congress any longer. They don't have a fair share of the country's wealth and revenues any longer, and those things are demonstrable and factual.

They're absolutely right to be furious about it, and we need to address that concern. To some extent, the way forward on the climate problem helps address that concern. That’s a very significant plus, not just for liberal politics, and certainly not for ""socialism,"" but for the way America has always worked. It's just -- we're in a Gilded Age.

I'm actually writing my dissertation about The Gilded Age.

The impetus for “Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the Freshman Force: New Party Who Dis?,” a commemorative comic book from Devil’s Due Comics starring Ocasio-Cortez and her diverse array of fellow freshmen, came after the new Congress member made headlines in January for quoting “Watchmen” creator Alan Moore and later appearing on a Donkey Kong charity Twitch livestream to advocate for transgender rights.

“It had too much momentum in our little geekosphere,” Josh Blaylock, Chicago-based Devil’s Due Comics publisher and one of nearly two dozen creators featured in the book, told MarketWatch. He began reaching out to colleagues in the comic-book world about contributing to the anthology, he said, and received an “amazing response.”

The resulting product, which debuts in May, is available for pre-order at $5.99 and will donate partial proceeds to a veterans’ charity and the refugee and immigrant nonprofit RAICES. It features a variety of stories, said 41-year-old Blaylock. Some are celebratory and sweet, some are “venting and cathartic,” and others are silly and irreverent.

Two covers released this week bear illustrations of Ocasio-Cortez in a power stance — dressed alternately in her white pantsuit and in warrior attire — claiming victory over a red elephant. A blue donkey surveys the scene with uncertainty.

Tim Seeley and Josh Blaylock/Devil’s Due Comics ‘Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the Freshman Force’ is due out in May.

Blaylock, who says he and most of his staff are “genuine fans” of Ocasio-Cortez, believes the 29-year-old congresswoman has infused politics with energy and momentum. “I think what resonates with so many people is seeing somebody going into what felt like a comatose, lethargic legislative system for so long,” he said. “I have a lot of respect for her so far and what she’s trying to accomplish.”

‘Certainly, earning a living as a studio artist involves making things that I know will sell — and I know that she, along with some other politicians, have a market.’ —Justin Rothshank, a studio potter in Goshen, Ind.

Blaylock, who in 2009 launched a Barack Obama-inspired “Barack the Barbarian” series — the first issue of which sold around 30,000 copies — says buzz around the Ocasio-Cortez comic book “really has taken off.” “I think it might end up being a lot bigger than I anticipated,” he said. “Which sort of runs parallel to AOC’s entire career so far: taking a lot of people by surprise.”

He’s not alone in drawing inspiration from the Bronx-born Democratic Socialist.

Justin Rothshank, a studio potter in Goshen, Ind., has been making pots with politicians on them for more than 10 years, a pursuit that began with Lyndon Johnson and Abraham Lincoln and grew from his interest in U.S. history and social justice. Having completed all 45 U.S. presidents in tableware and branched out to other politicians, he said, his handmade Ocasio-Cortez ceramic mug ($52 on Etsy) was a “natural evolution.”

“Certainly, earning a living as a studio artist involves making things that I know will sell — and I know that she, along with some other politicians, have a market,” Rothshank, 41, told MarketWatch. “They have market impact, and it’s not just because of their political policies; it’s also because of their persona and who they are.” (For the record, he said, none of his political subjects is a more popular seller than the perpetually memed Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.)

While AOC may not have reached Notorious RBG-level ubiquity, her presence is pervasive in plenty of artwork, t-shirts, mugs, phone cases, celebrity votive candles, tote bags and other items sold through online marketplaces. A search for her name, for instance, yields 670 results on Redbubble, 360 results on Zazzle and 248 results on Etsy.

While AOC may not have reached Notorious RBG-level ubiquity, her presence is pervasive in plenty of artwork, t-shirts, mugs, phone cases, celebrity votive candles, tote bags and other items.

Interested parties, for example, can purchase an AC/DC-inspired kids’ t-shirt that reads “AOC/DC” ($22) or a 5-by-7-inch watercolor portrait of the congresswoman ($150). There are AOC-emblazoned throw and floor pillows (ranging from $20.79 to $54.95), a handmade Ocasio-Cortez doll ($38.50) and Ocasio-Cortez earrings ($20). One item, a cross-stitch of the lawmaker’s face beneath the acronym “WWAOCD” ($29.68), contemplates what AOC would do. (The congresswoman, meanwhile, does not appear to have trademarked her name or initials.)

There are numerousreferences to a hypothetical future Ocasio-Cortez presidential bid, as well as spinoffs of the viral “Notorious RBG” meme. Creators have spun quotes from her speeches, her viral tweet rebuttals and her Instagram Live FB, -0.19% content into home-decor prints, vinyl stickers and t-shirts.

Joya Menashe, the 50-year-old creative director of Portland, Ore.-based Flix Wix Candles, says a $33 trio of prayer candles featuring progressive heroes Ocasio-Cortez, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, and Ginsburg — dubbed “the MAIDEN the MOTHER the MATRIARCH” — “went through the roof” after it went on sale a few weeks ago. The shop has sold 300 sets, Menashe said, as well as about 100 individual Ocasio-Cortez candles in the last month.

“They’re really meant to be inspiring,” she added. “People are using them like a shrine, almost, of hope and something new.”

And Elle, the owner of Macon, Ga.-based shop Full Moon Lane who asked to be identified by a pseudonym for privacy reasons, added a $22 t-shirt reading “I DANCE WITH ALEXANDRIA” — a nod to Ocasio-Cortez’s goofy college-era dance video that resurfaced in January — to her offerings of liberal feminist-themed clothing, mugs and accessories.

‘Anybody who has a capitalistic tendency is going to draw upon that excitement to put her face and whatever she’s saying on merchandise to capitalize on that popularity.’ —Kelly Dittmar, a scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University

“I saw that and just thought it was kind of crazy, the controversy over something so stupid,” she said, adding that the lawmaker seemed cool and relatable. “I thought, ‘Hey, that’ll make a good shirt.’” (The shirt, she noted, did not sell very well.)

Ocasio-Cortez’s office did not respond to MarketWatch requests for comment on her having inspired the comic book, as well as on her likeness and campaign logo being used on unofficial merchandise.

The congresswoman has in some ways come to symbolize a new generation of political leadership, said Kelly Dittmar, a scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. “That just yields all sorts of support,” she said. “So it’s not surprising that would also yield merchandising in the same way that we’ve seen for other progressive women who have broad support, like Ruth Bader Ginsburg or Maxine Waters [a Democrat from California].”

In other words, Dittmar suggested, “she’s a very popular and well-known political figure, and somebody who’s excited a large base of progressives.”

“Therefore, anybody who has a capitalistic tendency is going to draw upon that excitement to put her face and whatever she’s saying on merchandise to capitalize on that popularity,” she added.

Bruce Newman, a professor of marketing at DePaul University and the founding editor-in-chief of the Journal of Political Marketing, agreed that Ocasio-Cortez “represents a very attractive brand in the political marketplace” with the potential to appeal to both for-profit and nonprofit organizations that align with her politics and policies.

For artists looking for exposure, a bump from AOC — who often shares fan art with her 2.5 million Instagram followers and tags its creators — can be a boon.

“We live in a beautiful capitalist society,” Newman said. “Even if you’re a socialist politician, there’s still money to be made by companies that want to take advantage of who you are and what you’re doing and what you’re speaking about, and run with it.”

And for artists looking for exposure, a bump from AOC — who often shares fan art with her 2.5 million Instagram followers and tags its creators — can be a boon.

“If you’re doing well, you lift up the people behind you,” said Tina Duryea, a 46-year-old artist from Norwalk, Conn., who is currently painting a “New Women of Congress” portrait project that includes Ocasio-Cortez. That, she adds, is a very progressive idea.

“By her sharing fan art on her page, she’s helped other people out, and I think that’s very appealing for artists,” said Duryea, whose father grew up in Ocasio-Cortez’s home district.

Of course, not all of the artwork and merchandise inspired by the congresswoman sings her praises. Her likeness has been splashed across “MAGA” shirts that spell out “Make Alexandria Go Away.” There’s a vinyl toilet-lid decal and sticker set, and a customized lawn sign with a red strike-through over Ocasio-Cortez’s name.

“If I’m a Republican, and I want to take advantage of this and make the case that one of the rising stars on the Democratic side is a socialist — boom, let’s get it onto a t-shirt and write a few lines and make money off of it,” Newman said.

Politicians who achieve this art- and merchandise-inspiring status are those who have strong brand identities and stand out as different from other traditional politicians, Newman said. That rule applies regardless of political stripe, he added, citing Senator Bernie Sanders, an Independent from Vermont who’s thrown his hat into the ring for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and President Trump as prime examples.

“If you’re in the gray area, you’re not going to sell merchandise. But if you represent an extreme view like she does, and people buy into it, then I think that you want to have a coffee cup at work that has her name and face on it [or] the famous MAGA caps that Trump has sold over the last number of years,” he said. “You want to make statements to people around you.”

Reid, who has repeatedly slammed the president, renewed hostilities and even managed to spin his dislike of Trump into some unexpected praise for a former political adversary.

“In hindsight, I wish every day for a George Bush again,” Reid told CNN’s Dana Bash.

Reid, who is fighting pancreatic cancer and left office in 2017, was asked by Bash if ‘there was anything he thought the President was doing right?’

“I just have trouble accepting him as a person,” Reid replied. “So frankly, I don’t see anything he is doing right.”

Not one to take an insult lying down, President Trump quickly shot back on Twitter.

“Former Senator Harry Reid (he got thrown out) is working hard to put a good spin on his failed career. He led through lies and deception, only to be replaced by another beauty, Cryin’ Chuck Schumer. Some things just never change!” Trump tweeted.

Reid also gave some advice to Democratic presidential candidates who are seeking to take on President Trump in 2020.

More than seven hours later, Michael Cohen was still answering questions from the twenty-four Democrats and eighteen Republicans on the panel. What did we learn from this long hearing, which some have compared to the Watergate hearings of 1973 and 1974?

One lesson was to be careful with historical comparisons. Donald Trump isn’t Richard Nixon; Michael Cohen isn’t John Dean, and today’s Republican Party most certainly isn’t the Republican Party of Howard Baker and Lowell Weicker, Jr., who were G.O.P. representatives on the Senate Watergate Committee. These days, the House G.O.P. membership is a right-wing rabble, and the nation’s capital is a site of unremitting partisan warfare. From the very start of the hearing, Jim Jordan, the ranking Republican on the committee, and Mark Meadows, who heads up the Freedom Caucus, made clear that their only goal was to attack Cohen’s credibility. Even if the witness had turned up with a copy of the Moscow pee tape and a signed agreement between Trump and Vladimir Putin, the Republican duo and most of their colleagues would have tried to spin it as a Democratic hit job concocted by Lanny Davis and Adam Schiff.

Cohen hadn’t come to the hearing bearing explosives precisely of this nature. He told Representative Jamie Raskin that he had “no reason to believe that tape exists.” At another point, he stated that he had seen no direct evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. But he also added that he had his suspicions. “Mr. Trump’s desire to win would have him work with anyone,” he said. He claimed that during a July, 2016, meeting at Trump Tower, he witnessed Roger Stone calling in and telling Trump “that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange and that Mr. Assange told Mr. Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of e-mails that would damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign.” (WikiLeaks subsequently put out a statement saying no such call took place between Stone and Assange, and Stone said in a statement that Cohen’s testimony was “not true.”)

Cohen also claimed that Trump engaged in criminal behavior from inside the White House relating to the Stormy Daniels payoffs, and this assertion he backed up with documents. After providing the committee with a signed thirty-five-thousand-dollar check from Trump, dated August 1st, 2017—more than six months into Trump’s Presidency—Cohen calmly explained that it was meant “to reimburse me for the hush-money payments I made to cover up his affair with an adult-film star and prevent damage to this campaign.”

To be sure, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York essentially asserted, last December, that Trump had been involved in the payoff scheme when it said in a sentencing memorandum that Cohen acted at the direction of “Individual-1.” But it was still instructive to see Cohen saying bluntly and on live television, “For the record: Individual-1 is Donald J. Trump.” It was equally instructive when the California Democrat Katie Hill elicited from Cohen the revelation that, as recently as early last year, when the existence of the payoffs was revealed, Trump was involved in concocting a cover story that he knew nothing about them. “That’s what was discussed to do between myself, Mr. Trump, and Allen Weisselberg,” Cohen said. (Weisselberg is the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization.)

Cohen also claimed that he and Weisselberg discussed how to disguise the 2016 payoff to Daniels’s lawyer—Cohen ended up using his own money—and that Donald Trump, Jr., on behalf of the Trump Organization, signed one of the checks that eventually reimbursed him. Late in the afternoon session, Ro Khanna, a Democrat who represents Silicon Valley, zeroed in on these payments. “This is nothing to do with collusion,” he said. “This is garden-variety financial fraud.” Khanna also asked Cohen directly if he was claiming that Trump directed these transactions with Weisselberg and Trump, Jr., as “part of a criminal conspiracy, a financial fraud.” Cohen replied, “Yes.”

If there has been a previous occasion when a President’s personal lawyer has testified to Congress that his client is a common crook, it has been lost to the history books. But that wasn’t the end of Cohen’s damning testimony about the man he also described as “a racist,” “a cheat,” and “a con man.” He provided more details about the extensive efforts, on the part of Trump and himself, to mislead the American public about how long the Trump Organization pursued the Trump Tower Moscow project. Trump has long denied that there was a Russia deal of any type in the works. Cohen, who spent years working assiduously with Felix Sater, another colorful Trump associate, to put together a deal to construct Europe’s tallest building in the Russian capital, knew all along that this was a lie. “So to be clear, Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump-Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it,” Cohen said in his opening statement. “He lied about it, because he never expected to win.”

In 2017, Cohen went on, he told congressional investigators, “We stopped negotiating in January, 2016. That was false—our negotiations continued for months during the campaign.” Between January and June of 2016, Cohen added, Trump asked him at least six times about the progress of the Moscow project. And after Trump surprised everybody, himself included, by winning the election, he “did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That’s not how he operates. . . . He would look me in the eye and tell me there’s no business in Russia, and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing. In his way, he was telling me to lie.”

For all Cohen’s record of duplicity and lying, which he repeatedly fessed up to during the hearing, this statement had the ring of genuine insider knowledge. To be sure, this was a figure who acted as Trump’s fixer and bruiser for more than ten years, and who recently pleaded guilty to tax evasion, making false statements to banks, engaging in campaign-finance violations, and lying to the last Congress. But the very things that made Cohen such a problematic witness—his closeness to Trump and his history of finagling on behalf of his boss and himself—are also what made him a compelling one. This was an account of the darkness, told from within.

A bit later in the hearing, Michigan’s Justin Amash, about the only Republican to show a bit of independence, asked Cohen if he could talk some more about the way in which Trump sometimes communicated his directions indirectly. “Sure,” Cohen replied. “It would be no different than if I said, ‘That’s the nicest-looking tie I’ve ever seen. Isn’t it?’ What are you going to do? Are you going to fight with him? The answer is no. So you say, ‘Yeah, it’s the nicest-looking tie I’ve ever seen.’ That’s how he speaks. He doesn’t give you questions, he doesn’t give you orders. He speaks in code. And I understand the code because I’ve been around him for decades.""

During a subsequent exchange with Jim Cooper, a Tennessee Democrat, Cohen suggested that others around Trump are also in the know, and he appeared to allude directly to the Republicans on the panel who were busy doing the President’s bidding even as he was eight thousand miles away, in Hanoi. “Everybody’s job at the Trump Org was to protect Mr. Trump,” he said. “Every day, most of us knew we were coming in and we were going to lie for him on something. And that’s exactly what’s happening right now in this country. It’s exactly what’s happening here in government.” That statement, too, had the ring of authenticity.","Michael Cohen’s Damning Portrayal of Trump as a Lying, Racist Crook",Newyorker.com,https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/michael-cohens-damning-portrayal-of-trump-as-a-lying-racist-crook

Radical ideas are not unusual in the early stages of a US presidential election campaign, but many of the Democratic candidates for 2020 are advocating unrealistic policies. Just because a new idea seems more exciting does not make it better than an established, more practical one.

CAMBRIDGE – America’s Democratic Party is moving to the left, we are told. It is not yet clear whether this applies to the median American voter, or the median member of Congress who was elected last November. But it is clear that many of the candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination are experimenting with “bold new ideas.” They seem to receive a disproportionate amount of attention for doing so. If interpreted literally, many of these policy proposals are not entirely practical, either economically or politically.

Jose Luis Pelaez Inc/Getty Images A Better Populism Feb 27, 2019 argues that beggar-thy-neighbor policies cannot solve the problems facing declining communities. Wojtek Radwanski/AFP/Getty Images Europe, Please Wake Up Feb 11, 2019 argues that the EU cannot be saved without transforming its political party systems. Previous Next

Fortunately, few of the current or prospective Democratic candidates have yet committed irrevocably to extreme policies. Any of them could still build a campaign on solid practical proposals to address inequality and other pressing problems, without sacrificing economic growth or fiscal sustainability.

Such ideas are perhaps most likely to come from moderates such as former Vice President Joe Biden, former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, former US Representative Beto O’Rourke, or former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Other prominent Democrats, including former President Barack Obama and US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, share this emphasis on the doable. They made important progress with practical policies in areas such as health insurance, financial regulation, and progressive taxation, although Republicans often blocked or reversed these advances.

There is no reason why other new faces in the presidential field, such as US Senator Amy Klobuchar, cannot follow in the sensible Democratic tradition of Obama and Pelosi. The same applies to fellow senators Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, and Elizabeth Warren, who are often seen as being on the left of the party.

But for now, the bolder, less practical Democratic ideas are getting the airtime. Five in particular stand out, and there exist more practical alternatives to each of them.

First is the proposal for a marginal income-tax rate of 70% on the super-rich. There are more efficient and enforceable ways to improve income distribution in the US. For starters, the carried-interest loophole could be abolished, the Earned Income Tax Credit could be expanded, and the payroll tax could be made more progressive. Further suggestions include restoring the inheritance tax on all estates worth more than, say, $10 million, and eliminating the “step-up” of estates’ valuation that allows generations to pass on capital gains without ever paying tax on them. Other substantial Republican tax cuts for the rich could be reversed, too.

Another idea is that the government pays for universal four-year college education. But this would be expensive, and not the best way to help the children of families that have been left behind by US economic growth. Universal, quality pre-school might be a more effective way of working toward equality of educational opportunity.

To be sure, it makes sense to expand student grants for higher education and increase support for public institutions. This should cover two-year programs and vocational training as well as four-year degrees. But the most urgent higher-education policy priority is pushing back against the scams perpetrated by some for-profit colleges. The worst of these leave vulnerable students – veterans have been frequent targets – with high taxpayer-funded debts, low graduation rates, and poor post-graduation employment prospects.

A third idea is universal health-care coverage through “Medicare for All.” If this meant adding a public option for those who can’t get private health insurance, it would be a worthy initiative. But US Senator Bernie Sanders – not a Democrat, but running for the party’s nomination – has been clear that he favors the elimination of private health insurance. Most Americans do not respond positively when they realize that “Medicare for All” would force the many who are currently happy with their employer-paid plans to give them up, and saddle taxpayers with an enormous fiscal burden.

A more practical Democratic health-care policy would be to resume the expansion of coverage rates that the 2010 Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”) achieved. This means, as a first step, reversing the damage that Republicans have done to it.

Fourth, several candidates support a government-led “Green New Deal” that would radically change US energy use. True, when the US unemployment rate exceeded 8% between 2009 and 2012, the country could have used a larger and longer increase in government spending on environmental projects than Obama was able to get past Congress. But, with unemployment currently around 4%, now is not a good time to be expanding the budget deficit.

If the Green New Deal were interpreted as simply a rallying cry to mobilize support for strong action on climate change, it would be a welcome development. But the impracticality of so many of the Green New Deal’s components is worrisome, such as its goal of expanding renewable energy to 100% of electric power, not to mention some of the package’s extraneous parts. The efficient way to achieve climate-change goals is not via a truly massive expansion of government, but rather by using the price mechanism, meaning either a carbon tax or tradable emission permits.

Finally, Sanders and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (who is not seeking the presidency) recently proposed preventing firms from buying back their shares. It is true that corporations have spent more of their big gains from the December 2017 tax cut on share buybacks and dividends than on investment or workers. But the proper remedy is to broaden the corporate tax base. Banning buybacks would just divert firms’ extra profits into Treasury bills or other companies’ shares.

Radical proposals are not unusual in the early stages of a presidential election campaign. But just because a new idea seems more exciting does not make it better than an older, more practical one. The Democratic contenders for 2020 would be wise to remember this as they chase their presidential dreams.",Should Bold Ideas Drown Out Old Ideas?,Project-syndicate.org,https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/presidential-election-2020-democrats-radical-proposals-by-jeffrey-frankel-2019-02

306,Empty,2019-02-28T18:18:20Z,"""Our base in our party is women people of color and young people under 35 or 40,"" says Democratic official","Howard Dean's job leading the Democrats' new voter data sharing initiative precludes him from publicly picking a favorite among the ever growing group of presidential contenders. But the one-time presidential candidate and former chairman of the Democratic National Committee is cautioning his party against nominating ""two white guys.""

""I like young candidates,"" Dean said in an interview with CBS News. ""Our base in our party is women people of color and young people under 35 or 40. They vote overwhelmingly for Democrats. We have to get them to turn out. So I think you want to see really different Democratic Party.""

Dean continued: ""I would be shocked if you saw two white guys at the top of our ticket this time because in the last two elections in 2017, 2018 the people who won look like the American people and we have to keep doing that.""

In his new role, Dean will be tasked with streamlining Democrats' data collection, a significant initiative that ends the longstanding friction between the state and national parties over control and access to voter information. It also enables Democrats to try and catch up with Republicans, who have had a similar system in place for some time.

However, Dean said the party is not yet ready to prevent massive cyber breaches like the hack of the DNC and the release of the committee's emails during the 2016 campaign.

""I can guarantee you we're not ready, and we better get ready. Now we've learned some very bitter lessons because of being hacked in 2016. So we're better off than we were. But the hacking war, especially with the Russians, is going to get worse and worse.""

""They're going to up their capabilities and we're going to have to up ours,"" Dean said. ""But that's something I'm taking really, really seriously as we move down this.""

Democrats currently have one of the largest and most diverse fields in recent history. There are at least 10 contenders who have officially launched presidential campaigns or exploratory committees, including including six women, two African Americans, a Latino, and a gay millennial veteran.

The diversity of the field has raised questions about the viability of the 76-year-old Joe Biden. The former vice president said this week he is in the final stages of deciding about a presidential bid, and his family is supportive of another run.

And last week, 77-year-old Sen. Bernie Sanders announced his second presidential campaign, raising an astounding $10 million in his first week. Dean called the grassroots fundraising prowess of his fellow Vermonter ""extraordinary,"" but said Sanders could face ""a harder time this year because there's so many more candidates, there's a different kind of race.""

Dean also pushed back on accusations the presidential candidates are moving too far to the left, but also said the contenders need to come up with better answers to questions about Medicare for All and the Green New Deal.

""I think candidates have to get a little better with their answers,"" Dean said. ""The Green New Deal is not a plan, it is a proposal... There's a four page plan. We need to be committed to the ideals of the Green New Deal. We're going to have an argument later about just exactly how you get there.""

""This is not a matter of moving the party to the left, it's about making America strong again so everybody can participate,"" Dean said. ""So you are going to see Medicaid for a Medicare for All. Now, there's different ways of doing Medicare for All and smart ways of doing it. You're going to see a better way to get college. There's lots of ways to do 'free college' and people are going to debate how you're going to do it, but they're not going to debate whether you should do it or not.""

Dean dismissed the notion of whether Democrats could be vulnerable to President Trump and Republicans pointing to such policies to paint the party as ""socialists.""

""Look, if socialist means we ought to have Medicare for All, everybody should have health insurance in the country, I'm a socialist — and nobody ever accused me of that ... because I'm concerned about money.""

""This country is upside down with the worst leadership probably in the history of the country,"" Dean said. ""And we've got to do better, and we will do that but we will not do it better by attacking Donald Trump all the time. Let him attack himself, he does that well. Let us talk about what we're going to do to make the country a better place.""","Howard Dean says he'd be ""shocked"" if Dems nominate ""two white guys""",CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/howard-dean-says-hed-be-shocked-if-democrats-nominate-two-white-guys-in-2020/

Things are clearly happening in anticipation of 2020 — candidates, both announced and unannounced, are visiting with donors and activists, giving speeches and interviews and haunting restaurants and coffee shops. But it’s difficult to know what any of it means.

That’s why I’ve been repeatedly interviewing a group of roughly 60 Democratic Party activists in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada and Washington, D.C. for the past two years as part of my ongoing book research into how interpretations of the 2016 election outcome inform opinions about the future direction of the party and the choice of nominee in 2020. These are people I connected with on the recommendation of political reporters in each state; they’ve been active volunteers or staffers for state parties or past presidential campaigns. Some are relatively new to the field, while others’ involvement dates back to George McGovern’s presidential campaign in 1972.

And while I make no claim that my survey sample is representative or my respondents’ answers are predictive of the views of the wider public or of Democratic activists in general, studies have shown that the support of activists from states with early primaries or caucuses can determine the outcome of the nomination. Observing how, when and for whom activists make up their minds is invaluable to understanding how a party functions and makes decisions. This is why I’ve made understanding how they evaluate candidates the focal point of my research.

What I’ve found so far is that the vast majority of these early-state activists are still undecided. I reached out to the 60 activists twice recently — once in December 2018 and again early this month — to ask them about their views on potential 2020 presidential candidates. Each time, I heard back from roughly 35 of the activists. Of those, only nine said they had committed to a candidate: Five said they would support Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders as they had supported him in 2016; two said they would back former Vice President Joe Biden; one supported New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker; and one favored former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe. As for the rest of the activists, most said they were keeping their options open, weighing the candidates’ various strengths and weaknesses.

That level of indecision doesn’t seem all that unusual given the size of the field. Most modern presidential nomination contests have an obvious front-runner, but when they don’t (as was the case with the Democratic field in 1988), activists may take their time choosing a candidate. Several of the Democratic activists I’ve spoken with suggested that they may wait until the summer or fall of 2019 before making a decision, and quite a few wanted to meet with the candidates before making up their minds. (My plan is to check in with activists every two months to see whom they’re backing.)

But because so many of these early-state activists still haven’t decided who they would support, I also asked them which presidential candidates they’re considering. A few listed nearly all the possible candidates, and two listed none. But typically, a respondent named between three and five candidates. While not the same as knowing whom someone supports, knowing which candidates are among respondents’ top picks is useful for understanding who is widely thought of as a viable candidate. After all, as history and political science have shown us, the best nominee is not necessarily the one people are most passionate about, but rather the one the most wings of the party will accept.

Kamala Harris is currently the candidate who is being considered by the largest share of the activists I’ve been interviewing, although no one has committed to support her yet. This month, about 54 percent of the activists in my sample listed her as a candidate they might end up supporting. That figure is down slightly from December, when nearly 61 percent of activists named her. (Here I treated a commitment by an activist to a candidate the same as a consideration.)

Which candidates early-state activists are considering Share of respondents who said they were considering a candidate or had already committed to support a candidate in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary Candidate Dec 2018 Feb 2019 Harris 60.5% – 54.3% – Booker 44.7 – 48.5 – Brown 39.5 – 45.7 – Warren 23.7 – 40.0 – Klobuchar 34.2 – 37.1 – Biden 39.5 – 34.3 – Sanders 28.9 – 28.6 – Gillibrand 21.1 – 22.9 – Hickenlooper 21.1 – 22.9 – Merkley 7.9 – 20.0 – Delaney 15.8 – 17.1 – Castro — – 17.1 – Buttigieg — – 17.1 – O’Rourke 34.2 – 14.3 – McAuliffe 5.3 – 14.3 – Bloomberg 15.8 – 8.6 – Holder 18.4 – 8.6 – Gabbard — – 8.6 – Bullock 2.6 – 5.6 – Source: Seth Masket, “Learning from Loss: The Democrats, 2016-2020”

Overall, in February, there were five candidates — Harris, Booker, Sherrod Brown, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar — who were being considered or had been committed to by more than 35 percent of these activists. It is notable to see Brown’s and Klobuchar’s names included in this group, since at the beginning of February, each had received little national media attention and neither had gained much traction in the polls. (Klobuchar’s official announcement was on Feb. 10, and Brown still hasn’t formally entered the race.)

Close behind that group of candidates are Biden and Sanders. Sanders is somewhat unusual in that virtually all of his support from these activists is from people who are already committed to him, while relatively few others are still considering him. This may suggest that he has comparatively less room for growth than many other candidates.

Among the candidates who aren’t getting a lot of attention from this group of about 35 activists are former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper. He hasn’t yet announced that he’s running, but roughly a fifth of these respondents are already thinking about him. And although none of the activists in December mentioned Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, or Julian Castro, a former mayor of San Antonio, they’re now being considered by 17 percent of the activists in this sample, after their official campaign announcements in January. Perhaps the most important sleeper candidate is Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, who was named by 20 percent of respondents and who has, by my reckoning, received almost no national press at all.

Now, to be clear about what these results do and don’t show: First, as mentioned before, this is not a large sample, and it’s not particularly representative of Democratic primary voters as a whole. The method I’m using here is useful for capturing what activists are considering and how they’re making up their minds, but it’s hardly a perfect representation of those who will be casting votes next winter. (Not that primary polls this far before a contest are terribly accurate, either.) Second, these results do indicate that these influential activists in early-contest states are concentrating their interest around just a handful of candidates despite a field of maybe 20 or more. And third, these candidates are largely conventionally qualified — experienced senators and governors well within the party’s mainstream. However, these survey responses are not the same as a more public display of support, like an endorsement. Harris, for example, seems well-positioned today, but it wouldn’t necessarily take much — a gaffe by Harris or a strong launch by another candidate — to shift some activist loyalties.

That said, signs point to the Democrats’ invisible primary functioning more or less as it has in previous cycles, with activists vetting candidates and pressuring others out of the race. We’ll see in the coming months just how much candidate choices hold and whether more activists are willing to winnow their support down to just one candidate.",The 2020 Democrats Being Considered By Early-State Activists,Fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-2020-democrats-being-considered-by-early-state-activists/
308,Empty,2019-02-28T13:46:01Z,What the blackface scandals in the US tell us about the state of white supremacy.,"One more time, as if we needed any more evidence, the depth of the incurable racism at the heart of American society, culture and politics has come on full display. The Democratic Governor of Virginia, Ralph Northam, recently acknowledged he appeared in an old yearbook photo showing one man wearing a Ku Klux Klan (KKK) costume and another donning blackface.

The governor did not elaborate which one would have been more offensive to human decency - to pose as a member of the racist KKK or to mock and ridicule the victims of the KKK.

He, however, is not the only high-ranking Democratic Party official with such illustrious racist history. Shortly after Northam scandal erupted, Mark R Herring, the attorney general of Virginia and a member of the Democratic Party, also admitted that he had worn blackface at a college party.

Although both Northam and Herring apologised, there are quite a few American politicians who see nothing wrong with blackface. For example, when former Democratic New York State Assemblyman Dov Hikind faced criticism in 2013 for wearing blackface and an Afro wig at a Jewish holiday Purim party, he called it ""political correctness to the absurd"".

But it's not just the American political class that has a penchant for racist costumes, Hollywood too enjoys featuring them in its films. There is a long list of Hollywood productions in which blackface has figured prominently: from ""Birth of a Nation"" (1915), all the way to ""Tropic Thunder"" (2008).

Indeed, the United States as a whole has a long history of white men wearing blackface to mock, ridicule, and denigrate black people which goes back to the 19th century and which, as we see, is still perfectly alive and well.

But its present-day form and resurgence demonstrate not only the persistent racism within the American society, but also the existential crisis white supremacy is going through at the moment.

Black, brown, red skin

In Black Skin, White Masks (1952), anti-colonial writer Frantz Fanon offered a classical critique of the dehumanising effect of racism operating at the roots of a colonial conquest and its contingent cultural domains. He analysed how western colonialism and racist power relations have compelled people of colour to see themselves through the lens of white supremacy - ie donning a ""white mask"".

Identifying this dangerous tendency, he called for liberation from this destructive self-image: ""The black is a black man; that is, as the result of a series of aberrations of affect, he is rooted at the core of a universe from which he must be extricated. The problem is important. I propose nothing short of the liberation of the man of color from himself.""

In my Brown Skin, White Mask (2011) I extended Fanon's argument to look into the fate of brown immigrant intellectuals who put themselves at the service of a dysfunctional empire and become its native mis/informers. Instead of adding any momentum to the progressive politics of their adopted countries, these comprador intellectuals side with the ruling ideologies of reactionary, racist, and predatory imperialism.

Later in his Red Skin, White Masks: Rejecting the Colonial Politics of Recognition (2014), Canadian scholar Glen Sean Coulthard challenged the very idea of ""recognition"" of the indigenous peoples in liberal politics. In between the state and indigenous peoples, Coulthard proposed, a mere acknowledgement of the terror settler colonialism had perpetrated on First Nations not only amounts to very little but in fact derails a more substantive reconstruction and redeployment of denied and denigrated cultures towards a progressive politics.

These two and other works go back to Fanon's originary idea: ""I am a man and what I have to recapture is the whole past of the world, I am not responsible only for the slavery involved in Santo Domingo, every time man has contributed to the victory of the dignity of the spirit, every time a man has said no to an attempt to subjugate his fellows, I have felt solidarity with his act.""

That is, the struggle for liberation from the bondage of racism and slavery is geared towards the liberation of the entirety of the human soul, not just its native location. In this sense, Fanon is as much responsible for the liberation of Iran as I am for the liberation of the Caribbean and Coulthard for the liberation of Palestine.

This is also what American author and activist James Baldwin meant when he said: ""When you try to stand up and look the world in the face like you had the right to be here, when you do that, without knowing this is the result of it, you have attacked the entire power structure of the Western World.""

But this self-universalisation, while being liberating for the person of colour, is seen as threatening by ""the white man"".

Reinventing white power

It scares ""the white man"" for by historical habit he considers himself the epicentre of the universe, and the rest of humanity being there only to corroborate this delusional centrality. For him, this is a struggle for existence. It is either him or the rest of the world.

Used in racialised habits, practices, and assumptions, ""black"" is a social construct, not a factual colour. By donning blackface and engaging in a variety of other racist acts, the ""white man"" seeks to erase that social fact and turn the colour into a marker of imagined inferiority. In this way, he anxiously seeks to secure the power hierarchy of his world and reaffirm his centrality in it.

Immanuel Kant, the father of ""Western Enlightenment"", the very author of ""Answering the question: What is Enlightenment?"" (1784), captured this racist anxiety succinctly in his short treatise ""Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime"" (1764). There he wrote about a black carpenter having said something worth considering and then readily dismissed it: ""It might be that there was something in this which perhaps deserved to be considered; but in short, this fellow was very black from head to foot, a clear proof that what he said was stupid.""

Kant's racism was not accidental to his philosophy. It was and remains definitive to it. No person of colour could be anything but stupid for Kant, for, if he were to be recognised as a knowing subject, that would dismantle his entire philosophical project.

Thus, ""the white man"" must stage himself, from his philosophy to his fashion, from his theatre to his cinema to his art and culture, in the denigration and ridicule of the man of colour in order to believe himself.

Therefore, that blackface being still a persistent feature of US or European culture demonstrates not only that ""the white man"" is still celebrating his presumed racist superiority, staging the power to mimic, the permission to mock, in order to cross-authenticate his delusions, but also that he is dead worried about the loss of his inexplicable and unwarranted privileges.

The myth of ""the white man"" was coterminous with the rise of European colonialism and the subsequent spread of American imperialism around the globe. After generations of anti-colonial struggle and critical thinking, the ideological foregrounding of that racist assumption has now crumbled. ""The white man"" is increasingly aware he has been riding a delusional dragon, that he is the pathological myth of the colonial settler ruling from the Americas to Palestine. And this is scaring him witless.

Dionne: History will notice which Republicans distance themselves from Trump Salt Lake Tribune California Republican Party elects first woman, Latina to be its leader Los Angeles Times California's hurting Republicans pick insider to lead party ABC News …","Washington • In 1964, Nelson Rockefeller, then the governor of New York, rose before the Republican National Convention to condemn “extremists” who had “no plan and no program to keep the peace and bring freedom to the world.”

Amidst the boos and catcalls from right-wingers on the floor, Rockefeller denounced those who ""spread distrust,"" ""engender suspicion"" and ""encourage disunity.""

“There is no place in this Republican Party,” declared this stalwart of GOP progressivism, “for such hawkers of hate, such purveyors of prejudice, such fabricators of fear.”

You wonder what Rocky would make of a President Trump and the movement he has nurtured. And you sure wish someone like Rockefeller were around today to call his party back to reason and tolerance.

The events of recent days ought to try the consciences of Republicans who know that extremism and hatred are wrong. Many in the party acknowledge — usually in private — that the president they have continued to back has rooted his political appeal in vicious attacks against his opponents and a free press. He has invented crises for the purpose of stoking dread and horror. And he targeted minority groups (immigrants especially) to harvest political support.

In the meantime, the party as a whole has abandoned the embrace of civil rights and voting rights that had been, from the Lincoln era to Rockefeller's time, the GOP's calling card. Mimicking the segregationist Democrats of the past, Republicans have of late used the unfounded specter of voter fraud to justify voter ID laws and other measures squarely aimed at impeding access to the ballot box by African-Americans and the young.

So there was a delicious irony to last week's unanimous ruling by the North Carolina Board of Elections that it was a Republican candidate for Congress, Mark Harris, who found himself accused of massive voter fraud. As a result, the board threw out the district's 2018 election results and called a new election.

In 2017 Trump named a presidential commission that scoured the country for instances of in-person voter fraud that might justify the party's voter suppression efforts. It was such a bust that the commission itself had to be disbanded just eight months later.

Impeding voting rights needs to be called what it is: an act of extremism. It is radically anti-democratic to keep your opponents from voting. Where are the Republicans who will speak out loudly and clearly against what their party has done in so many states that they controlled?

An even more startling development was news that police in Maryland had arrested Christopher P. Hasson, a lieutenant in the Coast Guard and a self-identified white nationalist. The authorities said he stockpiled weapons and drew up a list of liberal politicians and commentators whom he hoped to kill. His catalog of targets included, among others, the House and Senate Democratic leaders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (whom he called ""Sen blumen jew""), and MSNBC commentators Joe Scarborough, Ari Melber and Chris Hayes.

Even if many Republicans have no problem these days labeling nearly all Democrats ""socialists"" based on the self-descriptions of a few in the party's ranks, it's obvious that no one should call out the entire GOP for the plotting of a fanatical would-be assassin.

One can, however, ask all responsible Republicans to deplore right-wing fanaticism and to take the threat of homegrown white nationalist terrorism as seriously as they do terrorism inspired from abroad. It is entirely fair to imagine that the GOP (and, especially, the president) would have a lot more to say if Hasson had been, say, a Muslim.

And it is important to examine the public statements of the president himself, his efforts to divide the country, and his constant demonizing of all those who oppose him.

Let's go back to Rockefeller's words: Day after day, Trump truly is a hawker of hate, a purveyor of prejudice, and a fabricator of fear. Prejudice and fear are at the heart of his invocation of national emergency powers to build his wall, an abuse of authority that ought to horrify all who proudly call themselves ""constitutional conservatives.""

The good news is that Republicans will soon have an opportunity to tell us who they are. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called a vote this week on a measure rejecting Trump's emergency declaration. The House is virtually certain to pass it. The Senate, by law, will be required to take it up.

It's not too much to say that history will notice how many Republicans choose to separate themselves from Trump's extremism.

On Sunday, The Washington Post reported that his administration is assembling a panel of fringe, industry-funded scientists who “represent the Trump administration’s most forceful effort to date to challenge the scientific consensus that greenhouse gas emissions are helping drive global warming and that the world could face dire consequences unless countries curb their carbon output over the next few decades.”

As Trump denies, though, Democrats delay. On Friday, in an encounter caught on video, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein told a group of teenage and preteen climate activists that she won’t support the Green New Deal, an ambitious plan to fight climate change introduced by Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey earlier this month. “There’s no way to pay for it,” she said, referring to the plan’s pledge to decarbonize the U.S. economy by the year 2030.



The children pleaded with Feinstein to be “brave” and to think about their future. “We’re the ones who are going to be impacted,” one girl pleaded. The 85-year-old insisted she understood, citing her seven grandchildren, but then dashed the schoolchildren’s hopes. “I’ve been in the Senate for over a quarter of a century,” she said, “and I know what can pass and I know what can’t pass.” Later, Feinstein put out a statement calling climate change one of her top priorities and released a draft resolution of her alternative to the Green New Deal.

This is how @SenFeinstein reacted to children asking her to support the #GreenNewDeal resolution -- with smugness + disrespect.

Republicans may want to re-think one of their planned 2020 campaign themes: It seems that President Donald Trump has met a “socialist” country he actually likes.

In recent months Trump has repeatedly cited what he calls the growing threat of socialism in an effort to tarnish leftist Democrats eyeing the Oval Office while also justifying his efforts to oust Venezuela’s dictator.

Story Continued Below

But this week, the U.S. leader has been praising Vietnam, the socialist-in-name country hosting his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. In fact, Trump has pointed to Vietnam’s economic advances as a model Kim could emulate if he gives up his nuclear weapons.

“Vietnam is thriving like few places on earth,” Trump tweeted Wednesday. “North Korea would be the same, and very quickly, if it would denuclearize. The potential is AWESOME, a great opportunity, like almost none other in history, for my friend Kim Jong Un.”

During his meeting with Vietnamese leaders the same day, Trump waved a small Vietnamese flag, praised growing U.S.-Vietnam economic ties, and signed new trade deals. The president’s public schedules also used the country’s full official name: the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Though it is standard diplomatic protocol to refer to foreign countries by their preferred name, the repeated presence of the word in official White House statements this week was jarring.

In reality, the Vietnam model, and Trump’s praise of it, also underscores the elasticity of the concept of “socialism,” and why some of its tenets may appeal to Americans.

Despite the presence of the s-word in its formal name, Vietnam is typically classified as a communist state. But its economy is largely capitalist, especially after the Communist Party adopted a policy of “doi moi” (renovation) in the 1980s.

The country's official name ""is a vestige term,"" said Joshua Kurlantzick, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""People in Vietnam are focused on getting rich, making money.""

Vietnam is in some ways mimicking China by unleashing capitalist forces while keeping tight restraints on political expression.

In one sense, praising Vietnam is just the latest discordant note for a president whose foreign policy, more than most presidents, is a tangle of contradictions on everything from human rights to use of military force.

After all, on the other side of the world right now, Trump is using diplomatic and economic pressure to try to push out of power Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who preaches socialist ideals but whose country's economy is in ruins.

In his State of the Union speech earlier this month, Trump slammed Maduro’s rule and also took veiled swipes at progressives such as Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and 2020 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, an independent Senator from Vermont, both of whom support some socialist ideas.

“We are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country,” Trump said, signaling what Republicans expect to be a potent 2020 campaign attack line. “America was founded on liberty and independence — not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free.”

Sanders, who also ran for president in 2016, describes himself as a “democratic socialist” who wants to reduce economic inequality in the United States.

He has pointed to European countries such as Norway, Denmark and Sweden as examples of places that successfully incorporate some socialist ideas into democratic political systems, including offering generous health care, retirement and educational benefits.

Maduro came to lead Venezuela after the 2013 death of Hugo Chavez, a longtime socialist firebrand and political mentor. But some Maduro critics say his government's problem isn't so much socialism as it is corruption, authoritarian instincts and the influence of narco-traffickers.

Venezuela was once relatively wealthy; now, many of its people are starving and millions have fled.

North Korea’s official name is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, but it’s essentially a totalitarian dictatorship. Kim, who is in his 30s, inherited rule from his father and grandfather.

Trump is banking that Kim’s desire for a stronger North Korean economy will lead him to offer concessions on the nuclear front in exchange for relief from international sanctions. And Kim may find the Vietnamese model an enticing one, so long as he gets to stay in power.

Of course, before any of that can happen, Trump and Kim may want to forget about the meaning of the word ""socialism"" and focus more on how each defines their shared stated goal of ""de-nuclearization.""

On Saturday night, Harris was on the other side of town at the United Steelworkers hall, keynoting the Iowa Democratic Party Black Caucus. Klobuchar, as she always does, built her speech up to a quote from Walter Mondale, talking about Jimmy Carter’s presidency: “We told the truth, we obeyed the law, we kept the peace.” Harris, as is her custom, progressed to a paraphrase of Coretta Scott King: “The fight for justice and the fight for civil rights must be fought and won with each generation.”

Afterward, I asked Klobuchar what she thought being a senator from Minnesota, compared with being a senator from California, would mean to Iowa.

“It means that for me, going south for the winter is going to Iowa. It’s easier to get here,” she said. “It’s important to have a lot of people running, but I am a candidate from the heartland, and it’s an important part of our path to success in the general election.”

Graeme Wood: The two Amy Klobuchars

Was she arguing that senators from the coasts—not just Harris, but Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Kirsten Gillibrand—wouldn’t be able to win?

“Senators from the coast have won in the heartland in the past. So I don’t think it’s that. It’s that my No. 1 request was to be on the Agriculture Committee. I served on that committee for 12 years. I’ve played a major role in getting the farm bill passed,” she said. “I know these issues here.”

Klobuchar likes talking about herself as an underdog, and structurally that’s how she started a campaign that many people thought she wasn’t actually going to go through with. She’s short on campaign staff, here and nationally, and arrived with just one person on her payroll and a handful of others who’d come in as volunteers. She had a surge of online fundraising after she announced, but aides have acknowledged in conversations with others that money is going to be a scramble and that her best hope is to scrape by enough to make it through Iowa, and then count on an explosion of interest if she wins to carry her over.

And so she lays it on thick, talking about the two states’ main agricultural exports, or how they both put a premium on butter-carving contests. On the list of ways the states are similar that she read from on Thursday evening: “You have the world-famous matchstick museum, and we have the only museum in the world devoted to Spam—or, as we call it, the ‘Guggen-ham.’”

But her main argument is that the country needs a pragmatic president, and that starts with making a pragmatic argument for why she should be the nominee.

“We need to win. So here’s my deal: I have won every single congressional district in the state of Minnesota, including Michele Bachmann’s, three times,” Klobuchar said, referring to the former congresswoman and 2012 Republican presidential candidate who helped popularize Tea Party politics in the run-up to a campaign that got much more attention than actual votes. With Democrats nationally nervous that Minnesota is in danger of slipping away—in a shocker, it had the smallest margin of any state Hillary Clinton won in 2016, and Trump’s campaign has been public about Minnesota being at the top of its 2020 target list—Klobuchar leaned in.",The Opposite Reasons Klobuchar and Harris Both Need Iowa,Theatlantic.com,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/02/klobuchar-harris-need-win-iowa-caucuses-2020/583558/

View full coverage on Googl…","A group of House Republicans gathered Tuesday on Capitol Hill to express their anger over two bills proposed by their Democratic colleagues that, if passed, would drastically tighten federal gun laws.

The Republican lawmakers, who were joined by a group of Second Amendment supporters, lambasted the two bills – HR 8 and HR 1112 – as “ineffective” and far overreaching measures that would ultimately lead to guns being confiscated from lawful owners.

“This bill turns law abiding citizens into criminals and it’s one more step towards federalized gun registration and ultimately gun confiscation,” Rep. Steve Scalise, R-Ga., the House Minority Whip, said. “That’s been the intention of many of the people bringing this bill for a long time. They want true gun control and this is the first step and surely not the last.”

ILLINOIS DEMS INTRODUCE BILL REQUIRING GUN BUYERS TO REVEAL SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS BEFORE GETTING FIREARM LICENSE

Scalise became a victim of gun violence when he was severely wounded by a gunman who opened fire while lawmakers were practicing for the annual Congressional Baseball Game for Charity in June 2017.

HR 8, which was approved by the House Judiciary Committee earlier this month in a 23-15 vote along party lines, would expand the scope of federal background checks and require nearly all purchasers of firearms to undergo a background check – even if they were bought it at a gun show, online or in a private transaction. HR 1112, which passed the committee 21-14, would require gun dealers to wait 10 days to receive answers about a background check.

The bills were introduced a day before the one-year anniversary of the mass shooting that killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.

“Although we know the issue of gun violence won’t be fixed overnight, there are steps Congress can and must take to address it,” Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, said in a statement. “Closing loopholes in the current background check system are long-overdue legislative measures that will help address this national crisis.”

While a handful of House Republicans have signed up in support of HR 8 – including Rep. Peter King of New York – the vast majority of GOP lawmakers opposed the legislation.

“Frankly HR-8 is taking the fears and concerns of a nation over gun violence and perpetrating a fraud upon them,” Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., said on Tuesday. “They are preying upon the very victims they are supposedly trying to help by putting a bill out there that will not help them. By constantly bringing up the mass violence instances such as schools and theaters and others. They are saying this will help.The reality is nothing in this bill would have stopped Parkland and nothing in this bill would have stopped the violence we have seen.”

The bills are part of the Democrats' efforts since retaking control of the House to move quickly to combat gun violence and they appear set to pass through the lower house of Congress. The legislation, however, is likely to meet a quick end once it lands in the Republican-controlled Senate.

In a prescient engraving from 1793, English poet and printmaker William Blake depicted a figure at the base of a long ladder that leads up to the moon. Beneath it, Blake famously carved the words: “I want! I want!”

The historic image offers an apt description of Canada’s space sector for the past year as it has repeatedly urged the federal government, both publicly and behind the scenes, to join a multibillion dollar international effort to build a next generation space station in lunar orbit.

On Thursday, Ottawa finally acquiesced, when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that Canada will become a partner in the Lunar Orbiting Platform-Gateway, a facility that the U.S. space agency, NASA, envisions as both a proving ground for space technology and a precursor to an eventual human mission to Mars.

“Today, we are stepping up,” the Prime Minister said during a press conference at Canadian Space Agency headquarters in Saint-Hubert, near Montreal. “Canada is going to the moon.”

The announcement means that Canada is the first partner to officially commit to the Gateway after the United States, although Europe, Japan and Russia have all indicated their interest and are expected to follow suit in the coming months.

The centrepiece of Canada’s involvement in the new platform will be supplying a robotic arm that Mr. Trudeau called “Canadarm 3,” a successor to the Canadarm 2, the unit that is depicted on the back of the Canadian five dollar bill and that has become crucial to operations aboard the International Space Station.

The commitment is the largest for the country’s space program in over a decade and will inject $2.05-billion into Canada’s space sector over the next 24 years. It also creates a focus for the Canadian Space Agency, which has been seen as adrift in recent years without a long-term plan or direction from political leaders about what happens after the space station.

The agency’s official entry into project, also sets the stage for Canadian astronauts to visit and work aboard the deep space outpost.

“Our objective is to have a Canadian on the Gateway within the next 10 years, as soon as the Gateway is completed,” said Gilles Leclerc, the agency’s director-general of exploration.

Jennifer Sidey-Gibbons, who was selected in 2017 to be a Canadian astronaut, said the prospect of a future mission to the Gateway was an opportunity almost too great for words.

“To hear the moon discussed as something we’re pushing towards is phenomenal,” she said.

Wilson-Raybould alleges ‘consistent and sustained’ effort by Trudeau, officials to ‘politically interfere’ in SNC-Lavalin case

Because of its remote location, it is expected that the Gateway will be unoccupied most of the time. The new Canadarm and other systems on board the platform will be more reliant on artificial intelligence with less real-time input from mission controllers on Earth.

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Leclerc added that Canada’s partnership in the Gateway would also open the possibility of access for scientists and Canadian companies to use the outpost as a base for conducting robotic mission on the lunar surface.

“It’s a door opener,” said Gordon Osinski, a planetary scientist at the University of Western Ontario. “Now that Canada’s at the table for a return to the moon it creates a way for scientists and engineers [at Canadian universities] to participate too.”

Thursday’s announcement also includes a $150-million allocation to the agency over the next five years for an accelerator program to spur projects by Canadian companies to develop technologies related to the Gateway. The program includes support for remote health technologies – a facet of human space exploration where the space agency hopes to develop a second niche alongside Canada’s established track record building space robotics.

Navdeep Bains, Minister for Innovation, Science and Economic Development, said that up to 200 companies stand to benefit from the initiative. The new funding will be included in the 2019 federal budget that is set to be tabled on March 19.

But the biggest potential winner is likely to be MDA, the company that built and operates Canadarm 2. While MDA is now part of Maxar, a U.S.-based aerospace firm, its robotics division remains in Brampton, Ont.

MDA has already been working on preliminary contracts to develop technologies toward Canadarm 3 and is a likely front-runner for the main contract to build the new arm.

For the past 10 months the company has led a vigorous public relations campaign under the banner “Don’t Let Go” to encourage the federal government to sign onto the Gateway.

In the SNC-Lavalin case, they pressure a minister over prosecution, allow criminal charges to lapse and invent bureaucratic ploys to bend and mitigate the law.

But at this end of Canada, the Liberals insist on hyper-respect for every law, regulation, concept, process and social notion that might possibly be used to delay a pipeline.

SNC-Lavalin is a Quebec-based company accused of fraud and bribery while doing business in Libya. Essentially, it’s charged with engaging in corrupt behaviour abroad that it would not employ at home.

As the past couple of weeks have shown, the cabinet and government will contort themselves to keep this company out of criminal court.

A conviction would ban the company from bidding on Canadian projects for 10 years. On Monday, the Globe and Mail reported that officials are now writing rules to allow “flexibility” in the length of a bidding ban.

Two senior officials of the company recently escaped criminal charges because judges ruled that prosecutors took too long to bring the cases to trial.

Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould was unhappy with what she evidently considered undue pressure to drop prosecution. She resigned and will soon appear before a committee.

Now, consider the handling of Trans Mountain by these same people.

The bedraggled project, far more important economically than any possible benefit from SNC-Lavalin, has been subject to endless public scrutiny.

The first proponent, Kinder Morgan, complied with every regulatory demand, completed extensive public consultations and negotiations — including dozens of financial benefit agreements with communities and First Nations — and has not been accused of any wrongdoing.

The project won 17 straight court challenges against other Indigenous groups, activists, and the cities of Burnaby and Vancouver.

But the obstruction played out for so long that the company left Canada, selling the project to Ottawa for $4.5 billion.

Construction began. Then, last Aug. 30, Trans Mountain ran into three Federal Court of Appeal judges who decided the permit was invalid.

The decision was not hostile to the pipeline itself. It was mainly critical of some consultation and environmental issues involving killer whales.

At that crucial moment, Ottawa might have applied some SNC-Lavalin-style vigour to the ruling.

Without any secretive actions, Ottawa could have appealed, ordered construction to continue, worked to fulfil the court’s demands and contested every application for an injunction.

The Liberals could also have passed a federal law enabling the pipeline. That was actually promised at one point. But the pledge sank without a bubble in the toxically conflicted cabinet.

Last Friday, the National Energy Board approved the project for the second time, adding 16 recommendations to its long list of previous conditions.

That might have been the moment for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau himself to promise quick cabinet approval.

But no, there’s not even a commitment to issue a new permit within cabinet’s 90-day guideline.

And all along, the Liberals have been busy erecting more legal barriers to energy and resource projects.

The best single article on this national disaster comes from former columnist Jeffrey Simpson, who recently wrote a long study for the Macdonald-Laurier Institute.

It details the impediments the Liberals have created, from giving the environment minister undue control over energy and resources to inferring veto powers for groups that will never agree to a project under any conditions and inventing extra-legal concepts like “social licence.”

Two bills — C-69 and C-48 — are now close to passage. The first would regulate new projects into oblivion. The second would prohibit Alberta products (not B.C. natural gas) from shipping by tanker off B.C.’s northern coast.

Absurdly, the Senate dominated by Ontario and Quebec is the last line of defence against these atrocious bills.

Counting the cost of delays and diversions so far, the C.D. Howe Institute estimates the loss in investment at $100 billion in 2017-18 alone.

Related

Along the way, the Liberals have virtually ceded a key power that holds Canada together, federal control over interprovincial shipping. At the same time, their bills would severely dilute provincial ownership and development of natural resources.

Such is the discriminatory regime the Liberals are creating for Western Canada’s resources. You can be sure they will enforce every nuance.

For SNC-Lavalin, though, existing law is a malleable thing, uniquely adaptable to partisan Liberal needs.

This double standard goes beyond simply hypocrisy. It’s a destructive message to the whole country about who counts, and who doesn’t.

The tension traces back to a suicide bombing that killed 40 paramilitary police in Indian-controlled Kashmir on Feb. 14. India blamed Pakistan for harbouring the terror group responsible for the bombing and launched an air strike into Pakistani territory on Tuesday.

The two sides shot down one another’s aircraft on Wednesday, and shots have been fired on both sides of the disputed region.

Key moments from Jody Wilson-Raybould’s testimony:

Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s introduction: For a period of approximately four months between September and December 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the Attorney General of Canada in an inappropriate effort to secure a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with SNC-Lavalin. These events involved 11 people (excluding myself and my political staff) – from the Prime Minister’s Office, the Privy Council Office, and the Office of the Minister of Finance. This included in-person conversations, telephone calls, emails, and text messages. There were approximately 10 phone calls and 10 meetings specifically about SNC-Lavalin that I and/or my staff was a part of.

On an interaction with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau: PM: I was quite taken aback. My response – and I remember this vividly – was to ask the PM a direct question while looking him in the eye – I asked: “Are you politically interfering with my role / my decision as the AG? I would strongly advise against it.” The Prime Minister said “No, No, No – we just need to find a solution.”

On a conversation with Privy Clerk Michael Wernick: He said that the PM wants to be able to say that he has tried everything he can within the legitimate toolbox. The Clerk said that the PM is quite determined, quite firm but he wants to know why the DPA route which Parliament provided for isn’t being used. He said, “I think he is gonna find a way to get it done one way or another. So, he is in that kinda mood and I wanted you to be aware of that.”

On a meeting with Finance Minister Bill Morneau: Still on September 19, I spoke to Minister Morneau on this matter when we were in the House. He again stressed the need to save jobs, and I told him that engagements from his office to mine on SNC had to stop – that they were inappropriate.

In a text message with chief of staff Jessica Prince about an interaction with adviser Gerald Butts: Gerry said, “Jess, there is no solution here that doesn’t involve some interference.” At least they are finally being honest about what they are asking you to do! Don’t care about the PPSC’s independence. Katie was like “we don’t want to debate legalities anymore.” … They kept being like “we aren’t lawyers, but there has to be some solution here”.’

Ms. Wilson-Raybould agreed to have a conversation with the deputy and the Privy Clerk, but that these conversations “would not change my mind.”

Ms. Wilson-Raybould says in a meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, which included the Privy Clerk Michael Wernick, Mr. Trudeau asked her to “help out” to find a solution on SNC-Lavalin on Sept. 17. He cited the loss of jobs and that SNC-Lavalin would have to move from Montreal. A board meeting with SNC-Lavalin would have been Sept. 20.

“If they don’t get a DPA they will leave Montreal,” Wilson-Raybould said she was told about SNC-Lavalin and the need to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement with the Montreal company — Steven Chase (@stevenchase) February 27, 2019

Wilson-Raybould thanks Canadians for their patience during the weeks since The Globe broke the initial story on Feb. 7.

The DPA that Ms. Wilson-Raybould is referencing is a “deferred prosecution agreement” or remediation agreement that provides an alternative to prosecution. In such deals, a company accepts responsibility for the wrongdoing and pays a financial penalty, relinquishes benefits gained from the wrongdoing and puts in place compliance measures. It was introduced in 2018 as an amendement to the Criminal Code.

“It is unfair that the actions of one or more rogue employees should tarnish a company’s reputation, as well as jeopardize its future success and its employees’ livelihoods,” SNC argued in a brief to federal officials in October, 2017.

All bets are now off about Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's political survival.

An ethics scandal has plunged Canada's government into disarray, with the prime minister himself facing unprecedented political peril.

Story Continued Below

A flood of new details allege Trudeau and several senior government officials repeatedly pressured his former attorney general to drop corruption charges against a large construction company and reach a settlement agreement. Trudeau's political opponents sent police a letter Thursday requesting an investigation and called for Trudeau's resignation.

""He can no longer, and in good standing with a clear conscience, lead this nation,"" said Conservative Andrew Scheer, who hopes to replace Trudeau.

The prime minister brushed off that request and said Canadians will have a chance to judge him for themselves in an election this fall.

Until recently, his reelection appeared to be nearly a lock. The latest polls now show him slipping into a tight race — and those surveys don't even capture the latest influx of damaging detail.

""It’s like someone threw the chessboard into the air,"" said Darrell Bricker, CEO of Ipsos Public Affairs. ""The pieces haven’t landed yet. ... This was already a close race. [Trudeau's Liberals] couldn’t afford to stumble. And, yesterday was much more than a stumble.""

The turning point was testimony Wednesday at a spectacular Justice Committee hearing in the Canadian House of Commons: On the same day Michael Cohen torched President Donald Trump at a committee hearing, a spurned ally of Trudeau's was scorching him too.

Former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould, who was dropped by Trudeau but continues to sit in his party’s caucus, broke her silence after weeks of speculation about what she might say.

In painstaking detail she demolished the talking point from the government that Trudeau played no role in pressuring her to cut a plea deal with a Montreal-based company. Wilson-Raybould described and shared notes from about 10 meetings and 10 phone calls with 11 senior members of the government, including Trudeau. She said after she repeatedly fought pressure last fall from officials in Trudeau's office and other departments to deliver a non-prosecution agreement, the prime minister brought it up with her.

She said Trudeau noted in a meeting last September that the company, SNC-Lavalin, is a major, longstanding employer in his home town.

Wilson-Raybould also said the prime minister and others raised the suggestion that cutting a deal could help the provincial wing of their Liberal party in an election last October, which it ultimately lost.

""At that point the prime minister jumped in, stressing that there is an election in Quebec and that 'I am [a member of Parliament] in Quebec.' ... I was quite taken aback,"" Wilson-Raybould said. ""My response — and I vividly remember this as well — was to ask the prime minister a direct question while looking him in the eye. I asked, 'Are you politically interfering with my role?'""

She said Trudeau said he wasn't interfering.

But she was soon demoted to a lesser role in the cabinet, replaced with a new attorney general from Trudeau's home town, and she recently quit her cabinet post.

Wilson-Raybould, who remains a member of Parliament, told the committee hearing that she was, ""having thoughts of the Saturday Night Massacre,"" the Watergate purging of the Justice Department.

The sole bright spot on the darkest day of Trudeau's term came when the former minister was asked whether Trudeau or others had committed a crime.

""I don't believe that,"" she replied.

The opposition seized the moment anyway: The Conservative leader hoping to replace Trudeau in an election later this year sent police a letter requesting an investigation.

Scheer asked the Mounties to investigate whether the acts described violated two criminal code items: one on obstruction of justice, the other against pressuring the attorney general. The RCMP has not commented.

He also called on Trudeau to resign.

“I was sickened and appalled by [the] story of inappropriate, and frankly bordering on illegal, pressure,” Scheer said. ""Mr. Trudeau’s cabinet must now find a way forward, without him. … They have a duty to govern this nation, not help a disgraced prime minister hang onto power.”

Trudeau disputed the characterization of events, but did not deny asking her to spare the company. He insisted he never directed the minister to drop charges.

“There are disagreements in perspective on this,"" Trudeau said Thursday. ""But I can reassure Canadians that we were doing our job and we were doing it in a way that respects and defends our institutions.""

He also sidestepped questions about calling a broader public inquiry, beyond ongoing parliamentary and ethics investigations.

One option available in theory is an early election.

If the opposition wants Trudeau gone, and if Trudeau said his fate is ultimately up to voters, they could call for an early election. The current election is officially set for Oct. 21, but the Canadian constitution allows a vote at any time.

Several members of the Trudeau government dismissed the idea. A spokesperson for the prime minister, Eleanore Catenaro, said Trudeau squashed the idea of an early election call in a December interview.

""His comments still stand,"" Catenaro said.

And asked about early election talk, Trade Diversification Minister Jim Carr said Thursday: “[There's been] none that I’ve heard.""

Minister of Innovation Navdeep Bains was with Trudeau at a press conference announcing a 24-year Canadian commitment to NASA's deep-space exploration project.

He sounded a similar note.

“We’re just focused on our mandate,"" Bains said in an interview. ""We’re focused on executing our work for Canadians.”

View full coverage on Google News","OTTAWA – Jody Wilson-Raybould has accepted the House Justice Committee's invitation to testify on the ongoing SNC-Lavalin affair on Wednesday, now that the government has waived solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence.

Her appearance will be the first time she speaks publicly and in detail in the 20 days since the allegations of political pressure being placed on her by members of the PMO in regards to an ongoing criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, were reported in The Globe and Mail.

Wilson-Raybould sent a letter to the committee Tuesday afternoon confirming she’d testify at 3:15 p.m. ET on Wednesday, which was the time the committee had requested.

Leaving the building where her lawyer has an office, CTV News asked Wilson-Raybould whether she felt satisfied with the terms under which she’s been permitted to speak, and she did not respond.

In requesting she attend imminently, the committee cited the Order in Council that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued Monday evening. The committee said it now has the clarity on confidence, privilege, and a parliamentary convention known as ""sub judice"" which deals with speaking about cases currently before the courts. These were issues that both Wilson-Raybould and the MPs who are conducting the probe were looking for more legal assurances on before having her appear.

The committee has agreed to a request Wilson-Raybould made in writing on Monday: that she be granted an ""extended opening statement"" lasting 30 minutes during which she would be able to go through everything she recalls about communications she was involved in regarding SNC-Lavalin. Most opening statements at committees are limited to 10 minutes.

The meeting is currently scheduled to span two hours, most of which will be Wilson-Raybould taking questions from MPs, and will take place inside one of the new committee meeting rooms in West Block. Wilson-Raybould is the only witness scheduled for the meeting.

""We're pleased to hear her take on things,"" said committee chair Anthony Housefather. ""I think it's important to the members of the committee to do our work, and to Canadians to hear from Ms. Wilson-Raybould, and I'm happy she’s agreed to come tomorrow,"" he said.

NDP MP Nathan Cullen said her testimony is ""pivotal,"" but expressed frustration that she was appearing in the afternoon, and not before the final prime minister's question period for a few weeks. On Wednesdays when he is in town, Trudeau takes every question asked during question period. Cullen said this could mean that the opposition won't have the ability to put to Trudeau what Wilson-Raybould has to say, until mid-March when the House of Commons reconvenes after a two-week hiatus where MPs are in their ridings.

Conservative MP Lisa Raitt said she'll be asking Wilson-Raybould whether in her view the pressure was appropriate and for more detail about many aspects of the entire affair from her perspective.

""The unanswered question I have is why did she resign? What was it either in what Mr. Lametti said or in what the prime minister said that caused her to realize she didn't have the confidence of the cabinet any longer?"" Raitt said.

In her Monday letter Wilson-Raybould said that she is ""anxious"" to appear and wrote that she'd be happy to stay for as long as the committee wishes to answer questions. Last week in the House of Commons she rose to say that she hopes she would be granted the ability to “speak my truth,” in relation to the allegations.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters on his way to Tuesday morning's cabinet meeting that he is ""pleased"" that Wilson-Raybould will be able to ""share her perspective.""

""It's important that people get an opportunity to testify or share their point of view at committee. As we said, waving the privilege, waiving cabinet confidentiality is something that we had to take very seriously,” Trudeau said.

""It's just important that she speak and that all of the mystery goes. This is important for all of us to get on with our work,"" said Crown Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett on her way out of cabinet on Tuesday. ""There is a view that in terms of the story, we need to hear her side of it,"" she said.

Over the last few weeks the opposition parties have focused in on this scandal, with Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer calling it a ""textbook case of government corruption with those at the very top of the prime minister's office implicated in what could very well be the obstruction of justice."" The opposition Conservatives and New Democrats have sought to have Trudeau and several senior PMO staff believed to be central to the story testify, and a public inquiry called, with no success.

Tuesday, Government House Leader Bardish Chagger criticized the opposition and its messaging throughout this ongoing controversy.

""Once upon a time it was a message that 'oh the committee will never meet on this issue.' They're meeting on this issue. Then we started talking about 'oh, witnesses will never be allowed to appear.' Witnesses are appearing. They’re being asked tough questions. 'Oh, the former Attorney General will not be allowed to appear.' Guess what? She is appearing. 'Oh the Prime Minister is not going to let her speak.' The Prime Minister has done whatever he can to work with the current Attorney General to ensure that the opportunity is there,"" Chagger said.

'There were contacts between lawyers'

On his way into cabinet Tuesday morning, Justice Minister and Attorney General David Lametti said that, before waiving attorney-client privilege and cabinet confidence, federal lawyers were in touch with Wilson-Raybould's counsel.

""It is fair to say that there were contacts between lawyers but I won't go any further than that,"" Lametti told reporters Tuesday morning.

In her letter of resignation as Veterans Affairs Minister Wilson-Raybould said she retained former Supreme Court judge Thomas Cromwell to provide advice on speaking publicly about the scandal. Up until now she has maintained solicitor-client privilege as the reason she’s been unable to speak to the allegations.

This specific waiver only permits Wilson-Raybould to speak about the matter to the House Justice Committee, however, as part of its study into the SNC-Lavalin affair, and to the federal ethics commissioner who has also launched an investigation.

""We have, I believe as a government, worked to demonstrate transparency as well as balancing the fact that there is ongoing litigation we do not want to compromise, so we feel we’ve done that with this agreement,"" Lametti said.

The government made the directive in an Order in Council posted Monday evening. The order authorizes her, as well as ""any person who directly participated in discussions with her,"" to speak to the committee and ethics commissioner, about the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

The order relates to any information or communications that have to do with Wilson-Raybould's time as the attorney general and exercising her authority under the Director of Public Prosecutions Act, and only in regards to the two ongoing probes of the matter, and not a blanket permission for Wilson-Raybould to speak.

As well, the order states that Director of Public Prosecutions Kathleen Roussel is exempted from this waiving of privilege and any information or conversations between Wilson-Raybould and Roussel cannot be disclosed, ""in order to uphold the integrity of any criminal or civil proceedings,"" the prime minister's office states in the Order in Council.

Recap on the story so far

On Feb. 7, citing unnamed sources, The Globe and Mail reported that Trudeau's office pressed Wilson-Raybould to drop a criminal prosecution against SNC-Lavalin when she was attorney general. It was alleged that the PMO wanted Wilson-Raybould to instruct federal prosecutors to change course and pursue a remediation agreement rather than criminal prosecution in the corruption and fraud case against the Quebec engineering and construction giant. CTV News has not independently verified the story.

Remediation agreements — or Deferred Prosecution Agreements (DPAs) — can include having the company accept responsibility, denounce the wrongdoing, vow to implement corrective measures, and pay financial penalties.

In contrast, if the company was criminally convicted it would be banned from securing Canadian government contracts for a decade, potentially putting jobs on the line.

When she was attorney general, Wilson-Raybould had the ability to direct the Director of Public Prosecutions to take a different route with the charges against SNC-Lavalin but she did not, despite several meetings and conversations before and after federal prosecutors decided to carry on with the criminal case in the fall.

In January, Wilson-Raybould was shuffled into the veterans affairs portfolio, and was replaced as attorney general and justice minister by David Lametti, a Quebec MP. Wilson-Raybould accepted her new position, but then resigned from cabinet days after the Globe story broke amid the opposition framing this as her being demoted for not changing her position on a deferred prosecution.

The House Justice Committee began probing the matter last week. As part of the study the committee has already heard from Lametti, his deputy minister, and top bureaucrat Michael Wernick, who gave blunt and detailed testimony in which he sought to reframe the Globe report, saying that while it's likely Wilson-Raybould could have felt pressured, it's a question of whether that constitutes as ""inappropriate pressure,"" or pressure that comes with being part of the inner circle that makes key decisions with national implications.

Then on Monday the committee heard from a slate of academic witnesses on the underlying legal aspects at the heart of the affair. These include the legal provision known as remediation or deferred prosecution agreements, which were tucked into a recent omnibus bill following heavy SNC-Lavalin lobbying, and the Shawcross doctrine; which has to do with the independence of the attorney general in making decisions.

These witnesses offered their hypothetical perspectives about the propriety of attorney generals making prosecutorial decisions, when the various principles are activated, and the balance of seeking advice from cabinet colleagues without succumbing to or factoring in politics.

Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, a legal counsel with Woodward and Company LLP, and law professor at the University of British Columbia, told the committee that what needs to be understood is how the situation unfolded.

""If the purpose was to persuade the attorney general as chief prosecutor to take a different position on a prosecution, it triggers a serious rule-of-law concern, and how will we know whether that’s serious or not? Well, obviously you need to hear from those who may have been involved,"" Turpel-Lafond told the committee on Monday.

To date, the government maintains that nothing improper occurred, though Trudeau's principal secretary resigned over the matter on Feb. 18, denying any wrongdoing.

Jody Wilson-Raybould, Canada’s former justice secretary and attorney general, has said she hopes to “tell her truth” when she appears before the Commons’ justice committee later today amid accusations ‘a line was clearly crossed’.

Ms Wilson-Raybould quit the Cabinet last month and is consulting lawyers as to what she can say on the scandal. Last week, Canada’s top civil servant Michael Wernick denied any wrongdoing when he testified to the justice committee but admitted Ms Wilson-Raybould would likely “express concern” about a series of meetings on SNC-Lavalin when she speaks. Mr Singh, head of Canada’s third biggest party, said his by-election victory “allows me to ramp up the pressure on Mr Trudeau and on the Liberal government”.

He added: “It allows me to really put into focus the question, ‘Is this Liberal government more interest in helping their well-connected, powerful friends like SNC-Lavalin?’”.

Mr Singh was chosen to replace Tom Mulcair in October last year as the former NDP leader lost a leadership review.

A former Canadian justice minister says she faced attempts at interference and ""veiled threats"" from top government officials seeking a legal favour for a firm facing a corruption trial.

Jody Wilson-Raybould said she was pressed repeatedly to ""find a solution"" for engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

PM Justin Trudeau said he disagreed with the minister's testimony and he and his staff acted appropriately.

Opposition leader Andrew Scheer has called on him to resign.

""He can no longer, with a clear conscience, continue to lead this nation,"" the Conservative leader told reporters, adding that he was calling for a full police investigation.

What did the former minister say?

Speaking to the House of Commons justice committee, the former justice minister and attorney general said she and her staff faced four months of a ""sustained"" and ""inappropriate effort"" to push for a possible deferred prosecution agreement for the Quebec-based engineering and construction company.

That agreement would have allowed the firm to avoid a criminal trial and instead agree to alternative terms or conditions, like penalties or enhanced compliance measures.

It was an option rejected in September by the Public Prosecution Service of Canada - an independent authority whose main objective is to prosecute federal offences - and one she supported.

Ms Wilson-Raybould said she and her aides were pulled into multiple conversations and meetings - ""a barrage of people hounding me and my staff"" - with Mr Trudeau, senior aides from his office and the finance department, and a top bureaucrat.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Wilson-Raybould says she felt political pressure and ""veiled threats"" from government officials

In those various meetings, they repeatedly raised concerns about the possibility of job losses and potential political ramifications of a trial long after that decision had been made.

""Within these conversations, there were expressed statements regarding the necessity of interference in the SNC-Lavalin matter, the potential of consequences and veiled threats if a deferred prosecution agreement was not made available to SNC,"" she said.

Mr Trudeau's Liberals have struggled to contain the controversy over the past three weeks.

Though she has been a key figure at the centre of the affair, Ms Wilson-Raybould had not yet not spoken publicly, citing solicitor-client privilege.

That privilege was waived by the government on Monday, paving the way for her appearance before the committee on Wednesday.

What has happened so far?

This began in early February, when the Globe and Mail newspaper reported on allegations of political interference in the case against SNC-Lavalin.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has faced repeated questions about the matter from opposition parties

The newspaper reported, citing unnamed sources, that Mr Trudeau's office pressured Ms Wilson-Raybould to push the public prosecution service to consider a deferred prosecution agreement.

Ms Wilson-Raybould was attorney general and justice minister until January, when she was shuffled into the veterans affairs portfolio, a move widely seen as a demotion.

An attorney general is supposed to act independently with respect of his or her prosecutorial function.

On 12 February, Ms Wilson-Raybould resigned suddenly from Cabinet, though she remains a Liberal member of Parliament.

Finally on 18 February, Mr Trudeau's top aide Gerald Butts announced he was resigning, denying in a statement that he or anyone on his staff did anything wrong but saying he had to leave so as not to be a distraction from the ""vital work"" being done by the team.

Mr Trudeau and his officials have denied anything improper took place but have struggled to contain the crisis.

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday evening, he said he was worried about jobs at SNC Lavalin and how pensioners would be affected.

Opinion polls indicate the matter is beginning to hurt the Liberals with months to go until the coming general election.

What is happening with SNC Lavalin?

The Quebec-based firm is one of the world's largest engineering and construction companies.

The company and two of its subsidiaries face fraud and corruption charges in relation to approximately C$48m ($36m; £28m) in bribes it is alleged to have offered to Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011.

The firm has openly lobbied to be allowed to enter into a remediation agreement instead of going to trial, saying it has cleaned house and changed its ways.

The agreement - similar to regimes in the US and the UK - essentially suspends prosecution while allowing a firm to agree instead to alternative terms or conditions.

SNC-Lavalin and its supporters say it would be unfair to penalise the company as a whole and its thousands of employees for the wrongdoings of former executives.

Preliminary hearings for the charges are currently before the courts. The company says it will ""vigorously defend itself"" against the allegations.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has denied wrongdoing after he tried to shield one of the country's biggest firms from a corruption trial.

Mr Trudeau said any lobbying by him or his inner circle for engineering giant SNC-Lavalin was done to protect jobs.

In explosive testimony, ex-Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould said she faced ""sustained"" pressure to abandon prosecution of the Quebec-based firm.

Opposition Conservatives are calling on the Liberal PM to resign.

They are also demanding a public inquiry following Ms Wilson-Raybould's testimony on Wednesday before the Commons justice committee in Ottawa.

How did Trudeau defend himself?

Speaking to reporters on Thursday morning, Mr Trudeau said he disagreed with his former justice minister's ""characterisation"" of events and maintained his staff followed the rules.

The prime minster said he had full confidence in an inquiry by a parliamentary justice committee into the affair and in an investigation by the federal ethics commissioner, and would ""participate fully"" in that process.

Opposition parties have been ramping up pressure on the prime minister and the Conservatives have said the Royal Canadian Mounted Police must immediately open an investigation.

Mr Trudeau said that to his knowledge no member of his staff has been contacted by the RCMP.

The prime minster has insisted for weeks that all communications between himself, federal officials and Ms Wilson-Raybould were above board.

He says that any advocacy for SNC-Lavalin was done in the interest of protecting Canadian jobs that no lines were crossed.

What does the ex-justice minister allege?

Ms Wilson-Raybould told the justice committee on Wednesday she had faced attempts at interference and ""veiled threats"" from top government officials seeking a legal favour for the Montreal construction firm.

The former justice minister and attorney general said she and her staff endured four months - between last September and December - of a ""sustained"" and ""inappropriate effort"" to push for a possible deferred prosecution agreement for the construction company.

That agreement would have allowed the firm to avoid a criminal trial and instead agree to alternative terms or conditions, like penalties or enhanced compliance measures.

Ms Wilson-Raybould said that while some discussions about the ramifications of the decision were normal, the pressure went well beyond what was appropriate given her role as attorney general.

In Canada, an attorney general is supposed to act independently with respect of his or her prosecutorial function and decisions are not supposed to be politically motivated.

Ms Wilson-Raybould said that in various meetings, Mr Trudeau and senior staff repeatedly raised concerns about the possibility of job losses and potential political ramifications of a trial.

She said she had made clear she was not prepared to help the company avoid a trial and that she believes it was why she was demoted in a Cabinet shuffle in January, which Mr Trudeau denies.

Ms Wilson-Raybould also said during her testimony she did not believe any laws were broken.

What is SNC-Lavalin accused of?

The company and two of its subsidiaries face fraud and corruption charges in relation to about C$48m ($36m; £28m) in bribes it is alleged to have offered to Libyan officials between 2001-11.

The firm has openly lobbied to be allowed to enter into a remediation agreement instead of going to trial, saying it has cleaned house and changed its ways.

SNC-Lavalin and its supporters say it would be unfair to penalise the company as a whole and its thousands of employees for the wrongdoings of former executives.

Preliminary hearings have begun and the company says it will ""vigorously defend itself"" against the allegations.

A conviction on fraud and corruption charges could result in a decade-long ban on bidding on federal contracts, which would be a major financial hit for the firm.

What's the company background?

SNC-Lavalin is one of the world's largest engineering and construction companies and employs some 9,000 people in Canada.

The firm has deep roots in the vote-rich province of Quebec, which is expected to be a battleground in this October's general election.

This is not the first time SNC-Lavalin has found itself in trouble.

In 2016, the agency that oversees Canadian federal elections said former executives had devised a scheme to illegally donate C$118,000 to the federal Liberals and Conservatives between 2004-11. The bulk of the funds went to the prime minister's Liberal Party.

In 2013, the World Bank barred the firm and its affiliates for up to 10 years from bidding on contracts with the agency for ""misconduct"" in a bridge contract in Bangladesh, the longest debarment period ever handed down in a settlement.

How bad is this for Trudeau?

Political commentators suggest Ms Wilson-Raybould's remarks are deeply damaging for Mr Trudeau and the Liberals.

Writing in the Toronto Star, columnist Chantal Hebert says the prime minister was ""already up to his neck in the SNC-Lavalin mess"".

""On Wednesday, former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould pushed his head down further. It will be harder for the Liberal government to dig itself out of the deep hole she dug before the next campaign.""

In the National Post, columnist Andrew Coyne said Ms Wilson-Raybould's testimony suggested ""an attitude that appears to pervade this government: that the law is not an institution to be revered, but just another obstacle to get around, by whatever means necessary.""

Columnist Patrick Lagace, writing in Montreal newspaper La Presse, said her remarks suggest that ""for the Prime Minister and people acting on his orders, the rule of law and the independence of the Attorney General were at least negotiable"".

In Maclean's magazine, Paul Wells suggests her remarks reveal a ""sickeningly smug protection racket whose participants must have been astonished when she refused to play along"".",SNC-Lavalin: Trudeau denies wrongdoing in corruption case - BBC News,Bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47362657
337,Empty,2019-02-28T16:53:12Z,PM's government has been rocked by allegation that undue pressure was put on the country's former attorney general.,"Canada's Conservative opposition leader has called on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to resign following allegations that his administration meddled in the prosecution of a major engineering firm, which is accused of committing fraud.

Andrew Scheer said late on Wednesday that Trudeau ""has lost moral authority to govern"" and ""must resign"" at once.

""Mr Trudeau can no longer, in good standing and with a clear conscience, lead this great nation,"" he added.

For weeks, Trudeau's government has been rocked by allegations first reported by The Globe and Mail newspaper that undue pressure was put on Jody Wilson-Raybould, the country's former attorney general, for an out-of-court settlement with SNC-Lavalin.

Earlier on Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould accused Trudeau's inner circle of pressuring her to defer the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, one of the world's top construction and engineering firms based in Montreal.

""I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, in an inappropriate effort to secure a deferred prosecution agreement with SNC-Lavalin,"" Wilson-Raybould told a committee in the House of Commons.

She also told the committee that she faced ""veiled threats"" and advice from Canada's top bureaucrat, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, that ""a collision with the prime minister on these matters should be avoided"".

Wilson-Raybould, who was also minister of justice, said she believes she was shuffled to another portfolio in January over her refusal to take action in the case.

Trudeau responded that he ""completely disagrees with the former attorney general's characterisation of events"".

When asked about calls for his resignation, Trudeau told reporters on Wednesday that ""Canadians will have a very clear choice in a few months time about who they want to be prime minister of this country and what party they want to form government"". Parliamentary elections are scheduled for October.

On Thursday, Trudeau won the public support of a top political ally, indicating there was no immediate pressure inside the Liberal Party to remove him.

""I have 100 percent faith in the prime minister,"" said Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, one of the most prominent members of Trudeau's Cabinet.

Alleged bribery

SNC-Lavalin was charged in 2015 with corruption for allegedly bribing officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011 to secure government contracts during former strongman Muammar Gaddafi's reign.

The firm, its international arm and another subsidiary are accused of having offered $36m in bribes to officials and of defrauding the Libyan government of $98m.

The charges relate to the world's largest irrigation project - the Great Man Made River Project, which aimed to provide fresh water to the cities of Tripoli, Benghazi and Sirte.

SNC-Lavalin has argued that those responsible for alleged wrongdoing left it long ago, and that holding it accountable for their criminal actions would severely hurt its business.

The company heavily lobbied the government, including senior officials in Trudeau's office, for an out-of-court settlement that would include paying a fine and agreeing to put in place compliance measures.

Trial set to proceed

But Wilson-Raybould refused to ask prosecutors to settle, and the trial is set to proceed.

She quit Trudeau's cabinet earlier this month. Trudeau's longtime friend and principal secretary Gerry Butts also resigned days later. Questions remain over their specific reasons for leaving.

Trudeau has steadfastly denied any wrongdoing, saying again Wednesday that he had made clear to his former attorney general that the ""decision around SNC-Lavalin was Jody Wilson-Raybould's and hers alone to make"", which she confirmed in her testimony.

""I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,"" he said.

Wilson-Raybould testified, ""The prime minister asked me to help out, to find a solution for SNC, citing that if there is no DPA (deferred prosecution agreement), there would be many jobs lost and that SNC would move from Montreal.""

She added, ""I told him that I had done my due diligence and had made up my mind on SNC and that I was not going to interfere with the decision of the director (of public prosecutions).""

Wilson-Raybould went on to say that 11 government officials, including the finance minister, raised similar concerns that SNC-Lavalin might move its headquarters to London without a deal, or could face massive job losses if it was found guilty at trial - in an election year.

They ""urged me to take partisan political considerations into account, which was clearly improper,"" she said.

She added that they continued to ""hound"" her from September to December after she made her decision not to offer SNC-Lavalin a deal and had made it known.

That pressure was ""not illegal"", she opined, but ""raised serious red flags in my view"".",Canadian opposition leader calls on Trudeau to resign,Al Jazeera English,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/02/canadian-opposition-leader-calls-trudeau-resign-190228113038516.html
338,Empty,2019-02-25T14:46:09Z,Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer wants Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to appear as a witness at the justice committee probing the SNC-Lavalin affair.,"The Trudeau government issued a broad waiver on Monday allowing former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to tell the Commons justice committee details of her conversations with government officials about the SNC-Lavalin affair.

In an order-in-council (OIC) posted online, the government says Wilson-Raybould — ""and any persons who directly participated in discussions with her relating to the exercise of her authority under the Director of Public Prosecutions Act respecting the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin"" — can report to the committee and to the federal ethics commissioner any cabinet confidences ""in any information or communications that were directly discussed with her respecting the exercise of that authority while she held that office.""

The OIC also ""waives ... to the extent they apply, solicitor-client privilege and any other relevant duty of confidentiality to the Government of Canada"" regarding what Wilson-Raybould discussed with other government officials as justice minister ""respecting the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin while she held that office.""

The waiver does not extend, however, to any communications between Wilson-Raybould and the director of public prosecutions on SNC-Lavalin while she was justice minister — ""in order to uphold the integrity of any criminal or civil proceedings,"" says the text of the order.

The order sets the stage for what could be an extraordinary session of the justice committee. Wilson-Raybould was expected to speak before the committee this week; a time has not yet been set for her appearance.

The justice committee is examining the growing controversy touched off by a Feb. 7 Globe and Mail report that said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's aides attempted to press Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin to help the company avoid criminal prosecution on bribery charges related to contracts in Libya — and that exasperation with her lack of co-operation was one reason for shuffling her out of the Justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs.

Wilson-Raybould quit cabinet entirely on Feb. 12. She's offered no comment since on the SNC-Lavalin affair or the company's attempts to secure a remediation agreement to avoid criminal prosecution, arguing that she's still bound by solicitor-client confidentiality from her time as federal attorney general.

The OIC clears a few things up in advance of Wilson-Raybould's appearance before the committee. The ex-minister, who said she is ""anxious"" to testify before the justice committee probing the SNC-Lavalin affair, wrote to committee chair Liberal MP Anthony Housefather today saying it would be useful for the committee to have an ""authoritative statement"" on the scope of what she can say prior to her appearance.

""I am anxious to appear at the first available time,"" she wrote. ""However, I believe that in advance of my appearance the members of the committee and I should have as much clarity as we can in relation to the possible constraints on the matters about which I may properly testify.""

Wilson-Raybould, who has retained retired Supreme Court justice Thomas Cromwell as counsel, also requested an extended period of 30 minutes to make an opening statement to the committee.

Under pressure to waive solicitor-client privilege for his former justice minister and attorney general, Trudeau said earlier today Wilson-Raybould would be given leeway to speak.

Earlier today, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called on Trudeau to testify at the committee, insisting Canadians should be outraged by the allegations of political interference in a criminal case.

A motion tabled by the Conservatives said Trudeau should be called to answer questions given his ""alleged direct involvement in a sustained effort to influence SNC-Lavalin's criminal prosecution."" It called on the prime minister to appear at a two-hour televised committee under oath sometime before Mar. 15.

The motion was defeated in the Commons this evening.

During a news conference on Parliament Hill Monday, Scheer described the SNC-Lavalin affair as an unprecedented attempt to alter the course of justice through political interference.

""Politicians don't get to execute our justice system,"" he said.

""What we've seen unfold over the last two weeks is a textbook case of government corruption, with those at the very top of the Prime Minister's Office implicated in what could be the obstruction of justice.""

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer outlines the motion he will introduce calling on the Prime Minister to appear before the Justice Committee . 1:25

It's rare for a prime minister to appear before a committee.

On Sept. 7, 2006, then-prime minister Stephen Harper appeared before a special committee on Senate reform.

Former prime ministers have occasionally appeared before Commons committee hearings. Former prime minister Paul Martin appeared before a committee on the Kelowna Accord on Nov. 9, 2006 and Brian Mulroney spoke before a committee looking into the Airbus settlement on Dec. 13, 2007.

Last week, Canada's top civil servant Michael Wernick told the justice committee that he warned Wilson-Raybould that there would be economic ""consequences"" from prosecuting SNC-Lavalin, including big job losses. But he maintained that he, Trudeau and officials in the Prime Minister's Office did not impose any inappropriate pressure on the minister.

Trudeau said Friday that Wernick is an ""extraordinary public servant"" who has served Canada with ""integrity and brilliance.""

""I would recommend that people pay close heed to the words of the clerk of the Privy Council,"" the PM said. ""His service to this country over decades in the public service leaves him well-positioned to understand what institutions are grounded in, and make sure that we're doing the right things as a government.""

In September 2018, the government amended the Criminal Code to allow for remediation agreements, enabling prosecutors to use them as an alternative to a criminal trial ""at their discretion to address specified economic crimes if they consider it to be in the public interest and appropriate in the circumstances,"" according to the Department of Justice website.

If the accused organization upholds the terms and conditions of the agreement, charges can be stayed and a criminal prosecution avoided.

Shawcross doctrine

According to the government website, the purpose of remediation agreements is to denounce wrongdoing and hold the organization to account, while reducing harm to innocent employees, shareholders and other third parties. The organization would have to accept responsibility for the wrongdoing and pay a financial penalty.

In the case of SNC-Lavalin, the Public Prosecution Service of Canada opted not to pursue a remediation agreement and chose instead to proceed with prosecution. It advised the company of that decision on Sept. 4, 2018.

Wilson-Raybould, as attorney general at the time, had authority to override the decision and halt prosecution. Wernick confirmed last week several meetings were held on the topic — including a telephone call on Dec. 19 he initiated, during which he warned Wilson-Raybould of the economic consequences of prosecuting a company that employs about 9,000 people.

He insisted there was never ""inappropriate"" interference.

According to the so-called Shawcross doctrine, the attorney general must consider the impact of prosecution on the public interest. The attorney general can consult with cabinet colleagues, but those discussions are limited to hearing advice, not receiving directions.

Delay advising investors

Arguing in favour of calling Trudeau to speak to the committee, Conservative justice critic and deputy leader Lisa Raitt said it's in the public interest to have the prime minister testify in order to bring together the various threads of the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Raitt also asked why SNC-Lavalin was told of the prosecutor's decision on Sept. 4 but didn't disclose that information to its shareholders until Oct. 10.

""Who in the Prime Minister's Office, what cabinet minister, or even did the prime minister give assurances to SNC-Lavalin that they would not have to disclose a material fact to their shareholders because they were going to sort it all out?"" she asked.

Five legal experts appeared before the committee today; some couched their comments by saying they don't have all the facts yet.

Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond is a senior associate counsel at Woodward and Company LLP and a professor at the Peter Allard School of Law, University of British Columbia. She told the committee the law imposes limits on anyone trying to influence an attorney general acting in the role of chief prosecutor.

'Crisis' in rule of law

""Those engaging in that must point to lawful authority that actually backs up their actions, and I would say the Shawcross doctrine is a flimsy authority,"" she said.

Turpel-Lafond said she believes it's important to hear from all of those involved in the SNC-Lavalin affair, not just Wilson-Raybould, because the situation is escalating to the level of a ""crisis in the rule of law.""

She said the RCMP integrity unit could investigate the matter — if it isn't doing so already — to determine if there was a ""subtext"" to the discussions between various officials and Wilson-Raybould regarding the criminal prosecution.

""If there's evidence that a prosecutor is fired and there was an attempt to influence or direct her attention to something that didn't have lawful authority, then it does raise the spectre of obstruction of justice, because obstruction of justice requires this sort of fear-favour element,"" she said.

Maxime St-Hilaire, associate professor at the Faculty of Law, Université de Sherbrooke, said he finds it difficult to understand how information conveyed to an attorney general would be useful after a decision had been made to not overturn a prosecution.

""If there are cabinet discussions after that decision has been made, then I find that quite difficult to understand,"" he said.

339,Empty,2019-02-28T23:43:55Z,Ottawa lawmakers requested an emergency debate Thursday to discuss allegations Prime Minister Justin Trudeau inappropriately sought to influence decision to charge SNC Lavalin.,"In the wake of Wilson-Raybould’s stunning testimony to the Commons’ justice committee Wednesday, MPs spent Thursday evening debating the allegations that have prompted calls for a police investigation and demands for the prime minister to resign.

OTTAWA—Jody Wilson-Raybould’s charge that top officials sought to “politically interfere” in an ongoing criminal case has plunged the government into “crisis” and shaken the confidence of Canadians in the judicial process, opposition MPs said during an emergency debate Thursday.

“The sustained interference and undermining by the key members of the prime minister’s office at the direct direction of the prime minister is a line that is crossed,” said Angus (Timmins-James Bay).

NDP MP Charlie Angus said the issue “cuts to the very heart of the question of the independence of the judicial system.

Conservative and New Democrats heaped criticism on the Liberals for “putting political considerations ahead of the rule of law” amid revelations that officials leaned on Wilson-Raybould to mediate a criminal case against SNC-Lavalin .

In testimony to the justice committee Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould gave a detailed account of meetings and phone calls between her and her office and Trudeau, his top aides, the top bureaucrat and officials in Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s office.

Over four months last fall, “there was a sustained effort, an attempt to politically interfere with my discretion as the Attorney General of Canada. It was inappropriate,” Wilson-Raybould told the committee.

Wilson-Raybould had the power to intervene in the case and direct a remediated agreement for SNC-Lavalin, ensuring the company avoided criminal prosecution, which could have resulted in a 10-year ban on federal contracts.

Candice Bergen, the Conservative house leader, denounced Trudeau’s repeated denials that anything improper was done, accusing the prime minister of being evasive and refusing to “own up” to the allegations.

“This leaves us at a crisis,” Bergen said. “If we don’t have a prime minister who can be truthful, we can’t trust him to get to the bottom of this.”

Bergen (Portage-Lisgar) said that, from the start, the Liberals have stonewalled opposition efforts to get answers, refusing at first to call witnesses to the justice committee and had to be forced “kicking and screaming” to hold hearings on the matter.

Toronto Liberal MP Arif Virani, the parliamentary secretary to the minister of justice, tried to defend the government. He was said it was “refreshing” to hear Wilson-Raybould’s “important” testimony.

He picked out elements from Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, noting the former justice minister had affirmed it was always her decision whether to intervene, that it was okay to discuss job impacts and that she considered the interventions inappropriate, but not unlawful.

“She indicated that the state of our institutions, the independence of our processes was, indeed, strong,’ said Virani (Parkdale-High Park).

But Bergen mocked his depiction of her testimony, adding, “that sure wasn’t the testimony I heard.

“Her testimony was not refreshing; it was disturbing. It was sad. It was appalling,” Bergen said.

“We have a government that is being deceptive, that is not owning up to what they have done.”

Fellow Conservative MP Michael Cooper said that attempts by Trudeau’s aides and others to persuade Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the criminal proceeding, “smells of obstruction of justice.

“They knew what they were doing was wrong. They knew they what they were doing crossed the line. You know what? They didn’t care,” said Cooper (St.Albert-Edmonton).

Bloc Québécois MP Monique Pauzé (Repentigny) put a spotlight on the potential economic consequences if SNC-Lavalin is convicted of its charges and is slapped with a 10-year ban on federal contracts, putting some 9,000 jobs at risk.

“The only way we can save these is through a remediation agreement,” Pauzé said.

She branded Wilson-Raybould’s testimony as a “settling of scores” with the prime minister and questioned why the former attorney general refused to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case.

“She didn’t answer the most fundamental question: Why did she decide not to use a remediation agreement, thus avoiding the loss of thousands of jobs,” Pauzé said.

“She had the power to do so and she choose not to use it.”",LIVE: Parliament holds emergency debate on Jody Wilson-Raybould’s allegations on SNC Lavalin,Thestar.com,https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2019/02/28/members-of-parlia.html

Liberal MPs, heading into a crucial re-election campaign, …","Jody Wilson-Raybould said she wanted to tell her truth on the SNC-Lavalin story. The story she told Wednesday at the Commons justice committee is so vastly different from everything the prime minister has said until now that the two versions simply can't be reconciled.

The former attorney general spoke of veiled threats if she didn't intervene in the criminal prosecution of the giant Montreal construction firm. She spoke of constant and sustained efforts over a four-month period last fall by some of the most powerful people in government to ensure SNC-Lavalin avoided a trial.

The pressure began right at the top, she said, starting with Justin Trudeau, his top adviser and the country's most senior bureaucrat.

All of them have denied doing, saying or counselling her to do anything improper.

Wilson-Raybould, citing from memory and what she called her ""copious"" note-taking, gave a very different view.

Disagreeing is, of course, part of any political discussion. But this is no ordinary disagreement over policy. This dispute exposes a clear rift inside cabinet, and inside the Liberal caucus.

'I was taken aback'

In her testimony, Wilson-Raybould said the interventions, in some ten phone calls and an equal number of meetings, played on similar themes: SNC-Lavalin would pull out of Quebec. Jobs would be lost. She was pushed, on a number of occasions, to get an outside legal opinion.

Most significantly, Wilson-Raybould said she was told by Justin Trudeau on Sept. 17 that refusing to give the company the option of entering into a remediation agreement instead of standing trial would go over badly in Quebec, home to his own riding, where a provincial election was underway.

""I was taken aback,"" Wilson-Raybould told the committee in her nearly 40-minute opening statement.

""My response, and I remember this vividly, was to ask the PM a direct question while looking him in the eye. I asked 'are you politically interfering with my role, my decision as the AG? I would strongly advise against it.""

WATCH | Wilson-Raybould says she experienced 'sustained pressure' on SNC-Lavalin

""I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the gov't to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion..."" 1:08

Trudeau, she added, said that wasn't his goal. That much, at least, is consistent with the prime minister's repeated statements that he assured her the decision on whether SNC-Lavalin is prosecuted was hers to make, and hers alone.

Except the efforts to get her to change her mind didn't end there, Wilson-Raybould said Wednesday, nor were they confined to the prime minister.

Wilson-Raybould stood her ground. She would not interfere. Less than a month later, she was out as attorney general, shuffled off to Veterans Affairs.

For a prime minister who has spent much of the past three weeks talking about his government's respect for democratic institutions, for the rule of law, Wilson-Raybould's testimony is more than her finally giving her side of a ""he said, she said.""

Her testimony gave Canadians a carefully constructed timeline, based on her own memory, detailed notes and transcripts of texts. Her testimony also gave the Opposition a political cudgel, which Conservative leader Andrew Scheer immediately seized as he called for a probe by the RCMP.

Canadians now have two dramatically different versions of what happened. Liberal MPs, heading into a crucial re-election campaign, are already choosing sides.

Challenged by her colleagues

At committee, Wilson-Raybould found herself in the odd position of being supported by opposition MPs on the committee, and challenged by her own colleagues in a hearing that featured six rounds of questions, lasting nearly four hours.

Liberal MPs peppered her with questions. Why didn't she resign last fall if she felt she was being pressured to override the decision to prosecute for political reasons? Why didn't she go the prime minister to complain? Does she still have confidence in the prime minister?

Conservatives and New Democrats praised her courage for speaking out.

""We have witnessed not a lesson in politics but a lesson in integrity,"" said New Democrat MP Charlie Angus.

While Jody Wilson-Raybould’s split with the Prime Minister’s Office is not apparently linked to any leadership ambitions, it is abundantly clear now that the former justice minister is driving the bus in this whole saga over SNC-Lavalin .

Once again, without uttering a word about the specific grievances, Raybould is forcing everyone around her to react. Last week, she managed to get a hearing from cabinet and caucus — and this of course came after the resignation of Trudeau’s principal secretary, Gerald Butts.

On Monday, on the eve of her much-anticipated appearance at the Commons justice committee, Raybould demurred, issuing instead a long letter setting out the conditions under which she intended to speak.

So while Wilson-Raybould is not the leader or even a would-be leader of her party, she definitely has forced Liberals to follow her — if only to try to anticipate her next move.

That’s pretty impressive clout for a rookie politician, new to cabinet and government a little over three years ago and a relative newcomer to the Liberal party.

When Lucien Bouchard left Brian Mulroney’s cabinet in 1990, that Conservative government carried on without him. Ditto for Paul Martin’s exit from Jean Chretien’s cabinet in 2003. Damage was done in both cases, certainly in the long term, but neither prime minister seemed overly concerned with keeping the departed minister in the fold.

In fact, it’s difficult to remember any other politician who retained the power to keep dictating rules of engagement to a Prime Minister’s Office after leaving cabinet.

Trudeau’s reaction to this whole saga has been curious. For several days after the story of Wilson-Raybould’s grievances about SNC-Lavalin first broke in The Globe and Mail earlier this month, the prime minister did not speak to her.

Then he spoke to her a couple of times in Vancouver and seemed to be confident she would stay in cabinet — until she quit, hours later. He apologized to her behind the closed door of the cabinet room last Wednesday, only to have her stand up in the Commons and warn that she was waiting a chance to “speak my truth.”

Late last year, Trudeau was asked in one of his year-end interviews to sum up U.S. President Donald Trump in a word. “Unpredictable,” Trudeau replied, which summed up a lot of things, especially his disciplined silence in the face of Trump’s trade-related tantrum after the G-7 meeting in Charlevoix last June.

In the end, Canada and the U.S. did end up signing a new trade deal a few months later and Trump stopped calling Trudeau and Canada names on his angry Twitter feeds.

Trump’s unpredictability isn’t Trudeau’s biggest problem now — Wilson-Raybould’s is. But when you think about it, the prime minister is handling them the same way, which is probably a mistake.

Trudeau’s strategy on Trump, distilled to its essence, was basically this: say nothing, don’t rise to the bait and fan out to seek allies and experts while the situation cools down. A similar strategy seems to be under way now, inasmuch as the Trudeau government’s response can be called a strategy.

But Wilson-Raybould’s disaffection with Trudeau and how she’s been treated is looking far more methodical than Trump’s episodic outrage of last year.

What’s more, in Trump’s case, Trudeau could count on most of Canada to be on his side. With some exceptions, Canadians were more likely to stick up for their prime minister in any battle with the unpredictable Trump.

This confident streak — maybe overconfident streak — is at the nub of the Wilson-Raybould saga now. It is striking to see the ways in which Trudeau and his team have just left the slate blank in this whole tale, banking on the conviction that Canadians will give them the benefit of the doubt.

Each day in the Commons, this is basically what Trudeau says — that Canadians know his government is balancing concern for jobs and the law. “Trust us,” he says, while the government fans out, looking for experts and allies to attest to Trudeau’s integrity and hoping that the mess will go away.

Sometimes scandals do blow themselves out; sometimes ministers — or angry presidents — just go away, and governments carry on in their absence.

Nothing in this nearly three-week-old saga over Wilson-Raybould and SNC-Lavalin gives any indication of following that pattern. Trudeau and his government aren’t leading themselves out of the controversy — they’re following and reacting — and Wilson-Raybould is doing the leading.

RCMP arrested David Petersen on Wednesday. In a news release, police said they became aware of the alleged threats on Feb. 12.

Petersen is accused of making the threats over the phone to an unnamed government agency.

He is charged with uttering threats against the prime minister and uttering threats against Parliament.

He'll be back in court in Nipawin — a town 225 kilometres northeast of Saskatoon — on March 6.

In 2017, two other Saskatchewan men were sentenced for making online threats against Trudeau.

Derek Hurrell pleaded guilty to one count of uttering threats and was given a two-year suspended sentence in December 2017. He posted on Facebook that he wanted to ""blow out"" Trudeau's brains.

And in August 2016, police charged Christopher Hayes of Grayson, Sask., with the same type of crime, saying he made threats against Trudeau over Facebook.

In February 2017, he was given nine months' probation, ordered to stay away from Trudeau, prohibited from having firearms for five years and fined $500.","Nipawin, Sask., man charged with threatening to shoot prime minister, blow up Parliament",CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/prime-minister-threats-charges-sask-1.5037675

But her story will get immediately committed to the political memory around Ottawa, mainly for the searing details Wilson-Raybould assiduously noted over four months: an offhand dismissal of annoying “legalities,” talk of “giving us cover” and the inevitability of “some interference” to help SNC-Lavalin. And that was just in one conversation she says her chief of staff had with the prime minister’s most senior advisers, Katie Telford and Gerald Butts, toward the end of what she called a four-month “sustained” effort to change her mind. Even with Butts gone from that inner circle, one of the early casualties of this no doubt enduring saga, how does the Trudeau government put itself on a steady keel again? This is not obvious at the moment.

It’s certainly not sunny ways. The Liberal ad team might want to throw out that pitch for the next campaign. Conservatives and New Democrats accumulated enough footage from Wednesday’s committee meeting to animate a full election’s worth of ads about a Liberal leader beating up on an Indigenous woman in his government. Speaking of campaigns, Wilson-Raybould claimed the prime minister made his case in September for helping the Quebec firm, not just in the context of potential jobs lost if she didn’t agree to a plea deal for SNC-Lavalin, but against the backdrop of a looming Quebec election. So, she said, did Clerk of the Privy Council, Michael Wernick — the same supposedly non-political bureaucrat who made a vigorous and also memorable presentation to this justice committee last week.

Article Continued Below

Wilson-Raybould said in her statement on Monday that Wernick thought it important to tell her in September that the SNC-Lavalin board needed some answers before a looming meeting with shareholders and warned that the firm would relocate to London if Canada proved inhospitable to a plea deal. He then leapt into the politics of the situation — the Quebec election coming on Oct. 1. “At that point the prime minister jumped in, stressing there is an election in Quebec and that, quote, ‘I am an MP in Quebec, the member for Papineau,’ end quote. I was quite taken aback. My response — and I remember this vividly — was to ask the PM a direct question while looking him in the eye. I asked, ‘Are you politically interfering with my role, my decision as the AG? I would strongly advise against it.’” Wernick was already facing criticism for the partisan bent of his testimony last week; Wilson-Raybould has only given credence to those arguments. A week or so ago, one of the senior officials who figured in the Wilson-Raybould story was talking off the record, and said the government couldn’t keep “fighting ghosts in The Globe and Mail.” Well, now we have a very different ghost story — actually, more like one of those scary movies with the line: “The call is coming from inside the house.” Wilson-Raybould is that caller and she brought everyone into the house with her with a hair-raising tale about how politics works in this government. There’s an old rule of opposites when it comes to Canadian prime ministers — they always exit office with an image opposite to the one they had when they took on the job. Trudeau, we’ll recall, was the just-not-ready, feminist guy who was going to make his relationship with Canada’s Indigenous people the most important one in his government. Wilson-Raybould has presented that opposite image: a prime minister who made life very difficult for an Indigenous woman in his government, who was more than ready to embrace the hard cynicism of power. That image just doesn’t line up with the one Trudeau, or even his critics, have presented of this government so far. But it’s now a signature picture in the political history books.

In a letter sent to the Commons’ justice committee Tuesday, Wilson-Raybould cautions the waiver to solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidences only applies to her time as attorney general, a post she was shuffled out of in January.

The waiver — formally provided Monday — “does nothing to release me form any restrictions that apply to communications while I served as Minister of Veterans Affairs and in relation to my resignation from that post or my presentation to Cabinet after I had resigned,” Wilson-Raybould states in her letter. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Justice Minister David Lametti portrayed the waiver as an example of their government’s transparency on the controversy. But Wilson-Raybould’s response underscores that she is still barred from speaking freely.

“I mention this simply to alert the Committee to the fact that the Order in Council leaves in place whatever restraints there are on my ability to speak freely about matters that occurred after I left the post of Attorney General,” she wrote. The former justice minister will begin her testimony before the Commons justice committee at 3:15 p.m. starting with a 30-minute statement to MPs. “While that time period will certainly not provide sufficient time for to provide a ‘full complete version of events,’ it will permit at least a reasonably detailed summary of them,” Wilson-Raybould wrote. Trudeau said earlier in the day that he’s “pleased” Wilson-Raybould will be able to tell her version of events around allegations she was pressured over the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. “It is important that people get an opportunity to testify or share their point of view with the committee. As we said, waiving privilege, waiving cabinet confidentiality is something that we had to take very seriously but I’m pleased that Ms. Wilson-Raybould is going to be able to share her perspective,” Trudeau told reporters Tuesday as he headed into a morning cabinet meeting.

It promises to be high-stakes testimony. Does Wilson-Raybould testify that her meetings with senior Trudeau aides and officials were an inappropriate intervention in the judicial process? Or does she back the government’s assertions that whatever pressure was applied on the SNC-Lavalin issue, it was appropriate and lawful?

Article Continued Below

Any charge of judicial interference by Wilson-Raybould would heap further political woes on Trudeau’s government, perhaps force yet further inquiries — beyond the Commons’ committee and ethics commissioner ongoing probes — and even trigger a police investigation, if one isn’t already underway. “Her testimony is pivotal,” NDP MP Nathan Cullen said. Wilson-Raybould’s testimony comes as a new poll reveals that the Liberals and Trudeau himself are already facing a political backlash for the controversy. Two-thirds of Canadians believe there is a deeper scandal in the Prime Minister’s Office, according to polling done by the Angus Reid Institute, a not-for-profit public opinion research organization. Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s principal secretary, resigned last week while denying allegations there was any inappropriate pressure put on Wilson-Raybould. Still, there’s a “sinking” feeling among Liberal voters “that there’s more to come, that it’s not over, that more issues are going to reveal themselves,” said Shachi Kurl, the institute’s executive director. Sixty per cent of Canadians say they have an unfavourable view of the prime minister and roughly the same number say their opinion has worsened over the last month, according to the online survey of 1,009 Canadians done between Feb. 21-24. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. While much of Trudeau’s negative polling is driven by right-of-centre voters, almost 30 per cent of Liberal supporters have a worse opinion of Trudeau. His rivals don’t fare much better — 54 per cent have an unfavourable opinion of Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer and 64 per cent for New Democratic Party Leader Jagmeet Singh. In the best case scenario for the Liberals, Wilson-Raybould’s testimony on Wednesday clears the air and allows the government to focus on other issues, Kurl said. “It really comes down to what she says and the credibility factor. Do people believe it and are they then mollified and want to move on ... or does it continue to flame?” she said. Citing solicitor-client privilege, Wilson-Raybould has neither confirmed nor denied the allegations.

OTTAWA—Discussions the Prime Minister’s Office had with former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould about criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin are “troubling,” lack a strong legal justification and may have led to her being “fired,” a respected jurist said Monday.

The director of public prosecutions decided last fall to proceed with criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin, rejecting the company’s request for a remediation agreement that would have spared it a conviction and, with it, a 10-year ban on government contracts.

“Perhaps this is an instance where a prosecutor was actually fired for establishing a boundary that was not popular or accepted. I’m not sure of that. I think there is some suspicion and concern here about that.”

“In fact, prosecutors should not resign. Lead prosecutors, when they’ve taken a decision, should hold firm to their position and that is consistent with the rule of law,” Turpel-Lafond said.

Now those interventions are in the spotlight amid questions whether lines were crossed.

Wilson-Raybould appears to have stuck by that decision in the face of meetings with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s senior aides and the top civil servant, despite concerns about the future of the Quebec company if the charges went ahead.

Turpel-Lafond, who currently practises law and teaches in Victoria, expressed serious doubts about the government’s claim — articulated by Wilson-Raybould’s successor, David Lametti, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick and Liberal MPs — that officials are permitted to hold robust discussions with an attorney general under the so-called Shawcross Doctrine.

Once a decision is made to pursue a prosecution, there is “limited authority for anyone to intervene at that decision point and going forward,” Turpel-Lafond said.

She said if the talks went beyond a “more passive and respectful approach,” and the purpose “was to persuade the attorney general as prosecutor to take a different position on a prosecution, it triggers a serious rule-of-law concern.”

And she cast doubt on Lametti’s and Wernick’s assertions that the decision to negotiate a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin is one that still remains open to the attorney general, even with the preliminary inquiry underway.

She said there should be a “full” airing of what was said to Wilson-Raybould, adding it would be something she’d expect the RCMP’s sensitive investigations or “integrity” section would already be looking into.

Two other legal experts agreed that the Shawcross Doctrine — a concept imported from the United Kingdom — does not justify any pressure put on an attorney general to make or change a prosecutorial decision.

That decision, they said, is the attorney general’s alone to make.

“The attorney general should not be put under pressure by colleagues and in particular should not be put under partisan political pressure,” said Mary Condon, interim dean of Osgoode Hall Law School.

Maxime St-Hilaire, an associate law professor at the University of Sherbrooke, said the clear line would be better drawn if Canada’s attorney general did not also serve as justice minister inside a federal cabinet.

Trudeau told the House of Commons he would partially lift confidentiality obligations on his former attorney general so she can testify about allegations that his office was at the centre of what the Opposition says was a “sustained effort” to influence the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Under fire in the House for weeks, Trudeau told question period Monday that Wilson-Raybould would be able to appear at the justice committee and “will be able to address relevant matters at the committee while ensuring that the two active court cases are not jeopardized.”

Monday night, the Trudeau cabinet issued an order-in-council waiving cabinet confidence and solicitor-client privilege for Wilson-Raybould for discussions she had on SNC-Lavalin, clearing the way for her testimony to the committee.

However, “in order to uphold the integrity of any criminal or civil proceedings,” the waiver did not extend to communications Wilson-Raybould had with Kathleen Roussel, director of public prosecutions concerning SNC-Lavalin.

It was not entirely clear when her long-awaited appearance will be scheduled, as her expected appearance Tuesday was postponed.

In a letter sent earlier Monday to the committee, Wilson-Raybould stated that she is “anxious to appear at the first available time.”

But she said that she remained constrained by what she can say by solicitor-client privilege, cabinet confidence and the ongoing cases involving SNC-Lavalin still before the courts.

“The government can waive solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence. I cannot, Wilson-Raybould said in her letter to Liberal MP Anthony Housefather, chair of the committee.

She said she wants to delay her testimony until “we all have whatever clarity we can have about these issues.”

When she does appear, Wilson-Raybould said she wants to make an extended opening statement of about 30 minutes to provide “my best recollection of all relevant communications.”

Trudeau has denied he or anyone in his office applied any inappropriate pressure on Wilson-Raybould. She has not yet spoken publicly to confirm or deny the allegation, saying she is bound by solicitor-client privilege.

Late Monday, the Commons voted 155-106 against compelling Trudeau to testify before the committee, as the Conservative and NDP opposition wanted.

The prime minister again defended his actions, telling the Commons that “at every stage,” his government did what it promised Canadians, to stand up for jobs and growth while protecting the rule of law and the independence of the justice system.

“We’ve consistently and continually stood up for the 9,000 jobs at SNC-Lavalin and good jobs right across the country,” Trudeau said.

“That’s exactly what we’ll continue to do and we will continue to do it in a way that ... always respects the rules and norms that govern our institutions.”

SNC-Lavalin and two former employees were charged in 2015 under the Corruption of Foreign Officials Act with one count of bribing former members of the Libyan regime of Muammar Gaddafi, and one count of fraud under the Criminal Code.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he completely disagrees with his former attorney general and says that he and staff always acted appropriately on a potential prosecution of a major Canadian engineering company.

Trudeau says the decision to avoid a prosecution and enter into a remediation agreement with Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin was hers and hers alone.

The company was facing allegations of corruption involving government contracts in Libya.

Emergency debates are held to discuss urgent matters and must take place on the day the request is approved unless the Speaker rules otherwise.

The Vancouver-area race was largely seen as a test of Singh's leadership, as he faced off against Liberal candidate Richard T. Lee, a former B.C. MLA, and Conservative candidate Jay Shin, a lawyer and newcomer to politics.

In 2017, Singh made history when he became the first non-white leader of a major Canadian federal party. Since then, he's led the NDP without a federal seat.

In his victory speech on Monday night, Singh said it was a ""new day.""

""When I was growing up I could have never imagined someone like me running for prime minister, but guess what we just told a lot of kids out there that yes, you can,"" he said.

""And I know that carries a lot of responsibility and I understand that responsibility and I want you to know that when I take my seat in the House of Commons I will work very hard to make you all very proud.""

Singh touts health care, housing

While Singh highlighted some of the issues critical to Burnaby South, he also touted a national platform — calling for expanded health coverage, building half a million affordable housing units across Canada, transitioning to a green economy, and working towards reconciliation with Indigenous communities.

Watch part of Jagmeet Singh's victory speech here:

Singh criticized the Liberals and Conservatives and called out the purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline.

He also addressed growing distrust of immigration.

""New Canadians and people who are fleeing are not responsible for the problems that we're faced with,"" he said.

""We'll address that uncertainty and fear by giving people something to hope, something to dream.""

With all polls reporting, the NDP claimed 39 per cent of the vote, the Liberals 26 per cent, the Conservatives 22.5 per cent, and the People's Party 10.6 per cent.

Just under 29 per cent of registered voters cast a ballot, not including electors who registered on election day.

Rough Liberal ride

The Liberals usually put up a strong showing in Burnaby. In the 2015 federal election, the Liberals came within 547 votes of the winning NDP candidate, Kennedy Stewart, who resigned the seat in September 2018 for a successful run at Vancouver's mayoralty.

But this time around, they faced challenges in the campaign.

Their first candidate, Karen Wang, resigned after pointing out Singh's ethnicity online.

In recent weeks, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been besieged by allegations his office pressured then-attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin — a scandal Singh alluded to in his speech.

""We have eight more months to let the people know we have a government … that doesn't give handouts to SNC-Lavalin, but stands up for everyday Canadians,"" he said.

Watch more of Jagmeet Singh's victory speech here:

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh says Canada can make different choices and get better results 1:59

But Lee, who replaced Wang as the Liberal candidate in January, said that as he went door-to-door constituents were concerned with local issues like housing and transportation, not the SNC-Lavalin scandal.

He said the Liberals ran a strong campaign and he is considering running again in the fall.

""I look forward to more debate ... in elections, sometimes it's difficult to get the message across so I believe in the fall [it will] be much better.""

Singh addresses Quebec

The NDP also faced a test in the Montreal-area riding of Outremont on Monday, which was vacated by the party's former leader, Thomas Mulcair. Liberal candidate Rachel Bendayan was the successful candidate in that riding.

Singh made a special pitch to Quebec, saying he knew Outremont would be a tough riding, but that the NDP supports legislation supported by many Quebecers, primarily surrounding green energy and the environment.

The NDP has struggled since Singh became leader in 2017. The party now sits at 14 per cent nationally, 11 per cent in Quebec and 16 per cent in B.C., according to CBC's Poll Tracker.

He was formerly director of communications to Stephen Harper.

Imagine you’re Justin Trudeau.

The SNC-Lavalin scandal has been battering your government for weeks. Your story keeps shifting. The usually docile media aren’t letting it rest. Even a thousand coordinated tweets about the positive impact of the Canada Child Benefit can’t change the channel.

On the contrary, l’affair SNC—now christened LavScam—is picking up steam.

You’ve been forced to accept the resignation of your good friend and top advisor, Gerry Butts, who showed himself the door despite doing absolutely nothing wrong on SNC. Your boy Buttsy jumped on the SNC grenade to spare others the damage.

Only Butts missed the grenade. Completely.

Even worse, Jody Wilson-Raybould—i.e. the grenade-launcher—is now before the Justice Committee. She’s (relatively) free to speak and she is letting loose. And now the shrapnel is everywhere, and everyone is bleeding.

You’re bleeding. Your chief of staff is bleeding. Your Quebec advisor is bleeding. Your policy guy is bleeding. Your big-spending, do-nothing finance minister is bleeding. Your finance minister’s chief of staff is bleeding. And the “non-partisan” clerk of the Privy Council—i.e. your own personal pick for the post? Well, Michael Wernick is soiled. Comprehensively soiled. And bleeding.

It’s riveting testimony. The media are typing as if their lives depend on it. The cable guys are running the full hearing. And ordinary people are watching, because it’s not every day you see a member of a government strafe its leadership. Strafe you.

Only strafe isn’t the word. It’s more of a shiv. There is no emotion or hysteria. There is ice in Jody Wilson-Raybould’s veins and a steely determination as she coolly, calmly and credibly outlines the myriad ways your political and bureaucratic apparatus attempted to impress upon her independent mind the need to have another think on SNC, despite her repeated attempts to everyone—including you—that her thinking on the matter was all done.

You’re watching this all go down, and it is devastating. Your government is in peril. You’re in peril. You’re staring a return to your career of part-time drama teaching right in the face.

And so you decide it’s time to fight back. Because the cast of fifth-rate clowns you sent to fill the Liberal seats at the justice committee certainly didn’t do any fighting back. They not only missed the grenades, they picked them up, played with them, and then didn’t even realize when they went off in their faces.

But that’s all right. You’re Justin Trudeau. Mr. Sunny Ways. Mr. Hope and Hard Work. You got this. So you wheel yourself out to ‘push back’ against Wilson-Raybould’s allegations.

Only you don’t push back.

You don’t counter Wilson-Raybould’s facts and recollections with any of your own. You don’t dispute what was said, even about your alleged direct personal involvement, other than to say you disagree with Wilson-Raybould’s “characterization” of events.

And it stinks.

It stinks as you moan about a difficult couple of weeks because of “internal disagreements.” It stinks as you reference your success in making it easier to die, and your success in making it easier to get high. It stinks as you talk about your job being to stand up for jobs and pensions, to stand up for Canadians, and for Canadian workers, and all in an overly dramatic tone that suggests that no other prime minister has ever had that in their job description. It stinks as you speak about anything other than what Canadians need to hear from you.

And you say all of this nothing in front of a carefully crafted human backdrop meant to demonstrate your love of youth and diversity. Except the youth look like they’re in a hostage video (they are). Your human backdrop even includes your new MP, Rachel Bendayan, who is standing over your shoulder tonight playing the role of Huma Abedin while you step all over your wiener.

There isn’t a hint of contrition, or even a speck of responsibility for letting things get this far. No acknowledgment that Wilson-Raybould has laid out a set of serious charges that require serious answers. Your focus remains political.

When you’re asked about Andrew Scheer’s call for your resignation over the seriousness of these allegations, you mumble something about Stephen Harper being a bad man and this coming election being about a choice, blithely assuming you’ll still be in function to see it out. And when you’re asked about Wilson-Raybould remaining in the Liberal caucus, you say you will have to review her full testimony—testimony you have already dismissed, by the way—before deciding her fate, when it really should be the other way around.

You tell Canadians—in that sanctimonious and overly serious tone you adopt when you’re under the cosh—who have watched Wilson-Raybould rattle their confidence in Canada’s institutions to now have confidence in the ethics commissioner, an office that has already found you guilty of breaking another law, but isn’t equipped to investigate the allegations unfurled by Wilson-Raybould. And while you’re busy doing that, you have your office tell media that nobody else will be resigning based on Wilson-Raybould’s testimony.

In other words, every move you make tonight makes you look like the un-smart, un-serious man that so many of your political opponents have always insisted you are.

But you can’t let that worry you.

Your only bet now is that you being you will be enough to see you through. If there is enough talk about evil Tories, or lost jobs, or Liberal values, then Canadians might just go back to sleep and wake up thinking you’re that wonderful man who promised to change everything in 2015.

Things have certainly changed. And you’ve changed, Justin Trudeau. My how you’ve changed.

The post Justin Trudeau, my how you’ve changed appeared first on Macleans.ca.","Andrew MacDougall is a London-based columnist, commentator and consultant at Trafalgar Strategy. He was formerly director of communications to Stephen Harper.

Imagine you’re Justin Trudeau.

The SNC-Lavalin scandal has been battering your government for weeks. Your story keeps shifting. The usually docile media aren’t letting it rest. Even a thousand coordinated tweets about the positive impact of the Canada Child Benefit can’t change the channel.

On the contrary, l’affair SNC—now christened LavScam—is picking up steam.

You’ve been forced to accept the resignation of your good friend and top advisor, Gerry Butts, who showed himself the door despite doing absolutely nothing wrong on SNC. Your boy Buttsy jumped on the SNC grenade to spare others the damage.

Only Butts missed the grenade. Completely.

Even worse, Jody Wilson-Raybould—i.e. the grenade-launcher—is now before the Justice Committee. She’s (relatively) free to speak and she is letting loose. And now the shrapnel is everywhere, and everyone is bleeding.

You’re bleeding. Your chief of staff is bleeding. Your Quebec advisor is bleeding. Your policy guy is bleeding. Your big-spending, do-nothing finance minister is bleeding. Your finance minister’s chief of staff is bleeding. And the “non-partisan” clerk of the Privy Council—i.e. your own personal pick for the post? Well, Michael Wernick is soiled. Comprehensively soiled. And bleeding.

It’s riveting testimony. The media are typing as if their lives depend on it. The cable guys are running the full hearing. And ordinary people are watching, because it’s not every day you see a member of a government strafe its leadership. Strafe you.

Only strafe isn’t the word. It’s more of a shiv. There is no emotion or hysteria. There is ice in Jody Wilson-Raybould’s veins and a steely determination as she coolly, calmly and credibly outlines the myriad ways your political and bureaucratic apparatus attempted to impress upon her independent mind the need to have another think on SNC, despite her repeated attempts to everyone—including you—that her thinking on the matter was all done.

You’re watching this all go down, and it is devastating. Your government is in peril. You’re in peril. You’re staring a return to your career of part-time drama teaching right in the face.

And so you decide it’s time to fight back. Because the cast of fifth-rate clowns you sent to fill the Liberal seats at the justice committee certainly didn’t do any fighting back. They not only missed the grenades, they picked them up, played with them, and then didn’t even realize when they went off in their faces.

But that’s all right. You’re Justin Trudeau. Mr. Sunny Ways. Mr. Hope and Hard Work. You got this. So you wheel yourself out to ‘push back’ against Wilson-Raybould’s allegations.

Only you don’t push back.

You don’t counter Wilson-Raybould’s facts and recollections with any of your own. You don’t dispute what was said, even about your alleged direct personal involvement, other than to say you disagree with Wilson-Raybould’s “characterization” of events.

And it stinks.

It stinks as you moan about a difficult couple of weeks because of “internal disagreements.” It stinks as you reference your success in making it easier to die, and your success in making it easier to get high. It stinks as you talk about your job being to stand up for jobs and pensions, to stand up for Canadians, and for Canadian workers, and all in an overly dramatic tone that suggests that no other prime minister has ever had that in their job description. It stinks as you speak about anything other than what Canadians need to hear from you.

And you say all of this nothing in front of a carefully crafted human backdrop meant to demonstrate your love of youth and diversity. Except the youth look like they’re in a hostage video (they are). Your human backdrop even includes your new MP, Rachel Bendayan, who is standing over your shoulder tonight playing the role of Huma Abedin while you step all over your wiener.

There isn’t a hint of contrition, or even a speck of responsibility for letting things get this far. No acknowledgment that Wilson-Raybould has laid out a set of serious charges that require serious answers. Your focus remains political.

When you’re asked about Andrew Scheer’s call for your resignation over the seriousness of these allegations, you mumble something about Stephen Harper being a bad man and this coming election being about a choice, blithely assuming you’ll still be in function to see it out. And when you’re asked about Wilson-Raybould remaining in the Liberal caucus, you say you will have to review her full testimony—testimony you have already dismissed, by the way—before deciding her fate, when it really should be the other way around.

The divide is at once simple and complex, logical and emotional—a fiery chasm that threatens to split our staff apart and turn us into brother soldiers on opposite sides of a bloody civil war.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that he ""definitely does not agree"" with the testimony of Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould that she faced ""constant pressure"" and ""hidden threats"" from his office, compelling her to help the Montreal engineering company SNC-Lavalin avoid a criminal trial, reports GlobalNews.

Eight top managers of SNC-Lavalin are accused of bribing foreign officials. The case was initiated by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in 2012. The main point of accusation is that the company bribed Libyan officials with the aim of obtaining multi-billion dollar contracts.

While talking to journalists in Montreal, Trudeau, who is the leader of the ruling Liberal Party of Canada, made it clear that he would not resign, despite demands from the opposition. He added that he would carefully read the allegations of the former Prosecutor General that numerous officials from his administration tried to force her to intervene to help the Montreal firm avoid criminal proceedings.

According to Wilson-Raybould's testimony, cited by AP, she asked Trudeau if he was politically interfering with her role as attorney general and told him she would strongly advise against it.

The Canadian engineering giant SNC-Lavalin is facing accusations that its former executives paid millions of dollars in bribes to win contracts in Libya under Muammar Gaddafi's rule, which collapsed in 2011.

Sears, two top political fixers, give their view of the Prime Minister’s reaction so far to Jody Wilson-Raybould’s testimony and what should come next.","“The prime minister completely blew it,” said Robin V. Sears, a long-time NDP strategist who runs Earnscliffe Strategy Group in Ottawa, one of the leading crisis-management firms in the country. “This is a moment when his integrity, his credibility, his future is on the line. To respond as arrogantly and flippantly and disrespectfully as he did tonight is not helpful.”

For decades, Watt and Sears have advised some of the most powerful companies and people around the world on how to survive public relations disasters. The veteran advisers, who regularly contribute to the Star’s Opinion section, offered their professional views of what Trudeau should have done, should have said and what he still must do to protect his office and the Liberal party in the wake of the SNC-Lavalin scandal.

“You can see the hand of Justice Cromwell crafting her remarks,” Watt said. “He writes beautifully. Because she was so direct, I think she has created a problem for the prime minister. And the government will need to answer with equal clarity.”

Watt praised Wilson-Raybould’s lawyer — retired Supreme Court judge Thomas Cromwell — for bringing “extremely compelling” clarity to the former justice minister’s address to the Commons committee regarding the Prime Minister’s Office’s role in mediating criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin.

“Here is a woman who is rising in public esteem daily and took a huge leap by virtue of her testimony today,” Sears said. “Trudeau reacted by appearing as if he were celebrating a byelection victory. It was just bizarre. It was tone deaf.”

What Raybould-Wilson told the House of Commons’ justice commitee about the pressure and persistent “veiled threats” she faced from Trudeau’s top officials is “profoundly critical of the character of this government,” Sears said.

Such a serious accusation demands a thoughtful response.

“Her case is pretty hard to challenge on the merits,” Sears said. “All that pressure from all those people over all that period of time — it’s hard to deny it was inappropriate. He should have said ‘I’m going to read my former attorney general’s remarks with care overnight and I’ll have a detailed reaction in the morning, but my initial reaction is I take a different view than she does about the degree to which she felt pressured.’ ”

3. Resist the urge to spin platitudes

It’s common for leaders in crisis to retreat to their “comfort zones” when they’re under public fire during a crisis, as Trudeau did during his late-night scrum with reporters in Montreal. But rattling off a series of “bumper-sticker” quotes is no way to do damage control, Watt said.

“The way they have to put their case forward is with no funny business. This is a time when spin and prevarication and the usual kind of rhetoric will be very ineffective at countering her. They actually have to employ legal-style communications, not just political-style communications if they’re going to bat down each of the points she made.”

4. Location, location, location

What Trudeau decides to say next is as important as where he says it.

“I think they would want to match the formalness of the setting (Wilson-Raybould) had,” Watt said, noting Trudeau has a few natural options. He could issue a statement in the House or the National Press Theatre or secure national television time to directly address the entire country. Watt said a formal television address is the way to go.

“She raised the stakes on this to a level of seriousness and gravity that he would have to match in his reply. These accusations go right to the heart of the integrity of the government that this requires the prime minister talking to the Canadian people.”

Sears is less specific, but agreed the Montreal scrum was a terrible move. “He should have done it in Ottawa. He should have done it outside the prime minister’s office.”

Sears said he thinks Trudeau has time to recover “tomorrow or later, but he’s got to show that he takes this seriously.” That message could resonate through an exclusive interview Trudeau could offer to a member of the media. “He needs to just talk about it; weigh the challenges a case like this presents between his obligation to be a champion of an important company on the one hand and on the other, how hard that is to navigate and how seriously he takes that. Something like that would help restore some perception that he understands that Canadians are not impressed by him claiming he did everything right when he didn’t.”

5. Another top Liberal official will need to fall

The resignation of Trudeau’s Principal Secretary, Gerald Butts, will not be enough to show the public that the federal government understands the magnitude of Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, Watt and Sears agreed.

Watt wouldn’t speculate on whose head would fall next, but Sears has a prediction based on Wilson-Raybould’s testimony.

“I think the clerk’s position (Michael Wernick) is pretty fragile,” he said. “Not only his testimony before the committee the other day, but the role he played that Jody outlined is pretty troubling. Political staff people misbehave, but the Clerk of the Privy Council is not expected to play that role.”

India acknowledged one of its air force planes was ""lost"" in skirmishes with Pakistan and that its pilot was ""missing in action"" on a chaotic day, which also saw mortar shells fired by Indian troops from across the frontier dividing the two sectors of Kashmir kill six civilians and wound several others.

A helicopter crash in the region also killed six Indian air force officials and a civilian on the ground.

The aircraft went down Wednesday morning in Kashmir, a mountainous region claimed by both India and Pakistan since almost immediately after their creation in 1947. One of the downed planes crashed in Pakistan's part of Kashmir while the other went down in an Indian-controlled section of the Himalayan region, Pakistan's army spokesperson Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor said.

Pakistan's ministry of information and broadcasting released what it says is the wreckage of the Indian planes.

Despite Geneva Convention rules prohibiting the public display of prisoners, the military circulated a video of the Indian pilot, who was recorded saying he was being well treated. He also praised Pakistan's military.

The pilot was injured and was being treated at a military hospital, Ghafoor said. He did not elaborate beyond saying the pilots were being ""treated well"" and made no mention of them being returned to India.

""We have no intention of escalation, but are fully prepared to do so if forced into that paradigm,"" Ghafoor said.

'Wars are full of miscalculation'

Tuesday's pre-dawn strike by India was its first inside of Pakistan since the two nations' 1971 war over territory that later became Bangladesh. Pakistan had said that Indian warplanes dropped bombs near the Pakistani town of Balakot but there were no casualties.

The violence Wednesday marked the most serious escalation of the long-simmering conflict since 1999, when Pakistan's military sent a ground force into Indian-controlled Kashmir at Kargil. That year also saw an Indian fighter jet shoot down a Pakistani naval aircraft, killing all 16 on board.

Residents on both sides of the de-facto frontier, the so-called Line of Control, said there were exchanges of fire between the two sides through the night into Wednesday morning. Hundreds of villagers fled border towns in both India and Pakistan.

Within hours of the incident, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan went on television urging peace talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

""History tells us that wars are full of miscalculation. My question is that given the weapons we have, can we afford miscalculation?"" Khan said during a brief televised broadcast to the nation. ""We should sit down and talk.""

There was no reply from Modi.

An Indian foreign ministry spokesperson said Indian planes engaged with the Pakistan aircraft and brought one of them down.

""In this engagement, we have unfortunately lost one MiG 21. The pilot is missing in action. Pakistan has claimed that he is in their custody. We are ascertaining the facts,"" Raveesh Kumar told reporters.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke separately with the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan and urged them to avoid ""further military activity"" following Tuesday's air strike.

""I expressed to both ministers that we encourage India and Pakistan to exercise restraint, and avoid escalation at any

cost,"" Pompeo said in a statement on Wednesday. ""I also encouraged both ministers to prioritize direct communication and avoid further military activity.""

Both China and the European Union have also called for restraint.

Meanwhile, the hashtag #SayNoToWar emerged on social media, with citizens of both countries calling for peace.

Airspace closed

Pakistan's civil aviation authority said it shut Pakistani airspace to all commercial flights on Wednesday, without elaborating or indicating when flights might resume.

Indian news reports said airports in the Indian portion of Kashmir closed for civilian traffic shortly after the air force jet crashed. The Press Trust of India news agency said these airports were located at Srinagar, Jammu and Leh.

Indian administrator Baseer Khan confirmed that the airport in Srinagar, the main city in Indian-controlled Kashmir, was closed and said it was a ""temporary and precautionary measure.""

Indian police also said officials recovered six bodies from the wreckage of an Indian air force helicopter that crashed in Indian-controlled sector of Kashmir.

Senior police officer Munir Ahmed Khan said the chopper crashed close to an airport on Wednesday in Budgam area, in the outskirts of the region's main city of Srinagar. The Srinagar airport is also an air force station.

Police said they were still going through the wreckage and did not immediately identify the victims.

Eyewitnesses said soldiers fired warning shots into the air to keep residents away from the crash site.

Meanwhile, as the tensions and confrontation escalated between India and Pakistan, authorities asked workers to paint rooftops of hospitals and clinics in red and white with a medical emblem of a cross in Srinagar city.

Meanwhile, the foreign ministry in Islamabad said the country's air force was carrying out airstrikes Wednesday from within Pakistani airspace across the disputed Kashmir boundary but that this was not in ""retaliation to continued Indian belligerence.""

Ghafoor, the Pakistani military spokesperson, said the strikes were aimed at ""avoiding human loss and collateral damage.""

According to local Pakistani police official Mohammad Altaf, the six fatalities in the Indian shelling earlier on Wednesday included children. The shells hit the village of Kotli in Pakistan's section of Kashmir.

Kashmir is split between Pakistan and India and claimed by both in its entirety. Though Pakistani and Indian troops in Kashmir often trade fire, the latest casualties came a day after tensions escalated sharply following a pre-dawn airstrike and incursion by India that New Delhi said targeted a terrorist training camp in northwestern Pakistan.

The latest wave of tensions between Pakistan and India first erupted after Jaish-e-Mohammad claimed responsibility for the Feb. 14 suicide bombing of a convoy of India's paramilitary forces in the Indian portion of Kashmir that killed 40 Indian troops.

Pakistan has said it was not involved in the attack and was ready to help New Delhi in the investigations.","'Extremely dangerous': Pakistan claims it shot down 2 Indian planes, captured pilot",CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/india-pakistan-pilot-planes-saynotowar-1.5035093

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke separately with the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan and urged them to avoid ""further military activity"" following Tuesday's air strike.

""I expressed to both ministers that we encourage India and Pakistan to exercise restraint, and avoid escalation at any

cost,"" Pompeo said in a statement on Wednesday. ""I also encouraged both ministers to prioritize direct communication and avoid further military activity.""

Both China and the European Union have also called for restraint.

Meanwhile, the hashtag #SayNoToWar emerged on social media, with citizens of both countries calling for peace.

Airspace closed

Pakistan's civil aviation authority said it shut Pakistani airspace to all commercial flights on Wednesday, without elaborating or indicating when flights might resume.

Indian news reports said airports in the Indian portion of Kashmir closed for civilian traffic shortly after the air force jet crashed. The Press Trust of India news agency said these airports were located at Srinagar, Jammu and Leh.

Indian administrator Baseer Khan confirmed that the airport in Srinagar, the main city in Indian-controlled Kashmir, was closed and said it was a ""temporary and precautionary measure.""

Indian police also said officials recovered six bodies from the wreckage of an Indian air force helicopter that crashed in Indian-controlled sector of Kashmir.

Senior police officer Munir Ahmed Khan said the chopper crashed close to an airport on Wednesday in Budgam area, in the outskirts of the region's main city of Srinagar. The Srinagar airport is also an air force station.

Police said they were still going through the wreckage and did not immediately identify the victims.

Eyewitnesses said soldiers fired warning shots into the air to keep residents away from the crash site.

Meanwhile, as the tensions and confrontation escalated between India and Pakistan, authorities asked workers to paint rooftops of hospitals and clinics in red and white with a medical emblem of a cross in Srinagar city.

Meanwhile, the foreign ministry in Islamabad said the country's air force was carrying out airstrikes Wednesday from within Pakistani airspace across the disputed Kashmir boundary but that this was not in ""retaliation to continued Indian belligerence.""

Ghafoor, the Pakistani military spokesperson, said the strikes were aimed at ""avoiding human loss and collateral damage.""

According to local Pakistani police official Mohammad Altaf, the six fatalities in the Indian shelling earlier on Wednesday included children. The shells hit the village of Kotli in Pakistan's section of Kashmir.

Kashmir is split between Pakistan and India and claimed by both in its entirety. Though Pakistani and Indian troops in Kashmir often trade fire, the latest casualties came a day after tensions escalated sharply following a pre-dawn airstrike and incursion by India that New Delhi said targeted a terrorist training camp in northwestern Pakistan.

The latest wave of tensions between Pakistan and India first erupted after Jaish-e-Mohammad claimed responsibility for the Feb. 14 suicide bombing of a convoy of India's paramilitary forces in the Indian portion of Kashmir that killed 40 Indian troops.

Pakistan has said it was not involved in the attack and was ready to help New Delhi in the investigations.","'Extremely dangerous': Pakistan claims it shot down 2 Indian planes, captured pilot",CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/extremely-dangerous-pakistan-claims-it-shot-down-2-indian-planes-captured-pilot-1.5035093

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has denied wrongdoing after he tried to shield one of the country's biggest firms from a corruption trial.

Mr Trudeau said any lobbying by him or his inner circle for engineering giant SNC-Lavalin was done to protect jobs.

In explosive testimony, ex-Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould said she faced ""sustained"" pressure to abandon prosecution of the Quebec-based firm.

Opposition Conservatives are calling on the Liberal PM to resign.

They are also demanding a public inquiry following Ms Wilson-Raybould's testimony on Wednesday before the Commons justice committee in Ottawa.

How did Trudeau defend himself?

Speaking to reporters on Thursday morning, Mr Trudeau said he disagreed with his former justice minister's ""characterisation"" of events and maintained his staff followed the rules.

The prime minster said he had full confidence in an inquiry by a parliamentary justice committee into the affair and in an investigation by the federal ethics commissioner, and would ""participate fully"" in that process.

Opposition parties have been ramping up pressure on the prime minister and the Conservatives have said the Royal Canadian Mounted Police must immediately open an investigation.

Mr Trudeau said that to his knowledge no member of his staff has been contacted by the RCMP.

The prime minster has insisted for weeks that all communications between himself, federal officials and Ms Wilson-Raybould were above board.

He says that any advocacy for SNC-Lavalin was done in the interest of protecting Canadian jobs that no lines were crossed.

What does the ex-justice minister allege?

Ms Wilson-Raybould told the justice committee on Wednesday she had faced attempts at interference and ""veiled threats"" from top government officials seeking a legal favour for the Montreal construction firm.

The former justice minister and attorney general said she and her staff endured four months - between last September and December - of a ""sustained"" and ""inappropriate effort"" to push for a possible deferred prosecution agreement for the construction company.

That agreement would have allowed the firm to avoid a criminal trial and instead agree to alternative terms or conditions, like penalties or enhanced compliance measures.

Ms Wilson-Raybould said that while some discussions about the ramifications of the decision were normal, the pressure went well beyond what was appropriate given her role as attorney general.

In Canada, an attorney general is supposed to act independently with respect of his or her prosecutorial function and decisions are not supposed to be politically motivated.

Ms Wilson-Raybould said that in various meetings, Mr Trudeau and senior staff repeatedly raised concerns about the possibility of job losses and potential political ramifications of a trial.

She said she had made clear she was not prepared to help the company avoid a trial and that she believes it was why she was demoted in a Cabinet shuffle in January, which Mr Trudeau denies.

Ms Wilson-Raybould also said during her testimony she did not believe any laws were broken.

What is SNC-Lavalin accused of?

The company and two of its subsidiaries face fraud and corruption charges in relation to about C$48m ($36m; £28m) in bribes it is alleged to have offered to Libyan officials between 2001-11.

The firm has openly lobbied to be allowed to enter into a remediation agreement instead of going to trial, saying it has cleaned house and changed its ways.

SNC-Lavalin and its supporters say it would be unfair to penalise the company as a whole and its thousands of employees for the wrongdoings of former executives.

Preliminary hearings have begun and the company says it will ""vigorously defend itself"" against the allegations.

A conviction on fraud and corruption charges could result in a decade-long ban on bidding on federal contracts, which would be a major financial hit for the firm.

What's the company background?

SNC-Lavalin is one of the world's largest engineering and construction companies and employs some 9,000 people in Canada.

The firm has deep roots in the vote-rich province of Quebec, which is expected to be a battleground in this October's general election.

This is not the first time SNC-Lavalin has found itself in trouble.

In 2016, the agency that oversees Canadian federal elections said former executives had devised a scheme to illegally donate C$118,000 to the federal Liberals and Conservatives between 2004-11. The bulk of the funds went to the prime minister's Liberal Party.

In 2013, the World Bank barred the firm and its affiliates for up to 10 years from bidding on contracts with the agency for ""misconduct"" in a bridge contract in Bangladesh, the longest debarment period ever handed down in a settlement.

How bad is this for Trudeau?

Political commentators suggest Ms Wilson-Raybould's remarks are deeply damaging for Mr Trudeau and the Liberals.

Writing in the Toronto Star, columnist Chantal Hebert says the prime minister was ""already up to his neck in the SNC-Lavalin mess"".

""On Wednesday, former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould pushed his head down further. It will be harder for the Liberal government to dig itself out of the deep hole she dug before the next campaign.""

In the National Post, columnist Andrew Coyne said Ms Wilson-Raybould's testimony suggested ""an attitude that appears to pervade this government: that the law is not an institution to be revered, but just another obstacle to get around, by whatever means necessary.""

Columnist Patrick Lagace, writing in Montreal newspaper La Presse, said her remarks suggest that ""for the Prime Minister and people acting on his orders, the rule of law and the independence of the Attorney General were at least negotiable"".

In Maclean's magazine, Paul Wells suggests her remarks reveal a ""sickeningly smug protection racket whose participants must have been astonished when she refused to play along"".",SNC-Lavalin: Trudeau denies wrongdoing in corruption case,BBC News,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47362657

Ex-Attorney General Jody Wils…,"TORONTO (AP) — Canada’s former attorney general is expected to testify Wednesday about whether she was inappropriately pressured by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office to avoid prosecuting a major Canadian engineering company.

Ex-Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould has said she wants to tell “her truth” and she will speak at a hearing of the Parliament justice committee.

Trudeau’s government has been on the defensive since the Globe and Mail newspaper reported Feb. 7 that Trudeau or his staff pressured Wilson-Raybould last year to try to avoid a criminal prosecution of Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin over allegations of corruption involving government contracts in Libya. Critics say that would be improper political meddling in a legal case.

The scandal has been a significant blow to Trudeau, who is facing an election this year. Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s closet adviser, resigned last week but denied that he or anyone else pressured Wilson-Raybould. Michael Wernick, the top civil servant in the government, has also said that no inappropriate pressure was put on Wilson-Raybould and that Trudeau repeatedly assured Wilson-Raybould the decision on the SNC-Lavalin prosecution was hers alone.

Wilson-Raybould resigned from the Cabinet on Feb. 12 as veteran affairs minister but gave no reasons. She had been demoted from justice minister last month, and was furious, releasing a 2,000-word statement after that.

The Globe and Mail’s report this month said Trudeau’s office pressured her to instruct the director of public prosecutions to negotiate a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin. The agreement would have allowed the company to pay reparations but avoid a criminal trial on charges of corruption and bribery.

If convicted criminally, the company would be banned from receiving any federal government business for a decade. SNC-Lavalin is a major employer in Quebec, with about 3,400 employees in the province, 9,000 employees in Canada and more than 50,000 worldwide.

Trudeau largely waived lawyer-client privilege to allow Wilson-Raybould to speak and said Tuesday that he’s “pleased” she will get that opportunity.

Wilson-Raybould accepted the committee’s invitation to testify but complained in a letter to the justice committee that the waiver does not release her to talk about any communications she had after she was named minister of veteran affairs or her resignation from the Cabinet.

Today is the day that Jody Wilson-Raybould finally speaks about what transpired between her, the prime minister, and his senior-most staffers over the SNC-Lavalin affair.

A win for the U.S. at the summit with North Korea may not be a win for America's allies in the region.

Michael Cohen's testimony in Washington today is clearly top of mind for President Trump at his summit in Hanoi.

D-Day for JWR

It's fairly rare that politicians become well-known enough to be referred to only by their initials.

Like FDR, or PET, DSK, or just plain-old W.

But Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former federal justice minister and attorney general, may already have joined those ranks.

Today is the day that JWR finally speaks (out loud in public, at least) about what transpired between her, the prime minister, and his senior-most staffers over the SNC-Lavalin affair.

It has been just 20 days since the Globe and Mail published its anonymously sourced article suggesting that Wilson-Raybould felt she had been improperly pressured to intervene in the prosecution of the Quebec engineering and construction giant, and subsequently demoted to a lesser cabinet portfolio after she refused.

Over that period, Wilson-Raybould has spoken mostly through her silence, first refusing to answer questions on the basis of solicitor-client privilege, and then resigning from cabinet ""with a heavy heart,"" but no additional details.

Justin Trudeau has spent the past three weeks trying to put out the flames.

He has denied any wrongdoing, as has Gerald Butts, his closest friend and advisor, who resigned from the PMO in the ""best interests of the office and its important work.""

Since then, Wilson-Raybould has addressed a closed-door meeting of her former cabinet colleagues, and has told the House of Commons of her desire for an opportunity to ""speak my truth"" about the allegations.

She has sought legal advice from a former justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, and obtained a waiver, via a special order in council, that expressly allows her to share all cabinet ""confidences"" regarding her discussions about the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

However, the authority does not extend to her communications with Kathleen Roussel, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the woman who made the call to forge ahead with the SNC-Lavalin case last October, rejecting the company's bid to avoid possible criminal sanction via a remediation agreement.

Wilson-Raybould will open her testimony to the House of Commons Justice Committee late this afternoon with an extra-long, half-hour opening statement to offer her ""best recollection of all the relevant communications,"" and will stick around as long as there are questions.

But it surely won't be enough to extinguish the controversy, given her claims that she still can't speak fully and freely about her demotion, resignation, or what she said to her former cabinet colleagues during the private Feb. 19 meeting.

The three weeks of wall-to-wall coverage of the affair is clearly weighing down the Trudeau government.

Five of the six opinion surveys that have been taken since the news broke show that the Liberals have slipped to second place in voter intentions.

And CBC's aggregated Poll Tracker now has the federal Conservatives sitting almost two points up on the Liberals, with 35.8 per cent support compared to 33.9 per cent.

The fall 2019 election is still 235 days away, sufficient time for the Liberals to put the affair behind them.

But that all depends on what JWR plans to say.

North Korea's upper hand

A win for the U.S. at the summit with North Korea may not be a win for America's allies in the region, producer Anand Ram writes.

Between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, there are nine years of experience leading a country. Seven of those are Kim's.

While Trump hopes the meetings that kicked off today in Vietnam will be ""equal or greater than the first"" summit last June, some who have been watching North Korea's closed-off dictatorship for decades say the dealmaker-in-chief might not have the upper hand going in.

That's more than a little concerning to North Korea's neighbours, since what Trump may want to negotiate may not make them any safer from a North Korean attack, nuclear or otherwise.

The National recently spoke to Naoko Aoki, the Stanton Nuclear Security Fellow at the Rand Corporation and a former journalist with Japan's Kyodo News agency, about the regional dynamics at play in Hanoi. Here are excerpts from the interview:

President Trump famously tweeted after the first summit in Singapore that there is ""no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea"" — is that true?

Naoko Aoki: I do not think that the North Korean nuclear threat has been reduced in any significant way.

When you think about the North Korean nuclear threat, I think it's useful to think about three elements. One, the North Koreans' ability to make fuel for nuclear weapons. The second is existing nuclear weapons, the ones that they've already built. And the third is their delivery systems — so these are missiles.

North Korea said in April, before the [first] summit, that it will no longer test nuclear weapons and missiles. And it has kept to this promise. But [all it] does is it prevents them from improving their existing missiles and nuclear weapons. It does nothing to reduce the number they already have.

In fact, they are not under explicit obligation to stop producing fuel for nuclear weapons.

Naoko Aoki is a Stanton Nuclear Security Fellow at the RAND Corporation whose research includes security issues in the Asia-Paciic region with a focus on North Korea. (CBC)

Does the threat differ depending on where you live?

Aoki: Yes, I think so. The threat looks very different in Asia.

[Regarding] the United States, the North Koreans tested their most powerful missile in late 2017 and then declared that it could hit anywhere in the United States with a nuclear-tipped missile. But there's some question as to whether they can really do that reliably.

Whereas in Asia, there are many places in the region they can hit — including U.S. allies South Korea, Japan and U.S. bases in the region — with nuclear-tipped missiles.

One of those allies is Japan. What are some of its concerns going into the summit, and what would a good outcome look like?

Aoki: Japan has two major policy goals for North Korea.

One is to solve a dispute with North Korea over the kidnapping of Japanese nationals in the 1970s and 1980s. This is a very emotional issue for Japan, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said repeatedly that this is a policy priority.

The second issue is the nuclear threat. Japan wants a solution to the nuclear problem, too. So for this summit, anything that promotes a solution — or rather, moves a step closer to the solution — to either of those or preferably both of those policy goals will be a good outcome for Japan.

What would a bad outcome look like?

Aoki: This North Korea/U.S. process is probably going to be a step-by-step process. So that means you cannot, or probably can't, solve everything all at once. Something has to be prioritized.

And if the United States prioritizes, for example, the dismantlement of the long-range missiles that would reach the United States and capping the production of fuel for nuclear weapons, that would not really reduce the nuclear threat to Japan, because North Korea would still be able to hit Japan with nuclear-tipped missiles.

What would you like to see come out of this summit?

Aoki: I think a positive outcome would involve two elements, in my mind. One is an agreement on a longer-term workable framework toward denuclearization, and the narrowing of the gap between the two countries over the term 'denuclearization.' They mean different things [to both sides].

The second element includes concrete steps. The June summit produced a joint statement that was very vague and aspirational, but that did not lead to substantive denuclearization steps by North Korea. So I will be looking at whether this summit — the summit in Hanoi — will produce more tangible steps.

Watch as Adrienne Arsenault tackles the question ""Is the North Korea threat over?"" on The National:

North Korea has not conducted a single nuclear test in well over a year. After the first summit Trump tweeted: ""There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea."" But is he right? 2:04

Political panel

President Trump is in Hanoi, but Michael Cohen's testimony in Washington today is clearly top of mind for him, writes producer Tarannum Kamlani.

Con Man. Cheat. Racist.

These words are how many of Donald J. Trump's enemies have described him since he began his rise to the Presidency. But these epithets also formed part of the highly anticipated testimony by the President's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen before the U.S. Congress today.

Cohen's opening remarks were leaked to the media overnight and set the stage for some fireworks on Capitol Hill.

Cohen is set to go to prison in a couple of months for lying to Congress. Republicans have used this to try and discredit him, dismissing his testimony as part of a grudge against Trump.

Central logical problem for Rep Jordan <a href=""https://t.co/r9KTdHfaOP"">https://t.co/r9KTdHfaOP</a> —@davidfrum

Cohen's testimony is clearly on the President's mind as he engages in some international diplomacy with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un in Hanoi.

He was reportedly up all night tweeting, among them this one: ""Michael Cohen was one of many lawyers who represented me (unfortunately). He had other clients also. He was just disbarred by the State Supreme Court for lying & fraud. He did bad things unrelated to Trump. He is lying in order to reduce his prison time. Using Crooked's lawyer!""

In Hanoi, meanwhile, Trump's attempted charm offensive was on full display. The President told Kim, ""I think your country has tremendous economic potential, unbelievable, unlimited. I think that you will have a tremendous future for your country, you're a great leader, and I look forward to watching it happen and helping it to happen.""

Stakes are high for both leaders as the summit gets underway. Kim wants the U.S. to ease sanctions and build up his country's devastated economy. For his part, Trump has tried to win over Kim by stating that there is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea, contradicting his own top diplomats.

Making sense of it all is The National's U.S. political panel tonight with Adrienne Arsenault. She's joined by Jai Chabria, Republican strategist and former chief of staff to ex-Ohio Governor John Kasich, and Stefanie Brown-James, co-founder of Collective PAC and member of President Obama's 2012 re-election campaign, who will offer a view from the Democrats. The CBC's Keith Boag will also weigh in from Washington, D.C. Hope you'll join us!

362,Empty,2019-02-27T01:44:23Z,"The former attorney general will testify before the Commons justice committee Wednesday, responding to allegations she was pressured by the Prime Minister’s Office to intervene in criminal proceedings against SNC-Lavalin.","In the face of Wilson-Raybould’s claim on the eve of her testimony that she still cannot talk freely because of restrictions Trudeau has kept in place, the prime minister defended the waiver his government granted to allow her to speak.

OTTAWA—Prime Minister Justin Trudeau insisted Wednesday Jody Wilson-Raybould can tell her story in a way that settles once and for all whether or not anyone in his office pressured her to drop criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin.

For many Liberal MPs and cabinet ministers who have heard her concerns in private, it won’t change their minds and they hope it won’t change much for Canadians.

Wilson-Raybould, his former attorney-general, has got a story to tell. That much we know.

“The approach that we are taking both in the Ethics Committee and the Justice Committee is looking into the issue of whether or not the Attorney General underwent pressure or inappropriate pressure and she will be able to speak fully.”

This is a sacrosanct principle in Canada’s legal system. It means prosecutors make decisions on who to prosecute and how to apply the law free from partisan or political influence. It ensures everyone is equal under the law, and the criminal law will be applied equally to accused persons or corporations, no matter how much money or influence they have.

But to tease out answers that will tell a fuller picture — one that will be judged by legal, not just political standards — MPs will have to bear in mind some big principles at play when Wilson-Raybould finally takes a seat, and ask her probing questions even though she still complains she is not fully free to, as she put it, “speak (her) truth.”

As all eyes turn to the Commons justice committee Wednesday afternoon, the biggest questions are simple: was Wilson-Raybould pressed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau or his officials to drop charges against SNC-Lavalin and cut a deal? Did she feel unduly pressured? If so, why didn’t she resign in protest as attorney general at any point? If not, why then did she resign from cabinet as veterans affairs minister on Feb. 11?

“What Canadians want is information and perspectives,” said International Trade Minister Jim Carr. “Canadians ultimately will be the judge of the issue and I’m satisfied and confident that that will be good for the government and our party.”

The questions here for Wilson-Raybould boil down to what was her view of the prosecution underway? Did she have a preferred course, or did she leave the decision entirely to Kathleen Roussel, her deputy attorney general and the independent director of public prosecutions? And did Wilson-Raybould regard Roussel’s decision — conveyed on Sept. 4 to the company — not to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement with SNC-Lavalin as final?

Yet even before Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, academics suggested there was a “troubling” pattern of PMO meetings with Wilson-Raybould under the guise that “robust” and “vigorous” discussions were permissible.

Deferred Prosecution Agreements

Also called remediation agreements, the government introduced these as tool to prosecute white-collar crime to the Canadian justice system in 2018 after public consultations. Subject to a court’s approval, a deferred prosecution agreement spares an accused company a formal criminal conviction that could see it debarred from future contracts in exchange for paying heavy fines, and being required to comply with ethical reforms and independent oversight.

But Wilson-Raybould as justice minister did not sponsor the change to the criminal code. Why was it instead stuffed into an omnibus budget implementation bill?

Was Wilson-Raybould aware of the SNC-Lavalin lobbying blitz to persuade Ottawa to make it the first test case, and grant it a deferred prosecution on bribery and fraud charges?

Did she fear it would set a bad precedent to give a deal to a company that has broken political financing rules and saw former executives plead guilty to bribery in a Montreal hospital construction project? When did she first communicate the DPP’s prosecution decision to the PMO or cabinet and what was the PMO’s reaction?

And a key question for the former justice minister is whether she agrees with Michael Wernick, Canada’s top civil servant, who said the prosecution decision was Wilson-Raybould’s and that decision was “still open” for her to intervene and possibly overrule months afterward, despite the fact the preliminary inquiry on bribery and fraud charges began Oct. 29? Does she agree with Wernick that the decision is still an option “open” to her successor, Justice Minister David Lametti? Does that amount to intervening to stop a criminal trial?

Jody Wilson-Raybould set to speak about SNC-Lavalin affair

Opinion | Susan Delacourt: Justin Trudeau is following instead of leading on SNC-Lavalin

Discussions with attorney general about SNC-Lavalin were ‘troubling,’ legal expert says

The Meetings

We know of four times that Trudeau or his aides met with Wilson-Raybould or her staff, first in September and then a flurry of meetings in December. We don’t know if they were the only times it was raised with her, the tenor of the discussions, or even why SNC-Lavalin was raised.

Now it will be important for MPs to drill down to the purpose of the meetings and their tone.

Does Wilson-Raybould view these meetings as inappropriate? And if Wilson-Raybould felt she was being pressured on the file, did she view it as “undue” or “inappropriate” and why? Did Wilson-Raybould ever advise the prime minister or any of his officials that they were either dangerously close to or had crossed a line in talking to her about the SNC-Lavalin charges? If not, why not?

This is a critical question at the heart of these allegations.

One of those participants, Trudeau’s principal secretary Gerald Butts resigned last week although he insists there was nothing wrong with his or the PMO’s interactions with Wilson-Raybould. But Michael Wernick and Trudeau’s chief of staff Katie Telford remain in their posts.

Wilson-Raybould’s recollections of all these meetings could raise uncomfortable questions for those two.

Cabinet solidarity

Trudeau said publicly that if anyone including his former justice minister had felt “undue pressure or felt that we were not living up to our own high standards of defence of the rule of law and our judicial system and judicial independence, it was their responsibility to come forward and at no time in the fall did the former attorney general come forward to me.”

Mary-Ellen Turpel-Lafond, a former judge, law professor and now practising lawyer, testified in fact that Wilson-Raybould in her role as chief prosecutor of Canada had a legal obligation to stand her ground, face those who would pressure her and not resign — if indeed she was pressured.

Other legal experts such as UBC assistant law professor Andrew Flavelle Martin have argued if Wilson-Raybould was pressured she had a duty to step down and publicly expose the reason why.

This too is a key question. Why didn’t Wilson-Raybould resign at any point prior to February to protest any interference or attempted interference at all in a criminal prosecution?

Wilson-Raybould remained in cabinet even after Trudeau shuffled her out of her job as attorney general and justice minister. We don’t know what Trudeau told her as the reason she was being moved, whether she bought his explanation, or viewed it as a demotion. We do know she appeared to do a slow burn at the cabinet shuffle, and later that day released a 2,000-word statement touting her achievements as justice minister and underlining the need for “our system of justice be free from even the perception of political interference.”

So what reason did Wilson-Raybould give the prime minister when she finally resigned on Feb. 11 after the prime minister touted her continued presence in cabinet as evidence that the cabinet was united?

Was it principle or petulance that lay behind her decisions?

Government’s version of events, Shawcross doctrine and caucus solidarity

From the first day the allegations broke on Feb. 7 in the Globe and Mail, Trudeau branded them as “false” and said there was no undue influence exerted on Wilson-Raybould.

Trudeau and his cabinet ministers have tried to continue that narrative since then, but explanations have evolved as details of meetings emerged.

Wernick called all discussions with Wilson-Raybould “lawful advocacy.” So just what does Wilson-Raybould think of the Liberal government’s reliance on the so-called “Shawcross doctrine” to pursue what it admits were “vigorous” discussions with her? That is a concept imported from the U.K. which suggests that cabinet members can have robust discussions about what constitutes the public interest in a prosecution without crossing any lines.

A final key question — and one that could influence whether Wilson-Raybould remains in Liberal caucus as she has done to now — is how Wilson-Raybould’s recollections mesh with the government’s line.

Justin Trudeau's right-hand-man says the prime minister did nothing improper as a deepening political crisis threatens the government's re-election chances. Here's what you need to know.

In a nutshell

Mr Trudeau has been accused of pressuring his former attorney general to cut a deal with a company facing corruption charges - and retaliating when she refused to play ball.

The revelations could cost Trudeau the October general election, some pundits say.

The former AG, Jody Wilson-Raybould, says Trudeau and his staff spent months trying to convince her that taking the company to trial would cost Canadians jobs, and their party votes.

She also says she was subject to ""veiled threats"", which she believes were made good when she was shuffled out of her department.

Now another minister, Jane Philpott, has quit saying it was ""untenable"" for her to continue due to ""serious concerns"" raised by the case.

But Gerald Butts, Mr Trudeau's former principal secretary, says there was no political pressure - only concerns for how the prosecution could affect local economies.

Who are the players?

The spurned ex-minister: Jody Wilson-Raybould was Canada's attorney general and justice minister. Unlike in the UK, the two roles are held by the same person.

She was also Canada's first indigenous justice minister and worked on a number of pieces of landmark legislation, including legalising cannabis and assisted dying.

In January, she was shuffled from the justice department to the department of veterans' affairs - a move many saw as a demotion.

The corporation: SNC-Lavalin is one of the world's largest engineering and construction companies.

The company faces fraud and corruption charges in relation to approximately C$48m ($36m; £28m) in bribes it is alleged to have offered to Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011, when Muammar Gaddafi was in power.

The firm has openly lobbied to be allowed to enter into a remediation agreement instead of going to trial, saying it has cleaned house and changed its ways.

The PM: Justin Trudeau is Canada's prime minister. He won a majority government in 2015 on a platform of transparency, gender equality and a commitment to reconciliation with Canada's indigenous peoples.

He faces a federal election in October 2019.

The Trudeau ally who quit: Jane Philpott is described as one of his most trusted ministers.

But her resignation statement explaining why she was quitting as Treasury Board president could not have been more pointed.

Citing the SNC-Lavallin affair, she said: ""I must abide by my core values, my ethical responsibilities, constitutional obligations. There can be a cost to acting on one's principles, but there is a bigger cost to abandoning them.""

Trudeau's right-hand man: Gerald Butts has been described as the ""most important Liberal in Canada today"" whose last name is not ""Trudeau"". But all that changed in February, when Mr Butts resigned amid rumours he had pressured the justice minister to cut a deal with SNC-Lavalin.

Mr Butts is one of Mr Trudeau's closest allies, and the two have been friends since their university days in Montreal.

He is credited with helping Mr Trudeau win the Liberal party leadership in 2013 and was a key architect in the Liberal party's sweeping 2015 electoral victory.

Why would Trudeau care about SNC-Lavalin?

SNC-Lavalin is based in Quebec, a swing province that has long been viewed as essential ground for the Liberal Party to win during an election - which is coming up in October.

When the Liberals win Quebec, they often win a majority of seats in parliament. When they lose, they lose badly.

At the time that Wilson-Raybould says she was being pressured to cut a deal, Quebec was also in the middle of a heated provincial election that eventually led to the ousting of Quebec Liberal premier Philippe Couillard.

Wilson-Raybould says the federal Liberal Party kept raising the Quebec election as one of the reasons why she should consider cutting a deal with SNC-Lavalin.

What does Trudeau say?

Trudeau has denied wrongdoing and says any lobbying by him or his inner circle for engineering giant SNC-Lavalin was done to protect jobs.

Speaking to reporters on Thursday morning, Mr Trudeau said he disagreed with her ""characterisation"" of events and maintained his staff followed the rules.

What could the fallout be?

Trudeau's longtime friend and principal secretary Gerald Butts has already resigned.

Many speculate that other top officials that Wilson-Raybould named may follow.

Canada's ethics commissioner is investigating Wilson-Raybould's accusations to see if any conflict-of-interest rules were broken. For her part, Wilson-Raybould says she believes no laws were broken, but that the prime minister's office acted improperly.

But the real question is what this could mean for Trudeau and his election in the fall.

Conservative leader of the opposition Andrew Scheer has already called for Trudeau's resignation, saying he no longer has the ""moral authority"" to lead.

That seems unlikely, but what is likely - at least according to columnist Chantal Hebert and other political pundits - is that ""the Liberals will likely go in the fall election campaign with the SNC-Lavalin albatross still hanging around their party's neck"".",Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould: The scandal that could unseat Canada's PM,BBC News,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47408239

It’s clear Wilson-Raybould was removed from her position as justice minister for “doing her job,” said Mary-Ellen Turpel-Lafond, a former Saskatchewan provincial court judge who currently teaches and practises law.

“It’s fair to say it’s a constitutional crisis,” Turpel-Lafond said Wednesday night, invoking a term often used to describe the breakdown of the rules underpinning a system of government. The events, as outlined by Wilson-Raybould in marathon testimony before the House of Commons justice committee, “shake the foundations of our very system,” Turpel-Lafond said. Wilson-Raybould told MPs she was repeatedly and inappropriately pressured by senior members of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s staff, as well as the country’s top bureaucrat, to cut a deal for SNC-Lavalin to avoid criminal trial on charges of fraud and corruption.

Wilson-Raybould refused, and found herself shuffled to a different cabinet portfolio in January. Former Ontario attorney general Michael Bryant agreed the scandal amounts to a constitutional crisis, saying Trudeau seems insistent on “interfering with the prosecution.”

“That conflicts with a system that requires independence from political influence. It opens the door to prosecuting enemies of the government and giving immunity to its friends which is despotic,” Bryant, who is now the executive director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, told the Star. He said the actions of the PMO, as laid out by Wilson-Raybould, undermine public faith in the independence of the judicial process. In the fallout from Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called on Trudeau and Michael Wernick, the clerk of the privy council, to resign. Irwin Cotler, a former Liberal attorney general of Canada, said he doesn’t believe Trudeau should step down or that “there was an intent on the part of the government to cross the line.” “I believe that they felt they were asking her to engage in what they believed was a matter of public policy for the importance of Canada and the importance of Quebec, jobs and the like, which she acknowledged was OK,” Cotler said. But at a minimum, Turpel-Lafond said the RCMP’s integrity section must investigate, noting that 11 highly placed people in the PMO, the public service and cabinet were named by Wilson-Raybould as lobbying her or her staff on the issue. “The consequences for that is that our reputation as a nation of the rule of law will be in tatters if we do not take steps,” Turpel-Lafond said. “And the steps need to be significant, decisive.” Alex Boutilier is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

The Liberal government has been on the defensive since Feb. 7, when the Globe and Mail said senior officials pressured Wilson-Raybould last year to help SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid a trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials and to pay a fine instead.

Wilson-Raybould - who was demoted in January and resigned from her new post this month - has not said a word so far about the affair. She will testify to the House of Commons justice committee at 3:15 p.m. ET (2015 GMT), her office said.

It is still not clear how much she will actually be able to say. Trudeau announced on Tuesday that she would be allowed to address most aspects of the case, but not all of them.

Opinion polls suggest the matter is starting to hurt the Liberals months before an October election. Trudeau and other officials insist there was no wrongdoing.

Trudeau must be very calm right now, because Liberals are nervous in the wake of Jody Wilson-Raybould’s remarkable revelations about her dealings with Trudeau and top members of his government. “It’s probably cost us the election,” one usually upbeat MP said offhandedly when asked what damage had been done by the testimony. Another MP, doing his own soundings of colleagues since Wednesday, said about one-third of the caucus is “grumbling” about Wilson-Raybould, another one-third is keeping an open mind about both sides and the last third is hoping that this episode is a corrective slap in the face for business as it has been practised in this government for the past three years. “Heads should roll,” said an MP who would put himself in that last category. Which heads? “Maybe all of them.”

The immediate Liberal communications strategy seems to revolve around having heavy-hitter cabinet ministers, such as Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland, talk to the media about how they continue to stand behind the PM. But there does not seem to be a plan to assure MPs or Liberals at large about their election prospects, apart from having Trudeau in business-as-usual mode. Trudeau himself has indeed radiated icy, almost surreal calm in media encounters after Wilson-Raybould’s testimony — even when technical glitches erupted in the midst of attempts to connect the PM with Canadian astronaut David Saint-Jacques, currently orbiting above the Earth in the International Space Station.

Yes, that really was on the prime minister’s agenda on a significant, day-after-disaster itinerary — a golden opportunity for would-be political comedians, who got to tell all kinds of jokes about who else should be hurtled into the stratosphere right now as Trudeau’s PMO is still reeling here on Earth with Wilson-Raybould’s detailed condemnations. (Insert your favourite Trudeau adviser here.) Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould may have a lot in common in times of stress. The former attorney-general sat stone-faced and calm in her front-row seat on the government benches in the Commons on Thursday as the opposition howled outrage on her behalf. It was an odd spectacle in a week filled with things we haven’t seen much around Parliament Hill.

Wilson-Raybould now has superhero powers in the eyes of the Conservatives and New Democrats, even as she continues to be a leading Liberal. She can leap tall government buildings and make herself invisible when she chooses, as she did on Thursday. Her most staunch defenders in the chamber were not the people surrounding her, but the Conservatives and New Democrats across the floor, voicing fury on her behalf at reports of how one of her own Liberal colleagues called her grievances “sour grapes.” The colleague in question is Jati Sidhu, from the B.C. riding of Mission-Matsqui-Fraser Canyon. In an interview with the Abbotsford News, Sidhu also said: “The way she’s acting, I think she couldn’t handle the stress…. I think there’s somebody else behind — maybe her father — pulling the strings.” Sidhu has since apologized, but it’s safe to say that the exasperation under his remarks is not isolated to just one MP or loyal Liberal soldier. Caucus management has never been a strong suit within Trudeau’s government; some backbenchers complain that members of the media have more regular access to the top folks in the PMO than they do.

Wilson-Raybould’s extraordinary intervention has emboldened some Liberals to declare their own dissatisfaction with PMO-MP relations — and make no mistake, Conservatives and New Democrats have picked up on those threads of dissent too, which means they’ll keep using disclosures this week to drive wedges in Liberal unity. But any clamping down on that dissent by the current PMO could backfire. What Canadians witnessed on Wednesday at a Commons committee could be seen as the direct result of keeping resentment and frustration simmering too long on the back burner.

""Canada is going to the Moon,"" Trudeau told a press conference that included a live video link from the International Space Station with Canadian astronaut David Saint-Jacques.

NASA plans to build a small space station, dubbed Gateway, in the Moon's orbit by 2026.

It will serve as a way-station for trips to and from the lunar surface, but will not be permanently crewed like the International Space Station (ISS), currently in Earth's orbit.

According to the Canadian Space Agency, Gateway will provide living space for astronauts, a docking station for visiting spacecraft and research laboratories.

Canada will develop and contribute an autonomous robotic system -- Canadarm3 -- that will be used to repair and maintain the station.

The original 15-meter remote-controlled mechanical Canadarm, also known as the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System, was used on the Space Shuttle for 30 years, deploying, capturing and repairing satellites, positioning astronauts, maintaining equipment and moving cargo.

Its successor is used on the ISS.

NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said in a statement that the organization is ""thrilled that Canada is the first international partner for the Gateway lunar outpost.""

""Our new collaboration on Gateway will enable our broader international partnership to get to the Moon and eventually to Mars,"" he said.

Trudeau also announced Can$2.05 billion (US$1.55 billion) over 24 years for Canada's space program, which will help support a push to develop new ""artificial intelligence-based technologies"" for space.

Due to communications lags between Earth and remote outposts, it will be increasingly necessary to automate many robotic functions on space stations and vehicles.

The last person to walk on the Moon was Eugene Cernan in December 1972, during the Apollo 17 mission.

Before humans set foot on the lunar surface again, NASA aims to land an unmanned vehicle on the Moon by 2024.

In dramatic testimony that lasted nearly four hours, Jody Wilson-Raybould broke her silence with a detailed account of efforts by Trudeau and top aides to persuade her to step in and end prosecution of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. She argues it amounted to interference in the judicial system, though concedes it wasn’t illegal, while Trudeau says he was trying to prevent job losses in his home province of Quebec.

“I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere,” the former attorney general said Wednesday afternoon. Wilson-Raybould, who quit cabinet this month, also said she faced “veiled threats” about what might happen if she refused to order an out-of-court settlement.

Her testimony shook the core of the Trudeau’s team, naming him, his finance chief and his most senior aides. The Conservative leader trying to unseat Trudeau in this fall’s election called for his resignation, but the prime minister stood his ground and rejected Wilson-Raybould’s version of events.

The public airing of grievances will inflame the scandal, which has driven the governing Liberals lower in national polls. The ordeal dredges up ghosts of the party’s past, which is marked by hand-in-glove ties with corporate Canada -- particularly in Quebec. The political fallout, however, is difficult to predict. Trudeau’s path to re-election runs through the largely French-speaking province, where his defense of SNC-Lavalin is being applauded.

Protecting Jobs

“I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,” Trudeau said Wednesday night in Montreal, where he was celebrating a Liberal Party by-election victory. “Our government will always focus on jobs and our economy.”

SNC-Lavalin had been pushing for what’s known as a deferred prosecution agreement to end a criminal case dating back more than a decade, related to corruption charges. The company’s stock plunged the most in six years Oct. 10 when it revealed that the Public Prosecution Service of Canada ruled out a negotiated settlement that would have staved off a trial. Settling out of court would also help the company, which employs about 9,000 people in Canada, avoid a ban on bidding for federal government contracts.

Wilson-Raybould pulled back the curtain on the effort to change that decision and help the company, in testimony that was aired on national television in its entirety. She spoke to lawmakers only after Trudeau waived privilege to allow her to do so, and believes she wasn’t even legally able to intervene.

Inner Circle

She said the prime minister and his aides wanted to end the case in part to prevent the company’s relocation -- and also to avoid electoral fallout for both the federal Liberals and the party’s provincial wing. Wilson-Raybould said she resisted intervening because she wanted to uphold the principle of judicial independence and the rule of law, but officials ignored her repeated instructions to stop raising the issue.

The former attorney-general identified a series of phone calls and meetings between her or her staff, and Trudeau or several of his top advisers. They include chief of staff Katie Telford; former principal secretary Gerald Butts, who resigned this month; and senior aides Mathieu Bouchard and Elder Marques. She also cited communications with Finance Minister Bill Morneau and his chief of staff Ben Chin.

One of the meetings was with Trudeau himself, in September. “The prime minister raised the issue immediately. The prime minister asked me to help out, to find a solution here for SNC,” Wilson-Raybould said. She said she’d told him she had made up her mind.

London Calling

“The prime minister again cited the potential loss of jobs and SNC moving,” while also stressing that he represents an electoral district in Quebec. She said Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, the country’s top bureaucrat, also warned her the company “will likely be moving to London” without her intervention.

Discussions continued. Wilson-Raybould said Bouchard at one point said bluntly: “We can have the best policy in the world but we need to get re-elected.”

The allegations by Jody Wilson-Raybould dramatically deepened the biggest crisis of Trudeau’s tenure just months ahead of an October election in which his Liberals face a tough fight.

Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee that she had confronted Trudeau over what she called inappropriate pressure to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. evade a corruption trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials.

Andrew Scheer, leader of the official opposition Conservative Party, demanded the resignation of what he called a disgraced prime minister.

“He can no longer, with a clear conscience, continue to lead this nation,” Scheer told reporters, calling for police to immediately probe the matter. Trudeau was to address reporters later Wednesday.

Wilson-Raybould said officials imposed “consistent and sustained pressure” on her from September to December last year to ensure SNC-Lavalin pay a large fine rather than go to trial.

“In my view, these events constituted pressure to intervene in a matter and that this pressure, or political interference to intervene, was not appropriate,” she told the committee.

Wilson-Raybould, who named several senior officials in the offices of Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau, said under questioning from Liberal legislators that she did not feel the pressure on her had been illegal.

A Morneau spokesman denied the minister or his staff had ever pressured Wilson-Raybould when she was justice minister.

Trudeau and other officials deny inappropriate pressure was put on Wilson-Raybould. But the case forced the resignation of Trudeau’s principal private secretary, Gerald Butts, earlier this month.

According to Trudeau, Canada's involvement in the project will cost $2 billion over the next 24 years, which will become the largest Canadian space initiative in more than a decade.

As a part of its involvement, Canada will provide the new space station with a robotic arm named ""Canadarm 3,"" a descendant of ""Canadarm 2,"" which is installed at the International Space Station. The first generation of these robotic arms was installed on the US Space Shuttles.

​The new space station will be unoccupied most of the time due to its remote location, and will rely heavily on artificial intelligence to sustain itself, the report says. However, Canada's involvement in the project opens up the possibility of Canadian astronauts participating in human expeditions to the station.

A former Canadian justice minister says she faced attempts at interference and ""veiled threats"" from top government officials seeking a legal favour for a firm facing a corruption trial.

Jody Wilson-Raybould said she was pressed repeatedly to ""find a solution"" for engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

PM Justin Trudeau said he disagreed with the minister's testimony and he and his staff acted appropriately.

Opposition leader Andrew Scheer has called on him to resign.

""He can no longer, with a clear conscience, continue to lead this nation,"" the Conservative leader told reporters, adding that he was calling for a full police investigation.

What did the former minister say?

Speaking to the House of Commons justice committee, the former justice minister and attorney general said she and her staff faced four months of a ""sustained"" and ""inappropriate effort"" to push for a possible deferred prosecution agreement for the Quebec-based engineering and construction company.

That agreement would have allowed the firm to avoid a criminal trial and instead agree to alternative terms or conditions, like penalties or enhanced compliance measures.

It was an option rejected in September by the Public Prosecution Service of Canada - an independent authority whose main objective is to prosecute federal offences - and one she supported.

Ms Wilson-Raybould said she and her aides were pulled into multiple conversations and meetings - ""a barrage of people hounding me and my staff"" - with Mr Trudeau, senior aides from his office and the finance department, and a top bureaucrat.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Wilson-Raybould says she felt political pressure and ""veiled threats"" from government officials

In those various meetings, they repeatedly raised concerns about the possibility of job losses and potential political ramifications of a trial long after that decision had been made.

""Within these conversations, there were expressed statements regarding the necessity of interference in the SNC-Lavalin matter, the potential of consequences and veiled threats if a deferred prosecution agreement was not made available to SNC,"" she said.

Mr Trudeau's Liberals have struggled to contain the controversy over the past three weeks.

Though she has been a key figure at the centre of the affair, Ms Wilson-Raybould had not yet not spoken publicly, citing solicitor-client privilege.

That privilege was waived by the government on Monday, paving the way for her appearance before the committee on Wednesday.

What has happened so far?

This began in early February, when the Globe and Mail newspaper reported on allegations of political interference in the case against SNC-Lavalin.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has faced repeated questions about the matter from opposition parties

The newspaper reported, citing unnamed sources, that Mr Trudeau's office pressured Ms Wilson-Raybould to push the public prosecution service to consider a deferred prosecution agreement.

Ms Wilson-Raybould was attorney general and justice minister until January, when she was shuffled into the veterans affairs portfolio, a move widely seen as a demotion.

An attorney general is supposed to act independently with respect of his or her prosecutorial function.

On 12 February, Ms Wilson-Raybould resigned suddenly from Cabinet, though she remains a Liberal member of Parliament.

Finally on 18 February, Mr Trudeau's top aide Gerald Butts announced he was resigning, denying in a statement that he or anyone on his staff did anything wrong but saying he had to leave so as not to be a distraction from the ""vital work"" being done by the team.

Mr Trudeau and his officials have denied anything improper took place but have struggled to contain the crisis.

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday evening, he said he was worried about jobs at SNC Lavalin and how pensioners would be affected.

Opinion polls indicate the matter is beginning to hurt the Liberals with months to go until the coming general election.

What is happening with SNC Lavalin?

The Quebec-based firm is one of the world's largest engineering and construction companies.

The company and two of its subsidiaries face fraud and corruption charges in relation to approximately C$48m ($36m; £28m) in bribes it is alleged to have offered to Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011.

The firm has openly lobbied to be allowed to enter into a remediation agreement instead of going to trial, saying it has cleaned house and changed its ways.

The agreement - similar to regimes in the US and the UK - essentially suspends prosecution while allowing a firm to agree instead to alternative terms or conditions.

SNC-Lavalin and its supporters say it would be unfair to penalise the company as a whole and its thousands of employees for the wrongdoings of former executives.

Preliminary hearings for the charges are currently before the courts. The company says it will ""vigorously defend itself"" against the allegations.

378,Empty,2019-02-28T09:00:00Z,Abandoning the Kurds is a longstanding Western tradition. But must we really add to this betrayal by sticking them with the worst of Canada?,"Let's begin by acknowledging the pungent barnyard smell that accompanied Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale's previous explanation for why his government wouldn't be bringing Canadians suspected of belonging to ISIS home for prosecution.

Northern Syria, where several Canadians, including women and children, are currently detained by the mostly Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), is a dangerous place, Goodale said, and Canada won't put its consular officials at risk by sending them there.

That the area is currently crawling with Western journalists speaks to its tolerable risk level. And, of course, Canada does send diplomats into dangerous environments. The death of Canadian diplomat Glyn Berry in Afghanistan in 2006 is tragic proof of that. He's not the only Canadian diplomat killed or injured on duty abroad, but most — thanks to training, rigorous security protocols and luck — return home safely.

Goodale has also argued that Canada isn't obligated to help ISIS fighters come home anyway. ""It should be noted that while every Canadian citizen, no matter how reprehensible, has the legal right to re-enter Canada, the government of Canada has no legal obligation to facilitate their return,"" he said in a January speech. This week, in an interview with Global News, the RCMP indicated it is nevertheless preparing for Canadian ISIS members' return.

The problem with Goodale's sort of talk is that it violates the spirit of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's election campaign mantra that ""a Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian."" If that were true, ISIS members should expect Ottawa to expend the same efforts on them as it does on other Canadians who find themselves in sticky situations abroad.

Goodale's obfuscation is pragmatic. It's just not moral (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)

The real reason why the Trudeau government wouldn't want to repatriate Canadian members of ISIS and their families is because they recognize the public relations disaster it would be if these men and women were to come home and escape meaningful prosecution — which is a possibility, given the difficulty in compiling evidence from Syria and Iraq that would stand up in a Canadian court. Returning ISIS members might also pose a security risk, necessitating resource-heavy surveillance.

So Goodale's obfuscation is pragmatic. It's just not moral.

The immorality is not in denying ISIS members a Canadian homecoming. Allowing killers and sex slave-owners a comfortable life in Canada is not justice in the cosmic sense, even if it may be legally unavoidable.

What's immoral about leaving Canadian ISIS members in Syria is that it makes our citizens a problem for the Syrian Democratic Forces to sort out. The men and women of the SDF, lest we forget, were Canada's allies, fighting ISIS on the ground while we bombed them from the air (before we pulled our CF-18s from that fight). American, British and French special forces also fought side-by-side with the SDF on the ground in Syria.

One of the SDF's contingent groups, the YPG, helped rescue Yazidis besieged by ISIS on Mount Sinjar in 2014. That same militia, with allied Syrian and Iraqi ones, broke the siege of Kobani in 2015, when almost everyone thought the city was lost. They've been the most steadfast and successful force fighting ISIS in northern Syria. They've suffered thousands of casualties as a result.

Now, with ISIS mostly defeated, America and its allies will leave the SDF to make whatever peace it can with the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and with Turkey, which opposes their presence along its border and will work to disrupt any efforts the SDF make to carve out an autonomous region there. Abandoning the Kurds is a longstanding Western tradition. But must we really add to this betrayal by sticking them with the worst of Canada?

And what exactly do we expect the SDF to do with our citizens they now house and feed? Detain them indefinitely? Release them to potentially menace others in Syria, or perhaps in Europe, should they manage to cross into Turkey and travel on from there? Hand them over to Assad's security forces, with its history of torture and industrial-scale murder? How are any of those options moral or pragmatic?

Whether we like it or not, Canadian ISIS members are our responsibility. We need to bring them home to deal with them as best we can.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made the announcement Wednesday that Canada would be partnering with NASA and spending 2 billion Canadian dollars ($1.4 billion) over 24 years on the Lunar Orbital Platform Gateway program, a human-tended facility in orbit around the moon, as well as other space programs. The announcement included funding of 150 million Canadian dollars over five years for a new Lunar Exploration Accelerator Program to help small and medium-sized businesses develop new technologies to be used and tested in lunar orbit and on the moon’s surface in fields that include artificial intelligence, robotics and health.

Canada will develop and contribute a smart robotic system – Canadarm3 – that will repair and maintain the Gateway, Trudeau announced. “Canada’s historic investment will create good jobs for Canadians, keep our astronaut program running and our aerospace industry strong and growing, while opening up a new realm of possibilities for Canadian research and innovation,” he said. “With the Lunar Gateway, Canada will play a major role in one of the most ambitious projects ever undertaken.”

NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine thanked Trudeau in a statement that highlighted Canada’s past support for the U.S. space program. “We look forward to our deepening partnership with Canada, and the support of the many other nations I am confident will join us and help strengthen our progress on the challenging goals we’ve set in space,” he added.

Canadian aerospace firms have been lobbying the federal government for years for a fresh influx of funding for space programs. In the fall of 2018 a coalition of space-related organizations, led by MDA which developed the Canadarm, launched a public relations and government lobbying campaign to highlight the need for more space funding and participation in the Lunar Gateway project.

MDA, a Maxar Technologies company, has already conducted early concept studies for the Canadian Space Agency on the Lunar Gateway robotics system. It has also conducted a survey of Canadian firms that could be used to deliver the capability and last year held its own industry day to meet with key suppliers.

MDA says the Canadarm3 robotics on the Lunar Gateway will be essential for critical operations and maintenance for the new international space station, on both the outside and inside of the station. It is expected to consist of a larger manipulator arm and a smaller dexterous arm, the firm noted.

Mike Greenley, group president of MDA, said over 500 Canadian firms participated in the company’s robotics program for the International Space Station. “We expect a similarly robust and diverse pan-Canadian supply chain will form to execute Canada’s commitment to the Lunar Gateway, including Canada’s strong AI community,” he added in a statement Wednesday.

Greenley, in a previous interview with Space News, noted that a new generation of Canadarm would also provide a highly visible and critical component to Lunar Gateway operations, including the assembly of the Gateway itself and its ongoing maintenance, the capture of visiting spacecraft.

NASA and the Canadian Space Agency have been in discussions to examine a Canadian contribution to the Lunar Gateway. Bridenstine met with Canadian Space Agency President Sylvain Laporte in September at NASA headquarters for talks on the project and other potential programs.

Bridenstine noted at a Sept. 7 forum at the Wilson Center in Washington that, “We need to take advantage of some of the great capabilities that Canada has developed.”

He suggested that capabilities, such as a version of the Canadarm2 robotic arm on the International Space Station, could for the Gateway, be used to help maintain it when astronauts are not on board. “Hopefully, maybe one day we can have an agreement where we can have a Canadarm on Gateway,” Bridenstine said at the time. “Not only on the outside but on the inside, and have it more robust than ever before so that it can, in fact, help manage the space station when it is uncrewed.”",Canada becomes first nation to formally commit to NASA's lunar Gateway - SpaceNews,Spacenews.com,https://spacenews.com/canada-becomes-first-nation-to-formally-commit-to-nasas-lunar-gateway/

The former justice minister had obtained a broad waiver from the Prime Minister's Office that allows her to disclose details of her conversations with government officials about the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, a Montreal-based global engineering and construction company.

In an Order in Council (OIC) posted online Monday, the government said Wilson-Raybould — ""and any persons who directly participated in discussions with her relating to the exercise of her authority under the Director of Public Prosecutions Act respecting the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin"" — can report to the committee and to the federal ethics commissioner any cabinet confidences ""in any information or communications that were directly discussed with her respecting the exercise of that authority while she held that office.""

But in the letter to Anthony Housefather, Wilson-Raybould said those parameters will not allow her to ""speak freely.""

""The OIC addresses only my time as attorney general of Canada and therefore does nothing to release me from any restrictions that apply to communications while I served as minister of veterans affairs and in relation to my resignation from that post or my presentation to cabinet after I had resigned,"" she said in the letter.

""I mention this simply to alert the committee to the fact that the Order in Council leaves in place whatever restraints there are on my ability to speak freely about matters that occurred after I left the post of attorney general.""

On Monday, Wilson-Raybould wrote the committee saying she is ""anxious"" to appear, and sought permission to deliver a 30-minute opening statement instead of the usual five to 10 minutes, a request which has been granted by the committee.

After the letter to Housefather was made public, a PMO official told CBC News that the core issue of the case revolves around whether or not Wilson-Raybould was pressured while attorney general of Canada on SNC-Lavalin. The PMO's position is that the order in council is broad enough for the former minister to deal with the issue in full.

PM Justin Trudeau says that waiving privilege is something they take seriously, but he is glad that Jody Wilson-Raybould will be able to tell her side of things in front of the Justice Committee. 0:21

Earlier, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he's ""pleased"" that Wilson-Raybould will be able to ""share her perspectives"" on the SNC-Lavalin affair.

""It's important that people get an opportunity to testify, or share their point of view, at committee,"" Trudeau told reporters as he headed into the weekly Liberal cabinet meeting.

""As we said, waiving privilege, waiving cabinet confidentiality is something that we had to take very seriously, but I'm pleased that Ms. Wilson-Raybould is going to be able to share her perspectives.""

Justice Minister David Lametti outlines discussions between both sides to waive solicitor client privilege in order for his predecessor to be able to appear in front of the Justice Committee. 0:32

The OIC waived cabinet confidence and solicitor-client privilege for Wilson-Raybould in her conversations with the justice committee and the ethics commissioner. The waiver does not cover communications between Wilson-Raybould and the director of public prosecutions — a limit imposed to ""uphold the integrity of any criminal or civil proceedings,"" according to the text of the order.

Justice Minister and Attorney General David Lametti said the order achieves two objectives.

""What we were doing is establishing a process that's fair and open and allows transparency but still protects the very principles that we want to protect in the legal system, as well as not interfering with ongoing litigation,"" he said.

Lametti confirmed there were ""contacts"" between lawyers, but would not say whether he was talking about discussions between government lawyers and Wilson-Raybould's counsel — retired Supreme Court justice Thomas Cromwell.

The justice committee is examining the growing controversy touched off by a Feb. 7 Globe and Mail report that said Trudeau's aides attempted to press Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin to help the company avoid criminal prosecution on bribery charges related to contracts in Libya.

'I anticipate tomorrow there may be some difficult rulings to make,' says Anthony Housefather. 6:56

Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet on Feb. 12, and has remained silent on the matter, insisting she's still bound by solicitor-client confidentiality from her time as attorney general.

""I understand fully that Canadians want to know the truth and want transparency,"" she told the House of Commons last week. ""Privilege and confidentiality are not mine to waive, and I hope that I have the opportunity to speak my truth.""

Housefather said he believes all of Wilson-Raybould's previous concerns have now been addressed and she will now have the opportunity to give her account of events.

""I think she now can tell her side of the story. With 30 minutes, I think she'll have ample time to do so and I look forward to hearing from her, as I know the other committee members do,"" he said.

Why did she resign?

Conservative justice critic and deputy leader Lisa Raitt will press Wilson-Raybould on what happened in various meetings and whether she engaged in any discussions that were, in her opinion, inappropriate. But she said the big unanswered question is what prompted Wilson-Raybould to resign.

""What was it either in what Mr. Lametti said, or in what the prime minister said, that caused her to realize she didn't have the confidence of the cabinet any longer and she had to remove herself from cabinet solidarity?"" Raitt said. ""Because that's what she did and it's a big deal.""

NDP MP Nathan Cullen said Wilson-Raybould's testimony will be ""pivotal"" and the committee probe must expand to call on testimony from officials in the PMO, including Trudeau's chief of staff Katie Telford and his former principal secretary Gerry Butts.

Her appearance will be the first time she speaks publicly and in detail in the 20 days since the allegations of political pressure being placed on her by members of the PMO in regards to an ongoing criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, were reported in The Globe and Mail.

Wilson-Raybould sent a letter to the committee Tuesday afternoon confirming she’d testify at 3:15 p.m. ET on Wednesday, which was the time the committee had requested.

Leaving the building where her lawyer has an office, CTV News asked Wilson-Raybould whether she felt satisfied with the terms under which she’s been permitted to speak, and she did not respond.

In requesting she attend imminently, the committee cited the Order in Council that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued Monday evening. The committee said it now has the clarity on confidence, privilege, and a parliamentary convention known as ""sub judice"" which deals with speaking about cases currently before the courts. These were issues that both Wilson-Raybould and the MPs who are conducting the probe were looking for more legal assurances on before having her appear.

The committee has agreed to a request Wilson-Raybould made in writing on Monday: that she be granted an ""extended opening statement"" lasting 30 minutes during which she would be able to go through everything she recalls about communications she was involved in regarding SNC-Lavalin. Most opening statements at committees are limited to 10 minutes.

The meeting is currently scheduled to span two hours, most of which will be Wilson-Raybould taking questions from MPs, and will take place inside one of the new committee meeting rooms in West Block. Wilson-Raybould is the only witness scheduled for the meeting.

""We're pleased to hear her take on things,"" said committee chair Anthony Housefather. ""I think it's important to the members of the committee to do our work, and to Canadians to hear from Ms. Wilson-Raybould, and I'm happy she’s agreed to come tomorrow,"" he said.

NDP MP Nathan Cullen said her testimony is ""pivotal,"" but expressed frustration that she was appearing in the afternoon, and not before the final prime minister's question period for a few weeks. On Wednesdays when he is in town, Trudeau takes every question asked during question period. Cullen said this could mean that the opposition won't have the ability to put to Trudeau what Wilson-Raybould has to say, until mid-March when the House of Commons reconvenes after a two-week hiatus where MPs are in their ridings.

Conservative MP Lisa Raitt said she'll be asking Wilson-Raybould whether in her view the pressure was appropriate and for more detail about many aspects of the entire affair from her perspective.

""The unanswered question I have is why did she resign? What was it either in what Mr. Lametti said or in what the prime minister said that caused her to realize she didn't have the confidence of the cabinet any longer?"" Raitt said.

In her Monday letter Wilson-Raybould said that she is ""anxious"" to appear and wrote that she'd be happy to stay for as long as the committee wishes to answer questions. Last week in the House of Commons she rose to say that she hopes she would be granted the ability to “speak my truth,” in relation to the allegations.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters on his way to Tuesday morning's cabinet meeting that he is ""pleased"" that Wilson-Raybould will be able to ""share her perspective.""

""It's important that people get an opportunity to testify or share their point of view at committee. As we said, waving the privilege, waiving cabinet confidentiality is something that we had to take very seriously,” Trudeau said.

""It's just important that she speak and that all of the mystery goes. This is important for all of us to get on with our work,"" said Crown Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett on her way out of cabinet on Tuesday. ""There is a view that in terms of the story, we need to hear her side of it,"" she said.

Over the last few weeks the opposition parties have focused in on this scandal, with Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer calling it a ""textbook case of government corruption with those at the very top of the prime minister's office implicated in what could very well be the obstruction of justice."" The opposition Conservatives and New Democrats have sought to have Trudeau and several senior PMO staff believed to be central to the story testify, and a public inquiry called, with no success.

Tuesday, Government House Leader Bardish Chagger criticized the opposition and its messaging throughout this ongoing controversy.

""Once upon a time it was a message that 'oh the committee will never meet on this issue.' They're meeting on this issue. Then we started talking about 'oh, witnesses will never be allowed to appear.' Witnesses are appearing. They’re being asked tough questions. 'Oh, the former Attorney General will not be allowed to appear.' Guess what? She is appearing. 'Oh the Prime Minister is not going to let her speak.' The Prime Minister has done whatever he can to work with the current Attorney General to ensure that the opportunity is there,"" Chagger said.

'There were contacts between lawyers'

On his way into cabinet Tuesday morning, Justice Minister and Attorney General David Lametti said that, before waiving attorney-client privilege and cabinet confidence, federal lawyers were in touch with Wilson-Raybould's counsel.

""It is fair to say that there were contacts between lawyers but I won't go any further than that,"" Lametti told reporters Tuesday morning.

In her letter of resignation as Veterans Affairs Minister Wilson-Raybould said she retained former Supreme Court judge Thomas Cromwell to provide advice on speaking publicly about the scandal. Up until now she has maintained solicitor-client privilege as the reason she’s been unable to speak to the allegations.

This specific waiver only permits Wilson-Raybould to speak about the matter to the House Justice Committee, however, as part of its study into the SNC-Lavalin affair, and to the federal ethics commissioner who has also launched an investigation.

""We have, I believe as a government, worked to demonstrate transparency as well as balancing the fact that there is ongoing litigation we do not want to compromise, so we feel we’ve done that with this agreement,"" Lametti said.

The government made the directive in an Order in Council posted Monday evening. The order authorizes her, as well as ""any person who directly participated in discussions with her,"" to speak to the committee and ethics commissioner, about the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

The order relates to any information or communications that have to do with Wilson-Raybould's time as the attorney general and exercising her authority under the Director of Public Prosecutions Act, and only in regards to the two ongoing probes of the matter, and not a blanket permission for Wilson-Raybould to speak.

As well, the order states that Director of Public Prosecutions Kathleen Roussel is exempted from this waiving of privilege and any information or conversations between Wilson-Raybould and Roussel cannot be disclosed, ""in order to uphold the integrity of any criminal or civil proceedings,"" the prime minister's office states in the Order in Council.

Recap on the story so far

On Feb. 7, citing unnamed sources, The Globe and Mail reported that Trudeau's office pressed Wilson-Raybould to drop a criminal prosecution against SNC-Lavalin when she was attorney general. It was alleged that the PMO wanted Wilson-Raybould to instruct federal prosecutors to change course and pursue a remediation agreement rather than criminal prosecution in the corruption and fraud case against the Quebec engineering and construction giant. CTV News has not independently verified the story.

Remediation agreements — or Deferred Prosecution Agreements (DPAs) — can include having the company accept responsibility, denounce the wrongdoing, vow to implement corrective measures, and pay financial penalties.

In contrast, if the company was criminally convicted it would be banned from securing Canadian government contracts for a decade, potentially putting jobs on the line.

When she was attorney general, Wilson-Raybould had the ability to direct the Director of Public Prosecutions to take a different route with the charges against SNC-Lavalin but she did not, despite several meetings and conversations before and after federal prosecutors decided to carry on with the criminal case in the fall.

In January, Wilson-Raybould was shuffled into the veterans affairs portfolio, and was replaced as attorney general and justice minister by David Lametti, a Quebec MP. Wilson-Raybould accepted her new position, but then resigned from cabinet days after the Globe story broke amid the opposition framing this as her being demoted for not changing her position on a deferred prosecution.

The House Justice Committee began probing the matter last week. As part of the study the committee has already heard from Lametti, his deputy minister, and top bureaucrat Michael Wernick, who gave blunt and detailed testimony in which he sought to reframe the Globe report, saying that while it's likely Wilson-Raybould could have felt pressured, it's a question of whether that constitutes as ""inappropriate pressure,"" or pressure that comes with being part of the inner circle that makes key decisions with national implications.

Then on Monday the committee heard from a slate of academic witnesses on the underlying legal aspects at the heart of the affair. These include the legal provision known as remediation or deferred prosecution agreements, which were tucked into a recent omnibus bill following heavy SNC-Lavalin lobbying, and the Shawcross doctrine; which has to do with the independence of the attorney general in making decisions.

These witnesses offered their hypothetical perspectives about the propriety of attorney generals making prosecutorial decisions, when the various principles are activated, and the balance of seeking advice from cabinet colleagues without succumbing to or factoring in politics.

Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, a legal counsel with Woodward and Company LLP, and law professor at the University of British Columbia, told the committee that what needs to be understood is how the situation unfolded.

""If the purpose was to persuade the attorney general as chief prosecutor to take a different position on a prosecution, it triggers a serious rule-of-law concern, and how will we know whether that’s serious or not? Well, obviously you need to hear from those who may have been involved,"" Turpel-Lafond told the committee on Monday.

To date, the government maintains that nothing improper occurred, though Trudeau's principal secretary resigned over the matter on Feb. 18, denying any wrongdoing.

Besides that critical race in B.C.'s Burnaby South for Jagmeet Singh, there are two other byelections being held in the Ontario riding of York-Simcoe and Outremont in Quebec.

Burnaby South is one place where all three major parties have been competitive in past elections. The NDP held onto the seat by a hair more than one per cent of the votes in 2015.

The Liberals, who usually put up a strong showing in Burnaby, faced challenges in this campaign.

Their first candidate, Karen Wang, resigned after pointing out Singh's ethnicity online. In recent weeks, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been besieged by allegations his office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Singh said he's not taking anything for granted, but he's confident his hard work to connect with voters will pay off.

""I think people are very disappointed with what's going on with the Liberal government,"" he said.

Voters in three ridings are headed to the polls in byelections in B.C., Ontario and Quebec. 1:37

He's up against Richard Lee (Liberal), Jay Shin (Conservative) and Laura Lynn Thompson (People's Party).

Singh has been without a seat since he was chosen as leader of the NDP in October 2017. The B.C. riding has been the focus of the party's heaviest campaigning efforts since Singh announced he would run for that seat in August. Expectations are Singh will take the win in this byelection.

But the NDP is also squaring off against the Liberals in another race — to defend former leader Tom Mulcair's seat in the downtown Montreal riding of Outremont.

Outremont

The provincial polls suggest that the Liberals should win the riding easily.

The NDP's support in Quebec has been fading, and the riding was a Liberal stronghold before Mulcair seized it in a 2007 byelection, the first-ever win in the province for the NDP and one that helped set the stage for the Orange Wave that swept the province in 2011.

Countrywide, that Orange Wave is now little more than a ripple. The NDP has been dropping in the polls and now sits at just 14 per cent in the CBC Poll Tracker — a result which, if replicated on election night in October, would be the worst result for the party in nearly 20 years.

The Montreal riding of Outremont (CBC)

Singh also presents unique challenges in Quebec ridings.

Julia Sanchez, the NDP's candidate in Monday's Outremont byelection, told The Canadian Press people in the riding talk to her about climate change, wealth inequality — and sometimes what the leader of her party wears on his head.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is Sikh and wears a turban, making him conspicuously religious in the eyes of a heavily secular province. His French is also weaker than the two previous party leaders, complicating the job of appealing to Quebec voters.

Even in multicultural Outremont, located in the geographic centre of the island of Montreal with one of the largest ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities in North America, Singh's religious clothing is on some voters' minds.

""Some people are concerned about [the turban],"" Sanchez said during a recent interview following a candidate debate in the riding. She said when she knocks on doors, ""It's definitely not the main thing people bring up .... It does come up.""

Sanchez is running against Liberal candidate Rachel Bendayan, Conservative Jasmine Louras, Bloc candidate Michel Duchesne, PPC candidate James Seale and Green party deputy leader Daniel Green.

York-Simcoe

York-Simcoe is almost certainly a safe Conservative seat. The Tories won it by 45 points in 2011 and still held it by 12 points in 2015 when Stephen Harper was defeated.

Tory candidate Scot Davidson told CBC News on Saturday he's confident the affluent riding will stay blue.

383,Empty,2019-02-26T17:15:07Z,"The votes in York Simcoe, Burnaby South and Outremont revealed political vulnerabilities across the country, Chantal Hébert writes.","Here is a look at some of bright and dark spots brought to light by the votes in York Simcoe, Burnaby South and Outremont:

Hold the champagne! If Monday’s much-anticipated byelection results suggest anything, it is that none of the main federal parties is where it should want to be a little more than six months from the official start of a national election campaign.

In fact, even as polls show the unresolved crisis is taking a toll on the prime minister’s party, voters in the three ridings in play on Monday did not seem inclined to discipline the Liberals for their latest alleged ethical transgression.

At 40 per cent, their score in Outremont was their best since the 2004 sponsorship scandal. That is just the latest sign that the crisis over the government’s handling of SNC-Lavalin’s judicial file is unlikely to turn into a train wreck of similar proportions for Trudeau in Quebec in the fall election.

Only one in five voters cast a ballot in Outremont and York Simcoe. The turnout in Burnaby South was 30 per cent.

That being said, the Liberals lost close to 10 points from their 2015 scores in each of the two non-Quebec ridings in the last election. A similar drop across Ontario and B.C. this fall would see Trudeau and his party back in opposition.

His entry in the House of Commons at a particularly challenging time for the ruling Liberals will offer the NDP leader as close to a second chance to make a good first impression as a politician can hope for.

Singh will have to hit the ground running, for Monday’s returns also brought the expected confirmation that the party is headed nowhere fast in the province that gave it the most seats in the last two federal elections.

Yes, the New Democrats held on to second place in Outremont with 26 per cent of the vote, and yes, it is a score they would have been proud of in the pre-Thomas Mulcair era. But that number reflects an 18-point loss in support. It would not take a drop anywhere near that large to wipe the NDP off the face of Quebec this fall. Just last week, two more NDP MPs from Quebec announced they would not be seeking re-election.

The Conservative performance was symptomatic of all that ails Andrew Scheer’s party as it looks to the general election.

Its vote share went up in the riding where it least needed to do better — giving it a win in Ontario’s York Simcoe with 54 per cent of the vote as opposed to the 50 per cent it got in 2015. But the CPC lost ground in the other two ridings, suggesting the non-Liberal vote has yet to coalesce behind Scheer.

At seven per cent in Outremont, the Conservatives might as well have stayed home. In Burnaby South, their third-place finish with 22 per cent of ballots cast was overshadowed by Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party capturing 10.6% of the vote.

The good news for the CPC is that its right-wing rival’s score is more reflective of the personal appeal of the local candidate than that of the fledging party. At barely two per cent in Outremont and York Simcoe, Bernier’s first electoral tests in his home province and in Ontario were flops.

But perhaps the worst night on the field of expectations goes to the Bloc Québécois. This was the struggling sovereigntist party’s first byelection under new leader Yves-François Blanchet, and the first vote to showcase a sovereigntist option on the ballot since the Parti Québécois rout in last fall’s provincial election.

Outremont would not top any list of winnable BQ ridings but prior to Mulcair’s appearance on the scene in a 2 007 byelection, the sovereigntist party routinely won about a third of the vote. On Monday it only took one vote in 10.

The BQ was even beaten for third place by the Green Party. In veteran environmentalist Daniel Green, Elizabeth May recruited a rare big-name candidate for her party in Quebec and that certainly made a difference.

But the Greens’ 12 per cent finish is also a reminder that, these days, more Quebec voters are inclined to use their ballots to send a pro-environment message than a pro-sovereignty one.

It's been 16,877 days and counting since the last manned mission to the moon, but now it seems that everyone is in a hurry to go back.

After keeping her silence for weeks, former Minister of Justice and Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould had a lot to say at Wednesday's Commons justice committee hearing.

Meghan Markle is at the centre of a war of words being fought on social media.

The new moon race

Fifty years is a long time, even on the moon.

The first footprints that Neil Armstrong made on the evening of July 20, 1969, were likely obliterated when Apollo 11's landing module blasted off the next day, and the American flag that the crew left behind was long ago bleached white by ultraviolet rays. Although the tools, towels, cameras and other objects they dumped to lessen the load are still up there along with the bags of astronaut poop, all now covered with a layer of fine, lunar dust.

It's been 16,877 days and counting since Apollo 17, the last manned mission to our closest celestial neighbour.

But now it seems that everyone is in a hurry to go back.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took a brief break from crisis management this morning to announce that Canada will join the U.S.-led Lunar Gateway project that could put astronauts back on the moon's surface as soon as 2028.

The international scheme calls for the construction of an orbiting moon station starting next year, followed by what NASA calls ""sustainable lunar architecture"" — aka a moon base — that will serve as both a research station and proving ground for an eventual Mars mission.

And the U.S. space agency recently announced plans for one of its private space partners to land a new robotic probe on the moon by the end of 2019, and last week unveiled a dozen scientific payloads.

The sudden resurgence of interest has everything to do with competition.

The Chinese government achieved a space first by landing a probe and rover on the far-side of the moon at the beginning of January, a likely precursor to their own crewed mission.

The Kremlin reportedly has plans to put Russian cosmonauts on the moon by 2031, and construct its own lunar base by 2035.

A lander built by a private Israeli firm, Beresheet, blasted off on a SpaceX rocket last week, and may or may not be headed for a moon landing following a software glitch.

India, which sent its first probe to the moon in 2008, has a second mission teed up and ready to go. It plans a manned mission by December 2021, the Indian Space Research Organization said in January.

And Taiwan has ramped up its space program, with the moon as the ultimate goal.

The private sector will surely play a big role in future moon missions.

A Japanese firm, ispace, is building two spacecraft that it hopes to send to the moon via SpaceX launches in 2020 and 2021. It is busy recruiting corporate partners, like NGK Spark Plug Co., to help underwrite the cost.

NASA, which hasn't had its own manned launch capability since the Shuttle program ended in 2011 — it has been contracting the job out to the Russians at as much as $82 million US a seat — is counting on Boeing and SpaceX for a made-in-America solution.

Kailasavadivoo Sivan, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organization, outlines upcoming moon missions at ISRO headquarters in Bangalore on Jan. 11. ISRO plans to launch a lunar probe by December 2020, a second by July 2021, and a manned mission by December 2021, he said. (Manjunath Kiran/AFP/Getty Images)

Progress has been slow, but Elon Musk's company is scheduled to send its Crew Dragon capsule on a dry run to the International Space Station this coming weekend, with plans to ferry its first astronauts in July, should all go well.

Boeing's Starliner test-flight should happen later this spring.

All of that has to do with cost.

NASA's 2019 budget is an impressive-sounding $21.5 billion US, but that's less than half a per cent of Washington's total spending, and about 50 per cent of the purchasing power the agency wielded during the Apollo glory years.

(Trudeau today earmarked $2.05 billion over the next 24 years for Canada's space program, including $150 million over five years for the Lunar Gateway.)

Despite the recent surge in interest, the new space race still lacks the 1960s urgency and investment provided by the Cold War.

Although Donald Trump, who has something of a space fixation, was reportedly willing to spend almost anything to ensure a Mars landing — as long as it occurred during his time in office.

Team of Vipers, the recent West-wing tell-all by former aide Cliff Sims, details an April 2017 Oval Office event during which the U.S. President put his then-NASA administrator on the spot, demanding a manned Mars mission before the 2020 election.

The NASA chief gently explained that the actual timeline — signed into law by Trump just a month earlier — is in the 2030s, and given the logistical challenges probably can't be advanced much, even with an unlimited budget.

Trump, writes Sims, was ""visibly disappointed.""

At Issue

It's been another wild week in Canadian politics, producer Arielle Piat-Sauvé writes.

Almost three weeks after allegations of political interference by the prime minister's office first came to light in a Globe and Mail report, we've finally heard from the person at the centre of it all — Jody Wilson-Raybould.

And after keeping her silence for weeks, the former Minister of Justice and Attorney General had a lot to say at yesterday's Commons justice committee hearing.

Jody Wilson-Raybould gives her testimony about the SNC-Lavalin affair before a justice committee hearing on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Wednesday. The Montreal-based firm was charged in 2015 with corruption for allegedly bribing officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011 to secure government contracts. (Lars Hagberg/AFP/Getty Images)

During her 40-minute-long opening statement, Wilson-Raybould presented her detailed account of events in chronological order. She then spent another three-and-a-half hours answering questions.

It's clear to anyone listening to the almost four-hour testimony that her account of what happened differs from that of the Clerk of the Privy Council and the prime minister.

Wilson-Raybould says she faced veiled threats and repeated political pressure to interfere in the SNC-Lavalin affair. The prime minister refuted Wilson-Raybould's testimony and reiterated that he believes there was no inappropriate pressure.

In his latest column, Andrew Coyne says either Wilson-Raybould is flat-out lying, or the prime minister and his people are.

Paul Wells describes the former Attorney General's account as a sickening, smug protection racket, and says the rules need to be the rules.

And last night, the leader of the opposition, Andrew Scheer, went as far as to call on Trudeau to resign.

Right now it looks like Canadians will have to decide whose narrative they believe, the prime minister's or Wilson-Raybould's.

As Chantal Hébert said during our special Wednesday At Issue, Wilson-Raybould has placed the prime minister right in the middle of the controversy — and they are supposed to be on the same team. Today, Hébert writes that the Liberals will likely be heading into the fall election campaign with the SNC-Lavalin affair still hanging around the party's neck.

So why is Wilson-Raybould remaining in the Liberal caucus? And what's the government's next move?

One thing we can be certain of is that this topic will dominate Question Period today.

Needless to say, lots for the At Issue panel tonight. Rosie Barton is away this week, but Chantal, Andrew and Paul will join host Ian Hanomansing. We'll tackle the latest on the SNC-Lavalin controversy and take some viewer questions.

Hope you can tune in!

#Megxit or #Megulator

Meghan Markle is at the centre of a war of words being fought on social media, writes London bureau reporter Kayla Hounsell.

I had been combing through the online vitriol about Meghan Markle for a while when my producer, Lily Martin, came across the work of social data journalist Gemma Joyce.

She had noticed so much nastiness online about the Duchess of Sussex, she decided to dig deep to find out who was saying what.

While it was already clear there were many distasteful and racist comments, I thought Joyce could give us some actual data. We made the trip to Brighton, England, to meet with her.

Joyce showed us a wall of screens in her office, displaying bar graphs, pie charts and maps. They indicated the most popular hashtag about Meghan Markle is #Megxit. You guessed it, a play on Brexit. People want Meghan to ""leave"" the way Britain is leaving the European Union.

#Moonbump is also growing in popularity, referring to the Duchess's baby bump.

""There is this theory going around that she is faking her pregnancy, which to me sounds a little bit mad,"" Joyce says.

Careful Meghan your moonbump crease is showing again <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/moonbump?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#moonbump</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/fakepregnancy?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#fakepregnancy</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Megxit?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Megxit</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Megxit?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Megxit</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/CharlatanDuchess?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#CharlatanDuchess</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/notmyduchess?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#notmyduchess</a> <a href=""https://t.co/LF0dHQJLD3"">pic.twitter.com/LF0dHQJLD3</a> —@jasmine3071

Perhaps not surprisingly, 80 per cent of this discussion is being generated by women, but what's really interesting is that the majority of them are not in the United Kingdom. The United States, where Meghan was an actress before marrying into the Royal Family, is fuelling the conversation, followed by the U.K., with Canada coming in third.

Joyce points out that while there is a lot of online abuse, there are also Meghan supporters, and they have a hashtag too. They're the Megulators.

""It's not that, you know, the trolls are really winning,"" she says. ""But at the same time, just looking at the kind of hatred around it is quite depressing really.""

It was a day of high political drama, as the former justice minister and attorney general accused top Liberal government officials of inappropriate, excessive political interference in an independent criminal prosecution, and the opposition parties called for Trudeau's resignation and a public inquiry into the scandal.

Testifying at the Commons justice committee Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould said she was contacted by 11 officials in the Prime Minister's Office, the Privy Council Office and Finance Minister Bill Morneau's office while she was justice minister and attorney general about the Quebec-based engineering and construction company. SNC-Lavalin was facing corruption charges for contracts in Libya and was lobbying for a remediation agreement as an alternative to criminal prosecution.

""For a period of four months from September to December 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the attorney general of Canada in an inappropriate effort to secure a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with SNC-Lavalin.""

Wilson-Raybould said she was ""hounded"" by various officials through phone calls, meetings and text messages.

'Veiled threats'

""Within these conversations there were express statements regarding the necessity of interfering in the SNC-Lavalin matter, the potential of consequences, and veiled threats if a DPA was not made available to SNC-Lavalin,"" she said.

""I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the gov't to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion..."" 1:08

The corporation faced a 10-year ban on bidding on government contracts if convicted of the criminal charges of bribery.

Wilson-Raybould chronicled a series of meetings, including one with Trudeau and Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick on Sept. 17, 2018. She told him that she had made a decision not to overturn the decision from the director of the Public Prosecution Service Kathleen Roussel to proceed with criminal prosecution against SNC-Lavalin.

The prime minister cited potential job losses and the possible move by the company, and asked her to ""help out."" The clerk then made the case for a DPA and reminded her that there was an election coming in Quebec.

""At that point, the prime minister jumped in, stressing that there is an election in Quebec, and that 'I am an MP in Quebec, the MP for Papineau,'"" she recounted. 'I was quite taken aback.""

PM needed a 'solution'

At that point, Wilson-Raybould said, she posed a direct question to Trudeau while looking him straight in the eye, asking if he was politically interfering with her role and her decision as the attorney general.

""I would strongly advise against it,"" she told the committee she warned Trudeau, who responded, ""No, no, no, we just need to find a solution.""

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh speech to reporters after Jody Wilson Raybould's testimony 0:48

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the RCMP must open an investigation, and he called on Trudeau to resign as prime minister for his role in undermining the administration of justice and trying to overturn an independent decision by the attorney general. He said the prime minister has lost his moral authority to govern.

""I was sickened and appalled by [Wilson-Raybould's] story of inappropriate and, frankly, borderline illegal pressure brought to bear on her by the highest levels of Justin Trudeau's government,"" he said.

Trudeau refuted Wilson-Raybould's account and dismissed the call for him to step down.

""I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,"" he said during an event in Montreal late Wednesday. ""And therefore I completely disagree with the characterization of the former attorney general about these events.""

Still in caucus — for now

Trudeau said it's premature to determine Wilson-Raybould's status in the Liberal caucus.

""I haven't yet had the opportunity to review her entire testimony. I will do that before making any further decision,"" he said.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Trudeau may well have to resign, but right now he's pressing to get to the bottom of the scandal.

""At this point, Canadians demand some answers that they have, and the only way to get to the bottom of this is a public inquiry that would have the independence to assess the truth,"" he said.

Singh called Wednesday's testimony ""explosive"" and ""incredibly damaging.""

Wilson-Raybould, who is still in the Liberal caucus, testified for nearly four hours as the key witness for the Commons justice committee in a packed room on Parliament Hill. In an unusual reversal of roles, opposition Conservative and NDP MPs praised the Liberal MP for speaking truthfully and having the courage to speak out while she was asked pointed and at times uncomfortable questions from her fellow Liberal MPs.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke to reporters in Montreal after Wilson-Raybould's testimony 0:57

Wilson-Raybould recounted an Oct. 26, 2018, conversation between her chief of staff Jessica Prince and PMO adviser Mathieu Bouchard, who was still pressing the option of an alternative to prosecution for SNC-Lavalin and suggesting an external legal opinion.

She told the committee that Prince told Bouchard this would be perceived as interference and the attorney general questioning Roussel's decision.

""Mathieu said that if — six months from the election — SNC announces they are moving their headquarters out of Canada, that is bad. He said, 'We can have the best policy in the world, but we need to be re-elected,'"" Wilson-Raybould testified.

On Dec. 5, 2018, she met with Gerry Butts, the prime minister's then-principal secretary, to discuss issues including SNC-Lavalin and the ""barrage"" of people hounding her and her staff.

'We need a solution'

""Towards the end of the meeting I raised how I needed everyone to stop talking to me about SNC as I had made up my mind and the engagements were inappropriate. Gerry then took over the conversation and said how we need a solution on the SNC stuff — he said I needed to find a solution,"" she said.

Wilson-Raybould said the pressure escalated later that month with contacts from PMO officials. Butts and Trudeau's chief of staff Katie Telford ""summoned"" Prince to a Dec. 18 meeting, saying the situation was getting worse and that they felt she wasn't doing anything about it.

According to Wilson-Raybould's testimony, Telford suggested they could line up people to write op-eds to say what she was doing was ""proper.""

The next day, Wilson-Raybould met with Wernick. She said the clerk conveyed that the prime minister was ""quite determined, quite firm,"" and wanted to know why the DPA route wasn't being pursued.

""He said, 'I think he is gonna find a way to get it done one way or another. So he is in that kinda mood and I wanted you to be aware of that,'"" Wilson-Raybould testified.

Wernick testified last week that he warned Wilson-Raybould about the economic ""consequences"" of prosecuting SNC-Lavalin, including heavy job losses, but insisted there was never any ""inappropriate pressure"" put on her to override the prosecution service's decision. The clerk also told her that the prime minister and others in the government were ""anxious"" about the impact of prosecution.

Confidence in PM?

Repeatedly asked by Liberal MPs why she would have remained in cabinet when she felt inappropriate pressure, Wilson-Raybould explained that she took the prime minister at his word, retained confidence in him, and decided to stay at the cabinet table as veterans affairs minister after the shuffle Jan. 14.

She said she had ""serious concerns"" that the government would enter into a DPA if she were no longer attorney general, and said she would have quit if that happened.

Wilson-Raybould offered few details on why she ultimately left.

""I resigned from cabinet because I did not have confidence to sit around the cabinet table, that's why I resigned,"" she said.

She declined to explain why she quit cabinet or disclose details of her conversations with the prime minister prior to her resignation. But she described experiencing ""heightened anxiety"" as she waited for the ""other shoe to drop.""

A week before the cabinet shuffle, she said she received a call from Trudeau advising her she was being moved from the justice portfolio.

""I will not go into details of this call, or subsequent communications about the shuffle, but I will say that I stated I believed the reason was because of the SNC matter. They denied this to be the case.""

Asked if she still has confidence in the prime minister, Wilson-Raybould said the question was not relevant to the hearings.

""Are you politically interfering with my role as the attorney general,"" Wilson-Raybould says she asked Trudeau. ""I would strongly advise against it."" 1:15

NDP MP Nathan Cullen asked if it is illegal to exert pressure on an attorney general to offer a ""special plea"" to a company for political reasons.

""In my opinion, it's not illegal. It is very inappropriate depending on the context of the comments made, the nature of the pressure, the specific issues that are raised,"" she said. ""It is incredibly inappropriate and is an attempt to compromise, or to impose upon an independent attorney general.""

“What is not appropriate is pressing the attorney general on matters that she or he cannot take into account such as partisan political considerations …” 1:10

Earlier Wednesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau insisted that Wilson-Raybould could ""speak fully"" about the SNC-Lavalin affair, contrary to the claim by Wilson-Raybould that she was constrained despite a confidentiality waiver from the Liberal government.

Wilson-Raybould wrote to the committee chair, Liberal MP Anthony Housefather, late Tuesday to say the parameters outlined in Monday's waiver would not allow her to speak freely on issues related to her resignation from cabinet or her time as veterans affairs minister.",Trudeau insists Wilson-Raybould can 'speak fully' on SNC-Lavalin affair,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/wilson-raybould-testifies-justice-committee-1.5035219

(File)

Canada's opposition leader formally asked federal police on Thursday to investigate a claim of political meddling by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government in the criminal prosecution of engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

The House of Commons scheduled an emergency debate Thursday on the deepening controversy, the most serious faced by Trudeau since assuming office in 2015.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer accused the Liberal prime minister's inner circle of possibly attempting to obstruct justice, in a letter to Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner Brenda Lucki -- which the RCMP confirmed to AFP it has received.

""The matter at hand appears, on its face, to be a gross violation of the law,"" Scheer wrote.

He pointed to ""explosive testimony"" by former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould, who told the House of Commons justice committee on Wednesday that Trudeau's staff and other senior officials applied undue pressure on her to settle a criminal case against SNC-Lavalin.

The Montreal-based company was charged in 2015 with corruption for allegedly bribing officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011 to secure government contracts during former strongman Muammar Al Gaddafi's reign.

Wilson-Raybould, after resigning from cabinet, testified that she experienced a ""consistent and sustained effort"" to politically interfere in the prosecution of one of the world's top engineering firms.

She added that she faced ""veiled threats,"" and described the intense pressure on her to comply as ""inappropriate,"" but stopped short of suggesting it was illegal.

In the end, Wilson-Raybould refused to ask prosecutors to settle, and the trial is set to proceed.

Trudeau has rejected her characterizations of events, saying Wednesday that he had made clear to his former attorney general that the ""decision around SNC-Lavalin was Jody Wilson-Raybould's and hers alone to make.""

Thursday morning, dodging calls to resign, he said: ""My team and I have always acted in a professional manner.""

""Canadians expect their government to look for ways to protect jobs, to grow the economy, and that's exactly what we've done every step of the way ... in a way that has respected our laws and respects the independence of the judiciary,"" he added.

For weeks, Trudeau's Liberal government has been rocked by the allegations first reported by The Globe and Mail newspaper, only eight months before elections.

Canada's ethics commissioner has launched an investigation into the matter.

389,Empty,2019-02-25T17:25:42Z,Scheer says it is clear now that Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin successfully lobbied the government for the criminal code to be changed to avoid a criminal prosecution.,"OTTAWA—Canadians should be outraged that Liberal politicians made any attempt to influence the outcome of a criminal case, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer says. Scheer introduced a House of Commons motion Monday afternoon that would demand Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appear at the Commons justice committee to explain his role in allegations former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould was pressured not to proceed with a criminal prosecution of Quebec engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

“Quite simply what we’ve seen unfold over the last two weeks is a textbook case of government corruption with those at the very top of the Prime Minister’s Office implicated in what could very well be the obstruction of justice,” Scheer said in a news conference before introducing the motion. Scheer said Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick’s testimony to the justice committee last week made it clear that SNC-Lavalin successfully lobbied the government for the Criminal Code to be changed to allow for remediation agreements. Those allow companies to avoid a criminal prosecution in exchange for accepting responsibility for wrongdoing, paying fines and reparation to any victims, relinquishing any financial benefit from the actions and showing changes to prevent misdeeds from being repeated. Striking such an agreement would mean SNC-Lavalin could avoid a criminal prosecution in Canada for allegations it bribed officials in Libya to win contracts there.

Scheer said the Liberals launched “an unsolicited, co-ordinated and sustained effort by the PM himself to get the former attorney general to change her decision. “Canadians need to be outraged at the suggestion that politicians were putting pressure on independent agents of the Crown, independent legal officers, to try to get a better deal for well connected friends of the Liberal party,” Scheer said. “That is unacceptable and we need to be outraged about this because of the implications it has on the entire justice system across the country.”

The Liberals don’t appear ready to support the Conservative motion to call Trudeau to testify. The motion would not be binding in any event, and a Commons committee can’t summon a sitting MP to appear before it. Arif Virani, the Liberal parliamentary secretary to the minister of justice, said in the House of Commons there isn’t a need for the Commons to inject itself into the proceedings of the justice committee. If the committee wants to call certain witnesses the committee members can decide who they want to hear from, he said. “Committees of this house do exemplary work,” said Virani. “We’re confident that the committee hearings will continue to be thoroughly and fairly conducted and will provide Canadians with the answers and information that they seek.” Thus far the committee has heard from Wernick, deputy justice minister Nathalie Drouin and current Justice Minister David Lametti. Lametti replaced Wilson-Raybould in the job in January, when she was shuffled to veterans affairs. She resigned from cabinet altogether a few days after the allegations of improper pressure were first raised, but continues to sit as a Liberal MP. She is expected to testify at the committee this week but no date or time has been confirmed. Trudeau denies any improper conduct occurred and that any conversations on the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin were done with Wilson-Raybould knowing the final decision was hers alone.

“It’s fair to say it’s a constitutional crisis,” Turpel-Lafond said Wednesday night, invoking a term often used to describe the breakdown of the rules underpinning a system of government. The events, as outlined by Wilson-Raybould in marathon testimony before the House of Commons justice committee, “shake the foundations of our very system,” Turpel-Lafond said. Wilson-Raybould told MPs she was repeatedly and inappropriately pressured by senior members of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s staff, as well as the country’s top bureaucrat, to cut a deal for SNC-Lavalin to avoid criminal trial on charges of fraud and corruption.

Wilson-Raybould refused, and found herself shuffled to a different cabinet portfolio in January. Former Ontario attorney general Michael Bryant agreed the scandal amounts to a constitutional crisis, saying Trudeau seems insistent on “interfering with the prosecution.”

Article Continued Below

“That conflicts with a system that requires independence from political influence. It opens the door to prosecuting enemies of the government and giving immunity to its friends which is despotic,” Bryant, who is now the executive director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, told the Star. He said the actions of the PMO, as laid out by Wilson-Raybould, undermine public faith in the independence of the judicial process. In the fallout from Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called on Trudeau and Michael Wernick, the clerk of the privy council, to resign. Irwin Cotler, a former Liberal attorney general of Canada, said he doesn’t believe Trudeau should step down or that “there was an intent on the part of the government to cross the line.” “I believe that they felt they were asking her to engage in what they believed was a matter of public policy for the importance of Canada and the importance of Quebec, jobs and the like, which she acknowledged was OK,” Cotler said. But at a minimum, Turpel-Lafond said the RCMP’s integrity section must investigate, noting that 11 highly placed people in the PMO, the public service and cabinet were named by Wilson-Raybould as lobbying her or her staff on the issue. “The consequences for that is that our reputation as a nation of the rule of law will be in tatters if we do not take steps,” Turpel-Lafond said. “And the steps need to be significant, decisive.” Alex Boutilier is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

On Wednesday, former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, an MP who was once the country's top prosecutor before resigning from Trudeau's cabinet, testified to a Parliamentary committee about the ""political pressure"" and ""veiled threats"" she endured as Trudeau and members of his office pushed her to offer a deferred prosecution agreement to Quebec-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin. Her testimony directly implicated Trudeau, who, according to Wilson-Raybould, insinuated during a meeting last year that he needed her to go easy on SNC-Lavalin to improve his prospects for reelection (he reminded her that he's an MP representing an area of Quebec that could be hurt by job losses if SNC-Lavalin decided to move).

Justin Trudeau

And although Trudeau's support within the Liberal Party remains relatively steady - he told reporters on Wednesday that he has no plans to resign - opposition figures are doing their best to stoke public anger with Trudeau. Late Wednesday, after Wilson-Raybould had finished her testimony, Canada's Conservative opposition leader Andrew Scheer demanded Trudeau resign, saying the prime minister had ""lost his moral authority"" to govern.

Here's more from Al Jazeera:

Andrew Scheer said late on Wednesday that Trudeau ""has lost moral authority to govern"" and ""must resign"" at once. ""Mr Trudeau can no longer, in good standing and with a clear conscience, lead this great nation,"" he added.

Trudeau has steadfastly disputed Wilson-Raybould's characterization of what happened, and insisted that he didn't do anything improper.

Wilson-Raybould left his government earlier this month after being abruptly transferred to lead the country's Veterans Affairs ministry, which was widely seen as a demotion. In her testimony, Wilson-Raybould implicated at least 11 employees in Trudeau's office and members of the privy council for participating in the pressure campaign.

392,Empty,2019-02-27T20:10:01Z,Tom Parkin: Andrew Scheer is pinned down with a Max Bernier problem. And Jagmeet Singh is finally freed to take on the struggling Liberals. The post The election battle lines being drawn appeared first on Macleans.ca.,"Two new confrontations were laid bare by Monday’s byelections. And how, in the months upcoming, political parties play out these pre-election challenges will frame the final showdown, which ends when Canadians head to the polls in October.

In Burnaby South, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh improved the NDP vote considerably and won his seat comfortably—revealing that the endless winability doubts were more partisan concern trolling than political science. In York-Simcoe, his NDP result was status quo. In Outremount, his NDP exceeded expectations scoring 26 per cent support, but lost the seat. Quebec challenges lie ahead.

Trudeau’s Liberals should certainly take comfort in re-taking Outremont—but dropping eight points in Burnaby South and nine points in York-Simcoe should concern them. The average result across the three byelections would yield a minority—Liberals 32 per cent, Conservatives 29 per cent, NDP 27 per cent. And those results echo the Liberals’ poll support, which droops as Canadians muddle through the detail and arrive at the central fact that Trudeau and his staff repeatedly intervened with the attorney general in an effort to stop the corruption prosecution of a major Liberal donor.

READ MORE: The real bad news in Burnaby South might be for Andrew Scheer

The real loser on Monday night was Andrew Scheer. He has Bernier problems. Conservative support in Burnaby South dropped deeper into third place, bleeding to Bernier’s hard-right People’s Party. In Outremont, the Conservatives ran fifth. While they held York-Simcoe, a four-point boost is not the tide required to sweep Scheer to government. And unlike in Burnaby South, in York-Simcoe the Conservatives faced no threat from the People’s Party candidate, who simply failed to launch, earning just two per cent support.

Laid bare by the Burnaby South results, Scheer’s strategic problem is that the People’s Party has him pinned. He needs to fight the far-right People’s Party by appealing to its far-right supporters. That’s tough to do without alienating mainstream conservatives.

Scheer’s role at the recent “convoy” rally in Ottawa is a snap-shot of the problem. Though watching Scheer compete with Maxime Bernier and Faith Goldy—a politician on the white nationalist fringe—for the support of a rally infiltrated with yellow-vests must be stomach-turning for mainstream conservatives, there he was. And Scheer couldn’t not be there, fearing Bernier would claim unrivaled leadership of the rally.

Thanks to Bernier, Scheer is unable to turn against the far-right, unable to turn to them, with no clear way forward. This is one of the two critical pre-election fights.

The stage for the other key fight was set on Monday as Singh’s win finally unpinned the NDP from its Burnaby South focus. Trudeau’s months of byelection delay kept Singh on the west coast, unable to continue his introduction in Quebec, a crucial battleground where he is not well known. But with his byelection test now won, Singh can make his critical pivot to Quebec to confront the Liberals.

Singh walks into the Quebec confrontation armed with a 15-member Quebec caucus and a durable, if eroded, political base—certainly he leads a Quebec political force many-fold better than what former NDP Leader Jack Layton had in the 2011 election run-up.

And the terrain of this coming confrontation has many features—most obviously, the Prime Minister’s repeated, lobbyist-fueled interventions with the attorney general in an apparent attempt to stop the corruption prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

The Trudeau Liberals are betting on the position that Quebecers, and Montrealers in particular, will excuse the PM’s effort to block a criminal prosecution because Trudeau says he was doing it to benefit Quebec. Singh and the NDP will try to pierce Trudeau’s veil of Quebec identity politics. Certainly, Liberals doing political favours for political friends remains an open sore in Montreal. So this skirmish will be fascinating to watch.

Another legal action, the trial of former vice-admiral Mark Norman, could add insight into the Liberal friends and favours political approach. Norman is charged with breach of trust by leaking confidential information while the Trudeau cabinet was considering switching a $670 million ship-building contract from Quebec City’s Davie Shipyard to the Halifax shipyard of the billionaire Irving family. Norman’s defense team will explore the relationship between former minister Scott Brison and the Irving family. Brison quit cabinet shortly after court documents listed him as a trial witness.

And in Quebec there are hilltops to be gained by attacking Trudeau’s failure to meet carbon targets and buying a bitumen pipeline. There is concern about failing to protect culture from massive corporations like Netflix. There is anger at tax haven inaction. Trudeau may be the government, he may be ahead – it doesn’t mean Quebecers wouldn’t choose a better option, if it came along.

A critical strategic objective of the NDP has always been to create a bond between progressive voters in Quebec and across Canada. Antipathy to Liberals whose idea of federalism is doing favours for insider friends in both official languages—at the expense of the people of Canada, including Quebecers—may be just the bond the NDP needs. With Singh now unpinned, and Scheer trapped in a side-battle with Bernier, the NDP has a few pre-election months to strengthen that bond.

They are going to have a tough time convincing Canadians","Contrary to what you might have read in all newspapers, the country is not going to the dogs — it’s going to the moon.

We are assured that Justin Trudeau did not arrange for Canada to join the U.S.-led lunar mission just to deflect attention from Jody Wilson-Raybould’s testimony at the justice committee. But the prime minister must have been mightily relieved to look at his itinerary for Thursday and see that it included the announcement at the Canada Space Agency headquarters in Saint-Hubert, Que., rather than answering questions about prosecutorial interference in the House of Commons.

In Saint-Hubert, he was asked about the SNC-Lavalin scandal and reiterated that his team acted professionally and appropriately. He said he disagreed with the former attorney general’s “characterization” of events.

Among Liberals Thursday there was a palpable sense of relief, such as might be felt by someone who’s just had hip replacement surgery — it’s still painful but there is a feeling the worst is over.

They’re probably right. Andrew Scheer, the Conservative leader, has over-reached by calling for Trudeau’s resignation — that’s not going to happen, as long as he maintains he and his staff acted appropriately, and Liberal polling numbers remain in the 30-40 per cent support range.

The only way he is forced out is if there is a split in Liberal ranks and that is not happening.

On the contrary, most Liberal MPs sound angry at Wilson-Raybould for putting their jobs at risk. Politics is a team sport, they argue, and she should have done what she was told by the leader at whose pleasure she served, or she should have resigned.

That will not be a popular view in the country, or one that MPs will express publicly, but it is held widely.

There is a sense in caucus that the prime minister is reaping the whirlwind after appointing as justice minister someone who was not a partisan Liberal.

But far from sending out her colleagues to besmirch Wilson-Raybould’s reputation, the Prime Minister’s Office is trying to rein in caucus anger and stop a repeat of the public haranguing directed at the former attorney general by B.C. Liberal MP Jati Sidhu. He told the Abbotsford News that Wilson-Raybould is not a team player and suggested her father may be “pulling the strings.” He later apologized for his comments but he is far from alone in thinking them.

In the absence of a caucus revolt, Trudeau should be able to ride out the storm. There is even anticipation in Liberal ranks at the prospect of being able to comment freely, now that Wilson-Raybould’s allegations are out in the open.

Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s former principal secretary, who is alleged by Wilson-Raybould to have told her former chief of staff that any solution “involves some interference,” wrote to the justice committee chair, Anthony Housefather, requesting an opportunity to give his side of the story.

The committee will also hear again from Michael Wernick, clerk of the Privy Council, and Nathalie Drouin, the deputy minister of Justice.

There is a genuine belief in Liberal ranks that, while Wilson-Raybould has told the truth, it is not the whole truth, and does not reflect the intent of the range of actors who were motivated by a desire to protect jobs at SNC.

They are going to have their work cut out for them convincing Canadians who appear to sympathize with the former attorney general’s viewpoint that the persistent and relentless nature of the attempts to make her change her mind over whether to offer SNC a deferred prosecution agreement was inappropriate.

They are going to have to be persuasive if they are planning to argue that the attorney general was not removed from her cabinet post because of a position she took and refused to change.

And they are going to have to make a compelling case if they are going to refute Wilson-Raybould’s allegation that, after she was shuffled, her former deputy minister at Justice was told by the clerk of the Privy Council that her replacement could expect to have an early conversation with the prime minister about SNC.

Yet, if they can place doubt in the minds of the jury, the Liberals will probably have done enough.

The SNC-Lavalin affair reduces the chances of the Liberals repeating their majority government feat of 2015. But are we going to see voters entering the polling booth in October vowing to defeat Trudeau because he may have applied undue pressure on one of his own ministers and breached the Shawcross doctrine? Unfortunately for the voters who would like to give Trudeau a one-way ticket to the moon, those people probably don’t exist in sufficient numbers to bring down a government.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told the House of Commons Monday he has waived solicitor-client privilege, freeing the former justice minister to talk about “relevant matters” as long as she does not touch on two court cases involving SNC-Lavalin.

Meanwhile, Wilson-Raybould said in a letter to the committee chair that she is willing to testify at the “first opportunity,” but wants to make sure there is clarity on possible constraints on what she can say — which suggests it may not be in the next couple of days.

While we don’t know when Wilson-Raybould will appear at committee, we do know she wants 30 minutes for an opening statement. You don’t need half an hour to say that the whole SNC-Lavalin saga, and recent allegations of political interference in the justice system, are just a big misunderstanding.

On Monday afternoon the committee heard from a former Saskatchewan judge who has gone on record as saying the affair should be investigated by the RCMP if there is evidence Wilson-Raybould was shuffled to another portfolio over her refusal to reconsider her position on asking the director of public prosecutions to offer SNC a deferred prosecution agreement. Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond has said a police investigation would be necessary to restore public confidence in the administration of justice, calling the prospect of the attempted influence over a prosecution “not only immoral, (but) illegal.”

Last week I suggested that Wilson-Raybould’s appearance at cabinet and Liberal caucus might auger a closing of ranks and an attempt by all sides to tamp down more controversy. After the clerk of the Privy Council’s unconventional committee appearance last week and Wilson-Raybould’s letter of intent, I’m less sure.

The appearance at committee of Michael Wernick, Canada’s top bureaucrat, suggested he thinks there is nothing to see here — that Canadians should have faith in the system because laws are “demonstrably working” when it comes to prosecutorial independence, lobbying and government ethics. “The shields held,” he said last Thursday.

As to his own conversation with Wilson-Raybould on December 19th last year, he made clear he believes it was neither immoral nor illegal. He said he told the then-attorney general her colleagues and the prime minister were “quite anxious” about the future of SNC and discussed whether a deferred prosecution agreement for the company was still an option. “I can tell you with complete assurance that my view of the conversation is that it was within the boundaries of what is lawful and appropriate,” he said. “I was informing the minister of context.”

The adjudicator of whether Wernick, and perhaps even the prime minister himself, crossed any lines will be the ethics commissioner. If prosecutors agree with Turpel-Lafond, the affair may even end up before the courts and be settled by a judge.

But what perplexes me is why Wernick, the prime minister, and senior advisers Gerald Butts and Katie Telford even discussed a remediation agreement for SNC after Wilson-Raybould made clear she was not disposed to negotiate one, when a perfectly sound plan B was already being worked on.

As my colleague Gabriel Friedman revealed in the Post on Saturday, the department of Public Services and Procurement is finalizing changes to the Ineligibility and Suspension Policy under the Integrity regime. This word salad governs whether corporations convicted of crimes can bid on federal projects.

SNC’s fear is that a conviction on corruption charges for bribing Libyan officials could lead to a 10-year ban on access to government infrastructure projects — the source of around 15 per cent of its $9 billion in revenue in 2017.

But the changes being contemplated by the government could reduce the ineligibility period from the automatically mandated 10 years to a debarment at the government’s discretion.

This policy change has been in the works for years — the public was invited to comment back in fall 2017 and the government says the update is being “studied and finalized.” A statement in the revised policy consultation said it is expected to take effect in “early 2019.”

One lawyer Friedman quoted said the debarment could conceivably be reduced to six months, a year or even no ineligibility at all. The proposed changes would widen the scope of offences that could lead to debarment, including human trafficking and environmental violations. The idea is that a one-size-fits-all punishment must be made more flexible if the range of offences is broadened.

SNC chief executive Neil Bruce has said the failure to secure a DPA would likely lead to three to four more years of court battles because the company considers itself not guilty.

But unless I’m missing something, a DPA would require an admission of culpability.

Under the new integrity regime, the company would also have to admit to wrongdoing before throwing itself on the mercy of the Registrar of Ineligibility and Suspension at Public Services. But, in that event, the company could claim mitigating circumstances, because the executives who perpetrated the alleged corruption have left and steps have been taken to ensure there is no repeat of the errant conduct.

So if the government already had an alternative to a deferred prosecution agreement that is expected to become policy in the next month or so, why did the prime minister and his most senior advisors risk flirting with immorality, if not illegality?

As Conservative leader Andrew Scheer asked Monday, if the decision to grant or refuse a deferred prosecution agreement was Wilson-Raybould’s alone — as the prime minister maintains — why did he apply “relentless pressure” to get her to change her mind?

The only answer that makes any sense is: because he could.

DRIVING THE DAY

NEW: BOB BARNETT, the Williams and Connolly attorney, is shopping around a book by Gary Cohn to publishers in New York. Cohn was a central character in “Fear,” the Bob Woodward book.

FOOD FOR THOUGHT … THIS WEEK, with the president in Hanoi, it looks like he is going to have a pretty horrible week in Washington. First, as our colleagues report below, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP will likely be handed a defeat when Congress rejects his emergency declaration. The House is going to vote it down, and it increasingly looks like the Senate will too.

-- AND SECOND, Michael Cohen, the president’s former attorney, will be on the Hill testifying for the next three days. Just one session is open: tomorrow’s House Oversight Committee hearing, chaired by MARYLAND REP. ELIJAH CUMMINGS. Cummings gaggled Monday night in the Capitol for a bit with reporters, and said a moment like this is “very significant."" Cummings added that he thinks people will be talking about Trump and the investigations 200 years from now.

-- NYT’S MAGGIE HABERMAN: “Cohen ... is planning on portraying his onetime client in starkly negative terms when he testifies Wednesday before a House committee, and on describing what he says was Mr. Trump’s use of racist language, lies about his wealth and possible criminal conduct.” NYT

BURGESS EVERETT and MARIANNE LEVINE: “Trump on brink of defeat on border emergency”: “President Donald Trump is on the verge of a bipartisan rejection of his emergency declaration at the border, in what would be an embarrassing rebuke by a Congress opposed to his immigration agenda.

“Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) on Monday night said he would join Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) along with 47 Senate Democrats to block Trump’s attempts to secure billions for his border wall after lawmakers effectively stiffed him. Now just one more GOP senator’s support for a resolution to block Trump's bid would send the measure to Trump’s desk and force a veto. …

“Interviews on Monday with more than a dozen GOP senators who have been publicly critical of Trump’s unilateral maneuver or warned him not to deploy it were cagey about their intentions for what would be a crucial vote on the Senate floor in coming weeks. Many said they were undecided and still studying Trump’s move to circumvent Congress and score billions more for the border barrier.” POLITICO … Tillis’ WaPo op-ed

-- SENATE REPUBLICANS have held back on publicly rebuking the president on a number of issues, but the emergency declaration appears to be a step too far for many who have long privately criticized Trump and his policies.

WHERE THE HOUSE IS … SARAH FERRIS and MELANIE ZANONA: “House GOP leaders work to contain defections on Trump’s emergency”

THE SUMMIT …

-- THE PRESIDENT is en route to Hanoi from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, per pooler Eli Stokols of the L.A. Times. Trump also stopped at RAF Mildenhall in the United Kingdom.

-- THE SCHEDULE, per Stokols: Wednesday: TRUMP will meet with the Vietnamese president and prime minister, and will have dinner with Kim Jong Un, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Kim Yong Chol and another North Korean associate.

-- ELIANA JOHNSON in Hanoi and RUAIRÍ ARRIETA-KENNA: “Trump’s blind spot on North Korea could sink a deal: The president has sold Kim Jong Un on peace and prosperity. But North Korea’s record on human rights stands in the way.”

-- DRAMA WITH AMERICAN MEDIA ALREADY … WAPO’S DAVID NAKAMURA and JOHN HUDSON in Hanoi: “Kim was staying at the Melia hotel tower in the heart of the city, but the hotel also happened to have been booked by the White House as the filing center for the traveling press corps to cover the summit.

“Not long before Kim arrived, a notice was distributed to the press corps that the filing center would be moved to a separate filing center for the international press corps at the Cultural Friendship Palace. …

“Television network producers had spent weeks setting up cameras, lights, monitors and other equipment shipped halfway across the world. A person with knowledge of the situation said the networks were told they could no longer do liveshots from the Melia, although the correspondents booked to stay in the hotel were not told they had to leave.” WaPo

“In a 47-page filing, Manafort’s attorneys described a client who has been ‘personally, professionally, and financially’ broken by special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation and who deserves a sentence ‘significantly’ below the statutory maximum of 10 years he faces after pleading guilty in Washington to a pair of conspiracy charges.” POLITICO … The filing

-- BEHIND THE SCENES: “It’s Mueller’s Investigation. But Right Behind Him Is Andrew Goldstein,” by NYT’s Noah Weiland and Michael Schmidt: “The routine was always the same. President Trump’s lawyers would drive to heavily secured offices near the National Mall, surrender their cellphones, head into a windowless conference room and resume tense negotiations over whether the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, would interview Mr. Trump.

“But Mr. Mueller was not always there. Instead, the lawyers tangled with a team of prosecutors, including a little known but formidable adversary: Andrew D. Goldstein, 44, a former Time magazine reporter who is now a lead prosecutor for Mr. Mueller in the investigation into whether the president obstructed justice. ...

“As evidence built over two years, Mr. Goldstein functioned as a repository of conversations that Mr. Trump had with lawyers, advisers and top law enforcement officials from early 2017 on. Among Mr. Goldstein’s jewels, according to Mr. Trump’s lawyers: exhaustive notes taken by Annie Donaldson, [Don] McGahn’s former chief of staff, which detailed in real time Mr. Trump’s behavior in the West Wing.” NYT

“Kelly Craft pulled off one unquestionable achievement in her stint as ambassador to Canada under Trump: She maintained good relations with Ottawa, even as her boss imposed tariffs and bashed Canada. ... At an Independence Day party Craft hosted last year at her Ottawa residence, some Canadians were so angry the president took the unprecedented step of imposing national-security tariffs that people boycotted the party.

“Those who did attend took home memories of the ambassador pouring tumblers of bourbon from her home state of Kentucky. ‘People were having a lot of fun,’ Ottawa lobbyist Greg MacEachern recalled. ‘She was really knowledgeable about the bourbon.’ Craft’s knowledge of other issues is about to be severely tested.

396,Empty,2019-02-27T21:46:22Z,Her remarks to the House of Commons justice committee deepen what is already the biggest crisis of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s tenure,"OTTAWA — In a stunning appearance before the House of Commons justice committee Wednesday, former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould accused the entire senior ranks of the federal government of making ‘veiled threats’ against her while attempting to interfere politically in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Sitting alone at a table in a packed basement room in Parliament’s West Block, Wilson-Raybould told the committee’s MPs that over a four-month period in late 2018 she was pressured by finance minister Bill Morneau and his staff, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, senior aides in the Prime Minister’s Office including former principal secretary Gerald Butts and chief of staff Katie Telford, and even Prime Minister Justin Trudeau himself — all of whom were eager for her to direct federal prosecutors to defer the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin on corruption and fraud charges and negotiate a remediation agreement instead.

“For a period of approximately four months between September and December of 2018 I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people in the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion,” Wilson-Raybould said.

Wilson-Raybould said partisan concerns were repeatedly raised in connection with the SNC-Lavalin case, including by Trudeau, who she claims pointed out to her in a September conversation that he was himself a Quebec MP and raised the political consequences of prosecuting a large Montreal-based company during the then-ongoing Quebec election.

A corruption conviction for SNC-Lavalin, a massive Montreal-based engineering company, would mean the company is barred from bidding on federal procurement contracts for ten years. Remediation agreements see a company admit wrongdoing, pay a fine, and obey other compliance conditions, but avoid a guilty conviction in court.

She said the conversations were “clearly inappropriate” and included the suggestion that “a collision with the prime minister on these matters should be avoided.” She said one conversation with Wernick on Dec. 19, 2018, had her thinking of the Saturday Night Massacre, a reference to U.S. President Richard Nixon’s firing of the independent prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal. Indeed, in a cabinet shuffle the following month, Trudeau moved Wilson-Raybould from her role as attorney general and justice minister to Veterans Affairs, a move she thought may have resulted from her refusal to comply with the prime minister’s wishes on the SNC-Lavalin case. However, she said, the PMO denied that this was the reason she was moved to a different cabinet portfolio.

Wilson-Raybould said it was not wrong for senior officials to raise concerns about job losses in the “early stages” of the decision, but once the decision was made, the “long sustained discussions about the job losses” crossed the line — and then became worse.

“Leaving aside job losses … where they became very clearly inappropriate was when political issues came up like the election in Quebec, like losing the election if SNC were to move their headquarters, conversations like that,” Wilson-Raybould said.

“Conversations like the one I had with the clerk of the privy council who invoked the prime minister’s name throughout the entirety of the conversation, spoke to me about the prime minister being dug-in, spoke to me about his concerns as to what would happen. In my mind those were veiled threats and I took them as such. That is entirely inappropriate.”

Speaking from Montreal after the committee testimony, Trudeau said he “completely disagrees” with Wilson-Raybould’s characterization of events, and said the decision on the SNC-Lavalin case was always “hers alone.” Yet he declined to respond to any of the specific allegations Wilson-Raybould made about comments from him and his senior staff.

“I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff alway acted appropriately and professionally,” he said. “Our government will always focus on jobs and our economy. We of course had discussions about the potential loss of 9,000 jobs in communities across the country, including the possible impact on pensions.”

Asked whether Wilson-Raybould should remain in caucus, Trudeau said he had not reviewed her testimony in full yet, and would make decisions on that once he had.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, meanwhile, said Trudeau had lost the moral authority to govern and called on him to resign.

“Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this country now that Canadians know what he has done,” Scheer said. “That is why I am calling on Mr. Trudeau to do the right thing and to resign. Further, the RCMP must immediately open an investigation, if it has not already done so, into the numerous examples of obstruction of justice the former attorney general detailed in her testimony.”

He also called for Wernick’s resignation.

Asked if the RCMP was investigating allegations of political interference in the matter — or planned to investigate — the force’s deputy commissioner Gilles Michaud said “it would be inappropriate to confirm or deny the existence of a criminal investigation.”

NDP leader Jagmeet Singh said Wednesday evening that while Trudeau may eventually need to step down, for now his party is calling for a public inquiry to bring out the facts.

“What we need to do is get to the truth, and that’s what a public inquiry will do,” he said. “He may need to resign because of this, but … a public inquiry will get to the bottom, get to the heart of this.”

Wilson-Raybould’s testimony included detailed accounts of conversations, telephone calls, emails, and text messages with 11 senior government officials. “For most of these conversations, I made contemporaneous and detailed notes,” she said. “Notes, in addition to my clear memory, which I am relying on today among other documentation.”

The officials named in her testimony included Trudeau, Telford and Butts, who resigned last week amid controversy over his role in the SNC-Lavalin scandal; senior PMO advisors Elder Marques and Mathieu Bouchard; Morneau and his chief of staff, Ben Chin; and Wernick, the ostensibly nonpartisan head of the federal public service whose testimony before the committee last week some observers criticized for being partisan in tone and content.

After federal prosecutors decided on Sept. 4 against a remediation agreement for SNC-Lavalin, it took only two days for Morneau’s chief of staff to contact Wilson-Raybould’s chief of staff, Jessica Prince.

“He wanted to talk about SNC and what we could do, if anything, to address this,” Wilson-Raybould said. “He said to her that if they don’t get a DPA, they will leave Montreal, and it’s the Quebec election right now, so we can’t have that happen. He said that they have a big meeting coming up on Tuesday and that this bad news may go public.”

She said the first time PMO staff contacted her office was Sept. 16, when Marques and Bouchard had a phone call with Prince.

“They said that they understand that the individual Crown prosecutor wants to negotiate an agreement, but the Director (of Public Prosecutions) does not,” Wilson-Raybould said. She said they started to discuss what a “reasonable solution” might look like, such as getting outside advice to the prosecutors, while acknowledging that “that there are limits on what can be done, and that they can’t direct.” She said they also brought up the “Quebec election context.”

It's the Quebec election right now, so we can't have that happen

On Sept. 17, she had a meeting with Trudeau that she had previously requested on another subject. Wernick was unexpectedly also in attendance. She said Trudeau raised the SNC-Lavalin case “immediately.”

“The prime minister asks me to help out, to find a solution here for SNC, citing that if there was no (deferred prosecution) there would be many jobs lost and that SNC will move from Montreal,” she said. She said she told him she had made up her mind, and was not going to interfere with the decision of federal prosecutors.

She said the discussion continued, with Wernick making the argument that the company could leave Canada if the prosecution continued.

“At that point (Trudeau) jumped in, stressing that there is an election in Quebec and that ‘I am an MP in Quebec — the member for Papineau,” Wilson-Raybould said. “I was quite taken aback. My response, and I remember this vividly, was to ask (Trudeau) a direct question while looking him in the eye. I asked: ‘Are you politically interfering with my role, my decision as the AG? I would strongly advise against it.’ The prime minister said ‘No, No, No — we just need to find a solution.’”

Two days later, on Sept. 19, she said Morneau spoke with her in the House of Commons.

“He again stressed the need to save jobs, and I told him that engagements from his office to mine on SNC had to stop, that they were inappropriate,” she said. But the next day, she said, her chief of staff had two phone calls from aides in Morneau’s office, including Chin.

After that, things went quiet for a while, Wilson-Raybould said. Then on Oct. 18, the PMO’s Bouchard called her chief of staff to suggest looking at the option of getting an external legal opinion on the issue.

The next day, SNC-Lavalin filed a Federal Court case challenging the prosecution service’s decision not to negotiate a remediation agreement. “In my view, this necessarily put to rest any notion that I might speak to or intervene with the (director of public prosecutions), or that an external review could take place,” she said.

Yet she went on to detail many more meetings and phone calls from PMO staff.

She met with Butts on Dec. 5, and she said she told him “how I needed everyone to stop talking to me about SNC as I had made up my mind and the engagements were inappropriate.”

“Gerry then took over the conversation and said how we need a solution on the SNC stuff, he said I needed to find a solution,” she said. She alleges he told her that the Director of Public Prosecutions Act, which separated the prosecution service from the justice department, “was set up by (former Prime Minister Stephen) Harper,” and that he “does not like the law.”

The two final meetings came on Dec. 18 and Dec. 19. The first one had Butts and Telford meeting with Prince, and pushing her to find a solution. Wilson-Raybould read out text messages that Prince sent her after the meeting, including the allegation that Butts had said: “Jess, there is no solution here that doesn’t involve some interference.”

Prince also texted that Butts and Telford were keen on having Wilson-Raybould retain a former Supreme Court justice to get advice on the matter, saying it would “give us cover in the business and legal community” and “allow the PM to say we were doing something.”

“(Telford) was like ‘if Jody is nervous, we would of course line up all kinds of people to write op-eds saying that what she is doing is proper,’” Wilson-Raybould said Prince texted her.

The next day, she had a phone call with Wernick. “The Clerk said that the PM is quite determined, quite firm, he wants to know why the (deferred prosecution) route which Parliament provided for isn’t being used,” Wilson-Raybould said. “He said ‘I think he is gonna find a way to get it done one way or another. So, he is in that kinda mood and I wanted you to be aware of that.’”

Wilson-Raybould said she told Wernick they were “treading on dangerous ground,” that the attorney general cannot act in partisan way and that “all of this screams of that.”

She said Wernick insisted that “it is not good for the prime minister and his attorney general to be at ‘loggerheads.’” She told him she was starting to have thoughts of the “Saturday Night Massacre.”

On Jan. 7, Trudeau called Wilson-Raybould to inform her she would be removed as justice minister and attorney general. “I will not go into details of this call, or subsequent communications about the shuffle, but I will say that I stated I believed the reason was because of the SNC matter,” she said. “They denied this to be the case.”

Following her opening statement, Wilson-Raybould took six rounds of questions from Liberal, Conservative and NDP MPs.

“I have to say that I am very shaken by what I’ve heard here today,” the NDP’s Murray Rankin said. “I’ve been a lawyer for over 40 years, I’ve taught a generation of law students about the rule of law, and what I’ve heard today should make all Canadians extremely upset.”

Liberal MPs focused many of their questions on why she didn’t immediately resign, and why she stayed in cabinet after she was shuffled to Veterans Affairs in January (she subsequently resigned after the SNC-Lavalin story hit the media).

“I decided that I would take the prime minister at this word, I trusted him, I had confidence in him, and so I decided to continue on around the cabinet table with the concerns that I had around SNC because I took the prime minister at his word,” she said.

“Do you have confidence in the prime minister today?” asked Liberal MP Randy Boissonnault.

Wilson-Raybould paused for a long time before answering. “I’ll say this … I resigned from cabinet because I did not have confidence to sit around the table, the cabinet table,” she said. “That’s why I resigned.”

Later, she was asked again by Liberal MP Jennifer O’Connell if she had confidence in Trudeau.

Said Wilson-Raybould, “I’m not sure how that question is relevant.”

Ms Wilson-Raybould gave testimony before the Canadian House of Commons justice committee for several hours on Wednesday, speaking out against members of staff and Prime Minister Trudeau attempting to interfere with an investigation into the SNC-Lavalin corporation, The Globe and Mail reports.

Accusations that the prime minister and the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) interfered with the SNC-Lavalin investigation first emerged on February 7th.

The engineering company, which is based in Quebec, was accused of engaging in bribery in Libya in efforts to secure lucrative contracts in the country.

Since the accusations were made public, further allegations have revealed that the corporation may also have gone as far as paying for prostitutes for Saadi Gadhafi, son of former Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, during a visit to Canada in 2008.

Receipts claim that the company spent as much as $30,000 on prostitutes for Gadhafi while he was allegedly in Montreal and Toronto at the invitation of the company to learn English.

Initially, after the first Globe and Mail report on the SNC-Lavalin affair, the accusations were dismissed by Trudeau and the PMO.

Justin Trudeau’s Top Adviser Resigns amid Corruption Scandal https://t.co/vAZMBhuUXF — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 19, 2019

Only weeks later, Trudeau’s chief adviser, and one of his closest confidants, Gerald Butts resigned abruptly from his position as principal secretary in the PMO.

Butts denied that his resignation had anything to do with the SNC-Lavalin affair saying accusations that he or others put pressure on former Attorney General Wilson-Raybould were “simply not true.”

Until Wednesday, Ms Wilson-Raybould had been unable to comment on the matter but was free to do so in front of the justice committee.

In her testimony, Wilson-Raybould made bombshell allegations towards Trudeau and the PMO saying, “For a period of approximately four months between September and December 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the Attorney General of Canada in an inappropriate effort to secure a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with SNC-Lavalin.”

“These events involved 11 people (excluding myself and my political staff) – from the Prime Minister’s Office, the Privy Council Office, and the Office of the Minister of Finance,” she added.

One of the most damning pieces of testimony involved an alleged discussion between Wilson-Raybould and Trudeau:

The Prime Minister asks me to help out – to find a solution here for SNC – citing that if there was no DPA there would be many jobs lost and that SNC will move from Montreal. In response, I explained to him the law… I told him that I had done my due diligence and made up my mind on SNC and that I was not going to interfere with the decision of the DPP.

… At that point the PM jumped in stressing that there is an election in Quebec and that “and I am an MP in Quebec – the member for Papineau.” My response – and I remember this vividly – was to ask the PM a direct question while looking him in the eye – I asked: “Are you politically interfering with my role / my decision as the AG? I would strongly advise against it.” The Prime Minister said “No, No, No – we just need to find a solution.”

The former Attorney General named several prominent politicians and staff who were engaged in pressuring her, some with “veiled threats.”

Among the names included former PMO head Gerald Butts, Minister of Finance Bill Morneau, and head of the Privy Council Office Michael Wernick.

The scandal has rocked the Canadian political scene and has led to calls from Conservative opposition lead Andrew Scheer for the prime minister to resign from office.

“As Ms Wilson-Raybould has so clearly articulated, the people Canadians entrusted to protect the integrity of our very nation were instead only protecting themselves and their friends,” Scheer said and added, “Mr Trudeau can no longer, in good standing and with a clear conscience, lead this great nation.”

Prime Minister Trudeau, meanwhile, rejected calls for his resignation saying that voters would get to decide their next prime minister at the upcoming national elections in October.","Alleged Threats, Bribes, Prostitutes: Growing Scandal Threatens to Bring Down Canada’s Trudeau",Breitbart News,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/02/28/ex-canadian-attorney-general-testimony-bring-down-trudeau/

Testifying before a House of Commons justice committee, Wilson-Raybould said she came under relentless pressure — including veiled threats — from Trudeau, his senior staff, the top public servant and the finance minister’s office to instruct federal prosecutors to prevent construction giant SNC-Lavalin from being prosecuted in a bribery case.

“For a period of approximately four months, between September and December of 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the attorney general of Canada,” she told the committee.

Right from the start of Jody Wilson-Raybould‘s testimony she provided a damning account of what “consistent and sustained” political interference looks like: 10 phone calls and 10 meetings involving 11 people in the PMO, the Privy Council Office and the finance minister’s office.

Unless Liberals offer persuasive evidence that Wilson-Raybould was making the whole thing up, writes Paul Wells, it’s pretty clear “the hucksters and worse” were running the show:

What the former attorney general described tonight is a sickeningly smug protection racket whose participants must have been astonished when she refused to play along. If a company can rewrite the Criminal Code to get out of a trial whose start date was set before the legislation was drafted, all because a doomed Quebec government has its appointment with the voter, then which excesses are not permitted, under the same justification? If a Clerk of the Privy Council can claim with a straight face that ten calls and meetings with the attorney general, during which massive job loss, an angry PM and a lost election are threatened, don’t constitute interference, then what on earth would interference look like?

After hearing Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to resign, saying the Prime Minister has “lost the moral authority to govern.” NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh didn’t go that far, but said an independent inquiry is needed. (Canadian Press, Scheer’s statement)

Trudeau fires back: The Prime Minister stated again that nothing anyone said to Wilson-Raybould constituted pressure and that she always had the final say on the SNC-Lavalin file. And he said no one from his office will be resigning: “I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally. I therefore completely disagree with the former attorney general’s characterization of events.” (CTV News, video)

The PM again cited potential loss of jobs and SNC moving.

I was quite taken aback. My response – and I remember this vividly – was to ask the PM a direct question while looking him in the eye – I asked: “Are you politically interfering with my role / my decision as the AG?

400,Empty,2019-02-25T23:42:04Z,Why did Trudeau apply ‘relentless pressure’ to get Wilson-Raybould to change her mind? The only answer that makes any sense is: because he could,"There is no calm for the Liberals as the storm of Jody Wilson-Raybould’s upcoming appearance at the justice committee rumbles towards them.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told the House of Commons Monday he has waived solicitor-client privilege, freeing the former justice minister to talk about “relevant matters” as long as she does not touch on two court cases involving SNC-Lavalin.

Meanwhile, Wilson-Raybould said in a letter to the committee chair that she is willing to testify at the “first opportunity,” but wants to make sure there is clarity on possible constraints on what she can say — which suggests it may not be in the next couple of days.

While we don’t know when Wilson-Raybould will appear at committee, we do know she wants 30 minutes for an opening statement. You don’t need half an hour to say that the whole SNC-Lavalin saga, and recent allegations of political interference in the justice system, are just a big misunderstanding.

On Monday afternoon the committee heard from a former Saskatchewan judge who has gone on record as saying the affair should be investigated by the RCMP if there is evidence Wilson-Raybould was shuffled to another portfolio over her refusal to reconsider her position on asking the director of public prosecutions to offer SNC a deferred prosecution agreement. Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond has said a police investigation would be necessary to restore public confidence in the administration of justice, calling the prospect of the attempted influence over a prosecution “not only immoral, (but) illegal.”

Last week I suggested that Wilson-Raybould’s appearance at cabinet and Liberal caucus might auger a closing of ranks and an attempt by all sides to tamp down more controversy. After the clerk of the Privy Council’s unconventional committee appearance last week and Wilson-Raybould’s letter of intent, I’m less sure.

The appearance at committee of Michael Wernick, Canada’s top bureaucrat, suggested he thinks there is nothing to see here — that Canadians should have faith in the system because laws are “demonstrably working” when it comes to prosecutorial independence, lobbying and government ethics. “The shields held,” he said last Thursday.

As to his own conversation with Wilson-Raybould on December 19th last year, he made clear he believes it was neither immoral nor illegal. He said he told the then-attorney general her colleagues and the prime minister were “quite anxious” about the future of SNC and discussed whether a deferred prosecution agreement for the company was still an option. “I can tell you with complete assurance that my view of the conversation is that it was within the boundaries of what is lawful and appropriate,” he said. “I was informing the minister of context.”

The adjudicator of whether Wernick, and perhaps even the prime minister himself, crossed any lines will be the ethics commissioner. If prosecutors agree with Turpel-Lafond, the affair may even end up before the courts and be settled by a judge.

But what perplexes me is why Wernick, the prime minister, and senior advisers Gerald Butts and Katie Telford even discussed a remediation agreement for SNC after Wilson-Raybould made clear she was not disposed to negotiate one, when a perfectly sound plan B was already being worked on.

As my colleague Gabriel Friedman revealed in the Post on Saturday, the department of Public Services and Procurement is finalizing changes to the Ineligibility and Suspension Policy under the Integrity regime. This word salad governs whether corporations convicted of crimes can bid on federal projects.

SNC’s fear is that a conviction on corruption charges for bribing Libyan officials could lead to a 10-year ban on access to government infrastructure projects — the source of around 15 per cent of its $9 billion in revenue in 2017.

But the changes being contemplated by the government could reduce the ineligibility period from the automatically mandated 10 years to a debarment at the government’s discretion.

This policy change has been in the works for years — the public was invited to comment back in fall 2017 and the government says the update is being “studied and finalized.” A statement in the revised policy consultation said it is expected to take effect in “early 2019.”

One lawyer Friedman quoted said the debarment could conceivably be reduced to six months, a year or even no ineligibility at all. The proposed changes would widen the scope of offences that could lead to debarment, including human trafficking and environmental violations. The idea is that a one-size-fits-all punishment must be made more flexible if the range of offences is broadened.

SNC chief executive Neil Bruce has said the failure to secure a DPA would likely lead to three to four more years of court battles because the company considers itself not guilty.

But unless I’m missing something, a DPA would require an admission of culpability.

Under the new integrity regime, the company would also have to admit to wrongdoing before throwing itself on the mercy of the Registrar of Ineligibility and Suspension at Public Services. But, in that event, the company could claim mitigating circumstances, because the executives who perpetrated the alleged corruption have left and steps have been taken to ensure there is no repeat of the errant conduct.

So if the government already had an alternative to a deferred prosecution agreement that is expected to become policy in the next month or so, why did the prime minister and his most senior advisors risk flirting with immorality, if not illegality?

As Conservative leader Andrew Scheer asked Monday, if the decision to grant or refuse a deferred prosecution agreement was Wilson-Raybould’s alone — as the prime minister maintains — why did he apply “relentless pressure” to get her to change her mind?

The only answer that makes any sense is: because he could.

Trudeau responded that he ""completely disagrees with the former attorney general's characterization of events.""

Jody Wilson-Raybould made her accusations before the House of Commons justice committee, which is investigating purported political meddling in the prosecution of the Montreal-based firm.

""I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, in an inappropriate effort to secure a deferred prosecution agreement with SNC-Lavalin,"" one the world's top construction and engineering firms, Wilson-Raybould said.

She also told the committee that she faced ""veiled threats"" and advice from Canada's top bureaucrat, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, that ""a collision with the prime minister on these matters should be avoided.""

Wilson-Raybould, who also was minister of justice, said she believes she was shuffled to another portfolio in January over her refusal to take action in the case.

For weeks, Trudeau's government has been rocked by allegations first reported by The Globe and Mail newspaper that undue pressure was put on the former attorney general for an out-of-court settlement with SNC-Lavalin.

The Canadian company was charged in 2015 with corruption for allegedly bribing officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011 to secure government contracts during former strongman Moamer Kadhafi's reign.

The firm, its international arm and another subsidiary are accused of having offered Can$47 million (US$36 million) in bribes to officials and of defrauding the Libyan government of Can$130 million (US$98 million).

The charges relate to the world's largest irrigation project -- the Great Man Made River Project -- to provide fresh water to the cities of Tripoli, Benghazi and Sirte.

SNC-Lavalin has argued that those responsible for alleged wrongdoing left it long ago, and that holding it accountable for their criminal actions would severely hurt its business.

Trial set to proceed

It heavily lobbied the government, including senior officials in Trudeau's office, for an out-of-court settlement that would include paying a fine and agreeing to put in place compliance measures.

But Wilson-Raybould refused to ask prosecutors to settle, and the trial is set to proceed.

She quit Trudeau's cabinet earlier this month. Trudeau's longtime friend and principal secretary Gerry Butts also resigned days later. Questions remain over their specific reasons for leaving.

After her four hours of testimony, which the opposition called damning, Tory leader Andrew Scheer urged the Liberal prime minister to resign, saying Trudeau ""can no longer and in good standing with a clear conscience lead this nation.""

He also called for a federal police investigation into possible obstruction of justice by Liberal officials.

Trudeau has steadfastly denied any wrongdoing, saying again Wednesday that he had made clear to his former attorney general that the ""decision around SNC-Lavalin was Jody Wilson-Raybould's and hers alone to make,"" which she confirmed in her testimony.

""I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,"" he said.

Wilson-Raybould testified, ""The prime minister asked me to help out, to find a solution for SNC, citing that if there is no DPA (deferred prosecution agreement), there would be many jobs lost and that SNC would move from Montreal.""

""I told him that I had done my due diligence and had made up my mind on SNC and that I was not going to interfere with the decision of the director (of public prosecutions),"" she said.

Wilson-Raybould went on to say that 11 government officials, including the finance minister, raised similar concerns that SNC-Lavalin might move its headquarters to London without a deal, or could face massive job losses if it was found guilty at trial -- in an election year.

They ""urged me to take partisan political considerations into account, which was clearly improper,"" she said.

And they continued to ""hound"" her from September to December after she made her decision not to offer SNC-Lavalin a deal and had made it known.

That pressure was ""not illegal,"" she opined, but ""raised serious red flags in my view.""

TORONTO (AP) — Cabinet ministers rallied around Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday, a day after his former attorney general testified that he inappropriately tried to pressure her to avoid prosecution of a major Canadian engineering company in order to save jobs — a case that has shaken the government in an election year.

Popular Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that ""the prime minister would never apply improper pressure"" and expressed ""100 percent faith"" in him.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau denied meddling, saying it was ""entirely appropriate"" for his staff to talk with the justice minister's staff about the economic effects of their decisions.

Ex-Attorney General and Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould testified Wednesday that Trudeau, his staff and other officials imposed inappropriate pressure on her to avoid criminal prosecution of Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin in a case involving allegations of corruption in Libya. She said they pushed for an agreement that would let the company pay reparations but avoid a conviction.

If convicted criminally, the company would be banned from receiving any federal government business for a decade. SNC-Lavalin is a major employer in Quebec, with about 3,400 employees in the province, 9,000 employees in Canada and more than 50,000 worldwide.

Trudeau has acknowledged raising the issue with Wilson-Raybould, but said that was appropriate.

""Canadians expect their government to look for ways to protect jobs,"" Trudeau said Thursday. ""That's exactly what we have done every step of the way.

""We have also done it in a way that has respected our laws and respected the independence of the judiciary,"" he added. ""There are no doubt disagreements in perspective on this but I can reassure Canadians that we were doing our job and we were doing in a way that respects and defends our institutions.""

Morneau said he never raised issue with Wilson-Raybould, but said she had ""approached me in the House of Commons to inform me that my staff was speaking to her staff, which I think is entirely appropriate.""

Wilson-Raybould herself said she didn't think the pressure had been illegal; she had not directly instructed to avoid prosecuting.

But she said Trudeau warned that a prosecution would drive the company and its jobs out of Canada, and she said she was ""barraged"" and subjected to ""hounding"" by Trudeau and senior members of his government, including Morneau and his chief of staff.

The opposition Conservative leader Andrew Scheer is calling on Trudeau to resign, and Wilson-Raybould's testimony to Parliament has increased the uproar against Trudeau, who is facing an election this fall. Trudeau has already lost his closet adviser, Gerald Butts, who resigned last week. Butts denied he or anyone in Trudeau's office pressured Wilson-Raybould and he is now asking Parliament's justice committee to testify.

""I believe my evidence will be of assistance,"" Butts said in a statement.

403,Empty,2019-02-28T02:17:11Z,Paul Wells: What Jody Wilson-Raybould described today is a sickeningly smug protection racket and it should make us all question what we're willing to tolerate The post The moral catastrophe of Justin Trudeau appeared first on Macleans.ca.,"The dangerous files are never the obscure ones. Scandals don’t happen in the weird little corners of government, in amateur sport or in crop science. They happen on the issues a prime minister cares most about, because everyone gets the message that the rules matter less than the result.

It’s a constant in politics. In 2016 I took one look at Bill Morneau’s first budget and wrote this: “The sponsorship scandal of the late Chrétien years was possible because it was obvious to every scoundrel with Liberal friends that spending on national unity would not receive close scrutiny from a government that was desperate to be seen doing something on the file. A government that considers the scale of its spending to be proof of its virtue is an easy mark for hucksters and worse.”

It wasn’t a perfect prediction. I kind of expected the hucksters and worse to be outside government. Unless the Trudeau Liberals can produce persuasive evidence that Jody Wilson-Raybould is an utter fabulist (and frankly, I now expect several to try), her testimony before the Commons Justice Committee establishes pretty clearly that the hucksters and worse were running the show. Led by the grinning legatee who taints the Prime Ministers’ office.

There will now be a period of stark partisanship. We’re in an election year. Loyal Liberals will tell themselves, and then everyone else, that the price of looking clearly at Justin Trudeau’s bully club (so many men; wonder how Katie Telford felt about that while she was signing off on every element of it) is ceding the field to Andrew Scheer. Who, they will tell themselves and then the country, is an actual Nazi.

I mean, after all, that’s pretty close to what they told one another, and then Jody Wilson-Raybould, last fall, isn’t it? There was an election in Quebec in the first week of October. And Ben Chin, a former journalist who did whatever Christy Clark needed done in B.C. before moving east to do whatever Bill Morneau and the PMO needed doing, used that thin reed of an excuse to try to sway Wilson-Raybould’s chief of staff, Jessica Prince. “If they don’t get a [deferred prosecution agreement], they will leave Montreal, and it’s the Quebec election right now, so we can’t have that happen,” Wilson-Raybould told the committee, paraphrasing Chin’s conversation with Prince.

I’ve never met a Liberal yet who doesn’t reliably confuse his electoral skin with the national interest. So much of what Trudeau and his minions have done in the last year stems from that instinct. Take the ludicrous half-billion-dollar bailout for people in my line of work, never explained, sprung out of nowhere in Morneau’s fall economic update—or as I now like to think of it, between Trudeau advisor Mathieu Bouchard’s meeting (yet another one) with Prince and Michael Wernick’s chat with Wilson-Raybould. You can get a lot of op-eds written with that kind of dough. Take the cool billion the Canada Infrastructure Bank coughed up to pay for a politically popular and impeccably well-connected transit project around Montreal. That money appeared, from a brand-new bank that has not funded a single other project and did not then yet have a CEO [Update, Thursday: Wrong! It had had a CEO since last May – pw], on the day before Philippe Couillard launched the Quebec election campaign. It is now impossible to believe on faith that the Canada Infrastructure Bank is not a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ben Chin, Mathieu Bouchard, Katie Telford and Justin Trudeau.

But anyway, back to partisanship. Liberals and their many friends across the land will insist that all this behaviour must have no real-world repercussions because the other side cannot be permitted to gain the upper hand. And similarly, a lot of battle-hardened opponents of the Liberals will call for the jails to be opened up to welcome fresh Liberal meat. Fortunately, there is indeed an election coming up, and I’m content to let voters decide the partisan affiliation of the next government. I offer them no counsel.

But we get to draw our own conclusions as citizens. What the former attorney general described tonight is a sickeningly smug protection racket whose participants must have been astonished when she refused to play along. If a company can rewrite the Criminal Code to get out of a trial whose start date was set before the legislation was drafted, all because a doomed Quebec government has its appointment with the voter, then which excesses are not permitted, under the same justification? If a Clerk of the Privy Council can claim with a straight face that ten calls and meetings with the attorney general, during which massive job loss, an angry PM and a lost election are threatened, don’t constitute interference, then what on earth would interference look like? Tonight I talked with two former public servants whose records rival Michael Wernick’s. Both were flat astonished that he seems not to have pushed back against this deeply disturbing, and plainly widespread, behaviour.

There’ll be time to contemplate mechanisms in the days ahead. I don’t think the ethics commissioner has a broad enough mandate to investigate matters like that Canada Infrastructure Bank investment and other tendrils of this affair. But in the end, the moral collapse of Justin Trudeau’s government teaches each of us a lesson, if we will only listen: There had damned well better be a limit to what we’re willing to do or say, whatever the cause we claim to serve. The rules need to be rules—not for the people we despise, but for ourselves. For myself. For you. Or else we have no souls.

TORONTO (AP) — Canada's former attorney general testified Wednesday she experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government to inappropriately interfere in the prosecution of a major Canadian engineering company, including receiving ""veiled threats.""

Ex-justice minister and ex-attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould called it ""incredibly inappropriate"" but said she didn't think it was illegal because she wasn't instructed to seek a settlement. She said 11 people tried to interfere in her prosecutorial discretion including Trudeau.

In a meeting with Trudeau, the prime minister raised the issue and asked her to ""help out"" with the case, she said.

Wilson-Raybould said she asked Trudeau if he was politically interfering with her role as attorney general and told him she would strongly advise against it.

""No, no, no. We just need to find a solution,"" she said Trudeau responded.

She said Trudeau told her that if Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin didn't get a deferred prosecution there would be jobs lost and the company would move its headquarters from Montreal to London and noted he was a lawmaker from Quebec. Wilson-Raybould said she was ""barraged"" and subjected to ""hounding"" by members of the government.

Trudeau disputed her view of events.

""I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally, and therefore I completely disagree with the characterization of the former attorney general about these events,"" he said at a news conference.

Trudeau said the decision on whether to forgo prosecution and enter a plea agreement with the company was hers and hers alone.

He also welcomed the investigation of the ethics commissioner while he rejected calls by the leader of the opposition Conservative Party to resign, saying Canadians will have a choice later this year in parliamentary elections.

""My job as prime minister is to stand up for jobs. I have done that and will continue to do that. That is a fundamental role of a Canadian prime minister,"" Trudeau said.

Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer also said police should investigate and called Trudeau a disgraced prime minister. Jagmeet Singh, leader of the opposition NDP, said there should be a public inquiry but stopped short of calling for Trudeau to step down.

""He may need to resign because of this,"" he said. ""What we heard today was explosive.""

Trudeau's government has been on the defensive since the Globe and Mail newspaper reported Feb. 7 that Trudeau or his staff pressured her to try to avoid a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin over allegations of corruption involving government contracts in Libya. Critics say that would be improper political meddling in a legal case.

""For a period of approximately four months, between September and December of 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the attorney general of Canada,"" she told a Parliament justice committee.

The scandal has been a significant blow to Trudeau, who is facing an election this year.

Gerald Butts, Trudeau's closet adviser, resigned last week but denied that he or anyone else pressured Wilson-Raybould. Michael Wernick, the top civil servant in the government, has also said that no inappropriate pressure was put on Wilson-Raybould.

Wilson-Raybould resigned from the Cabinet on Feb. 12 as veteran affairs minister but gave no reasons. She had been unexpectedly demoted from justice minister last month, and was furious, releasing a 2,000-word statement after that.

""I was concerned I was shuffled because of a decision I would not take with SNC, I raised those concerns with the PM,"" she said. ""Those concerns were denied.""

Wilson-Raybould compared the situation to President Richard Nixon's ""Saturday Night Massacre"" firing of the independent special prosecutor overseeing the Watergate investigation in 1973.

The Globe and Mail's report this month said Trudeau's office pressured her to instruct the director of public prosecutions to negotiate a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin. The agreement would have allowed the company to pay reparations but avoid a criminal trial on charges of corruption and bribery.

If convicted criminally, the company would be banned from receiving any federal government business for a decade. SNC-Lavalin is a major employer in Quebec, with about 3,400 employees in the province, 9,000 employees in Canada and more than 50,000 worldwide.

""It's OK to talk about job losses. It's OK to talk about it in initial conversations but when those topics continue to be brought up after there is a clear awareness that a decision has been made it becomes inappropriate,"" Wilson-Raybould said.

""Where they became very clearly inappropriate was when political issues came up, like the election in Quebec, like losing the election were SNC to move its headquarters.""

She said there would be merits in separating the roles of attorney general and justice minister.

Asked if she has confidence in Trudeau, Wilson-Raybould twice did not answer yes

Wilson-Raybould remains a member of Trudeau's Liberal party in Parliament. She said she doesn't anticipate being kicked out of the party. Trudeau said he hadn't reviewed her entire testimony and needed to see that before he made any decision on her membership.

Daniel Beland, a political science professor at McGill university, said Wilson-Raybould's testimony is very bad for Trudeau and threatens his re-election chances this fall.

""Her testimony was both detailed and credible. She also implicated a lot of people, from top advisers and the most powerful civil servant in the country to the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister, Bill Morneau,"" Beland said. ""The Liberals have fallen in the polls since this story emerged and today's testimony is likely to make things worse for them, at least in the short run.""",Canada ex-attorney: Government tried to interfere in case,Seattlepi.com,https://www.seattlepi.com/news/crime/article/Canada-ex-attorney-Government-tried-to-interfere-13649997.php

The remarks by Jody Wilson-Raybould, made during almost four hours of sometimes dramatic testimony to the House of Commons justice committee, deepened the worst crisis of Trudeau’s tenure months before an October election.

Wilson-Raybould said she had confronted Trudeau over what she said were persistent efforts by officials to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc evade trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials.

“I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,” Trudeau told a televised news conference in Montreal.

“I therefore completely disagree with (Wilson-Raybould’s) characterization of events,” he added, brushing off a demand from Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer that he step down.

The case forced the resignation of Trudeau’s principal private secretary, Gerald Butts, earlier this month.

Wilson-Raybould said officials imposed “consistent and sustained pressure” on her from September to December last year to ensure SNC-Lavalin pay a large fine rather than go to trial.

“This pressure, or political interference to intervene, was not appropriate,” she said, adding that some officials had made veiled threats unless she cooperated.

The head of the federal civil service, she said, told her that Trudeau would “find a way to get it done one way or another. So, he is in that kind (of) mood and I wanted you to be aware of that.”

Wilson-Raybould said those exchanges prompted her to think of the so-called Saturday Night Massacre of 1973, when the U.S. attorney general and his top deputy quit rather than obey an order from President Richard Nixon to fire an investigator probing the Watergate scandal.

She added, however, under questioning from Liberal legislators that she did not feel the pressure on her had been illegal.

Wilson-Raybould was unexpectedly demoted in January and resigned from the Cabinet this month. She said she was convinced the SNC-Lavalin case had prompted her demotion.

‘NEED TO FIND A SOLUTION’

SNC-Lavalin was seeking a so-called deferred prosecution agreement to allow the firm to escape with a fine. Wilson-Raybould had the power to scrap the decision to go to trial but decided against it. A trial is pending for the company.

SNC-Lavalin has said it had sought to avoid a trial because the executives accused of wrongdoing had left the company and it had overhauled its ethics and compliance systems.

SNC-Lavalin is based in the province of Quebec, where the Liberals have said they need to pick up seats to stand a chance of retaining a majority government.

Wilson-Raybould said officials cited the danger that the firm might cut jobs or move its headquarters out of Quebec if found guilty.

She cited several senior officials in the offices of Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau as among those weighing in. A Morneau spokesman denied the minister or his staff had ever pressured Wilson-Raybould.

Wilson-Raybould said that during a Sept. 17 meeting with Trudeau, he asked her “to find a solution” for SNC-Lavalin.

“I asked: ‘Are you politically interfering with my role? ... I would strongly advise against it.’ The prime minister said: ‘No, no, no, we just need to find a solution.’”

Trudeau told the news conference that “our government will always focus on jobs” and said officials had discussed the implications of SNC-Lavalin cutting its workforce.

Wilson-Raybould said that in mid-December, her chief of staff expressed concerns about possible political interference during a chat with Butts.

Citing her chief of staff’s account of the exchange, Wilson-Raybould quoted Butts as saying: “There is no solution here that does not involve some interference.”",Canada's Trudeau dismisses ex-minister's allegations of inappropriate pressure,Reuters,https://ca.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKCN1QG2Q3-OCABS

Preliminary results showed Jagmeet Singh won a special election to fill an empty seat in the parliamentary constituency of Burnaby-South, in the Pacific province of British Columbia.

Singh captured just under 40 percent of the vote.

A practicing Sikh, Singh made headlines in October 2017 when he became the first person from an ethnic minority to be elected leader of a major Canadian political party. But he has failed to lift the New Democratic Party (NDP), which trails its rivals badly.

The NDP and the Liberals - who compete for the same center-left segment of the electorate - will face each other in a federal election this October. The worse the New Democrats do, the better Trudeau’s chances become.

“This staves off all the talk that Singh would have to quit ... at least for the moment he is vindicated,” said Richard Johnston, a political science professor at the University of British Columbia.

Johnston said in a phone interview that Singh would still need to overcome unhappiness with his leadership.

Singh, 40, a former legislator in the province of Ontario, had no experience in federal politics when he took over from former leader Thomas Mulcair.

He has clashed openly with senior members of parliament on a number of issues. A quarter of the 44 NDP legislators who won seats in the 2015 election have either already quit or announced they are not running again in October.

And in a further sign of challenges ahead, in another special election on Monday, the NDP lost the Montreal seat Mulcair had held to the Liberals.

An Ipsos-Reid poll for Global News last week put the Liberals at 34 percent public support and the right-leaning official opposition Conservatives at 35 percent. The NDP was far behind at 17 percent.

The Liberals are stumbling amid allegations that officials in Trudeau’s office leaned on former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to help a major construction company avoid a criminal trial on bribery charges.

The federal NDP leader knocked on thousands of doors with a message that spoke to the economic anxieties and fears of many in the Burnaby South riding worried about housing affordability and the dearth of well-paid jobs.

His win was decisive, with nearly 3,000 votes more than the second-place Liberal and nearly 3,700 more than the Conservatives who might have done better had the People’s Party of Canada not hived off 2,420 votes.

The celebration was exuberant, with Singh leading his supporters in the dancing and singing. It was a historic win.

On March 18, Singh will take his seat in the House of Commons as the first, non-white leader of a national party.

“Growing up, I could never have imagined that someone like me would be running to be prime minister,” he said after his win. “We’ve just told a lot of kids out there that ‘yes, you can.’ ”

As Singh acknowledged Monday night, the celebration was only a brief respite before much bigger challenges ahead in the eight months until the Oct. 25 federal election.

With race and ethnicity constant topics even in Burnaby South — one of the most diverse ridings in the country — he’s likely to face much more of it in places like vote-rich Quebec, where the NDP lost a seat in one of the other two byelections Monday.

In Quebec, for example, the turban-wearing leader is likely to butt up against concerns about both displays of religious symbols and about immigration weakening its unique culture and language.

With the election looming and the party’s poll numbers and fundraising in the tank, Singh’s first challenge is to prove that he can lead.

Having stumbled several times when he’s forced off his tightly scripted message, Singh needs to prove both in the House and in daily scrums that he has a firm command of the issues.

His first test will be March 19, his second day in the house. That’s the day the Liberals’ deliver their pre-election budget and Singh will have to respond both in the chamber and outside.

The second challenge is Singh’s environmental policy. He’s called for tougher carbon emissions’ targets, a swift transition to a green economy and he’s opposed expansion of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline that terminates in Burnaby. Yet, Singh supports the northern B.C. LNG project, which some opponents describe as a “carbon bomb” that blows up the province’s climate-change commitments.

Even if it is contradictory, it seems to have resonated with Burnaby voters, who didn’t have the choice of a Green candidate in the byelection.

But Singh has alienated New Democrats and others in Alberta and Saskatchewan, as well as union leaders and their members whose jobs are tightly tied to a carbon and have the most to lose — or at least, the most to fear — since no one can guarantee of a smooth transition to a “green economy.”

Singh has downplayed criticism of his leadership, calling it “disrespectful to the opportunity that I have to make a difference in people’s lives to worry about my own situation.”

As a brown person growing up in a white culture and facing obstacles because of that, Singh told me, “You either become very cynical or you become very optimistic. I’ve become very optimistic.

“I always believe there are ways to get through, to push forward. I’m a bit of a hopeless romantic, but I’m more so a hopeless optimist.”

It’s a sharp contrast to the negative messaging of some other politicians. So too is his commitment to social justice. He learned it from his mother, and then committed to it after being initiated into the Sikh faith as a teenager.

“There’s a meditation that Sikhs do that calls for the betterment of all, and it’s not all Sikhs, it’s all as in everything — all people, animals and the environment. The betterment of all,” he said.

“There’s a nobility to the idea of wanting to pursue justice for all … I thought it was worth taking up the challenge to fight for a better world,”

It’s that mix of optimism and candour that’s appealing to millennials and idealists.

It’s why Winnipeg city councillor Jason Schreyer and his wife, Sarah, spent the last week campaigning in Burnaby South.

The son of former Manitoba premier and governor general Ed Scheyer, Jason was one of several New Democrats who talked to me Monday night about how Singh’s message has reinvigorated them.

But Singh has a hard road ahead. In an Angus Reid poll released Tuesday, Singh had the lowest rating of the three leaders, with 66 per cent saying they had an unfavourable view of him.

Still, Singh isn’t the only leader with challenges.

Because of the SNC-Lavalin affair, Justin Trudeau’s popularity has fallen, with 60 per cent of Canadians saying they have an unfavourable impression of him. And while the Liberals now trail the Conservatives by seven percentage points, 54 per cent of Canadians hold unfavourable view of the their leader Andrew Scheer.

Whether Singh can translate the enthusiasm from the hothouse of a byelection campaign into a national one remains to be seen. But the byelection win has at least given him a chance to try.

411,Empty,2019-02-28T14:37:32Z,Former justice minister claims she was pressured into intervening in corruption trial,"Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday won the public support of a top political ally, indicating there is no immediate pressure inside his Liberal Party to oust him over a political scandal.

Mr Trudeau, rejecting an opposition call for his resignation, disputed allegations on Wednesday by his former justice minister that government officials inappropriately pressured her to help the a construction firm avoid a corruption trial.

The testimony from Jody Wilson-Raybould threatens to badly damage the Liberals just months ahead of what polls suggest will be a hard-fought election.

In an unusual move, foreign minister Chrystia Freeland appeared on the Canadian Broadcasting Corp to say she fully backed Mr Trudeau. “Of course I support the prime minister 100 percent ... I am very clearly of the view that the prime minister would never apply improper pressure,” she said.

Ms Freeland, one of the most prominent members of the cabinet, is seen by some observers as a possible successor to Mr Trudeau.

In almost four hours of testimony to the House of Commons justice committee on Wednesday, Ms Wilson-Raybould said she had confronted Mr Trudeau over what she said were persistent efforts by officials to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin evade trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials. She said she had made clear she was not prepared to help the company avoid a trial, which is now pending.

Ms Wilson-Raybould was unexpectedly given a less prominent job in January and resigned from the Cabinet this month. She said she was convinced her refusal to give way on the SNC-Lavalin case had prompted her demotion.

Her testimony deepened the worst crisis of Mr Trudeau’s tenure, but one top official said on Thursday there was no talk for now of a leadership challenge. In the Canadian political system party leaders are elected at formal conventions and cannot be deposed by a simple vote of legislators, which means any move to push out Mr Trudeau would be lengthy.

Major employer

Another senior Liberal Party member, however, said there was growing unhappiness among legislators about how Mr Trudeau’s team had handled the SNC-Lavalin matter and said the prime minister needed to replace some of his staff.

“The level of concern over what has happened over the last few hours is unprecedented,” said the Liberal, who requested anonymity.

The Liberals have a majority in the House of Commons and if they all vote with Mr Trudeau they can fend off any votes of confidence.

SNC-Lavalin is a major employer in the province of Quebec, where the Liberals have said they need to pick up seats to stand a chance of retaining a majority government. Liberal officials note media coverage of the affair in Quebec has been generally favourable to the party.

Mr Trudeau addressed the controversy in a televised news conference in Montreal on Thursday, saying, “Canadians expect their government to look for ways to protect jobs, to grow the economy and that’s exactly what we have done ... we’ve also done it in a way that has respected our laws”.

The remarks by Jody Wilson-Raybould, made during almost four hours of sometimes dramatic testimony to the House of Commons justice committee, deepened the worst crisis of Trudeau’s tenure months before an October election.

Wilson-Raybould said she had confronted Trudeau over what she said were persistent efforts by officials to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc evade trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials.

“I strongly maintain, as I have from the beginning, that I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally,” Trudeau told a televised news conference in Montreal.

“I therefore completely disagree with (Wilson-Raybould’s) characterization of events,” he added, brushing off a demand from Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer that he step down.

The case forced the resignation of Trudeau’s principal private secretary, Gerald Butts, earlier this month.

Wilson-Raybould said officials imposed “consistent and sustained pressure” on her from September to December last year to ensure SNC-Lavalin pay a large fine rather than go to trial.

“This pressure, or political interference to intervene, was not appropriate,” she said, adding that some officials had made veiled threats unless she cooperated.

The head of the federal civil service, she said, told her that Trudeau would “find a way to get it done one way or another. So, he is in that kind (of) mood and I wanted you to be aware of that.”

Wilson-Raybould said those exchanges prompted her to think of the so-called Saturday Night Massacre of 1973, when the U.S. attorney general and his top deputy quit rather than obey an order from President Richard Nixon to fire an investigator probing the Watergate scandal.

She added, however, under questioning from Liberal legislators that she did not feel the pressure on her had been illegal.

Wilson-Raybould was unexpectedly demoted in January and resigned from the Cabinet this month. She said she was convinced the SNC-Lavalin case had prompted her demotion.

‘NEED TO FIND A SOLUTION’

SNC-Lavalin was seeking a so-called deferred prosecution agreement to allow the firm to escape with a fine. Wilson-Raybould had the power to scrap the decision to go to trial but decided against it. A trial is pending for the company.

SNC-Lavalin has said it had sought to avoid a trial because the executives accused of wrongdoing had left the company and it had overhauled its ethics and compliance systems.

SNC-Lavalin is based in the province of Quebec, where the Liberals have said they need to pick up seats to stand a chance of retaining a majority government.

Wilson-Raybould said officials cited the danger that the firm might cut jobs or move its headquarters out of Quebec if found guilty.

She cited several senior officials in the offices of Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau as among those weighing in. A Morneau spokesman denied the minister or his staff had ever pressured Wilson-Raybould.

Wilson-Raybould said that during a Sept. 17 meeting with Trudeau, he asked her “to find a solution” for SNC-Lavalin.

“I asked: ‘Are you politically interfering with my role? ... I would strongly advise against it.’ The prime minister said: ‘No, no, no, we just need to find a solution.’”

Trudeau told the news conference that “our government will always focus on jobs” and said officials had discussed the implications of SNC-Lavalin cutting its workforce.

Wilson-Raybould said that in mid-December, her chief of staff expressed concerns about possible political interference during a chat with Butts.

Citing her chief of staff’s account of the exchange, Wilson-Raybould quoted Butts as saying: “There is no solution here that does not involve some interference.”",Canada's Trudeau disputes ex-minister's charge she was pressured on SNC-Lavalin,Reuters,https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKCN1QG2VL

THE BUZZ — EXCLOO! FIRST IN PLAYBOOK — KAMALA HARRIS LOCKING DOWN CA: In a show of force aimed at locking down support in California — an early primary state critical to her 2020 hopes — U.S. Senator Kamala Harris has just announced the backing of a score of Democratic California statewide officers.

— The Harris campaign Tuesday touted endorsements from Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, Secretary of State Alex Padilla, State Treasurer Fiona Ma, Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond and Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara. Harris’ latest endorsements in delegate-rich California comes just weeks after Gov. Gavin Newsom announced he would support the senator‘s 2020 bid.

Story Continued Below

— The new endorsements are just the latest example of Harris’ aggressive efforts to dominate California, the nation’s most populous state, where a potential Mother Lode of delegates are at stake in March 3 Super Tuesday early primary. So far, Harris, the former state attorney general, is the only Californian in the 2020 White House race. But Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), who has family roots in Iowa and has visited the state more than 15 times, is edging closer to a run and has signaled an announcement could come by the end of April.

— Last week, Rep. Ro Khanna, a prominent Democrat from Silicon Valley, announced he would co-chair the 2020 campaign of rival Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. The full story by POLITICO’s Carla Marinucci.

BUENOS DIAS, Good TUESDAY morning. Gavin Newsom hit DC this week ... and met with a crowd of Silicon Valley CEOs last week. We have details on both ... And, no, Kamala Harris is not Jussie Smolett’s aunt, though some #fakenews websites are trying to spread that rumor.

— TWEET OF THE DAY: Roger Salazar @RogerSalazar: “Partisanship aside, it’s incredible that for the first time in history, both parties in Calif. are chaired by Latinas. @AlexRooker13 leads the @CA_Dem Party as acting chair and @millanpatterson was elected @CAGOP chair yesterday. #TheFutureIsLatina and the future has arrived.”

— QUOTE OF THE DAY: “I want to continue to have a relationship with the president on things that matter, and what matters is emergency preparedness, mitigation and suppression. And that’s an area that should be above politics, apolitical, and I just think that’s critical and I want to stay in that space .... We've had multiple conversations over the last few months. ” — Gov. Gavin Newson in DC yesterday, speaking to SFChronicle's Tal Kopan.

— PODCAST OF THE DAY: “I grew up in Indiana and I’m gay. I’m comfortable dealing with bullies. I got a lot of practice dealing with rocket fire (in the military). I think I can handle being called silly names.” South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a 2020 candidate, says he's what the Democrats need. He talks with SFChronicle's Joe Garofoli on ""It's All Political."" Listen here.

— WHERE’S GAVIN? Nothing official announced.

GAVINLAND

— GAVIN’S BIG MISSION: A foray into hostile territory or a bridge-building mission? Gov. Gavin Newsom’s time in DC the last couple of days qualifies as a little of both.

— There’s been plenty of fuel lately for the ever-smoldering conflict between Sacramento and Washington with California leading a lawsuit against Trump’s border emergency and Trump demanding federal high-speed rail money back in an act Newsom denounced as political retribution. Even as he’s traveled to Trump’s turf, Newsom has maintained a posture of defiance, with his office tweeting a picture of Newsom with New Mexico Gov. Michelle Grisham — who, like Newsom, pulled National Guard troops from the border in a pointed message to Trump.

— But all the backbiting doesn’t preclude some diplomacy; Newsom has said repeatedly he’s willing to work with Washington where possible. He met with DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt and acting FEMA director Brock Long to talk about topics that included emergency management and wildfire preparation. That comes in addition to talking about containing drug costs with fellow governors and meeting with Sen. Dianne Feinstein and dozens of CA House delegation members, including Nancy Pelosi and Kevin McCarthy.

— GOV'S BIG MEETING WITH SILICON VALLEY: In his first major visit to Silicon Valley as governor, Gavin Newsom last Thursday met privately with 67 CEOS and top tech executives, talking transportation, immigration and other key issues in a meeting described as ""incredibly positive"" by Silicon Valley Leadership Group president Carl Guardino. ""It was a wide-ranging, substantive hour,'' in which Newsom held a dialogue with business leaders, eager to talk about the big picture ""and still have a conversation on fine details, from transportation to housing, energy and water, the future of work and tax policy,” Guardino told POLITICO.

— The event, which included Q&A with tech leaders, was held at eBay headquarters, where the governor was hosted by CEO Devin Wenig. According to eBay, ""Newsom also participated in a Women In Technology roundtable discussion with female leaders from across eBay. The group discussed diversity and inclusion in the workplace, as well as the importance of increasing the number of women in high-level roles in the tech industry.""

— NO MEDIA NOTIFICATION: While Newsom's first Silicon Valley foray got plenty of play on EBay's webpage, it was not otherwise widely reported — because the media was never notified of it. Nathan Click, the governor's spokesman, said the meeting was quickly arranged and intended to be private. Newsom, in his first few weeks in office, has regularly made himself available to media. But he's also failed to notify the press on several occasions regarding scheduled events in his official capacity as governor — including this one with a key business community. We're watching. Stay tuned.

THE TRUMP ERA

— “Trump’s under-the-radar $1 abortion bill idea: Will it undermine Obamacare in California?” by Calmatters’ Elizabeth Aguilera: “A little-noticed Trump administration proposal aims to force California’s health exchange insurers to send all their customers a second premium bill every month, for $1 —the amount the state requires to cover unrestricted abortion benefits.

— “The Resistance State, unsurprisingly, is pushing back. State officials fear that many Californians insured through the Covered California exchange will be confused about receiving a second monthly bill, and may even neglect to pay it, putting their coverage at risk. And the insurers warn that the cost and labor involved in sending multiple bills for 1.5 million people could drive up the cost of their premiums.” Story.

— “Supreme Court tosses California equal-pay case, saying ruling died with judge,” by SFChronicle’s Bob Egelko: “The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled in April that the federal Equal Pay Act, banning sex discrimination in wages, bars taking salary history into account if a man and woman are doing the same job. The ruling went a step beyond other federal appeals courts and the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which had allowed employers to consider previous pay as one of several salary factors, along with skills and experience.” Story .

Jagmeet Singh, the leader of Canada's New Democrats Party (NDP), has won his first seat in parliament after a by-election bid in British Columbia.

The party premier secured 38% of votes in a closely-watched race in Burnaby, east of Vancouver.

Mr Singh, 40, is the first ethnic minority to lead a major federal party in the country.

His win comes ahead of general elections in October and is seen as a boost for his leadership.

""Friends, we made history today,"" he told supporters after learning the results. ""Guess what? We just told a lot of kids out there that yes, you can.""

His new seat, Burnaby-South, opened up after fellow NDP member Kennedy Stewart resigned to become mayor of Vancouver.

The town's election race made headlines in January after Liberal candidate Karen Wang stepped down after making remarks about Mr Singh that some said amounted to racism.

Ms Wang wrote a post on the website WeChat in which she said that as the only Chinese candidate in the race she stood a good chance of winning, and pointed out Mr Singh's Indian descent.

Announcing her resignation, she said her ""choice of words wasn't well-considered and didn't reflect my intent"", but she denied that they were racist.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Canadian politician Jagmeet Singh shows how to handle a heckler

Mr Singh is a practising Sikh and former provincial Ontario legislator, and became leader of the centre-left party in 2017 despite no experience of federal politics. During the NDP's leadership campaign, a video of his reaction to an angry heckler at a campaign rally went viral.

Despite success in Burnaby, the NDP failed to secure seats in Canada's two other by-elections. Liberal contender Rachel Bendayan ousted the party from Montreal's Outremont constituency, which the NDP had held for over a decade.

The Conservatives also held onto seat in the Ontario constituency of York-Simcoe.

By-elections are held in Canada when a seat is vacated by a member of Parliament (MP) between general elections.

What does this mean for the coming election?

Monday's victory was a necessary breakthrough for Mr Singh's leadership, which had been undermined by poor polling, fundraising difficulties, and internal party divisions.

The NDP has never held power and is currently the third place party in Canada's Parliament, holding 40 of 338 seats in the House of Commons. A quarter of its MPs who won seats in the 2015 election have either resigned or announced they are not running again in October.

In an interview with CTV last month, former NDP leader Thomas Mulcair said ""it would be extremely difficult for Mr. Singh to stick around"" if his parliamentary bid failed.

But losing the seat in Outremont to the Liberals on Monday is still a blow for the party.

That seat, which was won by Mr Mulcair in 2007, was a foothold in the vote-rich province of Quebec and helped launch the so-called ""Orange Wave"" of support for the NDP in 2011.

The NDP made historic gains in that year's general election and were catapulted into Official Opposition, only to lose almost a million votes - mostly to Justin Trudeau's Liberals - four years later.",Jagmeet Singh: Leader of Canada's NDP party becomes MP,BBC News,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47368645

With more than half the polls reporting results in Burnaby South, Singh had just over 38 per cent of the vote, comfortably ahead of Liberal Richard T. Lee’s 26 per cent and Conservative Jay Shin’s 22 per cent.

But while victory tightens Singh’s shaky grip on the reins of the NDP, the challenge ahead was underscored by the simultaneous loss of the Montreal riding that launched the NDP’s orange wave that swept Quebec in 2011.

In Outremont, Liberal contender Rachel Bendayan held more than 42 per cent of the vote with two-thirds of the riding’s polls reporting results, with the NDP’s Julia Sanchez running second with just over 25 per cent.

Outremont was a longtime Liberal stronghold until 2007, when former NDP leader Tom Mulcair scored an upset byelection victory for the NDP, creating a beachhead for the New Democrats that helped them launch their 2011 sweep of Quebec and vault them into official Opposition status for the first time in party history.

The Conservatives, meanwhile, easily hung onto the Ontario riding of York-Simcoe.

Conservative candidate Scot Davidson captured just over 50 per cent of the vote with a majority of polls reporting results, with Liberal Shaun Tanaka taking 31 per cent.

The Vancouver-area race was largely seen as a test of Singh's leadership, as he faced off against Liberal candidate Richard T. Lee, a former B.C. MLA, and Conservative candidate Jay Shin, a lawyer and newcomer to politics.

In 2017, Singh made history when he became the first non-white leader of a major Canadian federal party. Since then, he's led the NDP without a federal seat.

In his victory speech on Monday night, Singh said it was a ""new day.""

""When I was growing up I could have never imagined someone like me running for prime minister, but guess what we just told a lot of kids out there that yes, you can,"" he said.

""And I know that carries a lot of responsibility and I understand that responsibility and I want you to know that when I take my seat in the House of Commons I will work very hard to make you all very proud.""

Singh touts health care, housing

While Singh highlighted some of the issues critical to Burnaby South, he also touted a national platform — calling for expanded health coverage, building half a million affordable housing units across Canada, transitioning to a green economy, and working towards reconciliation with Indigenous communities.

Watch part of Jagmeet Singh's victory speech here:

NDP leader rallies supporters after Burnaby South win, calls for change in Ottawa 1:18

Singh criticized the Liberals and Conservatives and called out the purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline.

He also addressed growing distrust of immigration.

""New Canadians and people who are fleeing are not responsible for the problems that we're faced with,"" he said.

""We'll address that uncertainty and fear by giving people something to hope, something to dream.""

With all polls reporting, the NDP claimed 39 per cent of the vote, the Liberals 26 per cent, the Conservatives 22.5 per cent, and the People's Party 10.6 per cent.

Just under 29 per cent of registered voters cast a ballot, not including electors who registered on election day.

Rough Liberal ride

The Liberals usually put up a strong showing in Burnaby. In the 2015 federal election, the Liberals came within 547 votes of the winning NDP candidate, Kennedy Stewart, who resigned the seat in September 2018 for a successful run at Vancouver's mayoralty.

But this time around, they faced challenges in the campaign.

Their first candidate, Karen Wang, resigned after pointing out Singh's ethnicity online.

In recent weeks, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been besieged by allegations his office pressured then-attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin — a scandal Singh alluded to in his speech.

""We have eight more months to let the people know we have a government … that doesn't give handouts to SNC-Lavalin, but stands up for everyday Canadians,"" he said.

But Lee, who replaced Wang as the Liberal candidate in January, said that as he went door-to-door constituents were concerned with local issues like housing and transportation, not the SNC-Lavalin scandal.

He said the Liberals ran a strong campaign and he is considering running again in the fall.

The NDP also faced a test in the Montreal-area riding of Outremont on Monday, which was vacated by the party's former leader, Thomas Mulcair. Liberal candidate Rachel Bendayan was the successful candidate in that riding.

Singh made a special pitch to Quebec, saying he knew Outremont would be a tough riding, but that the NDP supports legislation supported by many Quebecers, primarily surrounding green energy and the environment.

The NDP has struggled since Singh became leader in 2017. The party now sits at 14 per cent nationally, 11 per cent in Quebec and 16 per cent in B.C., according to CBC's Poll Tracker.

Today’s the day, for real this time.

Committee chair and Liberal MP Anthony Housefather said he believes all of Wilson-Raybould’s concerns about what she can and can’t say have been addressed: “I think she now can tell her side of the story. With 30 minutes [for her opening statement], I think she’ll have ample time to do so and I look forward to hearing from her, as I know the other committee members do.” (CBC News)

Not so fast. In another letter to Housefather sent Tuesday, Wilson-Raybould said the freedom the Liberal government gave her to speak through an Order in Council “falls far short of what is required” if Canadians are to learn all the facts. That’s because the order only covered her time as attorney-general, but still limits her from speaking about events that happened after she was shuffled to veterans affairs or what she told cabinet after she resigned.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh‘s victory in Burnaby South presented him with an opportunity to try to reset what has been a lacklustre time for the party. With the party way down in the polls, struggling to raise money and losing incumbent MPs, Singh promised a turnaround: “We’re going to sharpen our message, which is we do believe that we can make better choices.” His first day in the House will be March 18, giving him just 217 days to get that sharpened message to voters before the federal election.

The Vancouver-area race was largely seen as a test of Singh's leadership, as he faced off against Liberal candidate Richard T. Lee, a former B.C. MLA, and Conservative candidate Jay Shin, a lawyer and newcomer to politics.

In 2017, Singh made history when he became the first non-white leader of a major Canadian federal party. Since then, he's led the NDP without a federal seat.

In his victory speech on Monday night, Singh said it was a ""new day.""

""When I was growing up I could have never imagined someone like me running for prime minister, but guess what we just told a lot of kids out there that yes, you can,"" he said.

""And I know that carries a lot of responsibility and I understand that responsibility and I want you to know that when I take my seat in the House of Commons I will work very hard to make you all very proud.""

Singh touts health care, housing

While Singh highlighted some of the issues critical to Burnaby South, he also touted a national platform — calling for expanded health coverage, building half a million affordable housing units across Canada, transitioning to a green economy, and working towards reconciliation with Indigenous communities.

Watch part of Jagmeet Singh's victory speech here:

Singh criticized the Liberals and Conservatives and called out the purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline.

He also addressed growing distrust of immigration.

""New Canadians and people who are fleeing are not responsible for the problems that we're faced with,"" he said.

""We'll address that uncertainty and fear by giving people something to hope, something to dream.""

With all polls reporting, the NDP claimed 39 per cent of the vote, the Liberals 26 per cent, the Conservatives 22.5 per cent, and the People's Party 10.6 per cent.

Just under 29 per cent of registered voters cast a ballot, not including electors who registered on election day.

Rough Liberal ride

The Liberals usually put up a strong showing in Burnaby. In the 2015 federal election, the Liberals came within 547 votes of the winning NDP candidate, Kennedy Stewart, who resigned the seat in September 2018 for a successful run at Vancouver's mayoralty.

But this time around, they faced challenges in the campaign.

Their first candidate, Karen Wang, resigned after pointing out Singh's ethnicity online.

In recent weeks, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been besieged by allegations his office pressured then-attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin — a scandal Singh alluded to in his speech.

""We have eight more months to let the people know we have a government … that doesn't give handouts to SNC-Lavalin, but stands up for everyday Canadians,"" he said.

But Lee, who replaced Wang as the Liberal candidate in January, said that as he went door-to-door constituents were concerned with local issues like housing and transportation, not the SNC-Lavalin scandal.

He said the Liberals ran a strong campaign and he is considering running again in the fall.

""I look forward to more debate ... in elections, sometimes it's difficult to get the message across so I believe in the fall [it will] be much better.""

Federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh won the Burnaby South byelection on Monday night with 39 per cent of the vote – but he is getting a great deal of attention for his rap game on Tuesday.

A huge crowd of supporters turned up to support Singh for this critical moment in his political career. Following the win, elated supporters turned the event room into a dance party.

“I will be your champion,” Singh said. “I will take each and every one of you to Ottawa. I will fight for you in the House of Commons.”

Of course, many people were dancing, but one of the night’s highlights was Singh rapping Post Malone’s “Congratulations.” Not only was he rapping some of the lyrics, but he also passionately pumped up the crowd. In fact, Singh got so into the beat that he started motioning to the crowd to jump when the chorus dropped, and he proceeded to jump on the platform.

Jagmeet Singh wins Burnaby South

Singh, the first visible minority leader of a major federal party, said that when he was growing up, he never imagined seeing someone who looked like him running to be the prime minister of Canada.

“We just showed a lot of kids out there that yes we can,” he said, borrowing a slogan from former U.S. President Barack Obama.

in its history. Nitin Sharma traces the journey of the rally, which was conceived  38 years ago and has enthralled rallyists as well as tricity r…","It was on the evening of July 19, 1980 that the St John’s Old Boys Association (SJOBA) was formed at the founder president Manmohan Lal Sarin’s home in Chandigarh. Nine months after the body came into being, SJOBA organised its first Scooter Motorcycle SJOBA Rally on March 8, 1981. While the first edition of the rally saw more than 40 riders competing, the second edition also saw the introduction of cars and jeeps in. The rally, which started as a one-day long affair, will see its 32nd edition being held over three days starting March 1 later this year

“The first meeting of SJOBA was held with 19 members on July 19, 1981 and the founding members were keen on organising a sporting event. Unlike other sports, motorsports gives an opportunity to a young rider to compete against an older rider and vice versa; this was the main reason we decided to hold the first SJOBA Rally in March, 1982.,” recalls Sarin, adding how he would accompany his brother Ranjit Lal Sarin to chalk out the route. “We also came out with a souvenir publication, which we used to raise funds for advertisements to conduct the rally,” adds Sarin.

The first rally, which was flagged off from the St John’s High School, Sector 26, was meant only for the scooter/motorbikes. The four-wheelers were introduced in the second edition. The first route of the rally saw riders traversing from Chandigarh to Kasauli-Dagshai-Chail and back to Chandigarh on the same day.

This year, the rally will be conducted for the first time in the plains with the new route covering places like Baddi in Himachal Pradesh and Garshankar in Punjab apart from seeing a night stage.

“We started with the stage format and a couple of women riders too competed in the second edition of the rally. As the number of participants grew in the coming years, we made it a two-day affair in 1996. After getting the affiliation with Federation of Motor Sports Club of India (FMSCI) in 2000, we also introduced the time-speed-distance (TSD) format in 2007 apart from converting the rally to a three-day long drive in 2006, which meant that the city residents could also see the rallyists in action. Nowadays, more and more riders are competing in the TSD format too and that is good for rallying. This year we have also introduced the night stage apart from conducting the rally in plains in Punjab,” said SPS Ghai, one of the founding members of SJOBA.

Champions Speak

With rallyists like five-time SJOBA champion Suresh Rana to celebrities like Gul Panag, the rally has seen some of India’s top ranked rallyists in its 31 editions. Rana, who is a multiple winner of Raid-De-Himalaya, will be making his return to SJOBA this year after missing the rally for some years. “The best thing about SJOBA Rally is that it helps you prepare for the more tougher rallies with the same kind of terrain and competitiveness. It is a short rally in terms of number of days as well as route but that makes it more competitive too. I am making a return to the rally after some years and I will be driving a Gypsy this time instead of Grand Vitara. The fact that the rally is being held in plains will make the rally more open and it will be a exciting thing to compete in the night stage too,” shares Rana, who is based in Manali.

Kalka biker Mohit Verma, a three-time winner in the rally in the motorbikes format with his first title coming in 2011, sees the rally as a big stepping stone in his racing career. 28-year-old Verma, who became the only Indian rider to win the Raid-De-Himalaya, Desert Storm, Dakshin Dare and SJOBA Rally in 2014, is currently away from the circuit due to an injury.

“If you are a beginner, the SJOBA Rally puts you in competition against experienced riders and a rider can take him time to master the format and return back strong in the next edition. When I won the title in 2011, it was one of my first titles and gave me a lot of confidence. In 2014, when I won the titles in all the rallies, it meant a lot for me. I suffered an injury in 2015 but those wins are always special for me,” shared Verma. Two-time winner in TSD format, Jagmeet Gill also believes the same. “Winning the rally twice in the TSD format as a former student means a lot for me. I had competed for the first time in 2009 in the rally. As a rallyist, one enjoys the tough competition in this rally,” shared 34-year-old Gill.

Woman Power

Over the years, SJOBA Rally has seen more than 50 women participants competing as riders as well as navigators. Last year, the rally saw riders like Sarah Kashyap, Anita Krishan and Suzanne Bull competing in the Extreme Moto category apart from some woman riders in the TSD format. Kashyap, who had moved to Dubai last year, is the only Indian female rider to complete Raid-De-Himalaya and Desert Storm.

The 33-year-old competed for the first time in the rally in 2015 while riding a Bullet. Last year, Kashyap finished first in the ladies category and 11th overall in Moto Extreme category. “I first heard about SJOBA rally when I was kid. I never thought I will compete in the rally one day. When I competed in the rally in 2015, it was my first rally ever and I had never raced before that. I kept falling off the motorbike and I even got a heat stroke after which the organsiers asked me if I wanted to continue. I got an appreciation award that year and it motivated me. I have competed in the rally three times so far and it has laid the foundation for many cross-country rallies for me. It was easily the stepping stone for Raid-De-Himalaya and Desert Storm and taught me the required skills. The rally has new routes every year and it poses fresh challenges every year,” shares Kashyap.

Former Miss India and Bollywood actress Gul Panag too competed in the TSD format in the rally in 2010 with her two cousins and an aunt. Panag acted as the navigator for her cousin Simrat and they won the event in the women’s category in TSD format. “It was an experience to remember for all of us. My team consisted of my two cousins and aunt and all four of us competed in the TSD format. Being the navigator, I was responsible for guiding my cousin about the route and also keep a track of others things. It was a different challenge in every stage and we enjoyed a lot competing in such a rally. It is good to see more and more women riders competing in such events,” shares Panag.

Logistics Control

There is a lot of logistics involved in the rally that sees close to 80 riders competing in the 4WD Extreme, Moto Extreme and TSD categories apart from spectators stage SSS.

Vishal Sharma, the present president of SJOBA, says their task begins with charting out the route. “The chalking of route begins 40-50 days prior to the rally and we do the recce of the whole route more than five times. Then there is the task of making rule books and log books for the route. Once I was officiating as a marshal and sitting on a hill top. A group of monkeys came and took my equipment,” he laughs.

Another SJOBA member Vivek Bansal handles the communication part of the rally which means setting up the communication channels and radio for the drivers. “I am Ham Radio operator and the toughest part in SJOBA rally is to provide coverage in the valleys. Most of the times, we sit on hilltops to get full coverage. Once while officiating at Barog, we had a slide shave when lightning struck my radio and other equipment,” shares Bansal.

Kshitij Sharma, secretary, SJOBA, too has seen the action from close. “This year, more than 140 SJOBA members will act as volunteers and we have got close to 80 entries. The event has been successful because of the efforts of all the members as well as riders,” says Sharma.

The Way Ahead

With new sponsors supporting the rally, it will see the night stage happening this year. As Manmohan Lal Sarin proudly shows the first souvenir, he is quick to add, “The rallying gods have been kind to us in all these years. Apart from one incident in the starting years when a car skidded down and the death of a rider in an accident some years later, the rally has been conducted smoothly. When a rallyist died in an accident, we were deeply saddened and thought about discontinuing the rally.

But then Brother Meredith told us to remain calm and see it as a mishap, which can take place in any sport. When the car of a competitor fell into a khud, Jimmy Sehgal, one of the competitors and leader at that point, stopped and helped the rider. Such heartwarming incidents have given strength to the organisers and rallyists.”

‘My first win at SJOBA will always be special’

SPS Garcha, 65, still remembers the first time he competed in the SJOBA rally. It was the first edition of the rally in 1981 and the 1971 batch alumnus of St John’s was also actively involved in organising the rally. Garcha, who started competing in motorsports in 1977, became the first winner of the Scooter/Motorbike Open SJOBA Rally in 1981 and went on to become the national champion for five successive years from 1982 to 1987.

Garcha won the rally on a Jawa motorcyle and was told not to compete in the following editions of the rally to give others a chance.

“I was actively involved in planning the route and doing the recce for the rally. I used to have a 1966 JAWA motorbike at that time. After the first stage in the morning, we had lunch at Solan with me in the lead but on the eay back , my bike’s rear brakes got heated. As the route was uphill, I removed the brakes and continued. Riding uphill does not require much of rear brakes and when I reached Barog, the brakes had cooled down and I completed the last stage. I have very find memories of my first win,” says Garcha.

The motorsports champion also used to run a garage in those days. The following years saw him working closely with the Federation of Motor Sports Club of India (FMSCI) and officiating in many rallies besides working as the federation’s regional director. A senior steward and technical delegate with FMSCI, the former rallyist is still involved in charting the route and officiating at the SJOBA Rally. “In the 1980s, we would read books and magzines to learn about various rules and the various formats of a rally. Since the rally was held only in Stage Rally format, it would mean spending hours chalking out the route and understanding the map. There was less traffic and most of the roads were tracks. Despite tech advancements, the core of the racing has remained intact. That’s why a lot of new riders compete every year,” adds Garcha.

Looking back at his long and adventurous innings, Garcha remembers an incident during the Raid De Himalaya. “I was officiating as one of the stewards of the course when one of the cars did not cross the next point. Knowing that something was wrong, we reversed and sure enough, I saw skid marks. It was close to midnight but we launched a search for the car.

Jagmeet Singh could lead the NDP to victory in the federal election this fall, but only if the party re-engages with its socialist roots, according to a former NDP MPP.

""We're looking at polls that say that socialism, as a word, is now more popular than capitalism for millennials,"" said Cheri DiNovo, who served for 11 years as an Ontario NDP MPP.

She told The Current's Anna Maria Tremonti that to capture those votes, the NDP doesn't need ""slippery language,"" but needs to stand ""on firm socialist ground."" The party needs to espouse positions like ""being very adamant about our opposition to pipelines, being very pro about doing something for the environment,"" she added.

""We need to take stands that are in dramatic contrast to liberalism, and neo-liberalism and centrism … no one needs another Liberal party.

""And ... if we do that, yes, I think we'll win.""

Singh won a byelection in Burnaby South, B.C., Monday, with 39 per cent of the vote. He will take a seat in the House of Commons for the first time. His win was balanced against an NDP loss to the Liberals in another byelection in Outremont, Que, the centre of the so-called Orange Wave that boosted the NDP to Official Opposition status in 2011, for the first time in its history.

NDP leader rallies supporters after Burnaby South win, calls for change in Ottawa 1:18

The party now sits at 14 per cent nationally, 11 per cent in Quebec and 16 per cent in B.C., according to CBC's poll tracker.

""The bad news is we've halved our polling in Quebec. The bad news is we're losing MPs who are not running again. That's the bad news,"" said DiNovo.

""The good news is that this … could be a reboot and that Jagmeet's completely capable of being a leader in such a reboot, if and only if, the party starts focusing on policies and starts focusing on principles.""

To discuss the byelection results and what lies ahead for the NDP, Tremonti was joined by:

Ed Broadbent, former leader of the federal NDP, and chair of the Broadbent Institute

Farouk Karim, who served as press secretary for the federal NDP caucus until 2016, and now works for the Canadian Union of Postal Workers

Cheri DiNovo, who served for 11 years as an Ontario NDP MPP, and is now the minister at Trinity-St. Paul's Centre for Faith, Justice and the Arts in Toronto

""I will have been doing it for nearly seven years by the time the next election comes along and I think it's time to pass the torch,"" Rankin said in an interview with CBC News.

""I wasn't prepared to spend the next four years doing this. I thought at this stage, I wanted to do other things with my life aside from politics.""

""Not to say this hasn't been the most exciting and rewarding career that I've ever had, but it's time for a change.""

Rankin is the 12th NDP MP out of the 44 elected in 2015 to resign or announce in recent months that they won't run again in October. Others, like B.C. MP Nathan Cullen, have said they are also weighing their futures in politics.

With eight months to the next election, the New Democrats are in third place with an estimated 14.2 per cent of support, compared with 35.8 per cent for the Conservatives and 33.9 per cent for the Liberals.

'People are saying we've got a strong leader'

Rankin said his decision has nothing to do with the party's popularity or the leadership of Singh, who was elected to the House of Commons on Monday in a byelection in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South.

""I think people are saying we've got a strong leader as well and as soon as Canadians get to know him better I think there's going to be an enormous uptick in support, and I think we're in a good position for the next election.""

Rankin said those who are leaving have a variety of reasons.

""Transition happens all the time in a party. I don't think the narrative that people are abandoning the NDP team is really warranted. It's certainly not relevant in my case. That's not the reason I have decided to move on.""

Rankin's announcement comes as he is in the spotlight as a key member of the justice committee examining allegations key government officials pressured former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement with SNC-Lavalin. (Chris Wattie/Reuters)

While the NDP has held the riding of Victoria since 2006, Rankin's departure could create an opportunity for Elizabeth May's Green Party.

Rankin was first elected in a byelection in November 2012, narrowly beating a Green Party candidate by less than three percentage points. While he increased his margin of victory in 2015 to more than nine percentage points, Green Party candidate Jo-Ann Roberts was a close second, with the Liberals and the Conservatives lagging far behind.

Rankin's riding also borders May's riding of Saanich-Gulf Islands and is represented provincially by B.C. Green Party Leader Andrew Weaver.

While Rankin acknowledges the Green Party posted one of its strongest results across the country in his riding in the last election, he said voters would be better off voting for whoever succeeds him as the NDP candidate — particularly if that candidate is a strong advocate for the environment.

""If you're caring deeply about these issues, where do you think you're going to have the most clout in Ottawa? Being part of a team that may have the balance of power in the next Parliament, the NDP? Or a team that has, so far, one member?""

Unpopular Liberal decisions

Rankin said the riding also has a base of Liberal support but he said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government has made decisions that are unpopular in the riding.

""There's a lot of disenchantment with the fact the electoral reform didn't go through. The pipeline issue — I would be lying to you if I didn't say that was an enormous obstacle for the Liberals on Vancouver Island. People are just not prepared to take chances with our coastline.""

Rankin's announcement comes as circumstances have thrust him into the spotlight as a key point person for the NDP in what he describes as a ""constitutional crisis"" — former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould's assertion that key government officials pressured her to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement with Quebec construction giant SNC-Lavalin which is facing charges of fraud and corruption.

He is also the NDP's deputy house leader and a member of the highly secret National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians.

While he plans to serve out his mandate, Rankin has already been appointed by the B.C. government to help guide and design a new reconciliation process with Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs who have been opposing a natural gas pipeline in Northern B.C. and implement the Supreme Court's Delgamuukw, decision which helped define indigenous title.

""The new government in Victoria, I'm very proud of the fact that they're committed to trying to do things differently. They have, in their speech from the throne, committed to the UN Declaration on the rights of Indigenous people. They talk about implementing the historic Delgamuukw case and to be given an opportunity to do that is something I couldn't say no to.""

A lawyer by profession, he is also thinking of once again teaching law at the University of Victoria and has been approached by law firms to practice environmental and Indigenous law.

But for now he is focused on completing his mandate and getting to the bottom of the SNC-Lavalin case.

""There's a lot of work to do here. We're living through a constitutional crisis right now in the House of Commons. … We're dealing with issues that are absolutely historic and important so that will take a lot of my time.""

Finally. More than 16 months after he cruised to victory in the NDP leadership race, the 40-year-old politician from Ontario clinched his first federal seat in a British Columbia byelection Monday.

Not only will Singh now be able to lead his party from the floor of the House of Commons, he may also have saved his political career, for defeat in Burnaby South on Monday — as many NDP insiders have put it — was simply not an option for the third-place party. Singh’s victory came in one of three byelections held Monday, as voters in key battleground areas cast ballots against the backdrop of the lingering SNC-Lavalin scandal. In York-Simcoe, the Conservatives hold onto a Greater Toronto Area riding that has been a lock for the party since 2004. And here in Outremont, a diverse and multilingual district at the heart of the Island of Montreal, voters returned to their long-established tradition of electing Liberals, 12 years after Thomas Mulcair’s breakthrough here became the symbolic forerunner to the unprecedented success of the “orange wave” election in 2011.

The NDP leader campaigned against a Liberal government he accuses of cosying up to corporate friends, falling short on affordable housing and failing to take climate change seriously. The riding was previously held by Kennedy Stewart, an NDP MP who won by about 500 votes in 2015 and resigned the seat last year to run for Vancouver mayor. David Coletto, chief executive officer of Abacus Data, said a Singh victory is the first bit of good news the NDP has had in a long time. Under Singh’s leadership — which began when he cruised to victory in the October 2017 leadership race — the NDP has stalled in the polls, seen a parade of sitting MPs quit or announce they won’t run again in the general election, and experienced a sharp drop in fundraising from more than $18 million in 2015 to roughly $5 million last year.

Singh’s entry to the House of Commons gives the party a chance to change the narrative, Coletto said. “It gives them a huge opportunity to pivot and to start rebuilding his own reputation,” he said. “Low expectations can be a really powerful tool, because it’s easier to meet them.” Singh’s chances may have been boosted by the SNC-Lavalin scandal, which the NDP has used to portray the Liberals as a band of faux-progressive allies of big business. Combined with a Liberal stumble — candidate Karen Wang was replaced by former MLA Richard Lee partway through the race — and the possibility that People’s Party candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson snags votes from the Conservatives’ Jay Shin, the riding looked primed for a Singh win, said political scientist David Moscrop. “Burnaby South is sort of cooked for him to win,” he said Monday morning. Meanwhile, the results in York-Simcoe pointed to victory for Conservative candidate Scot Davidson. For 14 years, the riding north of Toronto was home to Peter Van Loan, a Harper-era cabinet minister who resigned from the House of Commons last year. That continued Monday with Davidson on pace to beat Liberal challenger — and second-time candidate — Shaun Tanaka. With such a record of Conservative voting, Coletto said he is looking to see how Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party — and local candidate Robert Geurts — performs in the riding. “The most important signal we get from tonight is how well does Max Bernier’s party do,” he said, adding the party could make an impact in all three byelections. “That will give us an indication of the potential effectiveness of his party,” he said. Meanwhile, Outremont was a Liberal stronghold for decades, until Mulcair won it for the NDP in a 2007 byelection. It is therefore hallowed turf for New Democrats, who see Mulcair’s success as the symbolic toehold for the “orange wave” in 2011, when the party was lifted to its best-ever federal election result by overwhelming success in Quebec. But now that Mulcair has left politics, local lawyer Rachel Bendayan wrested Outremont back for the Liberals Monday night. By late Monday, she had a sizable lead over Julia Sanchez, an economist who worked for decades in international development, who campaigned on an environment-focused platform for the NDP. One factor in the race may have been voter reaction to the SNC-Lavalin affair, which has a strong local component given the company is headquartered nearby in downtown Montreal and is a significant employer in the province. Shachi Kurl, executive director of the Angus Reid Institute not-for-profit polling firm, said while early polling has suggested the Liberals have taken a hit during the controversy, SNC-Lavalin is seen in a different light — as a big employer worth saving — by many in the province. But regardless of its impact Monday, it is too early to conclude whether the controversy surrounding the company and Justin Trudeau’s office will linger into the fall general election, Moscrop said. “I think this is a reminder to the Liberals that, boy, you don’t want this in the news in October,” he said. “The sooner you deal with this completely, the better.” Alex Ballingall is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

Big day today on Parliament Hill.

Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould is set to speak her truth about the SNC-Lavalin controversy this week—specifically, tomorrow,* when she appears before a justice committee that’s looking into whether the PMO tried to pressure her into going easy on SNC-Lavalin.

Will she light it up? If the former AG adds credible colour to the story being told by anonymous sources this past week, it will be a devastating day for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, writes Andrew MacDougall: “If you’re Trudeau, it’s hard to envision an appearance in which Wilson-Raybould doesn’t burn everything—Trudeau included—to the ground. There has been some serious red-on-red action on the nation’s front pages in the past few days, and only one side can survive.” (Maclean’s)

No, no, no: The men who wanted SNC-Lavalin to avoid criminal prosecution engaged in “Grand-Master-Jedi-level gaslighting” of former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould by repeatedly refusing to accept her authority on the file and then insisting she was under no pressure, writes Anne Kingston:

Even before her testimony, however, an eerily familiar tale has unfolded, the last chapter in the spell-binding spiel from [Privy Council Clerk] Michael Wernick, clerk of the Privy Council, this week before the justice committee. And that’s the spectre of powerful men not used to hearing “No,” not willing to accept “No,” doggedly pushing for a “Yes” from the person who ostensibly determines consent, then gaslighting her when they don’t hear it. Through it all a question emerges: How many times did Jody Wilson Raybould need to say “No” before she was heard? (Maclean’s)

Singh needs this win: Monday is also byelection day. Votes will be counted in three ridings, including Ontario’s York-Simcoe and Outremont in Montreal. But the one everyone will be watching is Burnaby South, where NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh hopes to finally secure a seat in the House. With his leadership in question, and the NDP low on polling and fundraising support, Singh needs victory—and the SNC-Lavalin mess embroiling Liberals can only help “(Singh) may have been handed the gift of some voters as a result of all this,” saysRichard Johnston, a University of British Columbia political science professor. “Although it’s just one thing amongst many, boy, he could use a win right now.” (Canadian Press, CBC News)

Politics show round-up

Didn’t catch the weekend politics shows? Here’s what you missed:

In his testimony to the justice committee Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick attacked the original Globe and Mail story that kicked off the SNC-Lavalin scandal. Bob Fife, one of the journalists who broke the story, made the rounds, and on CTV’s Question Period defended the scoop: “In politics the best defence is often a strong offence, and particularly shooting the messenger, but in his testimony [Wernick] actually confirmed what we reported—we reported Miss Wilson-Raybould was subjected to pressure to cut a deal so SNC-Lavalin would not be prosecuted, would pay a fine. We did not say the Prime Minister directed her to do so. Nobody said that. In fact nobody did do that.” (CTV video tweet)

Speaking on Question Period Conservative Justice Critic Lisa Raitt said Wernick’s committee testimony shows lines were crossed with Wilson-Raybould: “Jody Wilson-Raybould told the prime minister and the clerk of the privy council in no uncertain terms she wasn’t going to overrule her deputy on the matter. That’s where it should end. And yet we see time and time again through phone calls through meetings between her staff and the PMO, the prime minister himself, Gerald Butts, and whoever else that we’ll find along the way, all took it upon themselves to go in and check-in with her and see whether or not she’s taken another decision.” (CTV News)

Following Friday’s recommendation by the National Energy Board that the Trans Mountain pipeline be approved, Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi said Ottawa is on track to wrap up consultations with 117 Indigenous committees that would be impacted by the pipeline within the next few months: “The work that we have done so far and the work we will continue to do in the coming months, I can tell you that I feel that we are in a very strong position to conclude these consultations within the next 90 days. But we must get it right.” (Global News)

On Trans Mountain, Canada’s fisheries minister Jonathan Wilkinson told CBC’s The House that increased tanker traffic from the pipeline expansion won’t have much additional impact on endangered southern resident killer whales because they’re already being blasted with underwater noise. “It’s important to understand that the plight of the southern resident killer whale has very little to do with the Trans Mountain pipeline, he said. “There are 3,200 large container ships that come into Burrard Inlet every year, there are thousands of ferries…. All of those generate noise. So irrespective of whether Trans Mountain proceeds there’s a need for us to actually address issues around marine traffic.” (CBC News)

The New Democrats secured a seat for their leader, Jagmeet Singh. The Liberals stole a riding away from the NDP in Quebec and the Conservatives increased their support in a GTA stronghold. The Greens and the People's Party each hit double digits in one of the three contests as well.

That's the good news. But there was bad news, too.

Both the Liberals and Conservatives saw their support slip in two out of three byelections. The NDP lost Outremont, the scene of the party's first breakthrough into Quebec in 2007 that foreshadowed the Orange Wave of 2011. And where the Greens and Maxime Bernier's party didn't hit double digits, they weren't a factor whatsoever.

So what to make of the glass-half-full, glass-half-empty results?

In his victory speech, Singh thanked supporters and promised to fight against poverty and continue his party's campaign for a universal pharmacare plan.

""And when I take my seat in the House of Commons, I will work hard to make you all very proud,"" Singh said.

Singh's win came in one of three federal byelections held Monday in B.C., Ontario and Quebec.

In Ontario's York—Simcoe riding, Conservative candidate Scot Davidson claimed victory, stepping into a seat long held by retired Conservative MP Peter Van Loan.

In the Montreal riding of Outremont, Liberal Rachel Bendayan won her campaign, taking control of a seat last held by former NDP leader Thomas Mulcair.

Results from Burnaby South in B.C., show Singh claimed victory with 39 per cent of the vote. The Liberals followed with 26 per cent, followed by the Conservatives with 22.5 per cent. Former Conservative MP Maxime Bernier's People's Party of Canada trailed with 10.6 per cent.

Singh also pledged to help the NDP ""reconnect"" with Quebec voters who have drifted away, in an effort to realize the political ambitions of the party's late leader, Jack Layton.

""We are the champions for Quebecers. New Democrats are the champions for Canadians, we will continue to do that work.""

Low turnout

The Conservatives secured their seat in the Ontario riding of York—Simcoe with 53.2 per cent of the vote to the Liberals' 29.9 per cent and the NDP's 7.4 per cent with 115 of 136 polls reporting.

Early numbers showed that turnout in all three byelections was low: just over 19 per cent in York—Simcoe and just over 18 per cent in Outremont. Burnaby South drew slightly larger numbers at 29 per cent, but all three fell below the average of the last 20 years which sits at just under 35 per cent for byelections.

Watch as Jagmeet Singh declares victory:

In Outremont — where the NDP was looking to hold on to the seat of the party's former leader — Bendayan claimed victory with 40 per cent of the vote. The NDP trailed with 26.1 per cent, followed by the Greens and then the Bloc Québécois.

""On behalf of Liberals across Canada, I want to congratulate Rachel Bendayan and her team on their hard-earned victory, and I know that she will be a dedicated voice for Outremont in Parliament,"" Suzanne Cowan, president of the Liberal Party of Canada, said in a statement.

Vancouver NDP MP Jenny Kwan acknowledged the loss of Outremont was ""a disappointment.""

""What we're going to do, of course, is learn from this experience and then we're going to redouble our efforts to ensure that the people of Quebec know we are there for them,"" she said at Singh's victory party.

The NDP has struggled since Singh became leader in 2017. The party now sits at 14 per cent nationally, 11 per cent in Quebec and 16 per cent in B.C., according to CBC's poll tracker.

Julia Sanchez, a former international development executive, was the NDP's candidate in Outremont. Bendayan, a lawyer and former party staffer, ran against Mulcair in the last election, finishing second with 33.5 per cent of the vote to Mulcair's 44 per cent.

Conservatives win York—Simcoe

While the Conservatives usually have a tough time winning when the NDP is in a weakened position, the party kept its seat in York—Simcoe, Ont., formerly held by Peter Van Loan.

The former leader of Stephen Harper's government in the Commons, Van Loan stepped down from his seat in September and announced he was retiring from politics.

Conservative candidate Scot Davidson won the byelection in the Ontario riding of York-Simcoe. (CBC)

Van Loan won York—Simcoe in the 2015 federal election with more than 50 per cent of the vote to the Liberals' almost 38 per cent.

Davidson, a businessman, beat out Liberal candidate Shaun Tanaka, a geography professor at Queen's University and the University of Toronto, who also ran for the Liberals in the 2015 electio​n.

In his victory speech, Davidson thanked supporters and told them he is going to Ottawa to be a MP for everyone. He said he is the type of guy who is eager to meet with new constituents face-to-face to hear their concerns.

The breakaway People's Party of Canada, created last summer by Bernier, faced its first electoral test in the byelections. Results suggest it could be a spoiler that deprives the Conservatives of victory in tight contests come the fall.

While the fledgling party won less than two per cent of the vote in Outremont and York—Simcoe, it did surprisingly well in Burnaby South, where Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson won more than 10 per cent of the vote after running on a ""Canadians first"" campaign that was denounced as anti-immigration and racist by some supporters of rival candidates.","Voters cast ballots in Ont., B.C. and Que. byelections tonight",CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/byelections-burnaby-south-york-simcoe-outremont-1.5033259

Rankin has been representing Victoria, B.C. since he was first elected in a 2012 byelection. He plans to keep his seat until the end of this Parliament, at which point he says he’s keen to do other things.

""It has been the most rewarding, exciting thing I've ever done, serving as an MP… people writing an 'X' beside your name is something that will live with you forever, "" Rankin told CTVNews.ca ""But I never expected I would do it for the remainder of my career.""

As for what he plans to do next, he was recently appointed by the government of British Columbia to work as the province's representative in treaty renegotiations with the Wet'suwe''en First Nation as the two sides seek to affirm the rights and title of the Wet'suwet'en people.

Rankin worked for the federal government as a treaty negotiator for years, as well as a lawyer for various Indigenous communities and he thinks he is in a good position to understand both sides through this reconciliation process.

""I want to try to make a contribution in my own way,"" Rankin said. This is in addition to his plans to keep up on other legal matters, including the ongoing fight against the Trans Mountain pipeline, which is strongly opposed in his riding.

Rankin shot down any question that his departure has to do with the current state of the NDP, amid low polling numbers and fundraising troubles.

""It's simply not the case,"" Rankin said. ""I think it's time for a fresh look.""

His departure makes it at least a dozen NDP MPs who have announced they will not be running again, some of which have already vacated their seats. He said this wave of departures allows for party ""renewal.""

He said he is optimistic that the party is ""turning around"" now that leader Jagmeet Singh has clinched a seat in the House. Rankin predicted that once Canadians can see him in the Commons the party’s fortunes will ""dramatically improve.""

During his time on Parliament Hill, Rankin has sat on the House Finance Committee, House Health Committee, the special committee tasked with physician-assisted dying, and is a part of the House Justice Committee that is currently probing the SNC-Lavalin scandal.

He's also been the NDP House leader, and is the sole and first NDP MP on the top-secret National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians.

Over the last few months he's been pushing the government to pursue expungements for people with past pot possession charges, and not simply pardons, as Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale is poised to table imminently. He has presented a private member's bill to this effect and condemned the Liberals' plan as a ""half-measure."" He said he'll see what the bill that Goodale ends up introducing contains, but he’s planning on being disappointed.

Rankin voiced appreciation for the support of his wife, Linda Hannah, and two adult children during his many years of splitting his time between the West Coast and Ottawa.

430,Empty,2019-02-28T22:46:13Z,"The NDP justice critic has been busy probing the SNC-Lavalin affair, but plans to step down in October","VICTORIA — Victoria MP Murray Rankin took a break Thursday from one of his busiest weeks ever in Ottawa to announce he will not run in this year’s federal election.

The NDP justice critic, who has played a key role in probing the SNC-Lavalin affair, said there’s never a right time to make such a decision.

“Obviously, I wasn’t taking into account in my calculation the serious constitutional crisis that we have right on us,” he said in a telephone interview. “But I will continue to do that (work) until I’m no longer an MP in October.”

Rankin, who was first elected in 2012, said he decided to announce his intentions now to allow for a successor to get nominated and build a profile in the community.

He noted, too, that he’s leaving behind a strong electoral-district association with money in the bank and a team of volunteers.

“So I think I can honestly look myself in the mirror and say that I’m leaving this ship in good shape,” he said.

Finally, he added that the NDP has a bit of “spring in our step” now with new leader Jagmeet Singh winning his seat and a scandal threatening the Liberal government.

“It seemed like it was a good time for me to get on with the rest of my life,” he said.

Rankin, who last year was nominated by his peers for the title of hardest-working parliamentarian, stressed, however, that he has no plans to take things easy.

“I want to let people in Victoria know that I take very seriously representing them,” he said. “I have in the past and that’s not going to change as I step away from the election.

“In an ironic way, I hope I can work harder on some of the issues now because I won’t be involved in knocking on thousands of doors and doing all-candidates meetings.”

Among other things, Rankin said he’ll keep pushing the federal government for money to expand the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria. “The province stepped up, the private sector stepped up, and I’m trying desperately hard to get the federal government to contribute.”

In the years ahead, Rankin plans to devote his time to reconciliation efforts with First Nations. “Aside from climate change, I think reconciliation is one of the key challenges of our time.”

A lawyer, who specialized in environmental and aboriginal rights law before becoming an MP, Rankin was recently appointed by the B.C. government as its representative in a reconciliation process with the Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs.

“I think it’s an important assignment,” he said. “I’ll be working on behalf of the provincial government. I’m not getting paid for this. I’m simply going to do this because I’m committed to doing it.”

Among the highlights of his career, Rankin cited his role advising government on the legalization of medical assistance in dying and sitting on Parliament’s new intelligence and national security oversight committee. He also pointed to his role opposing the Enbridge pipeline.

At an age when many people retire and hit the golf course, Rankin, 69, said he has no plans to slow down.

“From binners to billionaires, I have met people all across our community, in all walks of life,” he said.

“This job makes you, requires you, to get to know your community like no other position. It’s just a remarkable community. So you know what? I want to keep growing from that, not simply going and retiring to the golf course. That’s not me.”

Rankin joins a growing list of NDP MPs who have announced they are not going to be running again in October’s election.

The list includes Alberta MP Linda Duncan, Ontario MPs Irene Mathyssen and David Christopherson, Quebec’s Helene Laverdiere, Romeo Saganash, Marjolaine Boutin-Sweet and Anne Minh-Thu Quach and B.C.’s Fin Donnelly.

Former MPs Kennedy Stewart and Sheila Malcolmson also left their jobs. Stewart is now Vancouver’s mayor and Malcolmson is a provincial politician in B.C.

Former Quebec MP and leader Tom Mulcair also quit politics to work as a visiting professor at Université de Montreal.

Please allow us a Mea culpa about yesterday’s edition. We got ahead of ourselves and said former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould would begin testifying Monday before the justice committee reviewing the SNC-Lavalin case. Her first appearance is (or was—see below) expected for today, instead. Very sorry about that.

Singh gets his win: NDP leader Jagmeet Singh pulled ahead early in the evening in the Burnaby South byelection and held that lead to the end, clinching 38.5 per cent of the vote. The Liberals came second with 25.8 per cent to the Conservatives’ 22.8 per cent, while the People’s Party took 11.1 per cent. (Results as of midnight ET with 89 per cent of polls reporting.) The win will allow Singh to put some of the questions about his performance as leader behind him as he takes a seat in the House. Meanwhile the Conservatives have got to be hoping the People’s Party just had a fluke of a good night that won’t be replicated across the country come October. (Canadian Press)

Win one, lose one: The NDP lost the byelection in Outremont, Que., the riding previously head by former leader Tom Mulcair, to the Liberals. Meanwhile the Conservatives reclaimed York-Simcoe as expected.

Waiting for Wilson-Raybould: It’s apparent now that Wilson-Raybould won’t be speaking today either. On Monday she sent a letter to the committee stating that, while “anxious” to testify, her testimony might need to be delayed until she and the committee have “as much clarity as we can in relation to the possible constraints on the matters about which I may properly testify. … I would prefer not to schedule my appearance before the Committee until we all have whatever clarity we can have about these issues.” (CBC News)

Those issues are solicitor-client privilege, cabinet confidentiality, and “sub judice,” a parliamentary convention that covers speaking about cases before the courts.

Earlier in the day Prime Minister Justin Trudeau did tell Parliament his government would confirm that Wilson-Raybould “will be able to address relevant matters at the committee while ensuring that the two active court cases are not jeopardized.”

And sure enough on Monday night the Liberals issued an order in council authorizing Wilson-Raybould “and any persons who directly participated in discussions with her relating to the exercise of her authority” to speak to the committee and the federal ethics commissioner. The order waved any solicitor-client privilege that existed and freed her from cabinet confidentiality. However, to safeguard the court case against SNC-Lavalin, Wilson-Raybould is not allowed to testify about anything discussed between her and the Director of Public Prosecutions about the file. (CTV News, Orders in Council)

So the question now is, does that sufficiently meet Wilson-Raybould’s request for an “authoritative statement” before she testifies? When she does speak, it promises to be gripping. In her letter to the committee Wilson-Raybould requested a full 30 minutes to make her opening statement.

The Conservatives tried, and failed, to pass a motion that would have compelled Trudeau to also testify at the justice committee. (CBC News)

With more than half the polls reporting results in Burnaby South, Singh had just over 38 per cent of the vote, comfortably ahead of Liberal Richard T. Lee's 26 per cent and Conservative Jay Shin's 22 per cent.

But while victory tightens Singh's shaky grip on the reins of the NDP, the challenge ahead was underscored by the simultaneous loss of the Montreal riding that launched the NDP's orange wave that swept Quebec in 2011.

In Outremont, Liberal contender Rachel Bendayan held more than 42 per cent of the vote with two-thirds of the riding's polls reporting results, with the NDP's Julia Sanchez running second with just over 25 per cent.

Outremont was a longtime Liberal stronghold until 2007, when former NDP leader Tom Mulcair scored an upset byelection victory for the NDP, creating a beachhead for the New Democrats that helped them launch their 2011 sweep of Quebec and vault them into official Opposition status for the first time in party history.

The Conservatives, meanwhile, easily hung onto the Ontario riding of York-Simcoe.

Conservative candidate Scot Davidson captured just over 50 per cent of the vote with a majority of polls reporting results, with Liberal Shaun Tanaka taking 31 per cent.

To most Canadians, Singh remained invisible. When he did emerge into the spotlight, he too often appeared defensive and ill-prepared. At times he seemed at odds with the party’s federal caucus. He also managed to engage in a feud with virtually the entire Saskatchewan wing of the NDP over an issue — the social awkwardness shown by Regina MP Erin Weir toward women — that was essentially trivial. If Singh had not won the Burnaby South byelection, he would have found it near-impossible to stay on as leader.

At a time when socialism is no longer a dirty word, it also gives the NDP a chance to define itself as a serious left-wing alternative to the Liberals and Conservatives. The NDP’s roots lie in the prairie populism and Fabian socialism of the old Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. But the party has never been entirely comfortable with its socialist antecedents. Nor has it always been at ease with its ties to organized labour.

That has made language important. The party tends to avoid terms like “working class” as too Red. It prefers instead to speak of “working families” or “ordinary Canadians” or “everyday families.” For years, the party warred internally over whether to keep the word “socialism” in its constitution. In the end, it settled on a compromise that talked of the party’s “social democratic and democratic socialist traditions.” Under the leadership of Jack Layton and later Thomas Mulcair, the NDP focused on replacing the Liberals as Canada’s centre-left party — and almost succeeded. But the 2015 election, which saw the Liberals under Justin Trudeau successfully feint to the left, demonstrated the key limitation of this strategy: It’s hard to out-Liberal the Liberals. Oddly enough, as the NDP continues to try and avoid sounding too left-wing, socialism has become fashionable again in the U.S. and Britain. In the U.S., seven contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination — including avowed socialist Bernie Sanders — have signed onto something called the Green New Deal. Among other things, it calls for the federal government to provide a good-paying job to whoever wants one. In Britain, much to the dismay of the right-wing press, young people are attracted to unions, government intervention and old-style democratic socialists like Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. When the LEAP Manifesto, a Canadian precursor of the Green New Deal, came out in 2015, its call for moving immediately to a zero carbon-emission economy was dismissed as utopian. It now seems prescient. Where is Singh in all of this? In his successful 2017 bid for the party leadership, he produced policy papers on standard issues, such as the old age pension. But when speaking, he preferred to focus on broad rhetorical themes like love and courage. During the Burnaby South byelection campaign, he talked of the need for affordable housing, an important issue in Greater Vancouver. Speaking on CBC the day after his victory, he spoke of a policy trifecta: affordable housing, fighting climate change and universal pharmacare. Perhaps this is where the NDP is going in the upcoming election campaign. If so, it will have to square some circles. In particular, it will need to show how it would reinvent Alberta’s entire carbon-based economy in a zero-emission world. It will also, however, have to be bold. The NDP can only get so far by calling Trudeau’s Liberals untrustworthy. It will have to sketch out a compelling but plausible vision of its own. That is the reaffirmed leader’s main task.

Singh may well be looking to turn the page on the past year and a half. Since he was elected in October 2017, his leadership has been marked by poor polling, lacklustre fundraising and a steady trickle of caucus members making their way toward the exit.

But with Monday’s victory, analysts say, Singh has a fresh chance to make a new impression on Canadians, albeit a little later in the game than he’d probably like. “The chatter is over,” B.C. MP Nathan Cullen told reporters in Ottawa on Tuesday. “Mr. Singh’s ability to lead this caucus into the next election is 100 per cent secured.”

Still, his problems aren’t all behind him: a few of his heavyweight MPs, including Cullen, have yet to say if they’ll run again in the next election, and he faces a major obstacle in Quebec, where the NDP lost Outremont, the riding held by former leader Thomas Mulcair since 2007, to the Liberals in another byelection on Monday.

But the timing for a fresh start isn’t bad, said former NDP strategist Farouk Karim. Singh will take his place in the House of Commons while the Liberals are mired in the SNC-Lavalin controversy, and as they table their last budget before this year’s election.

“It’s not often in life that you would have a second chance to make that impression,” Karim said. “And he has that opportunity.”

In his victory speech, Singh worked hard to paint Liberals and Conservatives as interested only in helping their “well-connected corporate friends,” while leaving ordinary Canadians in the lurch. “People should be angry at that, angry at governments in Ottawa that continue to develop a system that puts more and more wealth into fewer and fewer hands,” he said, pointing to three issues — affordable housing, pharmacare and climate change — that will likely be pillars of the NDP’s election campaign.

Robin MacLachlan, a former NDP strategist, said there’s an opening for Singh while Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is “reeling” from the SNC-Lavalin controversy, which he said has damaged Trudeau’s image “as being on the side of ordinary Canadians.”

“He has an opportunity to position himself as the leader who kind of gets what you’re facing,” he said.

With a seat in the House of Commons, Singh will finally have the chance to face off against Trudeau directly, though with little time remaining before the next election. “I would lower expectations. He’s not going to be 100 per cent from the get-go,” said Karim. “But I think if people see an improvement throughout, that will go a long way.”

Cullen said Singh took a risk in deciding to run for a seat in the Burnaby byelection, and it paid off. “I think Canadians are going to look at us in a new way, and I think Mr. Singh’s confidence is going to be boosted,” he said. “I’m looking forward to how he does.”

Arguably the biggest hurdle Singh now faces is Quebec, where the NDP has recently been polling as low as a dismal eight per cent, and nearly all of the party’s seats seem to be under threat. In a separate byelection on Monday, Liberal candidate Rachel Bendayan won the Montreal riding of Outremont, which had been a Liberal stronghold until it was taken by Mulcair in 2007 and became a symbol of the party’s gains in that province.

After Bendayan’s victory, Liberals were quick to declare the death of the Orange Wave that swept through Quebec in 2011 and helped propel the NDP to Official Opposition status for the first time. “It’s finished,” Infrastructure Minister François-Philippe Champagne told reporters in Ottawa on Tuesday. “Just look at the results.”

But Singh played down the loss on Monday, saying the party “always knew that Outremont was going to be a tough riding.”

Karim said he was actually “pleasantly surprised” by the Outremont results, which saw NDP candidate Julia Sánchez finish second with 26 per cent of the vote — disappointing, but not catastrophic, according to Karim.

“I think it’s a little hope that the party can build on,” he said. “Twenty-six per cent is far from over, that’s what I would say to the Liberals.”

Singh, clearly recognizing the importance of building his profile in Quebec, said on Monday that he plans to travel to the province next week. Currently, more than a third of the NDP caucus is from Quebec, but several Quebec MPs have said they won’t run again, including Marjolaine Boutin-Sweet and Anne Minh-Thu Quach, who both made their announcements last week.

MacLachlan said the NDP could attract Quebec voters concerned about climate change, and upset about the Trudeau government’s decision to purchase the Trans Mountain pipeline. Karim said the strong third-place showing of the Green Party in Outremont, which finished with 12.5 per cent of the vote, proves that Quebecers “want answers” on the environment.

Outside Quebec, two other high-profile NDP MPs — B.C.’s Cullen and Murray Rankin — have yet to announce whether they’ll run again in this year’s election. So far, 11 of the 44 NDP MPs elected in 2015 have either resigned their seats or have said they won’t seek re-election.

But MacLachlan said Singh’s win should help “consolidate support” for the leader within and outside his caucus. Now, he said, Singh needs to focus on building his profile from inside the House of Commons.

“He needs to reintroduce himself to Canadians,” MacLachlan said. “He’s been absent from the national conversation about policy, and now they’re going to hear from him.”

Just as they were celebrating Jagmeet Singh’s impending entry into the House of Commons after a long 16 months of wandering the land, seatless, Statistics Canada dropped this little gem: It put out new figures showing the Canada Child Benefit introduced by the Trudeau Liberals in mid-2016 is lowering poverty in a significant way. Fully 278,000 fewer children were living below the poverty line in 2017 compared to just two years earlier. That’s big.

What’s the connection? Just this. Once Singh takes his seat in the Commons as NDP leader, following his convincing byelection victory on Monday night, he’ll have to persuade voters on the broad left of the political spectrum to turn away from the Liberals and go with his party. Early signs are that he’ll take the standard NDP approach, arguing the Liberals are in bed with big business and the rich while only the New Democrats are “on your side.” But good luck with that when the facts show the Liberals’ signature social policy is working to lift tens of thousands out of poverty. The national poverty rate dropped more than a full percentage point in a single year, according to StatsCan. New Democrats would be proud to boast such a record, and rightly so.

Article Continued Below

It comes down to how Singh intends to position his party for this fall’s election, now that he’s secured a seat in Parliament. He has to put the stumbles and misstatements that have undermined his leadership behind him and develop a coherent critique of the Liberals. So far the NDP line is that Trudeau & Co. are tools of their corporate cronies, as demonstrated by the 50 meetings secured by SNC-Lavalin and its lobbyists with government officials to avoid a damaging trial on corruption charges. This, says Singh, amounts to “spending time trying to find a way to help his friends avoid the consequences of breaking the law.” If anything, this line of argument suggests the NDP has written off its chances in Quebec, where the survival of SNC-Lavalin and the thousands of jobs associated with it is seen, to put it mildly, as involving a lot more than propping up the undeserving rich. It’s something to see the self-styled party of working people so cavalierly dismiss the importance of protecting the livelihood of thousands of Quebec families. There are other promising issues for New Democrats. Take affordable housing, a pressing concern in Singh’s riding of Burnaby South and other places where property prices have soared out of reach. There, too, the Liberals will compete fiercely. They took steps to cool the hottest housing markets two years ago, and in his pre-election budget Finance Minister Bill Morneau is expected to address the difficulties first-time buyers have in getting into the market.

Voters will be looking for forward-looking solutions. But on Wednesday Singh had this to say to CBC News: “Let’s build houses the way we did in the 1970s or the late ’40s.” It’s clear what he meant: government should invest more in social housing of various kinds. But could there be a more backward-sounding statement, harking back to the approach of four or even seven decades ago? The bottom line is that winning a seat in the Commons is just prologue for Singh and his party. The lights will be all the brighter once he takes his place in Parliament and is expected to put forward a smart, persuasive critique of the government every day. Most important, the NDP has to figure out where its own heart lies and express that in a way that will give voters a distinct choice in October. With the Liberals occupying the centre-left, it’s not obvious how to do that. And the election countdown clock is already ticking loudly.

Rankin said in an interview on Thursday his decision was very difficult, and serving as an MP has been the “most rewarding experience” of his life.

“I’ve got to know so many people in our community,” he said. “I’ve got to know so many great colleagues here in Ottawa in the caucus. One of the great benefits of being an MP is in order to do your job and represent people, you have to know people from all walks of life and I’ve really enjoyed that.”

The 69-year-old also said his choice is about moving to a new chapter in his life and has nothing to do with the NDP’s prospects or Jagmeet Singh’s leadership.

The party has been lagging in popular support and fundraising.

He suggested the New Democrats’ fortunes are “definitely going up,” adding that Singh won his Burnaby South byelection by “significant margins” over both the Liberal and Conservative candidates.

“It looks to me to be a turning point,” he said. “We will have a leader in the House … I think people will be able to see a distinct contrast between us and the Conservatives and Liberals.”

Rankin joins a growing list of NDP MPs who have announced they are not going to be running again in October’s election.

The list includes Alberta MP Linda Duncan, Ontario MPs Irene Mathyssen and David Christopherson, Quebec’s Helene Laverdiere, Romeo Saganash, Marjolaine Boutin-Sweet and Anne Minh-Thu Quach and B.C.’s Fin Donnelly.

Former MPs Kennedy Stewart and Sheila Malcolmson also left their jobs. Stewart is now Vancouver’s mayor and Malcolmson is a provincial politician in B.C.

Former Quebec MP and leader Tom Mulcair also quit politics to work as a visiting professor at Universite de Montreal.

Rankin said Thursday he takes pride in work he’s done on issues including fighting for tax fairness and medical assistance in dying and working to ensure Canadians serving jury duty can access psychological supports.

“I hope I’ve made a difference,” Rankin said.

He said his work with the House of Commons justice committee has also been important, suggesting the “constitutional crisis” involving former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould will be an issue discussed for many months.

Rankin stressed he will not be working any less until the end of his mandate as MP.

B.C. MP Murray Rankin, the party’s justice critic and one of its senior caucus members, announced Thursday that he won’t seek re-election this year. His decision brings to 12 the number of NDP MPs elected in 2015 who aren’t running again — more than a quarter of the caucus.

“After about seven years, I think it’s time for a fresh voice,” he told the National Post in an interview. “It’s been the most exciting and rewarding thing I’ve ever done, working as an MP … But in terms of my life, I think it’s time to let someone else take the reins and I think this is a good time to do it.”

Rankin said he “absolutely” supports Singh’s leadership, and said he hopes the party is on an “upward incline” since Singh won the Burnaby South byelection on Monday with 39 per cent of the vote.

“We had, I think, a very significant turnaround in the NDP fortunes when the leader won so convincingly in Burnaby South,” he said. “I think a lot of Canadians are now going to say we have a leader … who connects well with voters. We just have to get him into the House and get him better known by Canadians.”

After about seven years, I think it’s time for a fresh voice

Rankin, a lawyer who previously worked as a treaty negotiator for the province of B.C., was elected as the MP for Victoria in a 2012 byelection. He is the party’s justice critic and co-chair of the House of Commons justice committee, which is currently investigating allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to negotiate a deal with engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

Rankin suggested the SNC-Lavalin controversy presents an opportunity for the NDP. “We have a situation unfolding in Ottawa that is going to give a lot of Canadians pause about the nature of the Liberal government, the government they thought was going to be a very different government,” he said.

In 2017, Rankin was also named to the national security committee of parliamentarians, tasked with overseeing Canada’s security and intelligence agencies.

Rankin joins a growing list of NDP MPs who have decided not to seek another term. Of the 44 MPs elected in 2015, 12 have now announced they won’t run again, including Quebec MPs Hélène Laverdière and Romeo Saganash, and Alberta’s lone NDP MP, Linda Duncan. A few more caucus members have yet to make their decisions public, including senior B.C. MP Nathan Cullen.

Singh has faced major hurdles since he won the party leadership in October 2017, including poor fundraising numbers and disappointing byelection results. Initially claiming he was comfortable without a seat in the House of Commons, he eventually changed his mind and decided to run in Burnaby. But his victory there was tempered by the loss of the Montreal riding of Outremont in a separate byelection on the same day, a seat held by former leader Thomas Mulcair since 2007.

Rankin said it can be a “hard slog” for opposition MPs trying to make an impact in Ottawa. “The lot of an opposition politician isn’t always a happy one,” he said. “We do make differences … but sometimes being in an opposition role is not always gratifying.”

Rankin was recently appointed by the B.C. government as its representative to help guide talks in a new reconciliation process with the hereditary chiefs of the Wet’suwet’en nation, whose opposition to a proposed natural gas pipeline through their traditional territory led to a showdown with the RCMP in January. He has accepted the position without pay.

“I simply want to do other things after this amount of time,” he said. “I think a lot of people would realize that going back and forth to Ottawa regularly, nine hours door-to-door, isn’t the most joyful experience, and maybe I can do other things at this stage of my career.”

“We need transformational change in health care in Ontario,” Health Minister Christine Elliott said.

Elliott pointed to the thousands of people waiting for long-term care every day or the 1,200 people who receive care in hospital hallways.

“What we are doing is centring care around the patient, that is the most important consideration,” Elliott told reporters after question period at Queen’s Park.

“We have to do better and we will do better.”

The plan will apparently scrap the Local Health Integration Networks that increased bureaucracy across the system but did not deliver the health-care coordination promised.

In place of the LHINs will be a centralized “Super Agency” to coordinate care.

Meanwhile, NDP Leader Andrea Horwath was blasting the government’s plans before they were announced.

But the NDP said the that Ford government is taking the province in a worse direction.

“We are waiting to see the legislation, but I’ll tell you this,” Horwath added. “It better have closed the loopholes that allows the province to belly up to our health-care dollars and it better close the loophole to this super agency.”

The push is coming from public-health advocates and from at least one Liberal MP, Toronto's Nathaniel Erksine-Smith.

""One of my constituents lost her nephew to the opioid crisis because of fentanyl and the lack of a safe supply,"" he said. ""If we want to save lives, we know that thousands of Canadians are dying because of an unsafe supply. If we want to save lives, we need to make that supply safe.""

Public-health experts are also advocating for removing of criminal sanctions for possession of small quantities of opioids to help to reduce stigma in seeking treatment, Erksine-Smith added.

British Columbia's provincial health officer has called for Ottawa to look at ways of supplying safer opioid drugs, saying B.C. and other parts of the country are grappling with a poisonous street-drug supply that is killing people because they can't tell what's in the drugs they use.

Richard Elliott, the executive director of the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network, said it is necessary to address the toxicity of the drug supply to ultimately reduce the number of deaths.

His organization was part of a Canadian coalition that called on the government last fall to address the issue of supply, pointing to toxicology results from across Canada that reveal opioids purchased in the illegal market are often contaminated with fentanyl and its analogues. Those can be much more potent than the opioids users believe they are consuming, and the difference between an ordinary dose and a lethal one is tiny.

""When you are in an emergency and the stuff you can get illegally is largely contaminated and may kill you even if you are seeking to be safe, as most people are, then we need to figure out, 'OK, how do we substitute something safer for you to use instead of what you're currently purchasing on the street and that is killing too many people,' "" Elliott said in an interview this week.

The opioid crisis is affecting every community in every province and territory, said NDP health critic Don Davies, adding that Canadians understand that people are losing their lives as a result of ""poison street supply.""

""Nobody is advocating drug use,"" he said. ""But as a public-policy response, they recognize that at least if we can control the supply, we can keep people alive and that's a better public-policy approach than letting them die in the streets or alone in their homes.""

Davies said he shares the concern of advocates who recently expressed concern that the federal Liberals won't want to address the issue in an election year.

Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor said she asked her department to explore options to address the toxic supply in the fall, adding she looks forward to seeing advice from Canada's top public-health doctor Theresa Tam on how to move forward.

""When we've consulted with many stakeholders, professionals and also individuals that use drugs, they've indicated the issue of safe supply is something we should really be looking at,"" Petitpas Taylor said. ""That's exactly what we are doing.""

In a December interview, Tam told The Canadian Press that said clamping down on the market-driven supply of illicit drugs is not easy.

""I think my plea is an escalated, compassionate response,"" she said. ""To implement a lot of these measures, you need society to be on side.""

Tam's comments came after the Public Health Agency show that 94 per cent of opioid-related deaths in 2019 were classified as ""accidental poisonings.""

Nearly 72 per cent were unintentional deaths involving highly toxic fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances.

Elizabeth May says the NDP government’s “Keep Canada Working” campaign centered around the controversial pipeline project is misleading.

“Canadians deserve to know the facts about the cost of the Kinder Morgan pipeline,” May said.

“The Notley government’s ‘Keep Canada Working’ ads exaggerate the economic benefits and hide the many risks. This pipeline is a liability any way you look at it.”

May said the Trans Mountain pipeline will create 90 permanent jobs, not thousands of jobs as indicated by the Alberta government.

“The delay to the Kinder Morgan pipeline costs the country of Canada about $40 million a day and there are tens of thousands of jobs at stake,” Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said last April.

Alberta’s NDP government said the expansion will help sustain good paying jobs for thousands of Canadians.

“The Conference Board of Canada has estimated that the project would result in 37,000 jobs across Canada,” a government statement to Global News read.

“Fifteen-thousand new jobs will be created during project construction. Thirteen-hundred annual full-time marine sector jobs will be created during operation.”

Trans Mountain said there were 2,000 people working on the pipeline before the Federal Court of Appeal struck down the project’s original approval last summer, citing issues over the impact on marine life and Indigenous consultation.

The company said it expected the project would employ 5,000 workers by the middle of the year had it not been postponed.

The Green Party leader also suggested the safest way to transport bitumen is as a solid by rail rather than by pipeline.

“The only way to transport bitumen, which is a solid, through a pipeline is mixing it with a toxic diluent,” the party’s statement read. “When that mixture spills it’s impossible to clean up.”

“I am often asked: ‘Doesn’t Canada have truth in advertising laws?’ We do, but the Canadian Code of Advertising Standards doesn’t apply to government paid advertising for political issues,” May said. “The Alberta ad campaign demonstrates that it should.”

On Feb. 19, Notley announced the province was spending $3.7 billion to move landlocked oil to market by rail.

The province said transporting oil by rail cars is more expensive, less efficient and less environmentally-friendly than by pipeline.

“We could be getting so much more out of our products then we do, but instead, we are forced to curtail production and lease rail cars to move our product,” a government statement read.

Last week, the National Energy Board conditionally approved the Trans Mountain expansion and made 16 new recommendations to the Governor in Council.

The NEB said the project could cause environmental harm but that the benefits of the pipeline outweigh the effects.

“We’re pleased that we got a recommendation to the federal cabinet and that we can hopefully see them move forward in a timely way,” Notley said.

Notley said she is not expecting the federal cabinet to approve the pipeline before the next provincial election, which by law has to happen before the end of May.

The Trans Mountain expansion would triple the amount of oil flowing from Alberta to the B.C. coast for export to overseas markets.

In January, the province told Global News $23.4 million had been spent on the Keep Canada Working campaign out the total budget of $31 campaign committed to the campaign.

The money is going towards television, radio, print, online and billboard ads that tout the Trans Mountain Pipeline as a project that would boost Canada’s economy and create jobs.

The Alberta government said the campaign is having an impact.

“Before the campaign started roughly four in 10 Canadians agreed that we need new pipelines. Now that number is almost seven in 10,” the province’s statement read.

Shawn Jeffords and Allison Jones, The Canadian Press





TORONTO -- Ontario is consolidating its local and provincial health networks to create a central agency as part of a system overhaul, the health minister announced Tuesday, though she wouldn't say if the move will save money or lead to job losses.

Legislation introduced Tuesday would create a new agency, called Ontario Health, to consolidate the 14 local health integration networks, Cancer Care Ontario, eHealth Ontario and several other agencies. The system transformation, including establishing local health teams to co-ordinate care, will take years, Health Minister Christine Elliott said.

""Too much time and attention is spent on maintaining a siloed and fragmented system, and far too many people believe it is the patient's or the family's job to navigate this complicated system during what is already one of the most traumatic and stress-filled periods in their lives,"" Elliott said. ""That is just wrong.""

Background materials from the government say that each of the agencies being rolled into Ontario Health has a full senior management team and administrative support, ""and over time some of this work has become duplicative.""

The ""duplicative"" work refers to some of the administrative functions, Elliott stressed, but she said those services will be required in the new local health teams, too.

""I think we have to look at this as a rearrangement, but rearranged around the patient,"" she said. ""This is not a financial exercise.""

When asked how many staff would lose their jobs as a result of the reorganization, the minister said that is something she can't answer right now.

""We promised that we would put more people on the front line in health-care services, and that's what we intend to do so that there are people who are working in the LHINs, for example, right now who provide wonderful home care,"" Elliott said. ""We will still need them. Nothing's going to change that way. People will still need home care. We want to make sure that we can amplify those home care numbers. So, in the end, it will work out.""

Elliott didn't say if the government expects to save money through the agency consolidation, but noted Ontario spends 42 cents of every dollar on health care, and studies show the province isn't getting good value for it.

The other agencies being rolled into Ontario Health are Health Quality Ontario, Trillium Gift of Life Network, Health Shared Services Ontario, and HealthForce Ontario Marketing and Recruitment Agency.

As well, Ontario Health Teams will be established to provide what Elliott called seamless access to health services, including primary care, hospitals, home and community care, palliative care, residential long-term care, and mental health and addictions services.

The teams would be responsible for delivering all of the care for their patients and connecting them to services. Elliott said the goal is to have 30 to 50 health teams set up, each responsible for up to 300,000 people. It won't change how patients go to the doctor, Elliott said.

A group of providers will come together -- for example a hospital, a local nurse practitioner clinic and a mental health team -- and will be responsible fiscally and for the delivery of care to everyone within the geographic area, Elliott said. The health teams will be given a lot of flexibility in how they operate to allow for local variation, officials said.

People will still be able to choose who provides their care, and more choices will be available through technology, Elliot said, such as giving patients an option to securely access their electronic health records and virtual care options.

""Imagine, we can book appointments online,"" Elliott said. ""We have access to our own health-care record.""

NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said she fears the changes will open the door to greater privatization of services.

""This morning's press conference did not allay our concerns about opening up our public health care system to private, for profit, motivated corporations,"" she said.

The Ontario Health Coalition said it would fight any attempt to privatize the public non-profit health services, while the Canadian Union of Public Employees said it will begin escalating actions across the province to push the government to reconsider the changes.

""This dangerous Ford government reboot of our public health system must be stopped before patient care and safety fall victim to the gaps, holes and pitfalls this massive overhaul will create,"" said CUPE Ontario President Fred Hahn.

But the changes had some supporters in the health care sector, including the associations representing the province's doctors, registered nurses and hospitals.

Dr. Nadia Alam, president of the Ontario Medical Association, welcomed the proposed changes, saying patients are currently struggling to get the care that they need.

""If we can do anything to make that easier it's a good day,"" she said.

Anthony Dale, the CEO of the Ontario Hospital Association, said a broader view of the health-care system will help address overcrowding and help break down barriers that exist between care providers in the health-care system.

""One in six hospital beds are occupied by someone who needs to be in long-term care or at home or assisted living,"" he said. ""It's a system wildly out of balance.""

The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario said they're optimistic that the government plan will divert money from middle management in the health bureaucracy to front line care.

""I think some of those organizations, quite frankly, have ballooned in terms of staffing,"" said CEO Doris Grinspun. ""I think what they need is a very clear mandate.""","Province unveils new 'Ontario Health' super agency, co-ordinated health teams - CTV News",Ctvnews.ca,https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/province-unveils-new-ontario-health-super-agency-co-ordinated-health-teams-1.4312887

Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press

Shortly after becoming Premier, Doug Ford demanded changes to his Ontario Provincial Police security detail because he didn’t trust the rotating cast of officers, according to newly disclosed court records.

Internal police e-mails filed in Ontario Divisional Court also show that the Premier’s office was interested in retrofitting a van for his travels, relaying a $50,000 cost estimate to the OPP.

Ontario Provincial Police Deputy Commissioner Brad Blair submitted the internal e-mails to bolster his claim that Mr. Ford and his office have interfered in police operations. The senior officer is asking the courts to order the province’s Ombudsman to review the hiring of Mr. Ford’s friend, Toronto Police Superintendent Ron Taverner, as the next OPP Commissioner.

Story continues below advertisement

Deputy Commissioner Blair, who was also a front-runner for the position, went public with his concerns in December, alleging that “inappropriate political interference or cronyism” could impact OPP operations. In his filings and correspondence, he alleged the Premier’s office directed a sole-sourced “off-the-books” request for the OPP to refit an executive van for the Premier’s use. He further alleged the Premier relayed to police that he wanted a meeting with then-OPP Commissioner Vince Hawkes to ask him to replace a rotating security detail for Mr. Ford with permanent bodyguards, and if not, ""perhaps a new Commissioner would.”

Deputy Commissioner’s Blair’s most recent court filings, made on Feb. 15, include internal e-mails about Mr. Ford’s concerns and an estimate for the van overhaul. The Premier’s office says, however, he should not be accessing those records and making them public.

“It is extremely troubling that Mr. Blair is apparently using his office to obtain confidential information and documentation and then filing such documents in a public court record to further his own personal agenda in the court process he himself initiated,” said Simon Jefferies, a spokesman for the Premier.

In an e-mail to The Globe, the spokesman added that the allegations about off-the-books purchase requests by the Premier’s office “are a complete fabrication by Mr. Blair and are categorically false.”

NDP MPP Taras Natyshak released a statement saying the van proposal is “wildly inappropriate"" when the government is implementing budget cuts elsewhere. ""It’s the gravy train for Ford, and cuts for everyone else.”

The OPP e-mails filed in court show that in mid-July, just a few weeks after the Progressive Conservative government had taken power, Mr. Ford expressed concern about his shifting cast of police-assigned bodyguards. In an e-mail to his supervisor, an officer assigned to Mr. Ford relayed the Premier’s displeasure as he prepared to travel to a first ministers meeting.

“[W]hat ... is going on? I’m going to Moncton with 3 officers I don’t know. This is too much. ... I keep getting new people in the truck. I just want my own protection team,” Sergeant Terrance Murphy wrote what Mr. Ford told him after he picked him up to go to the airport. He reported the Premier saying he had no faith in newly assigned bodyguards.

“I have not formed the trust with them. I have asked for my own detail of officers who I trust already. It feels like I’m not being heard, like I’m getting f***ed around by the OPP, and I’m getting more pissed off,” the e-mail reads.

“I’m going to call the Commissioner and sort this out,” the Premier then said, according to the e-mail.

In the July e-mail exchange, the police officer quotes Mr. Ford as saying he wanted to meet the then-OPP Commissioner “so he can see how serious I am about this. If he can’t sort this out, then maybe a new Commissioner can make it happen.”

The Premier’s office defended Mr. Ford’s request and again took issue with the release of internal e-mails related to security.

“These types of requests are made by politicians of all stripes, at both the federal and provincial levels of government,” said Mr. Jefferies. “Internal police reports are by definition, in our opinion, highly confidential documents.”

The Globe and Mail reported this week a senior government official warned Deputy Commissioner Blair in December about publicly disclosing any more sensitive OPP materials as part of his court bid.

The OPP e-mail exchanges filed in court further reveal that on Nov. 21, when the hunt for a new commissioner was concluding, the OPP received an e-mailed cost estimate of $50,696 for the interior redesign of an executive van for the Premier’s potential use.

A Mississauga company called A1 Mobility had provided this estimate – which involved installing WiFi, leather seats, a mini-fridge, a couch and a TV – to an executive assistant in the Premier’s office, who in turn relayed it to the police force.

Deputy Commissioner Blair has alleged in court documents that this cost estimate was relayed in a potential contravention of police procurement policies. The Premier’s office says these assertions are “categorically false.”

“As has been repeatedly stated by the Premier, he requested the OPP look into the possibility of obtaining a cost-effective used van for purposes of working and travelling the province,” said Mr. Jefferies. “The e-mails sent to the OPP from a member of the Premier’s Office staff are not an official procurement of a van, instead they are a cost estimate and reveal an effort to minimize expense.”

Mr. Jefferies said the retrofit has not happened. OPP Staff Sergeant Carolle Dionne said the police force would not comment about matters that are being litigated, including what happened to van-retrofit request that was received by the OPP.","Doug Ford demanded changes to his OPP security detail, according to court filings - The Globe and Mail",The Globe And Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-doug-ford-demanded-changes-to-his-opp-security-detail-according-to/

Ford banned the media after the Star revealed lobbyists had been enlisted to sell tickets to Wednesday’s event, which attracted 3,200 people who paid $1,250 each to attend the posh dinner.

Government House Leader Todd Smith dismissed opposition criticism of a decision by the Progressive Conservatives to ban media from a fundraising dinner Wednesday night. “It was open to everyone who wanted to buy a ticket, and then it was open to everyone via livestream,” he said. ( Chris Young / THE CANADIAN PRESS FILE PHOTO )

Journalists are typically allowed to cover premiers’ major fundraisers, but leave immediately after the speech and before the meal is served. Stung by the fallout after it emerged government lobbyists had been conscripted to hawk tickets, Ford closed the Toronto Congress Centre event to reporters, who were only able to cover his remarks using a Tory-supplied livestream. Opposition parties say the premier was clearly trying to conceal who was there.

“When you’re banning the media, it’s obvious that you have something to hide,” NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said Thursday. Interim Liberal Leader John Fraser told reporters that Ford “didn’t want you to see who was there last night.” “That was what this was about. I can remember our big fundraising dinners, (the media were) always invited for the speech,” said Fraser. “It’s an event with 3,200 people — it’s a big speech ... so why would you not be there? He probably didn’t want you to talk to who was there,” he said. Green Leader Mike Schreiner said by preventing the media from covering the event in person, Ford, whose campaign slogan is “for the people,” was doing the public a disservice.

“I just want to know what the premier is trying to hide. Did he not want the media to know which corporate lobbyist sold the most tickets? Which deep-pocketed insiders have the most access to the premier?” said Schreiner. While Ford was not in the legislature on Thursday, he sent a thank-you email to supporters.

“Last night was incredible. Nobody has ever raised as much money as we did last night. Nobody has ever hit the number of donors we did,” the premier wrote. “There can be no doubt we’re going to get this job done. From the bottom of my heart ... thank you,” he concluded, signing his missive “Doug.” Under fire from the New Democrats in the legislature, government house leader Todd Smith defended Ford’s move to close the dinner to the media. “It was an excellent night last night. It was open to everyone who wanted to buy a ticket, and then it was open to everyone via livestream last night,” said Smith, suggesting NDP MPP Taras Natyshak was jealous of the Tories. “When it comes to fundraising, our party is doing exceptionally well. I can understand why he’s turning red in the face or green with envy. It’s because they’re not raising anything. You know why? People aren’t buying what they’re selling. They’re buying what we’re selling,” he said. Natyshak (Essex) said Ontarians should be alarmed by the “disturbing edicts” from Ford. “Media reports in the Toronto Star today indicate that some unusual edicts have been coming out of the premier’s office. Desperate to sell tickets, the premier’s office allegedly ordered lobbyists to sell tickets to clients under threat of losing access to this government,” he said. “Late yesterday, the order banning journalists from the evening’s festivities also came out of the premier’s office.” Robert Benzie is the Star's Queen's Park bureau chief and a reporter covering Ontario politics.

Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale tweeted Wednesday that he intends to give notice to introduce ""a bill to provide no-cost, expedited pardons for simple possession of cannabis,"" following up on promise made in October.

According to parliamentary procedure, a member must give 48 hours written notice before introducing legislation in the House of Commons.

A spokesperson for the minister said that means that bill could be tabled as early as Friday.

Later today, I will give notice to introduce a bill to provide no-cost, expedited pardons for simple possession of cannabis. —@RalphGoodale

The Liberal government first signalled its plans to waive the fee and waiting period for Canadians seeking a pardon for a past conviction for simple pot possession the day recreational marijuana was legalized last year.

As it stands, the fee for normal record suspensions is $631. The waiting period to apply is usually five years for a summary offence and 10 years for an indictable offence.

According to a 2014 study, more than 500,000 Canadians have a criminal record for having pot on their person.

Goodale has previously said the bill would ""shed the burden and stigma"" and break down barriers to jobs, education, housing or volunteer work.

However, the bill has already received criticism from the NDP.

A record suspension does not erase the fact that a person was convicted of a crime, but keeps the record separate from other criminal records.

The NDP has been calling for the expungement of criminal records, which would erase the criminal conviction entirely.",Pot pardon legislation coming soon: Goodale,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/pot-legislation-coming-goodale-1.5036113

“I prefer to drive around and talk to the people about things that matter — about creating jobs, lowering taxes, making sure we’re lowering the heating costs, lowering gas prices,” he added, claiming “we don’t have enough people for all the jobs we’ve created.” The two King Airs are used to fly premiers, the lieutenant governor and cabinet ministers is an eight-seat, twin-engine turboprop with barely five feet of room for passengers to stand. They are operated by the natural resources ministry, which also uses them to shuttle forestry workers. Natyshak accused Ford of “a lack of respect for taxpayers” in seeking $50,000 in customization on a passenger van, as revealed in court documents this week from a court case fighting the controversial appointment of Ford friend Ron Taverner as commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police. It is on hold pending an ethics investigation into any political influence in the hiring.

“I requested a used van that is about one-third the cost of the regular Suburban,” Ford replied, referring to the model of Chevrolet SUV typically used by the police force to transport premiers. Government House Leader Todd Smith later told reporters Ford was “simply inquiring” about getting a customized van and noted “there is no van.”

“He obviously didn’t like what it was going to cost or he decided not to do it now.” Natyshak also pressed Ford on his complaints about his rotating OPP security detail, in which the premier reportedly stated just weeks after being elected: “I’ve asked for my own detail of officers that I trust already” and expressing concerns that “I’m getting f-ed around by the OPP and I’m getting more p--ed off.” The premier brushed aside the New Democrat’s accusations he “demanded special treatment” from the police force whose officers drive Ford to and from home and events and provide security for him. “I’m speaking for my detail. They’re disgusted right now…if they could run in here right now, each and every one of them would be standing shoulder to shoulder with me. I think they’re incredible.” Ford’s office has said the premier simply asked for bodyguards with whom he was comfortable and that such a request is “hardly unusual.” The details about the van request and the security detail complaints were in court filings from Deputy OPP Commissioner Brad Blair, who was passed over for the top job given to Taverner, 72, a veteran Toronto police superintendent. Blair lawyer Julian Falconer has launched a civil case to force Ontario’s ombudsman to probe the Taverner appointment, which is already the subject of an investigation by provincial integrity commissioner J. David Wake. He has recently interviewed Ford’s chief of staff Dean French for more than two hours about his role in the hiring, Progressive Conservative sources have told the Star. An email filed in Blair’s court case suggests French was involved in the search for a new OPP commissioner — in particular, on a hiring panel conducting a second interview with Blair.

Journalists are usually permitted to cover a premier’s speech, then leave before dinner is served. But the Conservatives have been scrambling to do damage control since it emerged last Thursday that they appealed to lobbyists for help, due to restrictions around fundraising introduced in 2016 by the Liberals. A ban on corporate and union donations — sparked by a Star probe of Liberal fundraising excesses — has made it more challenging to sell tickets. In the past, companies and unions could purchase entire tables for dinners and then distribute the tickets to employees, associates, clients or members. Under the current law, each ticket must be paid for by an individual. In an email appeal to clients obtained by the Star, Chris Benedetti, a principal at Sussex Strategy Group, a firm run by Conservatives and Liberals, said the company “has been asked to help with the event.” “The event is $12,500 for a table of 10 ($1,250/person). To reserve a table, please let us know, and we can assist you in assembling individual registrations to then be sent in as a package,” he wrote. Benedetti, who is registered to lobby for 60 different companies at Queen’s Park, said he was contacted last month by the party — not Ford’s office. “I have not spoken to anyone in the premier’s office about this event, and no one in the office or any other government office has been in touch with me to encourage sales or otherwise,” he said. NDP MPP Taras Natyshak (Essex) said “it’s becoming more and more clear how things work under this Ford government.” “If you’re a lobbyist who can help fill the empty seats at the premier’s fundraising dinner, you get access, and you get results. If you’re a family struggling to pay for treatment with autism — not so much,” said Natyshak. But government house leader Todd Smith said “no lobbyist is going to influence our premier.” “He’s been having $25 spaghetti dinners in communities right across Ontario, meeting with grassroots people in our communities. Listen, I’m not going to talk about the success that this party has had with fundraisers, because we’ve had a lot of success,” said Smith. “The NDP should think about having a fundraiser, because they’re not doing so well.” Robert Benzie is the Star’s Queen’s Park bureau chief and a reporter covering Ontario politics.

452,Empty,2019-02-26T02:24:19Z,"In a reference case starting March 18, the NDP government is asking the B.C. Court of Appeal whether the province has jurisdiction to regulate the shipment of heavy oil through B.C. by pipeline or rail.","VICTORIA — The B.C. New Democrats have lost an embarrassing legal round in the fight with their Alberta counterparts over petroleum and pipelines.

B.C. filed a constitutional challenge to an Alberta law allowing that province to restrict fuel supplies to this province in retaliation for opposition to twinning the Trans Mountain pipeline.

But the challenge was tossed out in a Calgary courtroom because the legislation, though passed by the Alberta legislature, had never been proclaimed into force by their provincial cabinet.

“I am of the view that a claim seeking a declaration as to the constitutionality of an act that has not yet been proclaimed is premature,” wrote Justice R. J. Hall in a decision released Friday. “The claim of the Attorney-General of B.C. is premature, because the act is not in force in Alberta. The statement of claim is hereby struck.”

His five-page written judgment cited ample precedents for the courts not involving themselves in hypotheticals, like ruling on the constitutionality of legislation not in force.

One might have expected B.C. Attorney-General David Eby to have familiarized himself with those precedents before mounting an expensive court challenge. A simple check of Alberta cabinet orders would have established whether the offending legislation was actually in force.

But when pressed during Question Period in the legislature Monday an unapologetic Eby insisted that the reversal was no big deal.

“The entire claim was not struck out,” he insisted, taking refuge in the court having said that it was merely premature.

“We thought we had a principled argument to make when Alberta brought forward legislation that they were going to turn off oil-and-gas supplies to British Columbia,” he told Opposition Leader Andrew Wilkinson.

LISTEN: This week on the In The House podcast, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw discuss the 2019 provincial budget. Did the B.C. NDP present a prudent plan or did government miss a key opportunity to fulfill its agenda?

In an affidavit filed in court, the New Democrats conceded B.C. is dependent on Alberta refineries for 55 per cent of its gasoline and 71 per cent of its diesel, most of it shipped via the Trans Mountain pipeline.

“The affidavit goes on to say that British Columbia cannot replace that supply from viable sources,” as Hall noted in passing. “It says that reductions in supply from Alberta will cause shortages in British Columbia and that the result could be increased prices, lack of supply and civil unrest in British Columbia.

“The affidavit makes interesting reading as to B.C.’s supply of gasoline and diesel fuel, and its dependence upon Alberta,” continued the judge, confirming B.C. fears were anything but groundless.

Back to Eby: “We thought we had good reason to go to the court as early as we could to raise this issue and say that that would have devastating consequences, certainly, for British Columbia and we believed the action was illegal.”

Outside the house, Eby was more pithy. “Why do we have to wait to get punched in the face, before we complain about being punched in the face?”

Otherwise Eby said the government is studying the Alberta court decision and will decide whether to file an appeal.

The judge suggested a more sensible course of action: “Should the Alberta government proclaim the act in force, the Attorney-General of B.C. may recommence a claim.”

But such advice misses the point of the legal grandstanding by governments opposed to the pipeline expansion. Burnaby spent untold thousands of dollars on court challenges, never mind that there was no precedent for a municipality to overturn a federal government approved project.

The B.C. New Democrats famously vowed to use “every tool in the tool box” in their fight against the pipeline expansion.

Eby initially suggested that B.C. would only be going to court over the threatened fuel restrictions if the Alberta government actually made use of the legislation.

“Clearly the legislation is a bluff,” Eby told the legislature in April 2018 when the Rachel Notley government tabled the bill. “We think they are very unlikely to use this and we think they know it, and it is a bill for political purposes only.”

In the unlikely event that the Notley government did try to use it, Eby continued, “we would be in court immediately seeking an injunction to stop them from using it. But we would probably have to get in line behind oil companies that would be concerned about contracts that they have with companies in B.C. to deliver product.”

But after the Alberta government passed its legislation in May, Eby decided that bluff or no bluff, B.C. was going to court.

“We believe it would be reckless in the extreme and therefore highly unlikely that Alberta will actually attempt to use the powers they granted themselves,” he told reporters, repeating his earlier take on the bill.

Nevertheless he proceeded to hire legal heavyweight Joe Arvay to file the constitutional challenge that has now been rebuffed.

However Eby decides to proceed in that case, the government will be back in court next month on a different aspect of the pipeline fight.

In a reference case starting March 18, the NDP government is asking the B.C. Court of Appeal whether the province has jurisdiction to regulate the shipment of heavy oil through B.C. by pipeline or rail.

Though interprovincial pipelines and railways are federal jurisdiction, B.C. believes it has a legal opening because of provincial responsibility over the environment.

But even if that line of argument fails, the case will have served the NDP’s larger purpose of sparing no legal expense in fighting the pipeline.

Ron Taverner.,"Premier Doug Ford’s chief of staff has been interviewed by the ethics watchdog probing allegations of political interference in the appointment of Toronto police Supt. Ron Taverner as OPP commissioner. Progressive Conservative sources told the Star that integrity commissioner J. David Wake recently questioned Dean French for more than two hours about his role in the Ontario Provincial Police hiring.

The meeting is significant because documents filed with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice suggest French was actively involved in the search for a new commissioner. The government has insisted that Taverner, a 72-year-old Ford friend, was selected by an “independent” hiring committee that had nothing to do with the premier. Asked about the questioning of French, the premier’s office said Tuesday they are co-operating with Wake’s investigation.

While Ford has not yet met with the integrity commissioner, Community Safety Minister Sylvia Jones has. Documents filed by a lawyer for OPP Deputy Commissioner Brad Blair, who was passed over for the force’s top job, show French and then secretary of cabinet Steve Orsini, the head of the public service, and deputy minister Mario Di Tommaso, Taverner’s former boss at Toronto police, did the job interviews.

A Nov. 15 email to Blair from Odgers Berndtson, the executive search firm, confirmed that Ford’s chief of staff was on the interview panel. “This time around you’ll be meeting with Steve Orsini, Dean French and Mario Di Tommaso,” Odgers Berndtson project manager Sue Mahon wrote to the OPP deputy commissioner. That missive is part of a trove of documents filed by lawyer Julian Falconer in his push to have Ontario ombudsman Paul Dubé probe the Taverner appointment. Dubé has said it is beyond his jurisdiction. Wake’s separate inquiry was triggered by a complaint from the opposition New Democrats that the Members’ Integrity Act had been violated. Blair’s lawsuit has also brought to light that Ford’s office sought an OPP van for the premier with more than $50,000 in customized features, including a 32-inch TV, a Blu-ray DVD player, a mini-fridge, mobile Wi-Fi, leather captain’s swivel chairs and a “power reclining sofa bench.” New Democrat MPP Taras Natyshak (Essex) blasted the premier for demanding an “over-$100,000, off-the-books, taxpayer-funded super-van.” “The vehicle the premier asked for sounds like the Taj Mahal on wheels,” Natyshak said of the Ford Transit passenger van, which has a base price of about $42,000. Customization and taxes would have pushed the price to more than $100,000. The community safety minister said Ford merely requested “a used van” to be retrofitted so “he could continue to do his work while he is travelling from community to community.” Jones said it is “a perfectly reasonable use of resources.” Government house leader Todd Smith said Ford “is not a premier who likes to travel by plane across the province.” “His office asked for the option of a used van so he can travel the province in comfort. At the end of the day, nothing has happened on this file yet,” Smith said. NDP Leader Andrea Horwath accused Ford of “jumping on his own gravy train while parents of autistic children beg for financial help with high treatment costs. “The premier has access to a number of OPP vehicles, SUVs, that are quite comfortable,” she said. “These are public dollars and no premier needs to have that kind of a pimped-out ride. Why he thinks the public should be paying for it, that’s something he’s going to have to answer to.” Robert Benzie is the Star’s Queen’s Park bureau chief and a reporter covering Ontario politics.

They also include pay, benefits and other conditions that can add as much as seven per cent to the cost of construction, by the government’s own admission.","VICTORIA — The New Democrats are continuing to drive up the cost of taxpayer-financed construction in the province, with more than $4 billion worth of projects already covered by union-friendly community benefit agreements.

The CBAs require workers on designated projects to join one of 19 NDP-favoured unions within 30 days. They also include pay, benefits and other conditions that can add as much as seven per cent to the cost of construction, by the government’s own admission.

Three recent announcements from the ministry of transportation and infrastructure should give a sense of the size and scope of the NDP’s intentions on the file.

Feb. 11: The transportation ministry issues a tender call for four-laning a two-kilometre stretch of the Trans-Canada Highway 1 east of Revelstoke.

It is budgeted at $63 million, with the province on the hook for three-quarters and Ottawa picking up the balance.

“This is the first of several upgrade projects on the Trans-Canada Highway between Kamloops and Alberta to be built using a community benefits agreement,” says the news release.

“Community benefits will include job and training opportunities for people in the local area and will increase the participation of apprentices and workers traditionally under-represented in the construction trades, such as Indigenous peoples, women and people with disabilities,” it continues, not mentioning either the union-favouring provisions or the added cost.

LISTEN: This week on the In The House podcast, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw discuss the 2019 provincial budget. Did the B.C. NDP present a prudent plan or did government miss a key opportunity to fulfill its agenda?

The project is part of a $464-million commitment by the NDP to four-laning the Trans-Canada through that part of the province over the next three years.

The next specific installment is probably a five-lane replacement for the almost 60-year-old R.W. Bruhn bridge at Sicamous.

The project was in the three-year capital plan in the provincial budget last week, priced at $225 million, with the province scheduled to pay 60 per cent and Ottawa the rest.

The ministry confirms it, too, will entail a community benefit agreement.

Feb. 14: The province announces the three pre-qualified bidding teams for the competition to design and construct a toll-free replacement for the 80-year-old Pattullo Bridge.

The project’s budget of $1.377 billion will be funded entirely by the provincial government, after the New Democrats agreed to take over the Pattullo from TransLink, the regional transportation authority.

“Construction of the new Pattullo bridge will be facilitated by the province’s community benefits agreement,” says the news release, echoing an announcement last July.

One head-turner among the three bidding teams is SNC-Lavalin, the Quebec-based firm embroiled in controversy over efforts to obtain a deferred prosecution on allegations of corruption. If convicted, the company would face a 10-year ban on bidding on contracts in Canada.

SNC-Lavalin will be competing against Kiewit Canada, which built the new Port Mann bridge, and a consortium led by Flatiron Constructors Canada, which is also a partner in building the generating station and spillways at Site C.

Feb. 15: The province issues a request for qualified contractors to design, build and finance the Broadway Subway project, a 5.7-km-long extension of SkyTrain from VCC-Clark to Arbutus St.

The call is on a tight timeframe, closing in April. “The ministry will then select up to three respondent teams to participate in the subsequent phase of the competitive selection process.”

Given that SNC-Lavalin built the earlier phases of SkyTrain, it would hardly be surprising to see it make that list as well, controversy notwithstanding.

The twin-tunneled subway and six stations are together budgeted at $2.83 billion, with B.C. putting up $1.83 billion, Ottawa $900 million, and Vancouver $100 million.

And once again, “the project will be delivered under a community benefits agreement announced by the provincial government.”

So that’s $464 million for widening the Trans-Canada, $1.377 billion for the Pattullo, and $2.830 billion for the SkyTrain expansion — $4.640 billion in total for projects with community benefit agreements.

In announcing the deal to build the Pattullo last summer, the New Democrats acknowledged that the benefit agreements could add as much as seven per cent to the cost of a given project.

On that estimation, news stories had the NDP’s union preference counting for almost $100 million in the budget for replacing the Pattullo.

But the New Democrats have since tried to fudge the numbers, saying the “up to seven per cent” calculation applies only to the cost of construction and not other matters in the budget for a given project.

“Estimated CBA costs are factored only into construction costs and can vary depending on the type of project,” according to a statement this week from the transportation ministry.

“With some projects a significant proportion of the total costs are non-construction costs, related to property acquisition, project management (including engineering, legal, environmental), and interest during construction.”

For instance, although the Broadway subway will be underground, there are major land acquisition costs for the entry points for the six stations.

Nor are the New Democrats prepared to specify what part of a given project budget is represented by construction costs.

“We can’t say right now” was the reply from a government representative this week. “That’s part of what the procurement process is all about.”

Forget about ever getting a precise dollar figure for how much the NDP’s union preference is adding to the cost of taxpayer-financed construction in the province.

But on the strength of what the New Democrats have admitted so far, the tab must run to the tens of millions of dollars.

457,Empty,2019-02-28T20:20:57Z,Attempts to contact 17 Liberal B.C. MPs unsuccessful thus far in the wake of the former justice minister's testimony to a House committee.,"Most B.C. Liberal MPs avoided public comment one day after Vancouver Granville Liberal MP and former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould testified before a House of Commons justice committee that she received “veiled threats” from senior members of the federal government in the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Postmedia sought comment from 17 Liberal members of Parliament in B.C. and the Vancouver Granville Liberal riding association since Wilson-Raybould testified, and received three responses.

On Wednesday in Ottawa, Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she was pressured — by Finance Minister Bill Morneau and his staff, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, senior aides in the Prime Minister’s Office including former principal secretary Gerald Butts and chief of staff Katie Telford, and even Prime Minister Justin Trudeau himself — to direct federal prosecutors to defer the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin on corruption and fraud charges and instead negotiate a remediation agreement.

“For a period of approximately four months between September and December of 2018 I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people in the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion,” Wilson-Raybould said in her opening statement.

Although he did respond to Postmedia’s inquiries, Mission-Matsqui-Fraser Canyon Liberal MP Jati Sidhu told The Abbotsford News on Thursday in an interview that he thought Wilson-Raybould’s testimony was “sour grapes” and he thought she lacked experience.

“The way she’s acting, I think she couldn’t handle the stress,” he told The News. “I think there’s somebody else behind – maybe her father (Chief Bill Wilson) – pulling the strings.”

Fleetwood-Port Kells MP Ken Hardie called Sidhu’s comments “total rubbish.”

“I would imagine my colleague would like that one back, because that’s certainly not been my observations of her. I don’t think that’s been anyone’s experience of her,” Hardie said.

He called her previous handling of big issues as “calm, deliberate and very orderly,” and described her as principled and someone with integrity.

I apologize without reservation to the Member of Vancouver Granville for my inappropriate comments. Both inside and outside of the House, it is important to treat everyone with respect. — Jati Sidhu (@MPJatiSidhu) February 28, 2019

Sidhu later issued an apology to Wilson-Raybould in the House of Commons and on Twitter, calling his comments “inappropriate.”

“Both inside and outside of the House, it is important to treat everyone with respect,” he said.

Personally, Hardie said, he disagrees with Wilson-Raybould’s decision to pursue criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

“I just happen to disagree with her position on this particular situation, but those disagreements are important; they need a good, thorough airing,” Hardie said. “If we can’t disagree and come out of it, then I think that’s a weakness — and I don’t think we’re a weak party.”

When asked about her testimony on the pressure to which she was subjected, Hardie said, “Was there pressure? Absolutely. Was it inappropriate? I think she is the one that should define that because she is the one who experienced it, so I won’t comment on that. But, was some kind of discussion — or if you want to call it, pressure — justified? Yes, absolutely, because of the implications of her course of action.”

Hardie said Wilson-Raybould is an asset and he hopes she remains with the party.

In an email, Surrey Centre MP Randeep Sarai said he did not believe that Trudeau placed “consistent and sustained” pressure on Wilson-Raybould, but merely discussed the matter with her.

“Pressure, discussions and consultation are what government officials do, not make decisions in a vacuum without taking into account all the consequences,” Sarai said.

The press secretary for Fisheries and Oceans Minister Jonathan Wilkinson, in an email on Wednesday evening, directed queries to the Prime Minister’s Office.

Conservative, NDP and Green MPs in B.C. described Wilson-Raybould’s testimony as “explosive,” “courageous” and “entirely credible.”

“I think she’s a hero,” New Westminster-Burnaby NDP MP Peter Julian said.

At Granville Street and Broadway in the heart of Wilson-Raybould’s Vancouver riding, a Postmedia News team asked 50 people what they thought of her testimony and whether she should stick with the Liberal party.

The dozen or so who responded said they were impressed by her, and took her word over Trudeau’s.

Beth Carruthers, 64, from Metchosin, said Wilson-Raybould “is a woman of great principle.”

“I would love to be able to say that Canada is ready to have a First Nations prime minister, who is also a woman, but I’m not sure we’re there yet,” she said.

“One of the things I like about someone like Elizabeth May is she also that kind of integrity, so if I were in some imaginary reality, (as) Jody Wilson-Raybould, I might be tempted to run with the Green party.”

Jackie Lehman, 35, from Vancouver, said she didn’t want to suggest what Wilson-Raybould do next, but believes the former attorney general has many options.

“She should just do what she wants,” Lehman said.

“She’s fantastic, so I think that she should stay … she does such an amazing job, whatever she does, so it would be good to see her in some type of leadership role.”

Both Children, Community and Social Services Minister Lisa MacLeod and Education Minister Lisa Thompson have received letters from school boards, with Halton District School Board trustees saying they are “gravely concerned about the changes” — and that they need to know what the government’s implementation plan is. Without one, and additional funding, student safety is compromised, they say.

She noted the province already spends $3 billion in total on special education. But NDP Education Critic Marit Stiles called it “disturbing” that school boards haven’t received any word from the ministry. “Boards are telling us there has been absolutely no communication around the situation,” said Stiles, a former school trustee. “Things were tough enough,” she told the Star. “School boards already spend more than they are given for special education, and it comes through other funds. They are just moving shells around.”

Cathy Abraham, head of the Ontario Public School Boards Association, said “we don’t know how many students will be coming — we don’t know the degree of their need, we don’t know the services required. We need to know what will happen so we can plan, because we want to be able to serve these children.” MacLeod has said the government is “committed to eliminating the 23,000-long wait list for families of children with autism” and will do so in the next year and a half.

A ban on corporate and union donations has made selling the tickets a challenge.","The Progressive Conservatives’ decision to enlist lobbyists to peddle $1,250 tickets to Doug Ford’s upcoming fundraiser suggests the governing party is selling access to the premier, charges Democracy Watch. Duff Conacher, co-founder of the non-partisan organization that advocates for democratic reform and government accountability, expressed concern after the Star first revealed the Tories urged lobbyists to sell tickets to Wednesday’s fundraiser.

Ontario Progressive Conservative leader Doug Ford: “We’ve put fundraisers together that are $25-spaghetti dinners as you know, so we have the freebies, we have the $25-fundraisers, and then we have the big fundraiser,” the premier said of the event, which should make the Tories $2 million. ( Aaron Vincent Elkaim / THE CANADIAN PRESS file photo )

“The PC Party asking lobbyists to sell high-priced tickets to the premier’s fundraising event shows that the Ford government is willing to sell access to the premier for cash, and to trade favours with lobbyists, in violation of the interests of the people of Ontario,” he said. Conacher, an adjunct professor of law and politics at the University of Ottawa, said the governing party will “feel compelled to return the favour by protecting the interests of the lobbyists’ clients. “That means the public interest will be violated.”

“I can tell you one thing: no one can influence Doug Ford. No one can influence my ministers or my caucus,” he said during a trade mission to Washington. “We’ve put fundraisers together that are $25-spaghetti dinners as you know, so we have the freebies, we have the $25-fundraisers, and then we have the big fundraiser,” the premier said of the Toronto Congress Centre event Wednesday that should make the Tories $2 million.

“We have to run campaigns.” As disclosed by the Star on Thursday, the Tories appealed to lobbyists for help due to the tightened rules around political fundraising introduced in 2016 by the previous Liberal government. The ban on corporate and union donations has made selling tickets a challenge. Until the changes three years ago, which were triggered by a Star probe of Liberal political fundraising excesses, companies could purchase entire tables for dinners and then give the tickets to employees, associates or clients. But now, each ticket must be paid for by an individual. In an email appeal to clients obtained by the Star, Chris Benedetti, a principal at Sussex Strategy Group, a firm run by Conservatives and Liberals, said the company “has been asked to help with the event.” “The event is $12,500 for a table of 10 ($1,250/person). To reserve a table, please let us know, and we can assist you in assembling individual registrations to then be sent in as a package,” he wrote. Benedetti, registered to lobby for 60 different companies at Queen’s Park, said he was contacted by the PC Ontario Fund last month. “I have not spoken to anyone in the premier’s office about this event, and no one in the office or any other government office has been in touch with me to encourage sales or otherwise,” he said. Another lobbyist, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wants to continue to do business with the Tories, said there has been “tremendous pressure” on his company to sell tickets. “You’re really made to feel that you’re not pulling your weight if you don’t sell a table or two,” the consultant said. NDP MPP Taras Natyshak (Essex) said Friday that “Doug Ford’s threat-based racket looks like cash-for-access on steroids.” Green Leader Mike Schreiner said that “when big money gets its hands on our politics, it eats away at democracy.” Marcus Mattinson, the PC party’s director of communications, has said “dozens of individuals have been assisting the party with fundraising for decades, and this event is no exception.” In November, the Tories repealed a section in the campaign finance reform bill that forced donors to “certify, in a form approved by the chief electoral officer, that the person has not acted contrary” to the ban on unions or corporations making donations in the name of members or employees. That new loophole means a company or union could, theoretically, make a political contribution in someone else’s name. The government has emphasized it only made the amendment because the disclosure form was a nuisance to contributors.

Ford noted the event was sold out, suggesting the party could have taken in as much as $4 million before expenses. “This is the largest fundraiser in Canadian history,” the premier boasted. Because of the large crowd, the snowstorm and some protesters outside, attendees were slow entering the sprawling Etobicoke venue, which delayed Ford’s speech by about an hour. At Queen’s Park earlier in the day, he defended the closed-door dinner and emphasized he also does events that ordinary Ontarians can afford to attend. “I’m going up to Muskoka on Friday for a $25 spaghetti dinner to talk to the real people. I encourage everyone to come out Friday to listen to the great things that this government has done for the common folk,” Ford said in the legislature.

But Green Leader Mike Schreiner said those folksy fundraisers aren’t the problem. “We haven’t heard any reports that the premier is pressing corporate lobbyists to sell $25 tickets to his spaghetti dinners,” said Schreiner.

Last Thursday, the Star disclosed that the Tories asked lobbyists to help sell tickets because campaign finance reforms that banned corporate and union contributions have made it a challenge to fill tables. “It’s potentially doing an end run around the ban on corporate donations,” Schreiner said. While premiers’ major fundraisers have traditionally been open to the media, the party announced Tuesday that the event would be closed. NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said that is becoming a theme for Ford’s administration. “It says that the government is elected for only special interests,” said Horwath. “We know that this government, particularly, does a lot of their business behind closed doors in secret where nobody knows what they’re doing and what they’re cooking up.” Government house leader Todd Smith said prohibiting reporters was “a decision made by the party.” But Tory sources, speaking on condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal PC matters, insisted the edict came from Ford’s office.

After weeks of embarrassing leaks — including revelations in the Star about a new health “super agency” and the opposition NDP’s unauthorized release of a draft government bill — Elliott will table legislation on Tuesday.

“There’s no real surprise in the sense that I’ve said from the beginning that we need transformational change in health care in Ontario,” the minister told reporters Monday at Queen’s Park. “We have some significant problems that we’re dealing with when we have over 30,000 people who are waiting for long-term care beds,” said Elliott. “We have 1,200 people every day in hospitals across Ontario who are receiving health care in hallways and storage rooms; and the wait-list for mental health and addictions is way too long,” she said.

Confirming what the Star first reported on Jan. 17, Elliott said as part of the restructuring there would be a new “super agency” overseeing how health services are delivered. “What we really need to do is focus our health-care system on the patient. That’s what the centre of all of this is about — to make sure that patients’ needs are considered and thought of first and foremost.”

The minister emphasized that the head of the new super agency would not be a patronage appointment. “We are thinking about the people that we are going to be appointing to the agency. We are wanting to make sure that we are connecting with people that are knowledgeable about our health-care system so that’s what we are concentrating on,” she said. “We are finalizing our appointments ... it is going to be a professional person.” In recent months, the Tories have been criticized for appointing friends of Premier Doug Ford, including Toronto police Supt. Ron Taverner, 72, the proposed new commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police. NDP Leader Andrea Horwath, whose party’s obtaining of draft legislation led to a mid-level government bureaucrat being fired on Feb. 4, said she’s worried about what the revamped system will look like. “They better close this idea of a super agency that’s going to take away the local specifics around what people need in their communities,” said Horwath. “We’re very, very concerned about that,” she said, warning of increased “privatization” in health care. The draft bill, which Elliott downplayed as a “very early” version, would give the new super agency unprecedented powers to contract out health services. One of the leaked documents, titled “agency review weekly status report,” indicates the government has used focus groups to gauge acceptance of the health-overhaul plan. Some 20 existing health agencies are expected to be folded into the new body. Robert Benzie is the Star’s Queen’s Park bureau chief and a reporter covering Ontario politics.

A number — including the Halton public board — are now writing letters of concern to Community and Social Services Minister Lisa MacLeod and Education Minister Lisa Thompson given changes to the autism system come into effect April 1 and they’ve received no direction from the government.

Lisa MacLeod, Ontario's Children, Community and Social Services Minister, said the government aims to clear up the 23,000-child wait-list within the next 18 months. ( Chris Young / THE CANADIAN PRESS FILE PHOTO )

“We know that our educators, our teachers and our educational assistants do their very best to support students every single day, but they are stretched to the limit,” NDP Education Critic Marit Stiles said in the legislature Tuesday. “The truth is that this government has cut supports to students with special needs. I want to know ... if the minister of education will tell parents and families if they are going to be hiring more teachers, educational assistants and support workers to ensure these children get the support they need in school? Will the minister at least consult with the school boards?” said Stiles, a former Toronto public school board trustee. Criticism of the autism overhaul continued for another day at Queen’s Park, with MacLeod again defending accusations her ministry froze the wait-list for children’s autism services after taking office, as well claims the Ford government’s is spending more on autism than the Liberals when the previous government had budgeted the same amount — $321 million.

“If I used that quote yesterday incorrectly, I unequivocally apologize,” MacLeod said. Windsor West MPP Lisa Gretzky called it a “hollow apology” saying Sherri Taylor — a mom of four children with developmental disabilities — felt “manipulated” because “the minister’s office asked her for a statement before they announced changes to the autism program” and “was not told what the statement was to be used for; nor that the minister would be reading it aloud” in the legislature on Monday.

Article Continued Below

Under the changes, the government has promised to clear the 23,000-long wait list for therapy, and will introduce a childhood budget allowing families to choose the services they want — essentially spreading autism funding to more families, meaning some will receive much less than they currently do. Families will be eligible for up to $20,000 a year for children under 6 — up to a lifetime maximum of $140,000. Children older than that can access up to $5,000 a year up to age 18, to a lifetime maximum of $55,000. MacLeod has previously landed in hot water for issuing a warning to behavioural therapists during a meeting in January that they’d be in for a “long four years” if they didn’t publicly support the autism changes. She later said sorry for her tone during what she described as a tense meeting. Meanwhile, Education Minister Lisa Thompson said the government has extended funding for a pilot project “with regard to improving school-based supports for students” who have been diagnosed with autism. Overall, she noted, boards will receive $3 billion in funding for all special education programs this school year — though many boards say they spend more than that. “We are working with our school boards and we will be sharing our steps forward with our boards in the weeks to come,” Thompson later told reporters. “... We are working with boards in identifying and addressing their concerns.” Boards say they have no idea how many children are currently being served outside of schools under the Ontario Autism Program, nor what impact the changes could have come April 1. “This so-called 23,000 wait list is just going to be pushed into the schools,” said Liberal MPP Michael Coteau, who is also a former Toronto public school board trustee. “So if you are a young child who needs 25 hours of ABA (behavioural therapy) services and you are only getting seven hours because of the allocated amount, that gets downloaded to the actual school board,” he said. “And the school boards are just not prepared.” Under the Ford government changes, only families earning less than $55,000 in net income will qualify for the full funding amounts. On Tuesday, the social services ministry quietly released the sliding income scale which determines how much families are entitled to for autism services.

Health Minister Christine Elliott held a news conference early Tuesday morning, more than six hours before the legislation to transform the system was introduced. That left her answering questions by saying she couldn’t comment.

“I can’t really speak about it yet. I have to wait until this afternoon to introduce it properly in the legislature,” Elliott said in response to one question on the looming changes.

“That is something that we can’t answer right now,” she said in response to another question.

Late Tuesday afternoon, after the legislation had been introduced, officials held a background briefing for journalists that was again devoid of details.

No documents were available to explain the legislation, the legislation itself was not available until after reporters had been asking questions for about 20 minutes. Then, mid-briefing, members of the media were handed a collection of documents more than 85-pages long.

Officials also were unable to answer basic questions at times.

This was the Ford government’s chance to sell their legislation, their chance to explain how and why they were changing a system that is fully broken and that no one can defend anymore.

They failed, it was amateur hour at Queen’s Park.

So what can be said about the government’s plans at this point?

The goal of these changes, Elliott said time and again, was not to save money but to change the focus from the bureaucracy to the patient.

“Too much time and attention is spent on maintaining a siloed and fragmented system, and far too many people believe it is the patient’s or the family’s job to navigate this complicated system,” she said.

“We promised that we would put more people on the front line in health-care services, and that’s what we intend to do.”

There will obviously be job cuts, especially in the over-bloated bureaucracy, but neither Elliott at her news conference nor the officials at the briefing could give details — or even estimates.

Elliott wouldn’t even admit that by getting rid of the useless and ineffective Local Health Integration Networks that any jobs would be cut.

If they aren’t cut, then we will still have a broken system and not enough money for front-line care.

The system under the Liberals became one more interested in those that pushed paper than medical personnel who provide front-line care.

I believe the Ford government wants to shift the system back in the right direction; I just wish they could tell us how in some greater detail and sell the system without being scared of their own shadow.

There won’t be private hospitals and no, you won’t need to pull out your Visa to pay for a doctor’s visit. Despite NDP fear mongering, the system will not be privatized.

NDP Leader Andrea Horwath is continuing to push the privatization line and decrying that there might be private delivery of care.

There is in Ontario, including family doctors, the local blood lab or X-ray clinic, the private delivery of care.

Horwath told me she’d like to get rid of that. If the opposition at Queen’s Park wasn’t so inept, the Ford government would be big trouble.

The Canadian Press





LETHBRIDGE, Alta. -- A spokeswoman for Alberta Premier Rachel Notley appeared to acknowledge the poor optics of a weekend appearance Notley made at a hospital, which the Opposition says broke rules prohibiting political activity at health facilities.

Cheryl Oates posted on Twitter on Sunday that while Saturday's event was in a public area of the Chinook Regional Hospital in Lethbridge, the premier's office will ensure future campaign events are not done at Alberta Health Services facilities.

A picture Notley posted on Twitter of the event showed her standing at a podium with the message ""Rachel Notley, fighting for you"" on it, with health-care workers standing behind her.

United Conservative House Leader Jason Nixon said in a news release that Notley's NDP government and AHS should be investigated by the province's ethics commissioner for what he called a ""partisan campaign event.""

AHS policy states that elected officials may access their facilities for the purpose of carrying out their duties, provided they don't engage in political activity.

The health agency tweeted Sunday that the Notley event was not organized by AHS, and that participants were not representing the agency.

""The AHS Political Activity Policy, which came into effect in March 2012, is designed to maintain AHS's non-partisan role in health-care delivery, and to protect our staff and patients,"" the health agency said in a separate tweet Sunday.

An Alberta election must happen before the end of May, and Notley could call a vote at any time.

""The NDP's use of a public hospital to launch a partisan attack is an unethical abuse of public resources. Alberta's hospitals belong to Albertans, not to the NDP,"" Nixon said in his statement..

Nixon also suggested Notley and her staff broke government rules that prohibit them from using their influence to host a partisan event in a public hospital.

United Conservative Leader Jason Kenney called the event ""an unethical abuse of public resources.

""Stop campaigning at public expense. Call the election,"" Kenney challenged Notley on Twitter.

Oates said on Twitter that ""not a single tax dollar"" went to the announcement.

""The nurses who came to speak out about the dangers of (Kenney's) plan to privatize health care, came on their own time because they are worried about what he will do to front-line services,"" she stated.

Kenney responded by posting that his party will maintain a ""universally accessible, publicly funded health-care system.""",Opposition accuses Alberta premier of breaking rules with event at hospital - CTV News,Ctvnews.ca,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/opposition-accuses-alberta-premier-of-breaking-rules-with-event-at-hospital-1.4310811

While Ford did not attend question period Tuesday, the New Democrats did not hold back.

""The vehicle the premier asked for sounds like the Taj Mahal on wheels,"" said Taras Natyshak, the NDP MPP for Essex.

""When the premier said that he wanted to stop the gravy train, it's clearly because he needed time to get on board.""

Community Safety and Correctional Services Minister Sylvia Jones fielded the questions, maintaining Ford's request for a used van was to make sure he could travel the province without incurring expenses of a flight.

""[It's] a perfectly reasonable use of resources,"" said Jones.

The retrofitting would have cost taxpayers more than $50,000 and would have included:

A mini-fridge.

A 32-inch television with Blu-ray player.

A leather power reclining sofa bench.

Four swivel chairs and desks.

Blair is asking the court to force Ontario's ombudsman to investigate the hiring of Ford's family friend, Toronto Police Service Supt. Ron Taverner, as OPP commissioner.

Personal email

Interim Liberal Leader John Fraser expressed concern about the way Ford's staff got an estimate for the van.

The court documents show Ford's executive assistant Nico Fidani used his personal email address to communicate with members of the OPP and a company called A1 Mobility.

""The most important thing is they tried to conceal it,"" said Fraser. ""That's what people should be concerned about.""

The Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario states online it ""recommends"" leaders of public institutions ""strictly control"" their staff and forbid the use of personal email accounts for doing government business, unless they can be set up to make sure those records are saved.

Ford's office did not respond to questions Tuesday about why Fidani used his personal email.

The premier's office maintains any accusations it wanted the van to be kept off the books are false.

Health Minister Christine Elliott says there have been changes from a leaked draft version that the NDP revealed late last month.

The draft bill showed that Ontario was planning a health ""super agency,"" with the proposed legislation allowing the government to roll local health integration networks, Cancer Care Ontario, eHealth Ontario and other government health agencies under that umbrella.

The NDP has warned that language in the draft bill allows for greater privatization in the health system.

But Elliott has said the legislation will not include two-tier care, private hospitals, making patients pay for more services out of pocket, or privatizing services such as long-term care inspections and the air ambulance service.

Insurance broker Jasvir Deol defeated Edmonton-Mill Creek MLA Denise Woollard. Clinical psychologist Chand Gul also ran for the nomination in the new southeast Edmonton riding, called Edmonton-Meadows.

More than 400 members cast a ballot in the contested nomination, which Woollard called a reflection of democracy. So far, most NDP incumbents have stood for nomination without facing opposition.

""What's really important to remember is that we have a fight on our hands now that the UCP has decided to parachute in an unknown — a manager of a football club of all things — who doesn't live here, doesn't know the people,"" Woollard said.

""The UCP will be throwing money at him and at that campaign. So that makes another bit of an obstacle. There are challenges ahead.""

Deol has lived in the community for 26 years.

In an interview with CBC Radio's Metro Morning, Elliott said the health-care system is ""broken"" and the consolidation of agencies that will occur through the legislation tabled in the Ontario Legislature on Tuesday will help to fix it.

Under the People's Health Care Act, 2019, the provincial government would create a new agency called Ontario Health. The super-agency will be formed by dissolving the province's 14 Local Health Integration Networks (LHINs) and merging their duties with those of six other health agencies, including Cancer Care Ontario and eHealth Ontario.

""We are not looking at reducing jobs,"" she said.

The agencies collectively employ some 10,500 people. Elliott said Wednesday that thousands of workers will be included in the new super-agency.

Ontario's health care system is getting a makeover. As CBC first reported in January, that means dissolving the 14 Local Health Integration Networks or LHINs - and merging them with six other provincial health agencies, including Cancer Care Ontario, eHealth Ontario and Trillium Gift of Life Network. According to the Progressive Conservatives, the new agency - called Ontario Health - will result in better integrated system that puts patients' needs first. But will it curb long wait times and end hallway medicine? Christine Elliott, Ontario's Minister of Health and Long Term Care joins us to explain all the changes, and what it means for people in Ontario. 11:52

""What we are looking at is improving patient efficiency. We are restructuring the system in many respects, moving people into different positions within that structure, because the way things are operating within the LHIN structure, it's not working right now. And providers are operating in silos. We want to break down those silos.

""What we are saying is a lot of those jobs will still continue to be necessary.""

Health Minister Christine Elliott greets patients at Bridgepoint Active Healthcare before making an announcement in Toronto. (Tijana Martin/Canadian Press)

For example, she said, when the province creates local Ontario Health teams, those teams will need ""supports, certainly."" And within the LIHNs, she said, ""excellent people"" providing home care services will continue to do their work.

Patient care won't be interrupted

She said patient care will not be interrupted as the provincial government creates local teams to co-ordinate care and patients should know that they will continue to have access to their local health care providers.

""They don't need to change anything in that respect. As we transition, we are transitioning gradually so that patient care will not be affected,"" she said.

""We want people to experience no changes in their immediate care, but better care as we bring the system to maturity because their health-care providers will be connected for their benefit. And people will have one number to call. There will be no gaps.""

The transformation of the health-care system will take time, she emphasized.

Ontario Health teams, she added, will be made up of local service providers that already exist and organized to work as a co-ordinated group.

For example, a team could be made up of a local hospital, a home care agency and a mental health service provider that ""come together, make an application to the larger body, Ontario Health, to become responsible for their geographic area and provide care.""

As for concerns raised by NDP Leader Andrea Horwath, Elliott said the provincial government is not trying to increase privatization in the health-care system.

""What is necessary and what we are doing is to centre care around patients, integrate care for them, and have them continue to pay for their services using their OHIP card. We are not intending to advance privatization. That is not the intention of this legislation.""

NDP Leader Andrea Horwath has said she is worried that the super-agency will allow for contracting of health services to the private sector.

Patients have felt 'disconnected'

A year and a half ago, Elliott experienced Ontario health care firsthand when she was in hospital with a serious head injury. On Wednesday, she said she received excellent care, although other patients told her that they would have appreciated ""more connection"" once they went home following rehabilitation.

""We know that there is only so much that the system currently can provide.""

When she was Ontario's patient ombudsman, she said the number one concern was that patients felt ""disconnected"" from the health-care system, particularly as they went from hospital to home care or hospital to long-term care.

473,Empty,2019-02-25T16:15:46Z,Jennifer McKenzie has resigned as leader of the New Brunswick NDP a day after members voted for a leadership review.,"Jennifer McKenzie, who tried to move the New Brunswick NDP back to its socialist roots, has resigned as party leader, a day after members voted to hold a leadership convention before the end of August.

In a statement Monday, McKenzie said she was resigning ""effective immediately.""

""The NDP has by a vote this week determined that there will be a leadership convention within the next six months,"" she said. ""I have decided not to participate in such a leadership contest.""

McKenzie has been leader since August 2017 and led the party to a dismal showing in the provincial election last September, when the NDP won no seats.

On Sunday at Moncton's Darts Club, 95 delegates took part in the vote on whether to hold a leadership convention.

The vote was close, with 52 in favour and 43 against, said Danny Légère, who holds a labour seat on the NDP provincial council. He said the results of the 2018 election definitely affected the leadership review.

""At the end of the day, there are some who feel that leadership may be a factor in that,"" he said.

In a Monday afternoon scrum, Jennifer McKenzie told reporters she's proud of the work she did before resigning as leader of the NDP. (CBC)

In a Monday afternoon scrum, McKenzie admitted she was surprised by the result and said she's ""not part of that vision"" of where the party wants to go.

Despite the vote Sunday, McKenzie could have remained leader until a convention, when she could have run against other candidates to try to keep the post. But she chose to resign immediately and said she won't run again for the leadership.

In her statement, McKenzie said she was ""thankful,"" for the opportunity to be leader. Despite the disappointing results of the Sept. 24 election, she said she was glad that the party had a full slate of candidates and that more than 50 per cent of them were women.

McKenzie finished third in Saint John Harbour, the riding represented by the last NDP member of the legislature, Elizabeth Weir, who retired from politics in 2005.

In 2018, the NDP received more than 19,000 votes provincewide, a 60 per cent drop from 2014 and its worst result in a New Brunswick election in 44 years.

McKenzie campaigned on a return to the NDP's socialist beginnings, promising universal childcare, pay equity, home care, better nursing home ratios and pharmacare.

This was a shift from what former leader Dominic Cardy pushed for. He alienated some people by endorsing the Energy East pipeline and distancing himself from unions. He's now a minister in the Progressive Conservative government.

""I was the new kid on the block, and the party was renewing itself and going back to its socialist roots,"" McKenzie said ""That is something that's quite new and different. We haven't seen that for a long time in this province and it's going to take some time to sell.""

In 2018, the NDP received five per cent of the popular vote, down from 11 per cent when Cardy was leader.

The NDP appears to have missed the wave that propelled the two other alternative parties (the Green Party and People's Alliance) to greater success. The Greens had 11 per cent and the Alliance had 12 per cent of the popular vote last election, and each won three ridings.

McKenzie said people may have chosen Green over NDP because there has been confusion about what sets them apart.

""[The Greens] are not a socialist party, they're not a party to the left,"" she said. ""Because we haven't had a lot of socialism and socialist policy in this province, people did not understand the difference.""

4 leaders in 14 years

Since Weir resigned in 2005, the NDP has had four leaders, including McKenzie, who ran for the leadership unopposed.

No date has been set for the leadership convention, which has to be held in the next six months.

The vote was by secret ballot, Légère said, but some people did voice their disagreement with the results.

""Some felt that we shouldn't be changing leaders as often as we do. It wasn't good for the party, that we needed consistency. Some felt otherwise.""

""It's an act that would require the government to track and publicly report on a monthly basis the number and percentage of patients to be admitted to emergency rooms who do not have a family doctor,"" said party leader Gary Burrill.

The NDP plans to bring the proposed Emergency Room Accountability Act forward later this week when MLAs return for the spring session of the legislature.

Burrill said a freedom of information request made by his party showed an alarming increase in people going to emergency rooms who don't have a doctor. The numbers, from 2013 to 2018, show a 112 per cent increase provincewide under the Liberal government.

The highest increase was at the Valley Regional Hospital in Kentville at almost 265 per cent. There were also significant jumps at the Colchester East Hants Health Centre in Truro and the Dartmouth General Hospital, where increases were recorded of 257 per cent and 217 per cent, respectively.

""This is the level of openness, transparency and scrutiny that is required across the breadth of the crisis in the emergency care system,"" said Burrill. ""The purpose of this act is to make it law in Nova Scotia.""

The proposed legislation would include the IWK Health Centre in Halifax and hospitals under the Nova Scotia Health Authority.

The NDP said there would be no additional cost to monitor the monthly information. The freedom of information request shows the numbers are already being tracked, the party said.

N.S. health minister responds

Nova Scotia Health Minister Randy Delorey said he'll wait to hear exactly what the NDP's legislation entails before making a judgment, but he pointed out the numbers provided through the freedom of information request may not paint the most accurate picture.

""As I understand the data that was brought forward today, it makes reference to visits,"" Delorey said. ""It's important to recognize a visit may be one person who has multiple visits to an emergency department.""

Health Minister Randy Delorey said the government is committed to hiring more doctors and primary care providers. (CBC)

He added the data released by the NDP doesn't explain why a patient is in the emergency room.

""For example, a patient shows up at the hospital in cardiac distress, whether they have a physician, a primary care provider or not, they're supposed to be in the emergency department,"" Delorey said.

""And so there's nothing in that data set that was released today that gives any consideration to the clinical symptoms or diagnosis or services that were offered.""

The Nova Scotia Health Authority said doctor recruitment to help ease the strain on ERs is ongoing.

Labour Relations Board instead of the courts.,"Lawyers squared off in court Wednesday over the issue of how best to proceed with a legal challenge to a labour agreement of the NDP government that critics say favours B.C.’s trade unions.

A coalition including contractors and building associations has filed a petition in B.C. Supreme Court seeking to strike down the government’s labour framework for building public infrastructure projects.

The framework calls for workers on public projects such as the new Pattullo Bridge to become members of affiliated trade unions, a move that the coalition claims is illegal and unconstitutional.

Lawyers involved in the case appeared in B.C. Supreme Court in Vancouver on Wednesday to deal with an application involving a jurisdictional issue.

Government lawyers argued that the case involved private contractual issues and was best handled by the B.C. Labour Relations Board, an independent tribunal with a mandate to mediate and adjudicate employment and labour issues.

The move was supported by lawyer Charles Gordon, who is representing union interests in the case.

“We think that this matter should be heard at the Labour Relations Board, that the Labour Relations Board has proper jurisdiction,” Gordon said during a break in the proceedings Wednesday.

“It involves labour relations and the Labour Relations Board has proper jurisdiction over matters involving labour relations.”

Related

Gordon said a number of other similar cases, including one recent one in Manitoba, that have been challenged in the courts have resulted in matters being referred to labour relations boards.

“So there’s a pretty strong precedent that it should be at the board.”

Peter Gall, who is representing the petitioners, said outside court that what the government wants is effectively a full trial, which could take years to get to, or to have it handled by the Labour Relations Board.

“Both arguments are designed to prevent the court from dealing with it now,” said Gall.

The Vancouver lawyer said that instead of being a contractual issue, the petition was in fact a challenge to the transportation minister’s decision to impose the union requirement.

“We say it’s illegal,” he said. “It’s for an illegal purpose, to reward (the government’s) friends.”

Gall added that the focus of the petition was on the exercise of statutory powers by the minister, not on any contract.

“And exercise of the statutory power is not within the jurisdiction of the labour board. They don’t deal with whether a minister’s decision is legal or illegal.”

The transportation ministry said in an email statement that it understood the court hearing was only to determine whether the matter should continue through the traditional court system or whether another venue may be more appropriate.

“As this matter is before the courts, we can’t comment further, but government stands behind the principles of the Community Benefits Agreement to deliver good paying jobs, enhanced training, more apprenticeships and more opportunities for Indigenous people, women and youth around the province.”

The hearing before B.C. Supreme Court Justice Christopher Giaschi is expected to continue until Friday, after which the judge will likely reserve judgment.

The party, which formed the government between 2007 and 2011, won four district seats and four Territorial At-large seats, while the incumbent National Democratic Party (NDP) won three seats.

The other two seats were won by the Progressive United (PU) and the Progressive Virgin Islands Movement (PVIMP).

In the First District, Fahie, received 752 votes, easily defeating Sylvia Moses , 141 votes and Stephanie Brewley ,a mere 28 votes.

Fahie, 48, is expected to be sworn in as the new Premier later on Tuesday.

He was last December ousted as Opposition Leader following the split within the then ruling NDP with Ronnie Skelton leading a faction and became the largest opposition party in Parliament.

The VIP was one of four political parties that contested the elections held after Premier Dr Orlando Smith, decided to forego a by-election for the Fifth Electoral District that became vacant last October following the death of Representative Delores Chris.

Smith did not contest Monday's polls, after having indicated in June last year that he would be stepping down and not contesting the next general election.

Electoral officials said 25 candidates from four political parties as well as a lone independent, contested the election in nine districts, while 15 candidates contested the poll as At-Large Candidates.

It is the first time in the history of the BVI that four political parties --the Progressives United (PU), Virgin Islands Party (VIP), Progressive Virgin Islands Movement (PVIM) and the NDP -- contested an election here.

Finance Minister Joe Ceci will give a fiscal update Wednesday for the first three quarters of the fiscal year ending in December 2018.

Ceci says the first part of 2018 came in with higher resource prices, before the ""crisis"" of the oil price differential set in.

""A harbinger of good news was Q2, and I think we can continue that,"" said Ceci, who declined to divulge what impact the lack of pipeline capacity, and oil glut had on provincial coffers at the end of 2018.

""You'll see everything.""

Oil price gap

In his second-quarter financial update in November, Ceci predicted what he called a brewing crisis, as the gap between the price Alberta gets for its oil and the world price continued to grow.

At that time, the provincial deficit forecast for 2018-2019 sat at $7.5-billion — about $1.3 billion less than originally predicted.

The widening differential prompted the government to take the extraordinary move to restrict production output of Alberta oil.

It forced the largest 25 oil companies in the province to limit their oil production to help boost prices.

The curtailment did have the desired impact of increasing prices, causing the government to ease quotas in February.

In budget preparation telephone town halls held Feb. 6 and Feb. 7, Ceci told listeners the news in the financial update will be positive.

Ready for bad news

UCP leader Jason Kenney says he is bracing for bad news. He predicts a larger debt and a deficit that still isn't under control.

""Our big focus will be on their plan to get to a hundred billion dollars in debt,"" said Kenney.

""Their fiscal plan they ran on is a complete shambles,"" added Kenney who noted the NDP election platform of 2015 predicted a half billion dollar surplus in 2019, not a $8 billion deficit.

I think the big thing is going to be that the dip in revenue because of the price differential. - John Brennan, political analyst

Political analyst John Brennan also predicts the update will include a bit of bad news but believes it will be countered with an upward swing toward increased royalty revenue.

""I think the big thing is going to be the dip in revenue because of the price differential,"" said Brennan.

""But I expect that to be corrected by the next update because royalty revenue should have increased in the last couple of months with the increase in the price of Western Canadian Select.""

Believing a new provincial budget will be introduced before the next election, Brennan, who spent years working with the federal Liberal government under Jean Chrétien, thinks it's tried and true formula to take to the polls.

'Nothing to lose'

""They've got nothing to lose,"" said Brennan.

""It's not going to be a bad news budget like the Prentice budget in 2015,"" said Brennan.

In 2015, then-premier Jim Prentice introduced a budget that increased taxes and cut services. Prentice called an early election running on the budget, but his Progressive Conservative government met with a historic loss to the NDP.

By contrast, the NDP isn't about to make that mistake, said Brennan.

""This will be an NDP budget. There'll be no increases in taxes. There'll be no health care premiums and there'll be slight increases for health education and post-secondary education.""

The NDP has said it is preparing to introduce a spring budget but hasn't indicated when that will be.

The super-agency — unveiled Tuesday by Health Minister Christine Elliott — will be formed by dissolving the 14 Local Health Integration Networks (LHINs) and merging their duties with those of six provincial health agencies, including Cancer Care Ontario and eHealth Ontario.

CBC News was first to reveal the health-system merger plans with a report in January on the provincial government's intention to dissolve the LHINs. Since then, leaked documents obtained by the NDP, including draft legislation, revealed more about the changes the government was considering.

Six agencies that will be consolidated under Ontario Health, in addition to the 14 LHINs, are:

Cancer Care Ontario.

eHealth Ontario.

Trillium Gift of Life Network.

Health Shared Services.

Health Quality Ontario.

HealthForce Ontario Marketing and Recruitment Agency.

Elliott said Tuesday that work overhauling the system will begin in the spring, but it will take years for it ""to become mature.""

The changes will be contained in new legislation, the People's Health Care Act, 2019, which Elliott will table in the legislature Tuesday afternoon.

Elliott also unveiled details of her plans to encourage hospitals, long-term care facilities, home-care agencies and other health service providers to form ""integrated care entities.""

Watch Christine Elliott describe Ontario's new health-care system:

Expect changes to begin 'within the next few weeks,' says provincial health minister Christine Elliott. 7:52

The Ontario Health Teams will be made up of local health-care providers and organized to work as a co-ordinated group, Elliott said. The teams will be built to ""guide patients"" among various care providers and help families through transitions between providers.

""They would take the guesswork out of navigating the health-care system,"" Elliott said.

Under the plan, each newly formed grouping would receive a single block of funding and work together to deliver a range of health-care services for the region they cover.

The government is asking health providers to make proposals for forming the groups, rather than force them together. The goal is to have between 30 and 50 health teams in the province, Elliott said. Each team will be responsible for about 300,000 people, but that could vary based on factors such as population and geography.

Asked how the changes will affect family health teams, which were formed years ago to bring together family doctors and other practitioners, Elliott said they will continue to operate and Ontarians' ability to access their family physician will not change.

The new Ontario Health Teams will be responsible for managing all care in a specific region, she said. But people will continue to get home care as they always have, they will continue to see their physician as they always have.""

Asked repeatedly what the changes mean in terms of cost savings or administrative job losses, Elliott would not provide specifics on either point. The news release touting the changes does mention ""eliminating duplicative back office infrastructure and administration.""

In background materials provided by the government, it says that each of the six agencies being rolled into Ontario Health has a full senior management team and administrative support, ""and over time some of this work has become duplicative.""

Elliott also announced new digital health-care tools, including secure access to various tools such as virtual specialist appointments and secure access to electronic health records.

On Monday, Elliott spoke to reporters at Queen's Park in Toronto and said the changes will ""significantly reduce hallway medicine by making sure that people find the care that they need.""

""This is something that we have thought about long and hard,"" she said.

""What we really need to do is focus our health-care system on the patient. That's what the centre of all of this is about, is to make sure that patients' needs are considered and thought of first and foremost.""

NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said Monday she is worried that the super-agency model will allow for contracting of health services to the private sector.

The looming changes, as well as complaints the previous government failed to tackle the hospital overcrowding problem, have the Liberals on the defensive.

""I'm not going to say that we solved everything,"" said interim Liberal Leader John Fraser.

It's become somewhat of a tradition. The party entered the past four campaigns with a new leader and the streak will continue into the next one after the news Jennifer McKenzie resigned Monday, five months after a disastrous election night.

Once the principal alternative to the major parties, the NDP now appears in decline.

The party has struggled under shifting direction, the vote to review McKenzie's leadership was far from unanimous (52-43), and the NDP's most popular candidate described disunion within the ranks in a post-election interview with CBC News.

Meanwhile, the NDP remains voiceless at the legislature and pushed further to the fringe by two newer third parties heading in the opposite direction, with three seats each.

""I think the party is in a really tough spot, kind of going through a rebuild,"" said J.P. Lewis, an associate professor of political science at the University of New Brunswick Saint John.

The last time the party won a seat was 15 years ago — making it harder and harder to energize volunteers and voters, Lewis said.

""You can see the impact of not winning a seat, not being in the legislature can be pretty devastating on a party's momentum,"" he said.

The most recent Corporate Research Associates poll from December suggests a dip in support for the NDP. A single percentage point drop in support among those polled left the NDP at six per cent, or fifth among the five main political parties and the only one in single digits.

The party has yet to file financial returns to Elections New Brunswick, so it's unclear what shape its war chest is in.

Instability at the top

The NDP hasn't had much success in elections since Elizabeth Weir stepped down as leader in 2005, and previous party success is inked to Weir's popularity in Saint John.

In the past 10 provincial elections, an NDP candidate was elected five times, but Weir accounted for four of those times.

During her tenure as leader, from 1988 to 2005, the party's share of the popular vote hovered around 10 per cent, and that figure has ebbed and flowed with each successive leader.

Former NDP leader Elizabeth Weir was elected to the legislature four times. She is the last NDP candidate to win a seat. (Government of New Brunswick)

Its popular vote reached an all-time high of about 14 per cent under Dominic Cardy, now a Progressive Conservative MLA. Then it hit a 44-year low in the Sept. 24 election, with a measly five per cent.

Party leadership has been anything but stable since Weir's departure.

There have been four leaders — plus three interim leaders — and none have lasted long enough for a second campaign. Cardy held the longest term, from 2011 to 2017, coming in on the heels of the 2010 election but taking off before 2018.

""When political parties change leaders after successive election defeats, it can be demoralizing to the rank-and-file party members,"" said Jamie Gillies, an associate professor of communications and public policy at St. Thomas University.

""For the NDP, in a province where they have not been in a position to form the government, it is especially frustrating because supporters are looking for leadership that can break them out of disappointing election cycles.""

A leadership convention is supposed to occur within six months. The new leader needs to appeal to disaffected progressive voters, Gillies said.

""But the New Democrats in recent elections, apart from Elizabeth Weir's support in Saint John, have not had too much traction provincially, so building the membership and expanding voter support is challenging,"" he said.

And attracting leadership candidates may prove difficult, too. McKenzie was acclaimed in 2017.

Change in direction

In her election night concession speech, McKenzie struck an optimistic tone despite the resounding defeat.

""The NDP is back,"" she said.

McKenzie was speaking to the overall party direction and a return to an uncompromising stance on social programs after Cardy steered the party to the centre and alienated some members by endorsing the Energy East pipeline and distancing himself from unions.

""We know we're on the right track,"" McKenzie told reporters that night. ""It's a question of getting our message out.""

NDP Leader Jennifer McKenzie's hopes of getting the party back to its roots and into the legislature were crushed Monday when she went down to defeat in Saint John Harbour. 10:26

Reaching progressive voters may be a tall order, however. Lewis said the Green Party — which, unlike the NDP, is gaining momentum provincially and federally — has eclipsed the NDP in that regard.

The PCs and Liberals also saw declines in their share of the popular vote last year, he said, but the NDP failed to pick up the slack. On the left, it was the Greens who came through with a historic three-seat night.

""The Green Party, in numerous provinces, including New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, has become the progressive alternative to the Liberals and Tories, and that has hurt the New Democrats even among the traditional labour union base of the party,"" Gillies said.

A pragmatic approach

Lewis suggested the party could benefit by taking a page from the Green playbook. The NDP could be best served by stepping back from a provincewide campaign and narrowing its focus and resources to a select few ridings, or even one, where victory is a possibility.

Returning to the legislature is crucial, he said, citing the success of Green Leader David Coon, who was the lone third-party MLA from 2014 to 2018 but made the most of it, pushing policies in the legislature and to the voters.

View f…","OTTAWA — Fewer Canadians are living under the official poverty line than at any time in the last decade, Statistics Canada reported Tuesday

The agency laid the credit for the drop on a combination of a buoyant economy and the Liberals signature child benefit.

The national statistics office says that in 2017, the most recent year available, 3.4 million Canadians, or 9.5 per cent of the population, lived below the poverty line the government officially adopted late last year — including 622,000 children — which is the lowest the agency reported going back to 2006.

The drops since the Liberals took office in 2015 were also noted in the agency’s release: 278,000 fewer children living below the poverty line in 2017 — the first full year of the benefit — compared to 2015 when the Liberals took office.

Statistics Canada said an increase in the value of child benefits, coupled with gains in market income, put more money into the pockets of families in 2017 — which Liberals touted Tuesday as a political and policy victory.

“It certainly shows a program that is simple for the government to manage, simple for families to receive, and fair for everyone … is a good thing when it comes to making more Canadians able to make ends meet,” Social Development Minister Jean-Yves Duclos said in an interview.

The Liberals introduced the income-tested Canada Child Benefit midway through 2016, replacing a previous system of tax credits and the Conservatives’ universal child care benefit. The agency calculates that between 2016 and 2017, a couple with children saw their median benefit rise by $1,200, while lone parents received an extra $1,300.

Duclos suggested numbers will drop further, particularly once the Canada Workers Benefit launches next month and expands a wage subsidy introduced under former prime minister Stephen Harper to boost the incomes of the country’s working poor.

Duclos was less clear about whether the Liberals would boost the base value of the child benefit or ensure immigration status doesn’t affect eligibility as some anti-poverty activists have requested.

The Liberals promised in the 2015 election that the child benefit would lift 300,000 children out of poverty compared to 2013 figures, but based on a different measure of poverty than was previously used.

Parsing out the numbers, the Liberals met their projections: a drop of 315,000 in children in poverty in 2017 compared to 2013.

Last year, the Liberals pegged the value of the benefit to inflation — two years before they planned to do so — and promised by 2020 to cut poverty rates by 20 per cent of 2015 figures.

What Statistics Canada reported Tuesday is that there were 826,000 fewer people living in poverty in 2017 compared to 2015 — or just shy of the 20 per cent target.

An expert panel the Liberals turned to for help crafting the poverty plan originally recommended a 25 per cent target for 2020. The Liberals chose 20 per cent, leading some experts to suggest the goal was likely a given based on the measures the government had introduced.

The next part of the plan proposes a drop to 50 per cent of 2015 levels by 2030, which will require thought about how to “make more of a dent in those who are living in and with extreme poverty,” Lindsay Tedds, scientific director of fiscal and economic policy at the University of Calgary’s school of public policy, said on Twitter.

A bill to set the poverty plan into law has yet to pass the House of Commons, but it doesn’t propose any additional spending than what is already promised.

“We picked the indicator, we picked where we want the indicator to be, but there’s no plan if we miss that target and there should be,” said David Macdonald, a senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives.

“That’s the point of a poverty reduction plan as opposed to having just a tracking plan, which is presently what it is.”

That estimate, in a new analysis, is 22 per cent higher than figures presented by the Department of National Defence and will likely mean renewed criticism of the Liberal government's plan.

Parliamentary Budget Officer Yves Giroux looked at the cost of buying 18 old F-18s, modifying them to Canadian standards, operating them until at least 2032 and disposing of them.

The warplanes, which are of the same vintage as the air force's existing CF-18s, are expected to arrive in batches between now and 2022. The first two aircraft arrived recently.

DND planners estimated the cost would be up to $895.5 million.

The budget office figures it will be higher, running between $1.09 billion and $1.15 billion.

Giroux says the biggest difference between the two estimates relates to upgrading the fighters to Canadian standards.

Even still, he is puzzled by the disagreement. In preparing its estimate, the budget office used figures from the Department of National Defence and publicly available information.

""Why have they underestimated the cost? I wonder myself."" Giroux told reporters after the report was presented.

""Given that they provided us with the basic information we used, I don't see why they would have missed the mark by 22 per cent.""

'The magical trigger of $1 billion'

The answer, he suggested, may involve optics, because programs that slide in just under the $1 billion mark tend to generate less public controversy.

""The estimate we provided crosses the magical trigger of $1 billion life-cycle cost. They may have had an incentive to lower the cost estimate,"" Giroux said.

In a statement, National Defence said its cost was ""extremely close to that of the PBO on the majority of line items,"" but they differed on figures for the upgrade, as well as the notion of whether extra funds — known as a contingency — should be set aside.

The department insisted the cost of improving the Australian jets is still up in the air. ""We are still producing options for these upgrades,"" said the statement.

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan told the House of Commons defence committee that his department has provided the necessary information to the budget office and the public.

He said his department does ""thorough costing.""

Auditor general also challenged figures

Even still, the budget office is not the only one estimating that the program crack the billion-dollar mark.

Last fall, the auditor general also challenged DND's figures.

Michael Ferguson's last report estimated the purchase and operations cost would be roughly $1.02 billion.

Giroux, in his report Thursday, said the cost could go higher.

""The sensitivity analysis conducted within this report shows that prices could further change according to both project timelines and future flying-hour behaviour within the fleet,"" the report said.

The Liberals have long insisted the air force needs extra fighters because it cannot at the moment meet both its NATO and full-alert North American Aerospace Defence Command commitments at the same time.

The used F-18s are considered a stopgap until the federal government purchases 88 new fighters through a competition that has yet to get going.

The Conservative opposition have repeatedly said used fighter jets are a waste of time and money.

""We shouldn't be surprised here, the Liberals have a tradition of buying old used equipment for the Canadian Armed Forces, all for political gain,"" said Conservative critic James Bezan, referring to the 1990s-era purchase of used submarines from the British.

The latest report is not the first time the budget office has challenged National Defence over its fighter jet arithmetic.

Almost eight years ago, the budget office questioned whether the estimated cost of acquiring the F-35 fighter, under the former Conservative government, was low-balled by defence planners.

The report led to the eventual unravelling of the federal government's plan to buy the stealth warplane.",Used Australian fighter jets could cost taxpayers $1.1B: PBO,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/pbo-fighter-jets-1.5036942

The push is coming from public-health advocates and from at least one Liberal MP, Toronto’s Nathaniel Erksine-Smith.

Federal Liberal backbencher Nathaniel Erskine-Smith and public-health advocates are pushing the Trudeau government to immediately provide a safer supply of drugs to address a growing number of opioid-related deaths across the country. ( Colin Perkel / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

“One of my constituents lost her nephew to the opioid crisis because of fentanyl and the lack of a safe supply,” he said. “If we want to save lives, we know that thousands of Canadians are dying because of an unsafe supply. If we want to save lives, we need to make that supply safe.” Public-health experts are also advocating for removing of criminal sanctions for possession of small quantities of opioids to help to reduce stigma in seeking treatment, Erksine-Smith added. British Columbia’s provincial health officer has called for Ottawa to look at ways of supplying safer opioid drugs, saying B.C. and other parts of the country are grappling with a poisonous street-drug supply that is killing people because they can’t tell what’s in the drugs they use.

Article Continued Below

His organization was part of a Canadian coalition that called on the government last fall to address the issue of supply, pointing to toxicology results from across Canada that reveal opioids purchased in the illegal market are often contaminated with fentanyl and its analogues. Those can be much more potent than the opioids users believe they are consuming, and the difference between an ordinary dose and a lethal one is tiny. “When you are in an emergency and the stuff you can get illegally is largely contaminated and may kill you even if you are seeking to be safe, as most people are, then we need to figure out, ‘OK, how do we substitute something safer for you to use instead of what you’re currently purchasing on the street and that is killing too many people,’ “ Elliott said in an interview this week.

The opioid crisis is affecting every community in every province and territory, said NDP health critic Don Davies, adding that Canadians understand that people are losing their lives as a result of “poison street supply.” “Nobody is advocating drug use,” he said. “But as a public-policy response, they recognize that at least if we can control the supply, we can keep people alive and that’s a better public-policy approach than letting them die in the streets or alone in their homes.” Davies said he shares the concern of advocates who recently expressed concern that the federal Liberals won’t want to address the issue in an election year. Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor said she asked her department to explore options to address the toxic supply in the fall, adding she looks forward to seeing advice from Canada’s top public-health doctor Theresa Tam on how to move forward. “When we’ve consulted with many stakeholders, professionals and also individuals that use drugs, they’ve indicated the issue of safe supply is something we should really be looking at,” Petitpas Taylor said. “That’s exactly what we are doing.” In a December interview, Tam told The Canadian Press that said clamping down on the market-driven supply of illicit drugs is not easy. “I think my plea is an escalated, compassionate response,” she said. “To implement a lot of these measures, you need society to be on side.” Tam’s comments came after the Public Health Agency show that 94 per cent of opioid-related deaths in 2019 were classified as “accidental poisonings.” Nearly 72 per cent were unintentional deaths involving highly toxic fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances.",Liberals face pressure to act on safer drug supply amid opioid-related deaths,Thestar.com,https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2019/02/27/liberals-face-pressure-to-act-on-safer-drug-supply-amid-opioid-related-deaths.html
484,Empty,2019-02-25T10:00:00Z,"Don’t expect to see the much-discussed national pharmacare plan in the March budget, writes David Olive.","Universal pharmacare has long been in place widely in Europe. The Liberal-dominated Commons health committee called last year for universal pharmacare, because about 20 per cent of Canadians are uninsured or under-insured for drugs. And roughly one in 10 Canadians goes without prescription drugs because they cannot afford them.

In the spring budget, just over three weeks from now, the Trudeau government will once again pass on the chance to finally give Canadians the universal pharmacare that doctors and a multitude of studies have shown is needed to improve patient outcomes and reduce the country’s prescription-drug bill.

That’s not what the doctor ordered, but it is what the insurance lobby wants. And the Trudeau government will oblige the private insurers, who fear having to compete with universal pharmacare.

Morneau will speak glowingly of how the Trudeau government is “filling the gaps” in our patchwork system of drug spending by government, private drug plans, and the $3.6 billion that Canadians spend out of pocket on prescriptions. Actually, Morneau will add complexity to the patchwork system rather than streamline it.

But in his next budget, which was set last week for March 19 , Finance Minister Bill Morneau will reject that holistic solution. He will instead announce narrowly targeted partial coverage of selected patient groups.

A government that has already broken its promise to balance the books by now understandably blanches at the estimated $20.4 billion annual cost of universal pharmacare. But the country’s total drug bill would actually drop by an annual $4.2 billion, according to the federal budget watchdog, due to volume buying by a single provider.

Putting private-sector insurers ahead of the people doesn’t sound like an effective means of winning a tight election contest in October.

The Alberta election campaign hasn’t officially started yet, and already the man poised to win it has effectively declared war on the rest of the country.

As premier, after a provincial election that must be held by May 31, Jason Kenney will demand that Ottawa sunder the federation by withholding transfer payments from provinces that don’t do Alberta’s bidding (that would be B.C., Quebec and to a lesser extent Ontario) by deep-sixing their misgivings about new heavy-oil pipelines in their backyards.

If those pipelines don’t rapidly materialize, Kenney will hold a nationally divisive Alberta referendum on the equalization-payments system. And he wants Ottawa to debauch the Federal Court of Appeal, which ordered a halt to the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, by using a Constitutional provision to overturn that decision.

At home, Kenney will set Indigenous communities against each other, favouring pro-pipeline communities with subsidies (that sure sounds like a bribe), and withholding the same from pipeline opponents.

He’ll throw Alberta teachers into confusion over elements of the curriculum that strike him as an NDP socialist plot. And he’ll strip farm workers of recently won means of redress for workplace injuries, on the untested theory that a safe farm is an unprofitable one.

Premier Rachel Notley has already blamed Canada for Alberta’s self-inflicted woes. Expect four more years of the same, only ramped up to firebrand level.

But understand that the next spell of Wildrose Country vitriol is coming from a good place. Kenney says he is simply “moving Alberta from an apologetic or defensive posture to an assertive posture.”

Apologetic? We await with interest a list from Kenney of Alberta’s apologies.

No rush, our patience is infinite.

Tariff-bully Trump: First Canada, now Germany

Canada may soon have an ally in Germany in our mutual despair over the U.S. as a threat to our economies.

Germany is bracing for the same 25 per cent tariffs on U.S. auto imports that U.S. President Donald Trump threatened Canada with in pressuring Ottawa for a makeover of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that neither Ottawa nor Canada’s business community much likes.

The looming tariffs on the German auto sector threaten to pitch Europe’s biggest economy into recession.

Recall that Trump justifies America’s continued 25-per-cent tariffs on Canadian steel on the specious grounds that imported Canadian steel girders somehow threaten U.S. national security.

A long-awaited report by Trump’s commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, a former steel baron, is expected to make the same bogus assertion about imports from Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG and BMW AG.

Likely the best way this turns out is a compromise that imposes quotas on German auto imports, but that would be damaging in reducing the revenues of a key German economic sector.

A more productive outcome would be a German commitment to make more vehicles in the U.S. The Germans already do so, of course.

Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said recently she doesn’t understand how the BMWs built in South Carolina are a threat to U.S. national security. She might be wiser to put ironies aside and accurately broadcast Trump’s tariffs as an attack on Europe, given that the German auto sector assembles vehicles and sources parts widely across that continent.

None of this would be an issue, of course, if only Detroit made cars as well as the Germans, who perfected the internal-combustion engine in the 19th century and have never looked back.

A followup on the thread linked to yesterday (hilariously characterized as doxing by some Democrat loyalist): “If it was just this one questioner, we could chalk it up to a mistake, or an acknowledgement that CNN reasonably didn’t believe that an intern needed to disclose her workplace. But this wasn’t just one questioner. There were a bunch of audience members who are far more active in politics than CNN disclosed. Watching the town hall live made it seem as if these were just folks from all walks of life, when in reality many of these supposedly innocuous questioners were political operatives in one way or another, as this thread revealed. CNN called Tara Ebersole a “former biology professor” when her LinkedIn page lists her current job description as “Chair, Baltimore County Democratic Party” since 2016. Further, her husband was part of Hillary Clinton’s leadership council in Baltimore in 2016. Abena McAllister was labeled “an active Democrat,” which is far less descriptive than the Charles County Democratic Central Committee’s description of her as their Chair.” • To erase one party chair may be regarded as a misfortune; to erase two looks like carelessness!

Interestingly, this replicates a controversy within the 2016 Sanders campaign that carried over into the founding of Our Revolution: Whether to emphasize the air war (TV) or the ground war (canvassing). It looks like Sanders has come down on the canvassing side (plus, he now has the strategic weapon of his own media operation, unlike 2016). Since conventional wisdom is that you can’t win California without the air war, 2020 should be not without interest. Harris: “Kamala Harris supports decriminalizing sex work” [The Hill]. “Sen.

“True Confessions of Texas Vote Harvesters” [RealClearPolitics]. “The most prevalent practice of harvesting begins with obtaining voter lists, which are public records. These lists help ballot harvesters identify the elderly and the sick in their communities. The ballot harvesters encourage these neighbors to request mail-in ballots — or may even request them on behalf of unaware voters. Often, a harvester shows up at a voter’s home with an offer of help around the time the ballot arrives in the mail. Sitting with the voter, the harvester might advise who would be the best candidate for a race that most voters are unfamiliar with. Sometimes the harvester will help fill out the ballot. She – since vote harvesters are usually female — might offer to mail the ballot for the voter.” • The numbers seem penny ante, but local elections are often low-turnout and decided by just a few votes.

This is telling evidence that business investment is down which in turn may well betray a downturn in business confidence…. Manufacturing is disproportionately exposed to global demand and the sector’s slump is a convincing reflection of general slowing in foreign economies, something that the Federal Reserve underscored as a key reason for its January downshift to neutral monetary policy.”

MBA Mortgage Applications, week of February 22, 2019: “Lower mortgage rates this year are giving a lift to home buying” [Econoday]. “Based in part on rising mortgage demand, forecasters are looking for a strong 1.0 percent gain for the pending homes index later this morning that would end three straight declines.”

“Pending Home Sales Index, January 2019: “There is hope after all for the housing sector which, before today’s pending home sales report, had been suffering through a nearly uninterrupted series of below consensus results. But not the January pending home sales index which, likely reflecting rising demand tied to lower mortgage rates, surged” [Econoday]. “[T]oday’s report does point at better results ahead.”

International Trade in Goods, December 2018: “The effects of cross-border trade actions have been difficult to pinpoint in the national economic data but outlines may be appearing in goods trade” [Econoday]. “The nation’s goods deficit swelled to a much larger-than-expected [level].”

The AAP notes that downloaded audio (as opposed to physical audiobook formats) has been the format with the most growth since 2013. “This is the third consecutive year that audiobooks saw double-digit growth (+37.1%) and eBook revenue declined (-3.6%),” the AAP report says. The AAP says that in 2017, e-books sales totaled over 1 billion in sales, but the sales in 2018 still fell.” • Completely different mediums.

“Grasslands More Reliable Carbon Sink Than Trees” [UC Davis]. “A study from the University of California, Davis, found that grasslands and rangelands are more resilient carbon sinks than forests in 21st century California. As such, the study indicates they should be given opportunities in the state’s cap-and-and trade market, which is designed to reduce California’s greenhouse gas emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030…. Unlike forests, grasslands sequester most of their carbon underground, while forests store it mostly in woody biomass and leaves. When wildfires cause trees to go up in flames, the burned carbon they formerly stored is released back to the atmosphere. When fire burns grasslands, however, the carbon fixed underground tends to stay in the roots and soil, making them more adaptive to climate change.” • I recall some readers are grassland fans.

That’s why I am so disappointed by the melodrama surrounding the Green New Deal resolution. Meekness in the face of crisis isn’t what America is all about. My concern isn’t with the bad-faith arguments from Republican climate change deniers…. What worries me more are those who believe in climate change but offer no real solutions. From fretful hand-wringing to derisive sniggering to outright dismissal, folks who say climate change is an existential crisis have also cherry-picked or distorted elements of the Green New Deal to reduce the whole idea to pie-in-the-sky fantasy. This undermines the seriousness of the threat, downplays the scale of an adequate response, and sticks us with an untenable status quo.” • Maloney represents NY-18, which Trump won by two points, and his caucus memberships include the horrid No Labels “coalition,” so he wouldn’t be my first pick to write such an Op-Ed. I find this encouraging.

Clarke: “After the whole interaction, we were leaving and I wanted to bring it back to the purpose [of the meeting], and thank her for her time, because I recognize that she’s a busy lady. She said, ‘Thank you and I really want you to have an internship here so you can understand what it’s like and understand all of the nuance and things like that.’… The reason why I would take the internship is because I think it’s an incredible opportunity. To be blunt, you have to learn how to play the game to change it…. And I think that it’s also important to have my voice be in the room [like Elizabeth Warren –lambert]. But I wouldn’t take it for a couple of reasons. No. 1: I don’t know what the internship actually entails. Sometimes high school students just do paperwork, and that’s not what I’m interested in. But mostly it’s because I don’t want my having an internship with her to turn into a justification for the whole situation. It’s already kind of being used like that. People are saying, ‘There was a happy ending, and Senator Feinstein offered a girl an internship and whoopdeedoo.’ And I don’t want me having a position there to be a way to cover up everything that just happened.” • Since today is my day to kick puppies, let me say I’m sure elites are hoping this youth movement ends up just like the last one; we don’t hear much about the Parkland Kids now, do we? On the bright side, I thought Clarke was pretty level-headed.

But, while that is true, the phrase itself betrays a neoliberal obsession with making “business” fit for purpose – a tweak here, a nudge there – as if citizens were merely passive subjects of larger economic forces. We all have an active role to play in shaping the economy. But to do so requires that we first shake off the constraints that neoliberal thinking has placed on the public imagination…. The policies that have resulted from this mindset – defunding or otherwise curtailing public investment, deregulating the economy, and decentralizing democracy – have prevented the US from weaning itself off fossil fuels.” • See, e.g. “Obama takes credit for U.S. oil-and-gas boom: ‘That was me, people'” [Washington Times].

“The ‘Green New Deal’ Out West” [Power]. “California’s cap-and-trade program (a cornerstone of the California carbon reduction program) was extended last year through 2030, with deepened regulatory targets reducing emissions 40% below 1990 levels by 2030…. Based on 2016 GHG reporting, California has already met its 2020 GHG reduction target. From 2001 to 2016, the carbon intensity of California’s economy decreased by 38 percent, while the state gross domestic product grew 41 percent…. More than a decade ago, California initiated the nation’s market-based efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Oregon and Washington are poised to expand that effort, linking carbon credits and offset programs into California and Canada.” • It sounds good (but let’s remember that biosphere collapse is not driven by greenhouse gas alone; the best explanation so far for insect population collapse is habitat destruction). Let’s also remember, as Yves points out today, that cap-and-trade is a trade, i.e., has traders, therefore speculation, therefore volatility.

“State cap-and-trade systems offer evidence that carbon pricing can work” [The Conversation]. “I led a Fletcher School Climate Policy Lab team that reviewed carbon pricing policies in 15 jurisdictions to see how they work in the real world, not just in theory. We found that in all cases carbon pricing seems to be a cost-effective method to cut carbon pollution.” • “Cost effective” makes my spidey sense — my priors, in fact — twitch. “We certainly don’t want preventing the ocean from boiling to be expensive MR SUBLIMINAL Here, have another F-35 .

“Want a Green New Deal? Here’s a better one.” [Washington Post]. The conventional wisdom: “If the market can redirect spending most efficiently, money should not be misallocated on vast new government spending or mandates… Want a Green New Deal? Here’s a better one.” • I ran this link on the 25th, but here it is again, just as a discussion starter. One obvious objection is that since the State structures the market, the state-level cap-and-trade programs we above would not have to account for, say, the Defense Department, an enormous greenhouse gas producer. (Is there a short, pithy word for “greenhouse gas producer”? Other than “cow”? And hopefully pejorative?) One can well imagine a DoD examption being carved out in any Federal cap-and-trade program (which would, presumably, over-ride state programs). The same objection applies to Federal policy decisions driven (presumably) by geopolitical concerns, like Obama’s insane boost to fracking. Price or not price, we should have left it in the ground, surely?

Health Care

UPDATE “House Democrats unveil a sweeping ‘Medicare-for-all’ bill — here’s what’s in it” [CNBC]. “Jayapal highlighted support from various labor unions and public interest groups on Wednesday. She also disputed the notion that House members from ideologically balanced districts would not support the plan. One congressman who won a swing district last year — Rep. Josh Harder of California — appeared with Jayapal to back her plan Wednesday.” • Good for Harder: “Josh Harder [DCCC; e][M]” (from my pre-election worksheet). “e” is for education, so it looks like he’s not a CIA Democrat, at least.

UPDATE “Medicare-for-all: Rep. Pramila Jayapal’s new bill, explained” [Sarah Kliff, Vox]. “Eventually, though, everyone would all end up in the same plan, which includes an especially robust set of benefits…. The plan is also significantly more generous than the single-payer plans run by America’s peer countries. The Canadian health care system, for example, does not cover vision or dental care, prescription drugs, rehabilitative services, or home health services…. What’s more, the Jayapal plan does not require consumers pay any out-of-pocket spending on health aside from prescription drugs. This means there would be no charge when you go to the doctor, no copayments when you visit the emergency room. All those services would be covered fully by the universal Medicare plan. This too is not in line with international single-payer systems, which often require some payment for seeking most services.” • I like Kliff, but wow, liberals really love those co-pays, don’t they? Free at the point of care is essential; complex eligibility systems will always serve as vectors for neoliberal infestations.

Class Warfare

“U.S. Wage Growth Is ‘Higher Than We Think,’ Fed Researchers Say” [Industry Week]. “U.S. workers are experiencing larger wage growth than you’ve been reading in the news. That’s according to a new study by a group of researchers at the Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas and Cleveland. The researchers conclude that average hourly earnings — or AHE —reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics understates real wage growth by ‘a notable amount.'” • “Notable” being, as I read it, between 2.1% and 2.5%. I’ve been waiting for an explanation of why auto loan defaults are increasing; this looks like it.

“Group of New York Lawmakers Calls for Legalization of Prostitution” [NBC News]. “Senators Jessica Ramos, Julia Salazar and Brad Hoylman, as well as Assemblyman Richard Gottfried are working with Decrim NY to introduce a bill to rewrite the state’s penal code to decriminalize sex trades in the state of New York. Decrim NY is a coalition to “decriminalize, decarcerate and destigmatize the sex trade in New York City and state.” In a Daily News op-ed, Ramos and Salazar urged for the end of criminalization of sex work while Gottfried and Hoylman spoke out about the Decrim NY in a series of tweets where they expressed their support.” • Courageous! Does this mean Eliot Spitzer can return to public life? He was certainly a better Attorney General than the flaccid Schneiderman!

News of the Wired

“Postage Stamps from Bhutan That Double as Playable Vinyl Records” [Open Culture]. From 2015, but wow: “[In Bhutan, some] postage stamps… double[d] as playable vinyl records. Created by an American entrepreneur Burt Todd in the early 70s, at the request of the Bhutanese royal family, the “talking stamps” shown above could be stuck on a letter and then later played on a turntable. According to Todd’s 2006 obituary in The New York Times, one stamp “played the Bhutanese national anthem,” and another delivered “a very concise history of Bhutan.” Thanks to WFMU, our favorite independent free form radio station, you can hear clips of talking stamps above and below. Don’t you feel happier already?” • “Happier” becaue Bhutan has made it a goal to increase the Gross National Happiness of its citizens. We could use more little fun things like this.

“Want to Know If Someone Is Manipulating Data?” [MedPage Today]. “Deception of the audience in presenting a clinical trial is based on the same strategy of misdirection that magicians use to make their performances work. Believe it or not, there are dozens of possible forms of misdirection that are possible when presenting the results of a clinical trial…. First and most important is the trick of missingness. The best way to make data look better is to take out data that you do not like or not bother to collect it at all. If the presentation does not account for missing data, all sorts of mischief are possible. Let us say that you have randomized 600 patients in a trial. According to the intention-to-treat principle that governs the integrity of clinical trials, you need to show data on 600 patients. But often, investigators will show you data on 550 patients, having taken 50 patients out of the analysis. Clinical investigators can provide all sorts of reasons why the 50 patients are missing…. The truth: Missingness is never random, and if it is large enough, it is always a source of bias…. When is missingness important? When the amount of missing data is a meaningful proportion of the size of the treatment effect. Example: if the treatment group had 25 fewer deaths than the control group, missing data in 15 patients is meaningful. If the treatment group had 200 fewer deaths than the control group, missing data in five patients is very unlikely to be relevant.” • The data is quicker than the eye…..

“Cross-cultural evidence does not support universal acceleration of puberty in father-absent households” [The Royal Society]. “Father absence in early life has been shown to be associated with accelerated reproductive development in girls. Evolutionary social scientists have proposed several adaptive hypotheses for this finding…. Empirical evidence to support these hypotheses, however, has been derived from WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic) populations…. We find that relationships between father absence and age at puberty are more varied in contexts beyond WEIRD societies, and when relationships beyond the father–daughter dyad are considered. This has implications for our understanding of how early-life environment is linked to life-history strategies, and for our understanding of pathways to adult health outcomes, given that early reproductive development may be linked to negative health outcomes in later life.” • The section on “4. WEIRD populations are weird” is also well worth a read; reminds me of Piltdown Man, “the earliest Englishman.”

Yves Giroux’s report will be a fiscal analysis of the government’s acquisition of the 25 aircraft.

Eighteen of the Australian F-18 aircraft will eventually be flying for the Canadian Forces, while another seven will be used for testing and spare parts.

The Royal Canadian Air Force are using the jets as interim fighters to boost the capability of the current fleet of CF-18s until a new generation aircraft can be bought.

The Royal Canadian Air Force recently received its first two used Australian fighter jets at 4 Wing Cold Lake in Alberta. The first two aircraft were F/A-18A models, which means they are single seat aircraft. The aircraft were flown to Cold Lake, Alberta, from Nellis, Nevada, where they were participating in Exercise RED FLAG. The aircraft will be employed at 3 Wing Bagotville and 4 Wing Cold Lake, according to the RCAF.

Deliveries of the Australian jets will continue at regular intervals for the next three years, and aircraft will be integrated into the CF-18 fleet as modifications are completed, according to the RCAF. The final aircraft are expected to arrive by the end of 2021.

A second group of planes are expected to arrive later this year.

Canada is paying Australia $90 million for the aircraft. The federal government originally estimated the purchase of the Australian jets would cost around $500 million, but the Department of National Defence’s procurement chief, Pat Finn, said that price reflected every aspect of the associated deal, not just the cost of purchasing the jets. Canada is also acquiring extra spare parts, the Australian jets will have to be outfitted with specific Canadian equipment and software and testing will be needed.

The $500-million project estimate also included $50 million in contingency funds to cover any problems and another $35 million for the salaries of all civilian and military personnel involved over the life of the project. An additional $30 million will be spent on new infrastructure over the years needed to accommodate the aircraft.

Those costs add up to $360 million, Finn said. But DND also plans to upgrade its existing fleet of CF-18s with new communications gear and equipment required to meet regulations to operate in civilian airspace, improvements which the Australian jets will also eventually receive at a cost of around $110 million, an amount that brought the original estimate to nearly $500 million.

The Liberal government had planned to buy 18 new Super Hornet fighter jets from U.S. aerospace giant Boeing to augment the Royal Canadian Air Force’s CF-18s until new aircraft can be purchased in the coming years.

But in 2017 Boeing complained to the U.S. Commerce Department that Canadian subsidies for Quebec-based Bombardier allowed it to sell its C-series civilian passenger aircraft in the U.S. at cut-rate prices. As a result, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump enacted a tariff of almost 300 per cent against the Bombardier aircraft sold in the U.S. In retaliation, Canada cancelled the deal to buy the 18 Super Hornets, which would have cost more than US$5 billion.

Instead of buying the new Super Hornets, the Liberals decided to acquire the used Australian jets.",Budget Officer’s analysis of used Australian F-18 deal to be released Thursday,Ottawacitizen.com,https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/defence-watch/budget-officers-analysis-of-used-australian-f-18-deal-to-be-released-thursday

This transcript has been edited for length and clarity. The full interview is available on the podcast.

Katrina Trinko: Joining us today in studio is Gov. Matt Bevin, Republican of Kentucky. So Gov. Bevin, you come to us straight from the White House. Can you tell us about your meeting there?

Gov. Matt Bevin: I will say this. There has never been, in the memory of any governor, and my own as well just over the last four years, any administration that has ever met as much with, discussed as much with, cared about as much, or listened to as much as the president of the United States now. The Trump administration really genuinely cares about what governors are saying. And there’s never been any administration like it.

Trinko: So how do they show that they care about what governors are saying?

Bevin: By asking our opinion on a regular basis. Not only sitting down, going out of their way to proactively reach out. I personally get calls from the president. I’m sure I’m not alone. I know other governors do. He will proactively reach out to ask our input on things, to get our help on things, to ask for our 2 cents worth.

This is somebody that when you reach out to him, he’ll either take the call or will return it in very short order. And not always delegating it off to someone else. He’s very hands-on. So too is the vice president. So too are each of the Cabinet secretaries.

I’ve never seen anything like it. And it’s very helpful to those of us that are responsible for running our respective states.

Trinko: That’s very interesting and definitely not something the media has reported on.

Bevin: Not at all. In fact, he has been so misrepresented with respect to how accessible he is. It’s night and day.

Trinko: So speaking of media coverage, I wanted to talk about the Covington [high school boys attending] the March for Life. The teens were accused in this media uproar of essentially acting like racists. And now one of those teens, Nick Sandmann, is suing The Washington Post. Of course, more video imagery came out that showed they were not being rude to the Native American activist, Nathan Phillips.

So how did that affect the state? … I mean, I remember just watching on Twitter everything and being like, “What is going on? Why are we focused on these high school boys?” What was it like in Kentucky and how do people feel about it?

Bevin: I think the reaction in Kentucky was frankly no different on both sides of the equation than it was everywhere else in America.

But I will say this as to why they focused on these boys. I think we know why … the fact that they were white males, the fact that they were there for a pro-life rally, the fact that they were wearing a hat that was perceived to be in support of this president. For those reasons alone—the fact that they’re Catholic, the fact that they are … fill in the blank.

I mean every single demographic that the media and so many of those on the left would have us believe are triggers for automatic racism were triggered by this young man.

And he did nothing wrong, as you have noted and as all the evidence has shown.

I’m glad that he’s suing. I think I was frustrated by the fact that it took on the life that it did. I kept thinking this will go away because it’s nothing. Once I saw a lot of this video even in the hours after the very first snapshots were released, I was amazed that it was taking on this life of its own. I thought it would die out. It just kept getting more and more frenetic.

This is what happens. Those that preach tolerance to all the rest of us are the most intolerant people. And those that would accuse us of racism are the most racist and bigoted people. And those that would ask us to open and embrace all ideologies have no acceptance of any idea other than those they agree with.

It’s just outrageous to me. And I’m delighted in some measure that it was a private citizen and not someone in government who was attacked this way because he has the recourse of suing. And I hope he is well-remunerated in his efforts.

Trinko: To switch gears a little bit, I wanted to discuss health care. The Heritage Foundation, our parent organization, was actually down in Kentucky last week for some events on health care and they talked about the Health Care Choices Proposal plan. Essentially that plan would make some changes to Obamacare and would give the states more flexibility on how they spend their money. What do you think about that plan and what do you want to do on health care in Kentucky?

Bevin: I love it. I think the idea of turning control of dollars and of decision-making to the local level is the embodiment of the 10th Amendment. Those powers not specifically given to the federal government in our Constitution are the responsibilities of the states and of the people. And this would be a perfect example of that.

There’s no reason why the federal government needs to be controlling these decisions and these dollars. Give it back to the states. Let the states have control. Who better than the states to know what’s in the best interest of their citizens? I love the idea. …

We were the first state in America ever to be given the opportunity to have requirements of either work, or volunteering, or some other engagement in order to receive Medicaid benefits. This would be only for the Medicaid expanded population.

We are pioneering things that have never been done in America or Kentucky … as somebody who grew up well below the poverty level, as somebody who grew up with no access to health care—I was an active-duty Army officer the first time I ever had health care in my life. And I was in my 20s. I appreciate it. I’m empathetic. I know there’s a need there.

And what I want to see is what I know from personal experience to be true. That people who are engaged, people who have opportunity to pursue something but have an expectation that they do it are much more likely to end up with better health outcomes.

At the end of the day, I don’t just want quote, unquote coverage if it doesn’t result in a change in health outcomes. I want a healthier population. And so we’re working on many fronts to engage people in their own health making decisions because they’ll be better off for it.

Trinko: So that’s really interesting because the work requirements for Medicaid has, of course, attracted a lot of criticism from the left. And people are saying, “Well, how dare you make health care dependent upon working?” But you’re saying you understand what it’s like to need or to be in poor straits. So why did you decide to pursue this and what’s your response to liberal critics on this?

Bevin: It’s interesting. The people who criticize this really don’t know what they’re talking about. They really don’t … This, first of all, only applies to able-bodied working-age men and women, people with no dependents.

And it isn’t simply work. They could also volunteer for 20 hours a week. They could be in school for 20 hours a week. They could be in a training program for a job that actually exists in their community for 20 hours a week, which we will get them connected to. They could be taking care of somebody that otherwise the government would be paying for that person to be cared for for 20 hours a week.

We’re simply asking people to be doing something in exchange for something of great value. That liberals are outraged that they would be expected to do something in exchange for health care. But the people that are providing that health care to them have to do that very thing in order to pay for it.

So I’m outraged that somebody thinks someone [should] get it for free when someone exactly like them goes to work to provide it to them and may or may not even have it themselves. So to me, it’s an empty, empty excuse for not expecting more of people.

People are more capable of things than the bigoted left would often believe them to be.

Trinko: Speaking of that, how did your own story make you feel that? Because we hear over and over, people can’t move up in today’s America. It’s too hard. There’s privilege. All of this stuff. People can’t get past it. But obviously you did.

Bevin: I grew up in an unheated house just south of the Canadian border. We had no central heat. I shared a bedroom with my three brothers my whole life. We had no shower. We drove around on $100 rusted out cars. We lived well below the poverty level.

And here’s what I know: The American dream is a real thing. It’s not an anecdote. It’s not a historical thing of the past. It’s not some dream or urban myth. It’s genuine. It has been. It continues to be.

But it’s fragile. And it needs to be preserved. And if a kid like me, growing up in a community in which very few people would’ve ever done what I did—I never even flew in an airplane till I won a trip through 4-H when I was 17 years old.

I mean, for me, the world was a very small and insular one. For many people I grew up with, it stayed that way. But America affords opportunity for people.

I chose to take that opportunity and I’m grateful and blessed to live in America. And I want the same for others …

When people on the left look down on people like I was and assume I don’t have the capacity, the drive, the mental willpower or whatever to do more for myself, it is a level of bigotry that, whether they recognize it or not, assumes that I’m not worthy of being who they are.

And I think it’s insulting. I think it’s wrong. And I think it’s the exact anathema of everything that the American dream has always been.

Trinko: OK. Well, to switch gears again, you talked about foster care in your State of the Commonwealth address. And you said there’s about 9,000, 10,000 kids in Kentucky who are in foster care right now. Tell us why you’re passionate about that issue and how you’re trying to address that.

Bevin: Boy, we could talk for three hours. And I know we don’t have that kind of time. But I am passionate about this for many reasons. My wife and I are blessed to have nine children. We had five of them were born to us, four of whom were adopted. This is near and dear to our hearts. This is driven by a whole lot of personal life experiences.

But at the end of the day, it’s driven by this: We have in America 470,000 kids in the foster care system. Again, between 9,000 and 10,000 in Kentucky.

In Kentucky alone, I’ve got more than 2,500 of those children that are waiting to be adopted that just simply want a forever family. And every kid just wants to be loved. They want a mother and a father. Or at least a mother or a father. Somebody to love them, protect them, advocate for them, defend them. These are all that kids want. Encourage them.

And the greatness of America is that we are so blessed with resources. There’s no reason why we can’t make room for every one of these kids—470,000 kids in a nation of 350 million people or so. What are we talking—1.2, 1.3 percent of the population maybe? Can the 98.7 percent of the rest of us not take care of these kids? I’m pretty confident we can.

So I just would encourage people at every turn to do what you can in your community. Be a foster parent, be an adoptive parent. At the very least, reach out to someone who is. Provide a meal. Provide some clothes your kids have grown out of. Provide a date night for them by saying, “Hey, let your kids hang out at my house for the night.”

There’s any number of ways we can fix this problem in America like that. We just have to be aware of it and we need to be passionate about stepping up. And this includes every governor and every legislature in the United States of America. It’s a badge of shame if we don’t.

Trinko: We’ve seen a lot of extreme abortion legislation recently. New York, of course, passed a law. Virginia, thankfully, did not. New Mexico, I believe, is looking at extreme abortion legislation as well. What do you think is going on and what is Kentucky doing on this issue?

Bevin: I think what you’re seeing is the gild is coming off the lily, the lily of rare, safe, and legal [abortion] that has been foisted upon us … supposedly those supporters of abortion only would want it under the rarest of circumstances. That’s clearly never been their agenda. And it certainly isn’t now. And they’re not even now pretending that it is.

There’s nothing about any of these pieces of legislation that are proposed and/or passed that you just mentioned that are anything about rare, safe, and legal. There’s nothing rare about it. They’re just simply saying essentially abortion on demand. A child could be born and if the parent doesn’t want it to live, they would just leave it there to die.

This is being espoused by people in elected office. It’s being cheered in legislative chambers. It’s sadistic. It’s evil. You can call it anything else you want. It is infanticide. It is morally repugnant. And the idea that as a nation we would not be outraged.

And the argument that, well, it’s not convenient for people or financially feasible for them at this time—that’s the reason to kill this infant child. But how much more feasible, or reasonable, or convenient, or affordable is, say, a 14-year-old child with severe autism? That could also be demanding. Do we just say, “Hey, we did the best we could and we’re just gonna now put this child to sleep”?

We should be offended—the same with euthanasia at any age, including for those who are elderly.

The idea of government not doing its basic function, which is preserving the most vulnerable in society, is remarkable to me.

… Let’s be honest. People like Margaret Sanger, who is a strong proponent of abortion, and was a strong proponent of eugenics, and who was the founder of Planned Parenthood—she was unapologetic in her desire to rid the human population of what she considered to be undesirable people. And they were people who were poor. And they were people who were immigrants. And they were people who were people of color.

And indeed, you look at where these abortion clinics are set up. They are deep inside those communities. And to this day, nearly 100 years later, they are fulfilling her desire to cleanse what she considered to be undesirable people. And those of us who are seeing this should be outraged and stand in the gap. And this is what I’m grateful that states like Kentucky are doing.

Trinko: On another somber note, school safety—you discussed that in your State of the Commonwealth address. What’s Kentucky doing on that issue?

Bevin: We are addressing it. It needs to happen. Not just in Kentucky, but everywhere. It’s crazy to me. And again, we can have a long conversation, but the short version is we have young people increasingly going into school and doing harm to other young people. And this needs to be protected against.

But it’s not just simply a function of putting up barricades, and frisking kids, and having metal detectors. Because that’s what we do in prisons and violence still happens inside of prisons.

The reality is this: It’s a human condition. It’s a function of the heart. It’s a function of the mind. It’s a function of the will of man to either do good or to do evil. And so we’ve got to look at the root causes.

We need to address behavioral issues and behavioral health. And we need to ask ourselves why our young people, why are they so devoid of appreciation for life itself? Why because of our culture of death have we created young people who would take their own lives and that of others? What are the root causes? What can we do to address this?

These are things that have informed our conversations in Kentucky. We are going to strengthen and harden, as the term is sometimes said, our school facilities. But more importantly, we’re drawing attention to the need for resources. To address the fundamental root causes. You’ll never fully be able to encapsulate evil. If people want to do harm, they will. But we need to address this and I’m grateful that our legislature has made this a priority in Kentucky.

Trinko: Last question. For those of us in the Washington, D.C., bubble, it’s easy to not know what people in the heartland are actually thinking and want. I’m sure you talk to a lot of Kentuckians on a daily basis. What is D.C. missing about what the people in your state actually want and care about?

Bevin: For starters, nobody in Kentucky really cares about anything published in The Washington Post. And I mean that not to be pejorative about The Washington Post, but what often creates buzz in this town, and is gossiped about, and rumored about, and discussed is of absolutely no relevance to the people in the rest of America.

So my point being, what do people in the heartland, Kentucky and otherwise, care about? They care about jobs. They care about the physical and the financial security of their families. They care about opportunity for their children.

They do believe in the American dream and they want it to be possible. They don’t resent and reject the idea of upward mobility for themselves and others. They don’t all resent it in others. They actually aspire to it and they want their children to aspire to it. The greatness of America. And I think this is why people don’t understand.

New York is failing non-English speaking students, report finds

New York state is failing to ensure that children and teenagers who come from families who don't speak English as the first language don't fall behind, according to a coalition that advocates for educational opportunities for people of color.

A newly released report from the LEAD coalition, a group of 30 organizations, points out that the state has the nation's second lowest graduation rate among multilingual learners (MLLs) and English Language Learner (ELLs), as well as higher dropout rates and lower rates of proficiency in math and English as compared to the rest of the student population.

In just the last decade, New York's MLL students have grown by almost 20 percent - they now make up 9 percent of the states student population. The roughly 237,000 MLL students in New York are mainly concentrated in New York City, Yonkers and upstate cities such as Syracuse.

A growing proportion of the states MLL student community is older than other students at their grade level, leaving them less time to finish high school by the age of 21.

ELLs continue to be one of the least serviced kids in the city, Rita Rodríguez, project director at Advocates for Children of NY, said Tuesday during a panel hosted by the Hispanic Federation, one of the nations most prominent Latino nonprofits. Both organizations are part of the LEAD Coalition.

Let them return to where they speak the language. Maybe after eight or ten years of study they can learn how to pick bananas. Or coconuts.

I guess spending $20,000 of taxpayer dollars per student per year isn’t enough. These publick skool sewers are ripe for competition, we only need transferable vouchers and/or tax credits so kids and parents have choice.

“Failing non-English speaking students.” Gee, I wonder if there is a solution to this conundrum. I can’t seem to think of one. Maybe the technique that my Dad used would work. He moved with his family to tenements in NYC in 1927 when he was three years old. He got beat up all the time until he learned to speak English. You either became an American or got beat up. Kids learned that lesson very quickly.

To: Oldeconomybuyer

Then make it a requirement to have a green card or citizenship to be fluent in English and make all immigrants sign a pledge to speak English at home. I’m know my English prose is problematic and stilted - a non-native English speaker. But I do OK. My kids speak Hebrew, English, French, and Arabic (and a smattering of Yiddish for the relatives). It’s not that hard.

When we lived in Japan and opted to put my children in the public schools, it was THEIR responsibility to know the local language or, at least, have the ambition to learn it. The only thing the school system did to help was to seat them with a kid who might assist. In kindergarten, my daughter got seated with a Japanese girl whose father had been posted in Hong Kong and the daughter knew a little English. Within four months, they were nearly equal in language ability. By 6th grade, a different daughter (whose FIRST language was, by then, Japanese was seated with a girls whose family had been posted in Houston and spoke English with a perfect Texas twang but needed help from my daughter with Japanese. Yeah, they used those two person desks you see from the one-room schoolhouse days. Yeah, there were up to 40 kids per classroom and, yeah, there was no whining about it being the school's responsibility to ensure they received ultra special treatment on the public dime.

Notley was in Ottawa Thursday giving the Senate her take on Bill C-69, the Impact Assessment Act, which overhauls the way energy projects are assessed for their effects on the environment as well as contributions to the country’s social and economic well-being.

Rachel Notley, Premier of Alberta, arrives to appear as a witness at a Senate Committee on Energy, the Environment and Natural Resources in the Senate of Canada Building in Ottawa on Thursday, Feb. 28, 2019. ( Sean Kilpatrick / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

When Environment Minister Catherine McKenna introduced the legislation a year ago, she said it was designed to attract new investment by giving the industry certainty about the criteria by which their proposed projects would be assessed and set timelines for reviews. Notley says the bill does the opposite. “I will give (the Liberal government) credit for stepping in to buy Trans Mountain, but I also think there is a high level of investor uncertainty that exists right now in the way in which it’s written,” she said in a press conference after the committee meeting.

Article Continued Below

“We cannot allow that uncertainty to continue. You can’t build trust by saying, ‘Trust us.’ You build trust by providing clarity.” Other provincial governments of different political stripes have joined Notley in calls for changes to the bill before it becomes law. On Thursday, the Senate committee studying the bill heard requests from Newfoundland Premier Dwight Ball and Saskatchewan Energy Minister Bronwyn Eyre. Ontario Energy Minister Greg Rickford presented to the Senate’s energy committee earlier this week. Ball agreed with Notley that scrapping C-69 is not the way to go, but asked for amendments to exempt offshore oil exploration. He said the bill will drive capital investments elsewhere, to places where production doesn’t have the same environmental protections as Canada does. Rickford told the committee C-69, as written, would make building new or replacing existing pipelines “impossible” and fears it will impede Ontario’s nuclear energy policies.

The federal government hasn’t yet published a list of project types that would be affected by the legislation. The House of Commons made more than 130 amendments before it landed in the Senate. Tim McMillan, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, told the committee last week the changes from MPs made the bill more complicated and provided less clarity.

Article Continued Below

McMillan said the long, drawn-out legal challenges that have delayed the Trans Mountain pipeline will be the norm if the bill passes as-is. In particular, there is too much discretion given to cabinet to interfere in a project’s approval, he said. McKenna’s spokeswoman Sabrina Kim said in a statement Thursday the government is open to considering additional amendments. She blames the environmental assessment policies of the former Conservatives for the legal challenges delaying energy projects, and said the Liberals are keen to ensure the system protects the environment while still getting Canadian resources to market. Among the amendments Notley wants to see are a hard two-year deadline for the assessment and review process. She noted the proposal to expand Trans Mountain, which would triple an existing pipeline’s capacity between Edmonton and Burnaby, B.C., was first brought forward in 2013 and remains mired in legal battles. Notley also wants most new Alberta energy projects, including in-situ oilsands developments and petrochemical refineries, exempted from the bill because of existing provincial review processes and her government’s climate-change policies. She said the Alberta government has attracted $12 billion in investments for petrochemical and upgrading facilities. “We don’t want to see that caught up in duplicative regimes that scare away investors we’ve worked so hard to attract,” she said. Notley told senators Alberta’s struggle to get its oil to market has become a national unity issue, noting her government forced oil companies in the fall to cut production because of a collapse in oil prices. “Over in the Maritimes they are importing Saudi oil. Here in Ontario you are importing American oil, both at world prices, and meanwhile in Alberta we are cutting production,” she said. “I told (the Senate) very clearly this is not how you build a country.” The proposed Energy East pipeline that would have carried Alberta crude to eastern Canadian refineries was abandoned in 2017 with TransCanada citing market changes and uncertainty created by federal government policies. Notley said if C-69 passes, it will certainly discourage anyone from trying to get that pipeline back underway.",Notley says new energy assessment bill conflicts with purchase of pipeline,Thestar.com,https://www.thestar.com/business/2019/02/28/notley-says-new-energy-assessment-bill-conflicts-with-purchase-of-pipeline.html
490,Empty,2019-02-28T00:09:02Z,"If you were watching Wilson-Raybould’s appearance Wednesday afternoon, that cracking sound you heard was Liberal Party unity breaking up","Jody Wilson-Raybould’s testimony was so much worse than the opposition could have hoped, or the government might have feared. Justin Trudeau has been hoist by his own petard, and it may cost him his job.

Trudeau appointed as justice minister someone who said she is a “truth-teller,” an Indigenous person who said she has witnessed the consequences of the rule of law not being respected.

He appointed her and then he tried to make her complicit in running roughshod over that law.

If she is to be believed — and her testimony was convincing enough that it is likely she had public opinion in her pocket very early on — when she refused to play along he applied, in her words, “inappropriate political pressure.” When she still failed to bend to his will, he removed her from her position as justice minister.

If he thought she would respond to the “veiled threats” levelled against her, he clearly misread this woman.

If you were watching Wilson-Raybould’s appearance Wednesday afternoon, that cracking sound you heard was Liberal Party unity breaking up. The former attorney general remains a member of the Liberal caucus, and a candidate at the next election. But it is a malignant fidelity. Her testimony has done more harm to her party’s chances of re-election than anything achieved by a hapless opposition. It seems hard to see how she can continue to sit as a Liberal member, far less run again.

Her supporters in caucus believe she’s been made to wear a crown of thorns for speaking truth to power; her critics think, Judas-like, she’s betrayed her prime minister by publicly criticizing his conduct on the SNC-Lavalin affair, perhaps going so far as to leak the story to the Globe and Mail.

The consequence of her testimony is that the Liberal brand has been tarnished and Justin Trudeau’s credibility sullied. Trudeau was elected on a promise to do politics differently, but Wilson-Raybould revealed a leader guilty of the same hypocrisy as many of his predecessors — a prime minister who discounted the law in favour of expediency.

With opposition MPs to her left, Liberals to the right, Wilson-Raybould sat on her own Wednesday, clearly in a tenacious mood.

She said that for four months, the prime minister, people in his office, members of the Privy Council Office and staff in the office of finance minister Bill Morneau conducted a “consistent and sustained” effort to intervene politically to secure a deferred prosecution agreement for Montreal-based engineering giant SNC Lavalin.

Kathleen Roussel, the director of public prosecutions, notified Wilson-Raybould as attorney general on September 4 that she was not going to negotiate a DPA with SNC. The then-attorney general started her own study and quickly reached the conclusion that she would support Roussel’s decision.

But in the subsequent days, her staff was approached by senior officials in Morneau’s office and in the PMO, urging a re-think on the basis that SNC might move its head office from Montreal in the middle of the Quebec provincial election.

Wilson-Raybould said it was legitimate to have a discussion about potential job losses but she formed the view as attorney general that she had to leave aside political considerations and that it would be inappropriate for her to intervene in Roussel’s decision.

On September 17 she met with Trudeau to discuss another matter but he immediately raised the SNC case and asked if she could “help out and find a solution.”

She said she explained the law to him, that she had done her own due diligence and that she was not going to intervene.

That recollection does not correspond with Trudeau’s version of events, given his frequent protestations that his attorney general had not raised concerns with him about the handling of the case.

Despite communicating the apolitical nature of the attorney general’s role, Wilson-Raybould said Trudeau continued to press her, saying jobs could be lost in Montreal. “I am an MP in Quebec, the member for Papineau,” she quoted him as saying.

“I was quite taken aback. I asked: ‘Are you politically interfering in my role? I would strongly advise against it.’ He said: ‘No, no, no. I just want to find a solution,’” Wilson-Raybould testified.

If she is to be believed — and it has to be noted she made for an extremely credible witness — even the dimmest of dunces would have been able to conclude this was a woman who was resolute and unyielding once her mind was made up.

Yet the efforts to persuade her to deviate from her chosen course continued.

“There was a barrage of people hounding me and my staff,” she said.

There were efforts to convince her to reach out “informally” to Roussel and to seek an external legal opinion on whether a DPA should be negotiated.

She quoted Mathieu Bouchard, a senior adviser in PMO, as saying: “We can have the best policy in the world, but we need to get re-elected.”

After a meeting with Bouchard and another PMO adviser, Elder Marques, on November 22, she said she again made it clear that a DPA was not going to happen. “I said no, my mind was made up. This was enough.”

On December 18, her chief of staff, Jessica Prince, met with Trudeau’s chief of staff, Katie Telford, and his now former principal secretary, Gerald Butts.

Wilson-Raybould recounted a text exchange between herself and Prince after the meeting.

The chief of staff said the PMO was still pushing for a solution that involved external counsel offering an opinion on whether the attorney general could review Roussel’s decision.

It seems hard to see how she can continue to sit as a Liberal member, far less run again

Prince said that would constitute interference, and quoted Butts as saying that “there is no solution here that does not involve some interference.” Butts resigned last week and categorically denies that he or anyone else in his office pressured Wilson-Raybould. He is unlikely to be the last departure from the prime minister’s inner circle.

Yet, if not pressure, it seems clear arms were being twisted.

Prince quoted Telford as saying: “If Jody is nervous, we can line up some people to write op-eds saying what she is doing is proper.”

The final exchange was the call with Michael Wernick, the clerk of the Privy Council, that was the focus of much of his testimony last week.

Wilson-Raybould said she was determined to end all interference but Wernick said Trudeau remained “quite determined.” Her recollection was of a blunt conversation in which Wernick said: “I think (Trudeau’s) going to find a way to get it done one way or another. He’s in that kind of mood.”

She said the clerk warned her about the potential for a “collision” with the prime minister. But she said she stood by the constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence and told him they were “treading on dangerous ground.”

And so it has proven.

In his testimony, Wernick said that in his view his conversation with Wilson-Raybould was within the boundaries of what was lawful and appropriate — he was merely informing the minister of context.

But if the former justice minister’s testimony is to be believed, the sustained nature of the campaign to make her change her mind — with the hint that there would be consequences if she didn’t — may have crossed the line from information to interference.

An independent arbiter — be it the ethics commissioner, or even a judge — needs to make that deliberation.

But voters will reach their own conclusions long before any judicial proceedings take place. The verdict is likely to be harsh.

Methane-snacking crabs suggest they are adapting to climate change: report

Vancouver Sun ^ | February 26, 2019 | by The Canadian Press

Posted on by Oldeconomybuyer

VICTORIA - Crabs that have a normal diet of a type of plankton have been seen munching on methane-filled bacteria off B.C.s coast in what experts say could be their way of adapting to climate change.

Researchers with Oceans Networks Canada and Oregon State University discovered the snow crabs using other food sources because their main meal may be disappearing with a warmer climate.

The crabs were previously thought to exclusively eat phytoplankton but researchers said in a study published this month in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science that there is first evidence that the commercial species is finding some of its nutrition from other food sources.

Senior scientist at Oceans Networks Canada, an initiative of the University of Victoria, and the studys co-author, Fabio De Leo, said by collecting these specimens researchers can learn how a variety of sea-dwelling species are adapting to ongoing changes linked to climate change.

It was really funny when we first saw this, he said. The crab had accumulation of methane under its body and was sifting through the mud trying to collect the bubbles and they got trapped under its (shell) and then it got a lift off from the sediment.

Climate change models show that as the oceans get warmer there will be less of that food for the crabs.

The crab might be eating more of the methane-filled bacteria and less of the phytoplankton, De Leo said.

De Leo said theres a food-chain connection and it means humans are benefiting from the methane fossil fuel.

Its bubbling out of the sea floor and the crabs are using that and humans are using the crabs as a source of protein.

Well said. We never hear these enviro activists talk about, adapting to “climate change”. I’ve always thought that, if for sake of argument, we accept that climate change is happening, that we will adapt. This is a key reason why Ocasio-Cortez is full of it, to say we have 12 years before we all perish due to global warming. She ignores that we will make changes to adapt to changes, if they do happen. Their premise is that we humans are helpless and will all be destroyed due to the predicted changes. Perhaps this is a crude example, but there have been many ice ages in Earth’s history. And prehistoric man adapted and survived the climatic changes in those time. Certainly we are more advanced and able to adapt than Cro Magnon Man or Neanderthals were to changes they may have encountered. Or does Ocasio-Cortez think we are still on the level of Cro Magnon man?

They could do this all along but evidently “scientists” did not notice it until it became a useful propaganda.

492,Empty,2019-02-28T12:30:34Z,"Joe Chidley: If and when the dust clears in the political storm surrounding SNC Lavalin, the company will still face a lot of challenges","In every crisis, there is opportunity. Or at least that’s what everyone from presidents like JFK to fictional villains like Littlefinger in Game of Thrones would have us all believe.

It certainly sounds good, especially to investors, who might be tempted into contrarian plays simply because they are, well, contrarian. After all, in a world where headlines and twitter feeds drive sentiment, there’s always the possibility the market overshoots one way or the other, presenting a chance to buy low or sell high. Be greedy when others are fearful, fearful when others are greedy. Works for Warren Buffett, right?

Well, it might look like there is just that kind of Buffett moment popping up, in the shape of SNC-Lavalin (TSX:SNC). The Montreal-based engineering company faces corruption and fraud charges that are at the heart of the Ottawa-based Justin Trudeau/Wilson-Raybould scandal now dominating the nation’s political headlines. The stock has been suffering: it ended Wednesday trading at $37.03, way off its 52-week high last spring, when it surpassed $60. Not all of this can be put down to the charges, or to the scandal: earlier this month, the company reported a fourth-quarter 2018 loss of $1.6 billion and slashed its dividend for the first time in decades. SNC-Lavalin shares’ dividend yield is now a paltry 1.1 per cent, even with the stock depressed.

But it’s fair to say the scandal in Ottawa isn’t helping the stock price any, and that’s not likely to change anytime soon. Appearing before the House of Commons justice committee on Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould said that as justice minister and attorney general she faced “consistent and sustained” pressure from the Prime Minister’s Office to stop the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin and instead negotiate a remediation agreement, which would have resulted in some fines.

That seems a pretty clear case of attempted political interference in the decisions of the attorney general, which is apparently a no-no. No doubt much political brouhaha will ensue, for weeks or even months; for SNC-Lavalin, having its name invoked in such a negative frame is unlikely to do much good for investor sentiment.

But if and when the dust clears, then what? The most obvious challenge is the fire under the political smoke: the charges against the company. The court case could be heard sometime this year, but the charges date back to 2015, and the alleged offences date back much further. Four years ago, the RCMP alleged that the company offered bribes of almost $50 million to one or more public officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011, when the African country was ruled by Muammar Gaddafi. (The dictator died in 2011.) The company has pleaded not guilty. It has also pointed out that since the alleged transgressions it has changed its management team and its board, established a “world-class ethics and compliance framework,” and since 2012 has “settled every single matter or accusation brought against us,” as it said in an op-ed published on iPolitics.ca last December.

How that case will turn out — and how long it will take to resolve — is now a matter for the courts. Should the company be convicted, it stands to be barred from Canadian government work, and thousands of jobs, especially in politically important Quebec, could be on the line. The impact on earnings would be less clear. On the upside, Canadian operations are a small part of SNC-Lavalin’s overall revenue — it operates in more than 50 countries — and it could probably make do without them. On the downside, being labelled a pariah in its own country might be a roadblock to contracts in other jurisdictions.

Given the long history of this case already, and the way the Canadian courts and appeals work, either of those outcomes could be years away. But in the meantime, the case highlights how vulnerable SNC-Lavalin and its international operations are to political risk. One element of that is indeed the retroactive and extraterritorial nature of the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act, which seems to have been getting tougher under Trudeau’s Liberal government. The recent allowance for deferred prosecution agreements, which brought the CFPOA into line with U.K. and U.S. practice, isn’t really a sop to corporations: under them, companies might not have to face prosecution, but on the other hand the government does not have to prove its case in court.

As well, Canada no longer exempts under the CFPOA so-called facilitation payments — which are basically payments to low-level officials to grease the wheels of routine government functions — but other jurisdictions, notably the U.S., still do. Not a big deal, maybe, but it could put international Canadian companies like SNC-Lavalin at a disadvantage over the long term.

The other political risk, which has kind of got lost in the Trudeau/Wilson-Raybould kerfuffle, is Canada’s foreign policy, specifically with Saudi Arabia. Frosty relations with the Saudis — which really started getting cold after Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland called for the release of jailed human rights activists in a tweet last summer — were a contributing factor in the company writing down more than $900 billion in oil and gas assets last quarter. For a government that supposedly is doing everything it can to save SNC-Lavalin, the federal Liberals really haven’t been doing it any favours.

As it stands, short of charges getting dropped and the Saudis changing their minds on Canada, there are a few potential backstops to SNC-Lavalin’s slide. One is its ownership stake in the 407 toll highway in Toronto, which is probably worth several billion; the company has said it’s weighing its options for sale. Another would be some kind of white-knight takeover — though at the current share price, long-time shareholders might not realize much of a premium on any offer. As well, there’s the chance of action from Quebec, where Premier Francois Legault has suggested local investors could put together a “blocking” stake in the company to avoid a takeover and the loss of a provincial corporate heavyweight.

We’ll see, of course. But given that the upside and downside risks look pretty fairly balanced right now, investors might want to take a longer look before seizing on the SNC-Lavalin crisis as a Buffett-esque opportunity.",Investors sensing a Warren Buffett moment in SNC Lavalin should look before they leap,Financial Post,https://business.financialpost.com/investing/investors-sensing-a-warren-buffett-moment-in-snc-lavalin-should-look-before-they-leap
493,Empty,2019-02-28T18:25:29Z,"The costing included weapons, upgrades, annual maintenance fees and the fuel that would be needed over the years of flying the aircraft","The purchase of used Australian jets to boost Canada’s current fleet of fighter planes could cost taxpayers more than $1 billion, a figure 22-per-cent higher than the Department of National Defence is claiming, according to a new report from parliament’s financial watchdog.

Parliamentary Budget Officer Yves Giroux examined the cost of buying and upgrading 18 used Australian F-18s and flying them to 2032. His report, released Wednesday, puts the final price tag at between $1.09 billion and $1.15 billion — considerably more than the $895.5 million estimate from DND.

“We considered the entire life-cycle cost, from project management up until the very end of the disposal phase,” Giroux said in an interview with Postmedia. “We didn’t look at whether it was a good deal.”

The PBO’s costing included weapons, upgrades needed for the aircraft, annual maintenance fees and the fuel that would be needed over the years of flying the aircraft.

We didn’t look at whether it was a good deal

The Royal Canadian Air Force is using the jets as interim fighters to boost the capability of the current fleet of CF-18s until the purchase of a new generation of aircraft. The RCAF will fly 18 of the Australian jets and use the other seven for parts and testing.

The RCAF received its first two used Australian fighter jets at 4 Wing Cold Lake in Alta. on Feb. 16. Deliveries of the jets will continue at regular intervals for the next three years, and the aircraft will be integrated into the CF-18 fleet as modifications are completed, according to the RCAF. The last aircraft are expected to arrive by the end of 2021 and fly until 2032.

Giroux said his office used the same figures that DND had but did its own analysis of those cost estimates. “There’s no fundamental reason why we should come up with a different number,” he said. “My only sense is that they voluntary budgeted optimistic numbers. The reason why I don’t know for sure.”

In a statement Wednesday, DND said its cost figures are close to those determined by the Parliamentary Budget Officer. The statement also added that the PBO figures for upgrades of the interim fighter fleet include estimates for CF-18 combat upgrades which the department is still trying to determine. “While we are confident that our methodology is sound, we will continue to work with the PBO, the Auditor General of Canada, and other outside entities as part of our commitment to responsible use of taxpayer dollars,” the statement noted.

The Liberal government had planned to buy 18 new Super Hornet fighter jets from U.S. aerospace giant Boeing to augment the Royal Canadian Air Force’s CF-18s until new modern aircraft could be purchased in the coming years.

But in 2017 Boeing complained to the U.S. Commerce Department that Canadian subsidies for Quebec-based Bombardier allowed it to sell its C-series civilian passenger aircraft in the U.S. at cut-rate prices. As a result, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump enacted a tariff of almost 300 per cent against the Bombardier aircraft sold in the U.S. In retaliation, Canada cancelled the deal to buy the 18 Super Hornets, which would have cost more than US $5 billion.

Instead of buying the new Super Hornets, the Liberals decided to acquire the used Australian jets.

In November 2018 the Auditor General’s office issued a report noting that the purchase of the extra aircraft would not fix the fundamental weaknesses with the CF-18 fleet which is the aircraft’s declining combat capability and a shortage of pilots and maintenance personnel.

“The Australian F/A-18s will need modifications and upgrades to allow them to fly until 2032,” the report said. “These modifications will bring the F/A-18s to the same level as the CF-18s but will not improve the CF-18’s combat capability.”

“In our opinion, purchasing interim aircraft does not bring National Defence closer to consistently meeting the new operational requirement introduced in 2016,” the report added.

The Canadian Forces says it is bringing in new initiatives to boost the numbers of pilots and maintenance staff.

Mr Trudeau, rejecting an opposition call for his resignation, disputed allegations on Wednesday by his former justice minister that government officials inappropriately pressured her to help the a construction firm avoid a corruption trial.

The testimony from Jody Wilson-Raybould threatens to badly damage the Liberals just months ahead of what polls suggest will be a hard-fought election.

In an unusual move, foreign minister Chrystia Freeland appeared on the Canadian Broadcasting Corp to say she fully backed Mr Trudeau. “Of course I support the prime minister 100 percent ... I am very clearly of the view that the prime minister would never apply improper pressure,” she said.

Ms Freeland, one of the most prominent members of the cabinet, is seen by some observers as a possible successor to Mr Trudeau.

In almost four hours of testimony to the House of Commons justice committee on Wednesday, Ms Wilson-Raybould said she had confronted Mr Trudeau over what she said were persistent efforts by officials to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin evade trial on charges of bribing Libyan officials. She said she had made clear she was not prepared to help the company avoid a trial, which is now pending.

Ms Wilson-Raybould was unexpectedly given a less prominent job in January and resigned from the Cabinet this month. She said she was convinced her refusal to give way on the SNC-Lavalin case had prompted her demotion.

Her testimony deepened the worst crisis of Mr Trudeau’s tenure, but one top official said on Thursday there was no talk for now of a leadership challenge. In the Canadian political system party leaders are elected at formal conventions and cannot be deposed by a simple vote of legislators, which means any move to push out Mr Trudeau would be lengthy.

Major employer

Another senior Liberal Party member, however, said there was growing unhappiness among legislators about how Mr Trudeau’s team had handled the SNC-Lavalin matter and said the prime minister needed to replace some of his staff.

“The level of concern over what has happened over the last few hours is unprecedented,” said the Liberal, who requested anonymity.

The Liberals have a majority in the House of Commons and if they all vote with Mr Trudeau they can fend off any votes of confidence.

SNC-Lavalin is a major employer in the province of Quebec, where the Liberals have said they need to pick up seats to stand a chance of retaining a majority government. Liberal officials note media coverage of the affair in Quebec has been generally favourable to the party.

Mr Trudeau addressed the controversy in a televised news conference in Montreal on Thursday, saying, “Canadians expect their government to look for ways to protect jobs, to grow the economy and that’s exactly what we have done ... we’ve also done it in a way that has respected our laws”.

Ms Wilson-Raybould said she did not consider the officials had broken any laws and Mr Trudeau said the police had not contacted anyone in his office.– Reuters",Pressure eases on Canadian PM Trudeau in wake of political scandal,The Irish Times,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/pressure-eases-on-canadian-pm-trudeau-in-wake-of-political-scandal-1.3809905
495,Empty,2019-02-26T23:37:34Z,"The Ontario government began its long-anticipated health-care overhaul Tuesday, tabling legislation to create a super agency and setting the stage for an integrated “patient-centred” system to replace LHINs. “Right now, we are leaving Ontarians behind because…","The Ontario government began its long-anticipated health-care overhaul Tuesday, tabling legislation to create a super agency and setting the stage for an integrated “patient-centred” system to replace LHINs.

“Right now, we are leaving Ontarians behind because we have a system that is disconnected,” said Health Minister Christine Elliott, announcing the biggest provincial health reform in more than a decade.

Elliott sketched a vision of a new health system in which patients no longer have to leave the hospital without knowing when home care is coming, for example, but are part of a connected network focused on patient care.

“For patients in Ottawa, as in other parts of the province, it is going to mean their health care is going to be transformed to be centred around them and making sure their care is connected every step of the way,” she said in an interview.

The transformation of health care in the province will not happen overnight.

It could be three years before the system is in place. Until then, the 14 provincial LHINs, created by the Liberals to regionalize and integrate health care, including Champlain LHIN in Eastern Ontario, will continue functioning.

The foundation of the new system will be Ontario Health Teams, which Elliott described as integrated groups of health providers, including hospitals, primary care providers, home care providers and others, that will be centred around patients. As of Tuesday, dozens of groups had expressed interest in forming networks, she said.

Tuesday’s announcement was greeted with enthusiasm by some local hospital officials.

“I think there are lots of reasons to be optimistic about these collaborations,” said Mary Wilson Trider, who is CEO of both Almonte and Carleton Place hospitals.

A spokesperson for The Ottawa Hospital said it looks forward to working “with all interested partners on this new opportunity.”

And Arnprior Regional Health CEO Eric Hanna has already been talking with provincial officials and other hospitals and health providers about forming an integration group.

Elliott took pains on Tuesday to answer criticisms of the reforms, details of which were leaked by the Ontario NDP government. She emphasized that the system will remain public.

“Our primary objective has always been to strengthen our public health system, and that means paying for your services with your OHIP card,” she said.

Elliott, who had earlier described the health system as “on life support”, praised the province’s health-care providers Tuesday and said the government’s goal was to build on successes.

One of the most frustrating aspects of health care in Ontario, she said, “is that Ontario is home to some of the world’s best doctors, nurses and health-care teams. But we have left them to do their best with a patchwork system simply not built to help them do their jobs.”

The provincial government, which has already come under fire for cutting some French language services, was careful to avoid such criticism when it comes to health reform. The French language health service network will remain in place, said Elliott, news that was welcomed by Dr. Bernard Leduc, CEO of Montfort Hospital.

The super agency created by the legislation will absorb the LHINs, as well as CancerCare Ontario, Health Quality Ontario, eHealth Ontario, Trillium Gift of Life Network, Health Shared Services Ontario and the HealthForce Ontario Marketing and Recruitment Agency.

As part of the revamp, the province says it will establish a single province-wide supply chain management model for the province.

Elliott said there will be 30 to 50 Ontario Health Teams in place, each serving an average of 300,000 people, once the new system is fully working. Requirements for those teams will be released in the coming days, asking for expressions of interest, she said.

The minister recognized that the needs of medically fragile children require special networks of care in the province.

CHEO CEO Alex Munter said that recognizes there should not be “cookie cutter” integration models.

CHEO is already highly integrated, Munter said, and will look at becoming an early adopter of the new integration model.

Tuesday’s announcement, he said, set the stage for discussions about how to form networks and collaborate.

“The expertise to deliver services really resides with providers and health-care organizations, and so I think this notion of integrated teams really acknowledges that.”

The Canadian Union of Public Employees, which represents 80,000 hospital, long-term care and home and community care workers, warns, however, that there could be hospital closings or mergers in the future. The new legislation, CUPE notes, “gives the minister of health extraordinary powers to privatize hospital services or effectively close hospitals by moving services to another facility.”

The devil is in the details, said Colleen Flood, director of uOttawa’s Centre for Health Law, Police and Ethics.

She said the new structure has the potential to shake up the system, but requires it to be “tough” with organizations and providers who have tended to guard their turf in the past, including hospitals and doctors.

“It is potentially a great way to rock the boat a bit here.”

Anthony Dale, who heads the Ontario Hospital Association, said health providers are excited about changes to a system he described as “lethargic, silo-based and micro-managed.”

Still, it is just a piece of the solution, he said.

The question came to a head over the weekend when documents, including a set of talking points, were released to the media. The documents suggested the Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services was trying to control the message given to parents. In one email to staff, a manager in another jurisdiction noted the ministry “has asked us not to stray outside of their messaging.”

The issue boiled over Monday during question period at Queen’s Park.

Lisa MacLeod, the embattled minister of children, community and social services, told the legislature that allegations the program was frozen are “erroneous,” and that if the program had continued under changes introduced by the Liberals, it faced bankruptcy.

NDP leader Andrea Horwath shot back that the province would be be bankrupting families with its new program.

NDP MPP Monique Taylor was ejected from the legislature after accusing the government of “lying” to parents. Ottawa West-Nepean Progressive Conservative MPP Jeremy Roberts, who has a sibling with autism, did not stand up to applaud statements made by Premier Doug Ford and MacLeod, who is the MPP for Nepean. (A spokesman for Robert said he would not comment on the incident.) Ottawa South MPP John Fraser said parents had lost confidence in MacLeod and needed “a fresh set of eyes and ears” on the issue.

Meanwhile, the ministry released a statement saying agencies were instructed last October to bring in only new clients in three priority areas.

“At no point did Minister MacLeod instruct the Ministry of Children, Community and Social services to freeze the wait list,” said the statement. “These families were prioritized for services and supports following changes made to the Ontario Autism Program in January 2018, which placed significant funding pressures on the program budget that could not be supported within the allocated budget. Minister MacLeod secured the necessary investment upon taking office.”

In an interview Monday, Alex Munter, the president and CEO of CHEO, said that as of July 2018, the autism program at CHEO was facing a $8.2 million shortfall in a $25-million program because of the changes introduced in January 2018. As a result of the shortfall, CHEO cut discretionary expenses in the program and imposed a hiring freeze. CHEO also asked the province for more funding. “The shortfall would have had impacted services through CHEO,” Munter said. The autism program is different from the rest of the programs at CHEO, he said. In most other treatment areas, clinicians make decisions. In this program, the government dictates which children get services and how much. The program has been rebooted four times in the past three years and changing criteria has been hard for families, Munter said. But parents who called CHEO would have been told that if their child was not in one of the priority groups they would not be admitted into the program. “The reality is that we were working with a major budget shortage that we were trying to manage,” he said. “I can see why people thought we should have been more public. But we don’t normally start negotiations in a public kind of way. Our first step is to bring it to government.” Munter noted the issue has become a highly polarized, partisan debate. “We’re not going to participate in that.” It is still unclear how much individual families will receive under the new program, known as the “childhood budget,” which is targeted at low and middle-income families. It will depend on how long the child remains in the program. A child who enters the program at age two could receive as much as $140,000, but another child entering the program at seven could only receive as much as $55,000. Many parents are concerned they won’t meet the income test and will get little or nothing.

Sherri Brown, the mother of nine-year-old Quinn, said her son has been on the wait list ever since she moved to Ontario in September 2017 from British Columbia. “Thirty hours a week would change the entire trajectory of his disability. I wish I could afford 30 hours a week. I can’t,” Brown said.

The priority categories set by the province are “cherry-picking” who would receive services, she said. “For our kids, every months makes a difference. To halt a wait list for six months in unconscionable. This is a neurological disorder. Six months is forever.”

Meanwhile, Brown argues that funding for autism should be covered under the province’s Health Ministry, not the Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services. “Three independent medical professionals have indicated that Quinn needs this level of treatment. It’s the gold standard of treatment for children with autism,” she said.

“A three-year wait list wouldn’t fly for children with cancer. But it flies for our children.”

497,Empty,2019-02-25T22:07:09Z,Wilson-Raybould said she still needs the government to waive privilege. She also said the committee should get its own legal advice on what can be discussed,"OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has issued an official cabinet order to allow Jody Wilson-Raybould to publicly testify about the SNC-Lavalin affair.

The cabinet order, called an order-in-council, was published Monday evening, and comes on the same day Wilson-Raybould released a letter saying she needs more clarity on the constraints on her speech before she’ll schedule an appearance at the House of Commons justice committee.

The committee has invited Wilson-Raybould to testify about her version of events about the allegation, published in the Globe and Mail, that she was politically pressured to intervene in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

The order allows Wilson-Raybould and “any persons who directly participated in discussions with her relating to the exercise of her authority under the Director of Public Prosecutions Act respecting the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin” to disclose to the justice committee information about discussions on that subject that are covered by cabinet confidences or solicitor-client privilege.

It also allows those people to disclose the information to the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner, who is also conducting an investigation into the matter.

Cabinet confidence privilege protects information that is the subject of discussion at cabinet meetings or between cabinet ministers. Solicitor-client privilege protects information that is given by the government’s legal advisor.

“However, in order to uphold the integrity of any criminal or civil proceedings, this authorization and waiver does not extend to any information or communications between the former Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions concerning SNC-Lavalin,” the order says.

Trudeau had given a vague promise earlier on Monday that he would allow Wilson-Raybould to publicly testify about “relevant matters.”

Wilson-Raybould’s letter to the justice committee — revealed Monday afternoon — said these issues need more attention before she’ll agree to testify.

“I am anxious to appear at the first available time,” she said in the letter dated Feb. 25. “However, I believe that in advance of my appearance, the Members of the Committee and I should have as much clarity as we can in relation to the possible constraints on the matters about which I may properly testify.”

She said she has taken legal advice, but still needs the government to waive privilege. She also said the committee should get its own legal advice on what can be discussed without violating the Parliamentary convention that it not interfere with ongoing court matters.

“I would prefer not to schedule my appearance before the Committee until we all have whatever clarity we can have about these issues,” she said.

I am anxious to appear at the first available time

Wilson-Raybould said that when she does appear, she would like 30 minutes for an opening statement to give her recollection of events, and then would stay and answer questions for as long as the committee wants.

SNC-Lavalin is facing criminal charges for allegedly bribing public officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011. It has also filed a case in Federal Court that challenges the decision made by federal prosecutors last September to not negotiate a remediation agreement. Remediation agreements see a company admit wrongdoing, pay a fine, and obey other compliance conditions, but avoid a guilty conviction in court.

The political controversy centres on whether Wilson-Raybould, when she was justice minister and attorney general, was pressured by Trudeau or his senior staff to order federal prosecutors to stay the corruption case against SNC-Lavalin and instead pursue a remediation agreement. It is a Canadian constitutional principle that attorneys general must not be pressured politically when acting in their role of overseeing the federal prosecution service.

The Commons justice committee started its study of the matter last week, and heard a fiery defence of the government’s side from Michael Wernick, the Clerk of the Privy Council.

Despite Wilson-Raybould’s concerns about solicitor-client privilege, Wernick told the committee he doesn’t see any privilege around the conversations. “I do not see where the former attorney general was a solicitor,” he said. “The matter was never discussed at cabinet, ever. So she was not giving advice to cabinet. She was not advising the prime minister.”

Wernick predicted that Wilson-Raybould will raise concerns about three meetings, including a phone call he had with her on Dec. 19, 2018 — just weeks before she was shuffled out of the justice minister role.

He told the committee he was confident that all the conversations were “lawful.” Yet he also said that in his conversation with her, he told Wilson-Raybould that “a lot of her colleagues and the prime minister were quite anxious about what they were hearing and reading in the business press about the future of the company.”

The Conservatives sought to turn up the pressure on Trudeau by calling on him to testify at the justice committee. On Monday they introduced a motion that, citing Trudeau’s “alleged direct involvement” in pressuring Wilson-Raybould on the SNC-Lavalin case, called on him to “to appear, testify and answer questions at the (justice committee), under oath, for a televised, two-hour meeting, before Friday, March 15, 2019.”

The Liberals used their majority to defeat the motion on Monday evening by a vote of 155 to 106.

Earlier Monday the justice committee heard testimony from lawyers and law professors with expertise on remediation agreements and the role of attorneys-general in government.

UBC law professor Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, a former judge, said that once prosecutors have reached the “decision point” to proceed with a trial, she is skeptical government officials having any legal basis for raising it with the attorney general.

“There is limited lawful authority for anyone to intervene at that decision point, and going forward,” she told the committee.

Turpel-Lafond said it’s fine for government officials to offer their assistance if the attorney general wants more information, but that’s where the limit lies.

“I think when we get beyond that position of the more passive and respectful approach, and we get into a very rigorous position of saying, ‘I challenge you to take a different position,’ I think we are into very serious issues with the rule of law,” she said.

The agency laid the credit for the drop on a combination of a buoyant economy and the Liberals signature child benefit.

The national statistics office says fewer children are living in poverty and it is connecting the drop to the Liberal government's signature child benefit.

The drops since the Liberals took office in 2015 were also noted in the agency's release: 278,000 fewer children living below the poverty line in 2017 — the first full year of the benefit — compared to 2015 when the Liberals took office.

Statistics Canada said an increase in the value of child benefits, coupled with gains in market income, put more money into the pockets of families in 2017 — which Liberals touted Tuesday as a political and policy victory.

Ryan Remiorz/CP Trudeau reads to children at a library before announcing changes to the Canada Child Benefit on Oct. 27, 2017 in Saint Bruno-de-Montarville, Que.

""It certainly shows a program that is simple for the government to manage, simple for families to receive, and fair for everyone ... is a good thing when it comes to making more Canadians able to make ends meet,'' Social Development Minister Jean-Yves Duclos said in an interview.

The Liberals introduced the income-tested Canada Child Benefit midway through 2016, replacing a previous system of tax credits and the Conservatives' universal child care benefit. The agency calculates that between 2016 and 2017, a couple with children saw their median benefit rise by $1,200, while lone parents received an extra $1,300.

Duclos suggested numbers will drop further, particularly once the Canada Workers Benefit launches next month and expands a wage subsidy introduced under former prime minister Stephen Harper to boost the incomes of the country's working poor.

Duclos was less clear about whether the Liberals would boost the base value of the child benefit or ensure immigration status doesn't affect eligibility as some anti-poverty activists have requested.

Earlier: Canada's child benefit explained. Story continues below.

The Liberals promised in the 2015 election that the child benefit would lift 300,000 children out of poverty compared to 2013 figures, but based on a different measure of poverty than was previously used.

Parsing out the numbers, the Liberals met their projections: a drop of 315,000 in children in poverty in 2017 compared to 2013.

Last year, the Liberals pegged the value of the benefit to inflation — two years before they planned to do so — and promised by 2020 to cut poverty rates by 20 per cent of 2015 figures.

What Statistics Canada reported Tuesday is that there were 826,000 fewer people living in poverty in 2017 compared to 2015 — or just shy of the 20 per cent target.

An expert panel the Liberals turned to for help crafting the poverty plan originally recommended a 25 per cent target for 2020. The Liberals chose 20 per cent, leading some experts to suggest the goal was likely a given based on the measures the government had introduced.

The next part of the plan proposes a drop to 50 per cent of 2015 levels by 2030, which will require thought about how to ""make more of a dent in those who are living in and with extreme poverty,'' Lindsay Tedds, scientific director of fiscal and economic policy at the University of Calgary's school of public policy, said on Twitter.

A bill to set the poverty plan into law has yet to pass the House of Commons, but it doesn't propose any additional spending than what is already promised.

""We picked the indicator, we picked where we want the indicator to be, but there's no plan if we miss that target and there should be,'' said David Macdonald, a senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives.

""That's the point of a poverty reduction plan as opposed to having just a tracking plan, which is presently what it is.''

Freeland, one of the most prominent members of the Cabinet, is seen by some observers as a possible successor to Trudeau.

Andrew Scheer, leader of the official opposition Conservative Party, who on Wednesday called on Trudeau to quit, formally asked the head of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to probe the matter. Scheer said in a letter that it was illegal “to attempt to obstruct or defeat the course of justice.”

Wilson-Raybould, who complained about pressure from Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s then-principal secretary, said she did not consider the officials had broken any laws. Trudeau said the police had not contacted anyone in his office.

Butts, who quit earlier this month while proclaiming his innocence, asked on Thursday to speak to the justice committee to address Wilson-Raybould’s remarks.

One top Liberal official said there was no talk for now of a challenge to Trudeau’s leadership. In the Canadian political system, party leaders are elected at formal conventions and cannot be deposed by a simple vote of legislators, which means any move to push out Trudeau would be lengthy.

Trudeau, rejecting an opposition call for his resignation, disputed allegations on Wednesday by his former justice minister that government officials inappropriately pressured her to help the SNC-Lavalin construction firm avoid a corruption trial.

The testimony from Jody Wilson-Raybould threatens to badly damage the Liberals just months ahead of what polls suggest will be a hard-fought election.

In an unusual move, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland appeared on the Canadian Broadcasting Corp to say she fully backed Trudeau.

“Of course I support the prime minister 100 percent ... I am very clearly of the view that the prime minister would never apply improper pressure,” she said.

Freeland, one of the most prominent members of the Cabinet, is seen by some observers as a possible successor to Trudeau.

Andrew Scheer, leader of the official opposition Conservative Party, who on Wednesday called on Trudeau to quit, formally asked the head of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to probe the matter. Scheer said in a letter that it was illegal “to attempt to obstruct or defeat the course of justice.”

Wilson-Raybould, who complained about pressure from Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s then-principal secretary, said she did not consider the officials had broken any laws. Trudeau said the police had not contacted anyone in his office.

Butts, who quit earlier this month while proclaiming his innocence, asked on Thursday to speak to the justice committee to address Wilson-Raybould’s remarks.

One top Liberal official said there was no talk for now of a challenge to Trudeau’s leadership. In the Canadian political system, party leaders are elected at formal conventions and cannot be deposed by a simple vote of legislators, which means any move to push out Trudeau would be lengthy.

But another senior Liberal Party member said there was growing unhappiness among legislators about how Trudeau’s team had handled the SNC-Lavalin matter and that the prime minister needed to replace some of his staff.

“The level of concern over what has happened over the last few hours is unprecedented,” said the Liberal, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.

503,Empty,2019-02-26T15:00:00Z,Two new books reveal the coalition of far-right nationalists and anti-PC warriors who define the modern political right.,"Why has President Trump gone to such extraordinary lengths to build a wall on the Mexican border?

It’s not just a campaign promise; he made a lot of promises during the campaign that remain unfulfilled. It’s something deeper than that. The wall is a physical embodiment of Trumpism’s core idea: an ethnonational political vision that holds America is the nation-state of native-born white Americans, and that policy should reflect, above all, the interests of this group.

This ethnonationalism is behind the wall and Trump’s overall immigration policy, as well as his approach to racialized issues like civil rights and police violence. It explains his affinity with a host of powerful far-right European parties, like Germany’s Alternative for Deutschland and Italy’s Northern League. But while these ideas have a constituency in Western electorates, they have virtually none among Western intellectuals. Few scholars are interested in turning the scattered political proposals of Trump and the European far right into a coherent political program.

But recently, two new books shed light on what that could look like: Israeli scholar Yoram Hazony’s The Virtue of Nationalism and University of London professor Eric Kaufmann’s Whiteshift. One is a work of political philosophy, and the other a quantitative look at the demography and views of far-right supporters. One is written by an avowed conservative, the other by a self-described liberal. One is poorly reasoned (at best), the other tightly argued.

What the two books have in common is that they go beyond articulating part of the ethnonationalist worldview to actively defending core parts of it. Hazony’s book, widely celebrated in elite conservative circles, is a full-throated defense of the “nationalism” component of ethnonationalism. Kaufmann’s focuses on the “ethno” part, arguing that mainstream politicians need to more openly cater to white concerns about cultural and demographic change if they wish to beat back the far-right tide.

These books are emblematic of two distinct strains of political ideology that together form a new reactionary coalition: conservative nationalism and anti-PC liberalism. The ethnonationalist ideas they articulate are at the heart of modern politics. In the era of Donald Trump and the European far right, politics no longer revolves around classic left-right divisions over policy, but around whether one defends ethnonationalism’s core premises or rejects them.

Nationalism’s scant virtues

The core argument of Yoram Hazony’s The Virtue of Nationalism is what it says on the tin: to defend “nationalism” against its many critics. But while there are many kinds of nationalism, Hazony has a particular one in mind as the ideal. It’s a kind of conservative nationalism rooted in shared tribal identities. The Virtue of Nationalism is an intellectual defense of the spirit of the Trump and European far-right movements.

There’s real demand for intellectual work describing the ideas animating these movements while abstracting them from their baser nativist and racist elements. And indeed, Hazony’s book has become a hit among American conservative thinkers who find Trump personally distasteful. The book jacket features approving blurbs from influential right-wing policy intellectual Yuval Levin, conservative political theorist Patrick Deneen, widely respected writer Reihan Salam, and Ben Shapiro. National Review’s review predicted it will “become a classic”; David Brooks cited it approvingly in the New York Times.

Hazony came to his ideas about nationalism through an international route. Born in Israel, he became involved in the ascendant US conservative movement during his undergraduate study at Princeton in the 1980s. After finishing a PhD in political thought at Rutgers, he moved back to Israel — and was dismayed at the lack of conservative intellectual infrastructure.

Israeli conservatism “has no colleges, no serious think tanks or publishing houses, no newspapers or broadcasting,” he wrote in a 1996 edition of Azure magazine, a periodical he founded. “Nothing like the writings of Smith, Burke, or Hayek has ever been written in Hebrew, or even translated.”

In addition to founding Azure, Hazony set up an academic press and two think tanks that advanced the goal of building an Israeli conservative political culture. Currently, he is president of one of them, the Herzl Institute, devoted to biblical scholarship and Jewish political thought.

The Virtue of Nationalism is both a continuation of this work and an extension of it. It is largely an attempt to universalize the Israeli conservative vision, to argue that nation-states like Israel — countries founded by and for members of specific groups of people — are the best model for political organization around the world.

Hazony’s argument centers on a binary between nationalism and nation-states on the one hand, and imperialism and empires on the other. These are, aside from pure anarchy, the only two kinds of states that exist in Hazony’s writing. He presents a just-so story about how nations arose, arguing that government is the product of smaller groupings of people with a shared history (“tribes,” in Hazony’s language) voluntarily coming together to form a nation. That stands in contrast to empires, which expand beyond one nation, incorporating other tribes by coercion.

The bulk of the scholarly literature says otherwise: The process of nation-building is complex but often non-voluntary and quite bloody. European nations, which Hazony holds up as the historical ideal, didn’t arise out of smaller groups choosing to join together: As historian Mark Koyama shows, European states likely grew strong because tribal identities in Europe were weak, making it easier to consolidate power at higher and more remote levels.

Hazony defends his heterodox view with a lengthy exegesis of the Old Testament. He takes for granted that the biblical account of Jewish history, a story of tribes merging voluntarily, is historically accurate, and then more or less asserts that the biblical account is typical of all nations.

The core philosophical argument he derives from this potted history — that nationalism is morally good because it reflects an organic pre-political order — is wrong. In fact, national identity is plastic, changing and shifting as cultures and the needs of the state change. Take “American” nationalism. It is quite different, and more inclusive, than it was at the nation’s founding. (Hazony, somewhat oddly, argues that the citizens of each American state made up a separate tribe before independence.)

Now, he does admit that America’s boundaries have expanded, arguing that this shows the power of American national identity as an idea, but he fails to understand that this admission undermines his thesis. If the boundaries of the nation can be expanded, why can they not include more and more groups — even groups that now may think of themselves as separate nations?

Hazony’s dubious history also powers some wild empirical predictions. He condemns international organizations as would-be empires, as they seek to bring people of disparate nations together under a broader non-nationalist banner. The European Union is a particular boogeyman of Hazony’s, an “obviously imperial” threat to freedom everywhere.

“Such an imperial order cannot and will not tolerate the existence of independent national states,” he writes. “As it grows stronger, it will work to delegitimize and undermine the independence of all remaining national states, declaring them to be a holdover from a savage and primitive age.”

Since the EU’s expansion in Europe has been voluntary, and it has demonstrated zero interest in forcibly annexing non-European states, this feels a bit like paranoia. It’s especially strange since the EU has a far more limited history of imperialism than actual European states in the pre-EU era — back when they were the purer kind of nation-states Hazony admires so much.

The EU is substantially less imperialist than 18th-century Britain or 19th-century France, and those nations’ conquests arose partly because they were competing for power with rival nation-states. In Hazony’s view, these were aberrations, imperialist deviations from the true values of the nation-state. This is a bit like claiming that the Soviet Union and North Korea tell us nothing about the risks of communism.

To take the point even further, the present-day EU is substantially less imperialist than present-day Israel, which is currently occupying land largely populated by members of the Palestinian nation. Incredibly, Hazony frequently holds up Israel as an example of a non-imperial nation-state without once mentioning Palestinians.

The book makes no systematic effort to prove that historical imperialism had no relationship with nationalism, let alone was constrained by it. It does not seriously engage with the vast historical scholarship suggesting otherwise, nor with the quantitative political science documenting a relationship between nationalist sentiment and war. The Virtue of Nationalism is, in short, less a serious work of political philosophy than a series of specious empirical assertions about the benefits of nationalism justified by conceptual trickery and Bible references.

Only the book’s standing in the conservative movement, and its particularly clear attempt to gentrify the ideologies of Trump and the European far right, makes it worth taking seriously.

The central political argument of the far right on both sides of the Atlantic is that the “nation,” as Hazony would construe it, is under assault from foreign influences, primarily nonwhite migrants who are bringing violence and stealing jobs. At its base, this claim is rooted in ethnonationalism: a sense that the country’s core identity is based on the culture and influence of its white majority, and that this culture and influence are being erased through demographic change. Marine Le Pen, the leader of France’s far-right National Rally, has warned against “savage globalization” infringing on France’s sovereignty, threatening “our existence as a people.”

Hazony seems to see himself codifying this vision into a more systematic framework: In a 2016 essay previewing The Virtue of Nationalism’s core arguments, he called on conservative intellectuals to “give birth to the kind of political theory and historical work that could yield a coherent alternative to the order they are up against.”

The open hostility toward immigrants and cultural change in these politicians’ visions go largely unmentioned in Hazony’s account. But he largely seems to be fine with it. He has argued that Trump’s invocations of nationalism are not racially tinged, and even claimed in a 2018 interview that Trump was articulating his own vision:

[Trump recently] said, “We reject the ideology of globalism and embrace the doctrine of patriotism.” That is substantively the theoretical distinction that my book proposes and seeks to advance. The distinction that I draw between imperialist politics and a nationalist politics, you could call that a distinction between a globalist politics and patriotic politics. I think it’s basically the same idea.

There’s a deep and revealing irony in an Israeli thinker glossing over the anti-Semitic connotations of the word “globalist”: It demonstrates how Hazony has built a politically and intellectually “respectable” apparatus for defending the far-right political vision.

The Virtue of Nationalism defines the nation by components like “shared heritage,” a neat way to privilege the status of native majorities that just so happen to be white. It’s a vocabulary for defending ethnonationalism without owning the “ethno” part, in essence allowing mainstream conservatives to find something to admire in the Trumpian, far-right project.

Whiteshift and white supremacy

Whiteshift, Canadian demographer Eric Kaufmann’s book on the future of white majorities, is in many ways the opposite of The Virtue of Nationalism. Empirically careful where The Virtue of Nationalism is sloppy, conceptually precise where Hazony is loose, the book is in many ways a model of scholarship on right-wing populism.

But the book’s fundamental conclusion — that the only way to defeat the far right is to appease its voters — is both wrong and, as I’ll explain, morally repulsive. Understanding how such a careful analyst ended up here can help explain another kind of modern reactionary movement: the “classical liberals” who wage war on political correctness.

Kaufmann is of Chinese, Latino, and European Jewish descent; he was born in Hong Kong, raised in Tokyo and Vancouver, and currently teaches at the University of London. He is, as he notes in the book, an embodiment of the cosmopolitan ideals so many modern liberals hold dear.

Kaufmann cherishes these ideals too. He describes himself as a “liberal” and a “moderate egalitarian”; he wrote Whiteshift partly as an attempt to grapple with the threat the ethnonationalist right poses to liberal democracy. His goal is to understand the rise of these movements: What is it about the West today that makes it such fertile soil for right-wing extremism?

On this point, Kaufmann is clearsighted where Hazony is not, pinpointing ethnicity and not a more abstract clash over “nationalism” as the root of the current turmoil. “In our more peaceful, post-ideological, demographically turbulent world, migration-led ethnic change is altering the basis of politics from class to ethnicity,” Kaufmann argues.

He provides an ocean of data, from both original research and the broader literature, suggesting that anxiety about demographic change is behind the recent tectonic shifts in Western politics. He carefully works through data on the Brexit vote, the 2016 American election, and rising support for European far-right parties — finding correlations between economic factors and far-right support to be weak and those between demographic threat and far-right support to be strong.

Kaufmann’s research finds, for example, that there is little evidence that poor Americans or those more concerned with inequality were more likely to vote for Trump. But a bevy of tests of cultural values — things like attitudes toward immigrants and the degree to which a voter identifies with a “white” American cultural tradition — were profoundly predictive.

There are some glaring omissions in Kaufmann’s diagnosis. Most notably, he gives short shrift to the vital role of anti-black prejudice and backlash to the Obama presidency in Trump’s rise. But his basic claim, that a root cause of Trump’s and the European far right’s rise is a sense of cultural dislocation on the part of native whites, is persuasive.

Kaufmann believes the solution to this problem is to make whites more comfortable with rising diversity. Part of this, he argues, will come from the inevitable increase in mixed-race populations. The more whites and nonwhites intermarry, the easier it will be to develop a more inclusive definition of “whiteness” that decreases the sense of threat from migration and diversity.

“It’s easier for politics to revolve around class and government competence than ethnicity,” he writes. “I therefore favor Whiteshift: a model in which today’s white majorities evolve seamlessly and gradually into mixed-race majorities that take on white myths and symbols.”

Up to this point, the argument is on relatively solid ground. But it’s when Kaufmann starts to get into specific proposals for his “seamless” shift that things get dicey. Much of his argument centers on relaxing what he calls the “anti-racism norm,” the informal rules that stop mainstream Western political leaders and intellectuals from nakedly appealing to white identity and cultural fears.

“If politics in the West is ever to return to normal rather than becoming more polarized, white interests will need to be discussed,” Kaufmann writes. “Not only is white group self-interest legitimate, but … in an era of unprecedented white demographic decline it is absolutely vital for it to have a democratic outlet.”

This means politicians speaking openly of the need to maintain “white culture” in their societies, and to emphasize the assimilation of migrants into the traditions and national identity that define whiteness. Acting on this means a series of policy proposals that sound like straight-up concessions to the far-right political forces Kaufmann claims to oppose.

He suggests that Western nations should develop a “cultural points system on immigration” that would rank immigrants on things like their “assimilability to existing groups.” He proposes Europe put refugees in “long-term refugee camps” rather than allowing them to move into existing cities and towns, a kind of segregation designed to prevent native whites from freaking out. He advocates creating a form of “second-tier citizenship” for undocumented immigrants currently in the United States, which would “deny them membership in the nation and the right to vote.”

Kaufmann wants to let Trump build a wall on the Mexican border, and even defends the idea of white student groups on US college campuses. “It is unclear to me why no members of a dominant group would be interested in their cultural traditions, ethno-history, and memories,” he muses.

This kind of “why not White History Month?” conclusion forces a reconsideration of Kaufmann’s overall argument: What went wrong that we ended up here? It begins with his strange treatment of the concept of racism and social justice activism.

Chapters seven and eight of Kaufmann’s book are dedicated to attacking the social justice left, blaming their overly censorious definition of “racism” for helping produce the rise of the far right. In these chapters, Kaufmann advances a definition of “racism” as, essentially, personal animus toward nonwhites and “racial discrimination which results in a violation of citizens’ right to equal treatment before the law.” He contrasts this with what he calls the “left-modernist” account, the notion of “structural racism,” which views racism as deeply embedded within systems that ultimately privilege whites over nonwhites.

The problem, as scholars like Harvard’s Lawrence Bobo and Duke’s Eduardo Bonilla-Silva note, is that it is impossible to talk seriously about modern race relations without discussing structural racism. Racial prejudice did not disappear after the American civil rights movement; it simply became less overt. The anti-racism norm prevented people from outright saying, “Black people are inferior,” but it didn’t stop them from perpetuating a social system that privileged whites over nonwhites.

Yet Kaufmann dismisses the very idea of structural racism as pseudoscientific gobbledegook.

“Indicators of structures of white oppression have largely disappeared,” he argues. “Arguments based on critical race theory, history, or income differences do not constitute evidence of a structure of white privilege. Too often proponents make unfalsifiable claims which intimate that white privilege is engraved into the soul of society.”

Kaufmann is mostly talking about research on race in America here — and he is presenting a straw man portrait of it. Even if you only care about quantitative research, as Kaufmann seems to, there are hundreds of studies, often validated by researchers in large meta-studies, documenting “evidence of a structure of white privilege.”

One review of 28 quantitative studies on job applications finds that “whites receive on average 36 percent more callbacks than African Americans, and 24 percent more callbacks than Latinos,” and that levels of discrimination have not changed since 1989.

A literature review on racism in employment, housing, credit, and other markets from scholars at Princeton and Harvard found that “the weight of existing evidence suggests that discrimination does continue to affect the allocation of contemporary opportunities,” and that “our current estimates may in fact understate the degree to which discrimination contributes to the poor social and economic outcomes of minority groups.”

A massive report from the National Institutes of Health found that “racial and ethnic minorities tend to receive a lower quality of healthcare than non-minorities, even when access-related factors, such as patients’ insurance status and income, are controlled.”

The causal mechanisms here are straightforward. Slavery, Jim Crow, and racially discriminatory practices like “redlining” created a society in which African Americans were separated from the white population and shunted into inferior institutions. This was not fixed overnight in the late 20th century; on some metrics, like measures of school segregation, the United States has actually gone backward of late. Nor did white attitudes change overnight; while explicit prejudice toward all groups became less popular, stereotypes about minorities persist and affect the way whites treat minorities.

The result is that it’s still harder on average for minorities to live in safe neighborhoods, attend high-quality schools, or get access to the best health care. White Americans now enjoy systemic privileges purely because they were born white, a brute social fact that is among the most well-documented in all of American social science.

Kaufmann does not engage with the literature in any sustained way. He examines a few individual studies on discrimination, conceding some and nitpicking others, but the sense you’d get from reading Whiteshift’s middle chapters is that “anti-white radicalism” — his term — is a bigger problem in the modern West than actual racial discrimination.

This is vital to Kaufmann’s argument. Because structural racism doesn’t exist, he argues, white identity politics are no different from minority identity politics.

“Expressing a white identity or group self-interest, or an ethno-traditional national identity which includes a white-majority component, isn’t racist,” he writes. “The same holds true for black, Muslim, or other minority interests.”

This equation can only be true if a politics of “white identity” does not require, by its very nature, maintaining a social structure in which whites enjoy privileged and unfair access to social goods. But to defend “white group interests” today in the West is to defend white privilege.

On this point, I’d recommend research by Duke University’s Ashley Jardina. In her forthcoming book White Identity Politics, she presents evidence that Americans who strongly identify with being white do not necessarily express higher levels of animus toward nonwhites. But she cautions against drawing benign conclusion about white identity politics.

One reason, she explains, is that her research found “many whites who identify with their racial group do recognize their privileged status, and yet they express no interest in relinquishing it.” This shows that whiteness is a necessarily exclusivist category — and a politics emphasizing it is necessarily a politics of racism:

Whiteness, by its very nature, is still constructed in opposition to other groups. It exists as an identity by way of drawing boundaries around racial and ethnic groups, asserting who belongs, and who does not. Who is granted privilege and status, and who is not. The power and import of white identity politics makes clear that, as a nation, we have a long way to go toward achieving racial equality.

By failing to acknowledge this, Kaufmann ends up betraying the liberalism he set out to defend. And in doing so, he throws in his lot with Hazony, providing intellectual fuel to the far right’s arguments.

Kaufmann is part of a broader tendency of Western writers and thinkers to view the far right as a reaction to a deeper problem: censorious political correctness and intolerant social justice activists. Jordan Peterson, the Canadian professor who has become a best-selling author and cult intellectual guru, is the Platonic ideal of this kind of advocate. Similar views can be found from those in the so-called “Intellectual Dark Web.”

Whiteshift, which approvingly cites Peterson, reveals the link between the anti–political correctness brigade, which include some self-proclaimed liberals, and Hazony and the nationalist right.

By positioning the left as the problem, disproportionately training rhetorical fire on them, and concluding that condemnations of “structural racism” are unfair, Kaufmann lands on a position that severely downplays the reality of racial oppression. That makes it possible to see whites as a victimized class maligned by social justice warriors, and even swinging all the way around to embracing white ethnonationalism.

Kaufmann may still refuse to support far-right politicians directly, but by advancing their narrative and an ethnonationalist worldview, he is making them more respectable all the same. It’s not the far right that has to change fundamentally, if you accept his arguments — it’s the activists and people of color who are silencing them.

Whiteshift’s clarity about the ultimate implications of anti–political correctness politics is, second to the statistical analyses, its core virtue. The book reveals just how little practical daylight there is between the actual right and the anti-PC warriors. Their arguments may begin with different premises, but they end up at remarkably similar conclusions: the necessity of catering to a politics of white grievance.

Ultimately, this is the battle line along which Western politics will be fought — whether at the ballot box or in the academy. The far right and the anti-PC crusaders represent the energy of a restive white majority, each reacting to challenges from changing demographics and movements for racial equality. It’s a loose ideological coalition, but a coalition nonetheless.

Against them are establishment liberals, social justice activists, the newly resurgent socialist left, and those few conservatives who reject ethnonationalism on principle. These various factions disagree profoundly on a host of issues, but all share a baseline commitment to racial equality. The question for these groups is this: Can they find a way of getting past their differences, and come to something like the emerging right-wing coalition?

The Wall Street Journal on the AT&T and Time Warner Merger

Feb. 26

Someone pass the smelling salts. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday issued another rebuke to the Justice Department in its quest to block the AT&T -Time Warner merger and unanimously affirmed the trial judge’s ruling. As a legal matter this is a stone-cold knockout.

Justice sued to enjoin the merger in November 2017, arguing it would increase the leverage of Time Warner networks in carriage-fee negotiations with other distributors. AT&T, which owns DirecTV, would supposedly suffer less pain if negotiations deadlocked and Time Warner channels went dark since it might lure customers from other distributors. If carriage fees went up, non-AT&T customers might wind up paying more.

We won’t rehash the reams of evidence to the contrary, but suffice to say the government’s theory ignores the competitive nature of fast-evolving media markets, as federal Judge Richard Leon detailed last June. “Generic statements that vertical integration ‘can’” lead to ”‘an unfair advantage over its rivals’ do not come close to answering the question before the Court,” Judge Leon noted in a biting 127-page opinion.

The three-judge appellate panel comprised of two Democratic appointees largely agreed, notwithstanding some nits with Judge Leon’s legal diction. As is its custom, the D.C. Circuit judges reviewed the trial court ruling for “clearly erroneous” misstatement of facts, and they did identify misrepresentations by the government.

For instance, Judge Judith Rodgers noted the government ignored that Turner Broadcasting had “sent letters to approximately 1,000 distributors ‘irrevocably offering’ to engage in ‘baseball style’ arbitration at any time within a seven-year period.” This would prevent an AT&T monopoly over content. The government’s models also did not take into account long-term network contracts, “which would constrain Turner Broadcasting’s ability to raise content prices for distributors,” she wrote.

We repeatedly advised Justice to drop the suit, and the Trump Administration should be glad the D.C. Circuit’s liberals didn’t take up the opportunity to rewrite antitrust law along European lines as some on the left urged. Rather than suffer another humiliation at the Supreme Court, the antitrust cops should drop the case and consider why they lost so thoroughly.

So eager is Mayor de Blasio to destroy the cherished tradition of Central Park carriage horses, he’s doing it the Robert Moses way: bringing in the bulldozers and running roughshod over landmarks laws, not to mention fair play.

The mayor, who failed to outright ban the horses and failed again to move them into a mythical Central Park stable — neither plan could pass City Council muster — has now forced the Department of Transportation to do his bidding through the rule-making process. He’s uprooting the carriage hackline from 59th St., where it been since the Civil War, and putting it inside the park, out of sight from most potential customers.

The move is obviously designed to devastate the little industry and its good union jobs. So carriage operators sued. Manhattan state Supreme Justice Arthur Engoron wrongly denied their initial claim, failing to consider the impact of the banishment on people, not to mention horses.

Rather than wait for a scheduled motion to reargue before the same judge, let alone an appeal to a higher court, the DOT is ripping up historic Belgian block paving stones on a park drive median.

Even more troubling than his legal arrogance is the fact that de Blasio broke city law by altering the protected park without prior approval from the Landmarks Preservation Commission. Nor did he let any of the five Community Boards abutting the park weigh in.

The same guy who used to blast Mayor Bloomberg for tuning out community concerns is wearing bigger blinders now.

The Times-Herald Record on church sexual abuse

Feb. 26

If timing is everything, then the timing could not have been worse for Pope Francis as he prepared for an unprecedented four-day conference of the Catholic Church’s hierarchy to discuss the sexual abuse scandal ravaging the institution.

As the pope prepared for the conference, it was revealed that hundreds of priests in Brooklyn had been named in yet another investigation of cover-up of abuse of young boys. Reports also surfaced of nuns being sexually assaulted by priests. A book was released alleging a secret Vatican coterie of homosexuals who publicly espoused the church’s anti-homosexuality position.

Not surprisingly, expectations were not high when the church leaders met at the Vatican last week. Unfortunately, despite much moving testimony from victims of abuse and strong words from the pope himself on the need for an “all-out battle” against clerical sex abuse, those expectations proved to be accurate.

When the conference concluded, there was still no specific plan to deal with bishops covering up abuse. The Vatican did say it would provide a guidebook for bishops to help them understand their “duties and tasks” on abuse, although that would seem to be obvious after so many revelations of abuse worldwide.

One of the bishops, Cardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago, actually offered his own specific plan to deal with cover-ups, which recommended, among other things, including lay people in investigations of allegations. But the Vatican itself only offered faint hope that the culture of the church would change amid the growing worldwide frustration and anger with the slow pace of concrete action.

Francis, as pope, has the power to specifically hold bishops accountable for cover-ups, but has been reluctant to do so. The sheer number of bishops worldwide makes it a difficult task. Cardinal Cupich’s proposal would give local dioceses the power to conduct investigations and assign accountability.

Francis did say that the Vatican is working to clarify a new church law on accountability and negligence. The bishops again heard calls for ending the all-male power structure of the church, but those calls seemed to fall on traditionally tone-deaf ears.

Indeed, after days of searing, heartfelt testimony and calls for “zero-tolerance” of priests who abuse, many victims were left with the feeling that their pain and frustration were not understood, that, while their words may have been heard, and while some bishops seemed to understand the depth of the problem and the need for action, many others did not and even the pope himself may be misjudging the crisis.

With the scope of the scandal and its long standing within the church now obvious to the world, asking the faithful to be patient while their spiritual leaders search for a better understanding of their responsibilities as they struggle to find answers is simply unacceptable.

More bad timing: As the conference concluded, it was revealed that Australian Cardinal George Pell, Vatican treasurer and close adviser to Pope Francis, was convicted of multiple child sex offenses at a trial last December in Melbourne. He is the highest-ranking Vatican official to be convicted of child sex abuse.

The Catholic Church has been put on notice. It is time for dramatic action, not words.

The Post-Star on a proposed state split

Feb. 24

State Sen. Daphne Jordan, a Republican from Halfmoon, is offering hope to all her constituents who have dreamed of coming from their own state of Upstate and leaving all that downstate glitz behind.

Who needs an ocean coastline anyway? Let those city slickers have the beaches and the ports. We’ve got Mount Marcy! We’ve got the Canadian border!

Jordan has introduced a bill to create a working group that would study splitting the state in two — the good part, with great stuff like Michigans and jack wax; and that other part where people heap sauerkraut on their hot dogs instead of sweet spoonfuls of meat sauce.

But seriously, if Jordan’s little act of political grandstanding ever resulted in an actual split — and there is zero chance of that happening — it would bankrupt upstate.

New York City has the largest municipal and regional economy in the country, and upstate benefits from that in many ways — most directly from state funding. Although you often hear complaints around here about the city receiving more than its share, the truth is the New York City area contributes significantly more in taxes than it gets back in state funds. That means if the state were split, our area would immediately be in even worse financial shape than it is now.

And when it comes to culture, don’t we have the best of both worlds here in New York? It’s the union of Big Apple and apple orchards that makes this New York one of the world’s great places.

New York City is a national and international center for art, fashion and finance; home of Broadway, the United Nations and the Metropolitan Museum of Art; a tourist draw for millions of visitors every year and the financial engine of the world’s richest country.

All of that downstate greatness doesn’t matter to Jordan, however.

What matters to her is that those people in the state’s southern regions — New York City’s boroughs, Long Island and Rockland and Westchester counties — are different. Essentially, they’re Democrats.

Of course, they’re not all Democrats; many of them are Republicans, but never mind. Jordan is fixated on the differences between New Yorkers. She calls it a “tale of two states,” but it’s really a tale of two outlooks.

You can see New York as divided, because part of it is a densely populated urban area and part of it is a more sparsely populated rural area; or you can see it as outstanding, because it contains one of the world’s most dynamic cities and one of its most awe-inspiring wilderness areas and a whole lot else besides.

We have the skyscraping buildings and the cloud-wreathed mountains; broad beaches pounded by surf and remote lakes that lie still and frozen for half the year.

We’ve got the Statue of Liberty and Niagara Falls! Fort Ticonderoga and the Brooklyn Bridge! Wine and cheese! Oysters and cows!

For a state to be split, its Legislature and the U.S. Congress must approve the measure. The last time that happened was in 1863, when West Virginia was split off from Virginia. Numerous state-splitting efforts have been pushed since then, including multiple efforts in New York, but none has gotten close to approval.

It’s not a new idea, and it’s not a good idea. We wish Daphne Jordan would find something more constructive to do with her time, like promoting all the wonderful aspects of upstate that contribute to making New York great.

The Leader-Herald on special counsel Robert Mueller’s report

Feb. 26

After nearly two years of work, special counsel Robert Mueller is nearly ready to release his report on whether some Americans cooperated with the Russian government to influence the 2016 election.

It already is known that Moscow devoted resources to both a social media-based propaganda campaign and to a mostly futile attempt to hack U.S. electronic election systems. The social media attack continues and, with the unwitting help of many Americans, has driven a wedge between tens of millions of us.

Mueller and his staff already have charged several former associates of President Donald Trump with improper activities, many not related to the 2016 election. The question now is what Mueller’s report will say about Trump himself, who insists he never cooperated with the Russians in any way.

Democrats in Congress, many of whom have proclaimed that somehow, some way, they will impeach the president have been hoping for months that the Mueller report would provide them with ammunition.

There are reasons to doubt it will do so.

But a few of the Democrat lawmakers have seized upon a traditional practice of all federal prosecutors in an attempt to score political points and sow public discontent.

They say that unless the Mueller report is released in its entirety, along with pertinent documents, they will use a House of Representatives committee to subpoena the materials.

In summing up their investigations of all types of alleged crimes, prosecutors at all levels tend to discuss evidence against only those they believe have broken the law. That is a longstanding practice.

So, if Mueller and his staff have investigated Trump thoroughly — as they have — and found no evidence of wrongdoing, it is entirely possible the president will be mentioned only in passing in the report.

That is not what Trump’s foes in Congress want, of course. They desire something — anything — they can use against the president, whether he is guilty of a crime or not.

Mueller and his superiors in the Justice Department should let the chips fall where they may. If Trump engaged in wrongdoing, the American people deserve to know about it.

But if he did not, Mueller and the Justice Department should refuse to be part of a political vendetta.

With milky bluish eyes and luxurious dark gray fur, this kitty looks like a plush toy. Merlin rose to internet fame thanks to his human parents Nathanial Green and Elliot Green, two visual artists that curated a visually stunning Instagram page dedicated to their beautiful pet, which has amassed 28k followers.

More Info: Instagram | Twitter | Website

The Greens first laid eyes on Merlin in 2017 at the Lynchburg Humane Society on their “Free Cat Friday.” And while it was love at first sight, Elliot admitted to Bored Panda Merlin hadn’t been his first choice. “It actually was my coworker that convinced me to go in–she had just adopted a beautiful kitten from there. Browsing through the site, Nathanial and I had our hearts set on a Siamese kitten, but by the time I got off work, they were all either on hold or already adopted.”

Not to be discouraged the couple continued their search. “The lady who had shown us around eventually noticed us indecisively meandering; she stopped to tell us that she had a favorite, but that he had some issues and was sick. She took us to the medical wing to show us this little kitten who was recovering from a head cold. When I was first told that he was blind, I was a bit worried. As a full-time student also working two jobs, I was afraid that I wouldn’t be able to provide Merlin with the attention he needed. As soon as I got to hold him, I think it was pretty obvious that he was perfect.”

The Greens couldn’t be happier that they found Merlin, “He’s an affectionate cat that loves being acknowledged and held. He’s never destructive or petty, either,” said Elliot, “Because he was born blind, he really has no concept of fear and so he’ll attempt to jump off of pretty high places. He doesn’t hide or avoid people–he’ll run up to the door to meet us and climb all over guests sitting on the couch. His preferred place is on someone’s lap.”

That’s right this loving ball of fur can’t get enough of his human dads. “Anytime we sit on the couch or the bed, he jumps up and is ready to be cuddled. He loves having his face and ears scratched; we aren’t quite sure why, but he loves having the areas around his eyes massaged. If someone puts their hands up to his eyes or nose, he’ll usually awkwardly press into it as if he’s trying to push them away, but it’s his way of feeling loved,” said his other dad Nathanial

Image credits: merlin.griffith

Looking at Merlin you can’t help but notice his unique features, that’s because he is a rare mixed breed of a Munchkin and a Persian cat, called a Napoleon. “It’s a pretty new breed–by new I mean 20 to 22 years,” explained his owner, “Napoleons are pretty small, but they’re able to move around as easily as normal sized cats. For the most part, they inherit the Persian’s physical characteristics.”

Image credits: merlin.griffith

Image credits: nathanialtgreen

Merlin’s milky white-walker style eyes, however, are not a characteristic of his breed but due to his blindness. But even with his poor vision, his dad said this handsome guy still lives a full life. “Honestly, we forget that he has trouble seeing. When we first moved to our apartment, he definitely had trouble navigating, but he learns quickly and really knows how to own the space. His greatest recurring struggle is from our coffee table’s glass edges: Every now and then, he’ll jump or walk into it, but we think he’s learned. All he really cares about is where the food is and how far away it is from his dads.”

Image credits: merlin.griffith

While his blindness hasn’t been an issue, Merlin did suffer from some other health issues, “For a while, he was having seizures, and we really couldn’t figure out why,” recalled Elliot, “Through some research and trying out alternatives, we learned that his food was causing it. We removed wheat from his diet, and he’s been perfectly content since then.”

Meet the Greens: “@nathanialtgreen (left) was born in Michigan and is an insanely talented keyboardist, designer, and communications specialist. He loves chicken and waffles and syrup on almost everything. Often times can be found reading about politics. @elliotgreen.co (right) is an art director, branding specialist, and photographer from Istanbul, Turkey. Lover of olive oil and Daniela Andrade. Often can be found admiring typefaces at target. Both met at Liberty University and eventually made their way to Nashville, TN. they got married last September and spend most of their time hanging out at Baja Burrito or 51st Deli!”

Image credits: merlin.griffith

As a snuggly, social kitty, Merlin loves all living things, but sadly the feeling is not always mutual, “We’ve also learned–the hard way–that he’s easily dominated by other animals. Cats, in particular, tend to bully him. He never fights back, but we have seen him hiss a time or two. We have to keep a close eye on him around other animals. Other than that, he really is perfect!”

“Merlin loves watermelon, and since it’s Elliot’s favorite food, he gets it often”

Image credits: merlin.griffith

It’s easy to see why Merlin has become an internet sensation, but the Greens say it was never their intention. “We just started accumulating a lot of pictures on our phones and decided to share them with the world. It wasn’t an account we were regularly posting on, but when we did we made sure that it looked good. Honestly, Elliot was proud of the way his apartment looked at the time and thought Merlin was a good subject to help show it off,” said Nathanial.

Still, the response has been surprising, “Yea! Friends keep telling us that they see Merlin’s pictures all over–it’s just mind-blowing.”

This family couldn’t be more grateful for finding this little ball of joy and say they owe it all to shelters like the Lynchburg Humane Society, “We’re grateful for animal shelters and the selfless, essential work they continue to do.”

506,Empty,2019-02-28T23:42:43Z,Jhonattan Vegas shot a bogey-free 6-under 64 to take a two-stroke lead after the first round of The Honda Classic,"PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — A year ago at The Honda Classic, Jhonattan Vegas made seven birdies all week.

He’s off to a much better start this time.

Vegas made six birdies and no bogeys Thursday, shooting a 6-under 64 to open a two-stroke lead after the first round. Lucas Glover bogeyed his finishing hole for a 66, leaving him tied with Zach Johnson, Ernie Els and Ben Silverman — who went to college at nearby Florida Atlantic.

“Hit my irons the best I’ve hit them all year and I’ve always liked this golf course,” Vegas said. “It’s kind of one of those courses that I think suits me. You have to hit the ball well and you have to get around really well. And then I made a few putts.”

Brooks Koepka, Rickie Fowler and Sergio Garcia were in a large group at 67, and defending champion Justin Thomas shot 68 after an eventful day that saw him play the last eight holes without a 9-iron after it bent when he hit it against a tree.

“To feel like I gave quite a few back today and shoot 2-under par on this golf course, it’s great,” Thomas said.

Also at 68 was Sam Saunders, the grandson of golf legend Arnold Palmer. Saunders birdied all three holes in the famed “Bear Trap” stretch at PGA National, the run of holes 15 through 17 where a par 4 is sandwiched by a pair of par 3s that can be treacherous even without much wind.

Vegas made 12 bogeys last year at the Honda, along with three doubles and a triple, wound up beating only one of the 74 finishers and wrapped up the week with a final-round 78. He sprayed irons everywhere, missed half of the fairways, more than half of the greens.

But Thursday, he was dialed in — missing only three of 14 fairways and three of the 18 greens, needing only 29 putts to get through the day.

“I felt like I was in control pretty much all day long,” Vegas said.

The 34-year-old Venezuelan has three PGA Tour victories, winning the 2011 Bob Hope Classic and the RBC Canadian Open in 2016 and 2017.

Vegas took advantage on a day to make noise at PGA National, where the wind was down. And that’s not typical.

Forecasters correctly said breezes would be relatively light all day and should stay that way until perhaps the weekend, though Johnson — whose weather apps said breezes were going to be no more than 3 or 4 mph — was among those who felt the wind was still a factor and fluctuated more than expected.

“We had a stretch there on the front nine where it was a lot more than that,” Johnson said. “The ball curving with the wind, depending on the direction, easily 10 to 15 to 20 yards. And then we made the turn and it started to be more consistent, not as gusty. … It was not Honda wind. I don’t think we’re going to get Honda wind until Sunday.”

Els had no complaints.

Els has won more than 70 tournaments worldwide, 19 of them on the PGA Tour — the last of those coming in 2012 at the British Open. Getting a 20th on tour, he said, has been a goal for some time.

“Secretly on tour among the players, you know when you win No. 20 you get some benefits,” Els said. “It’s late in my career, but I’ll take any win now.”

Thomas sizzled at the start with three birdies in his first four holes, and made the turn at 4-under.

That’s when his day got eventful.

His drive ended up behind a tree on the 10th, and he figured that his 9-iron would snap on the follow-through of his approach shot. It merely bent instead, and the jolt of the impact meant Thomas was going to be spending some time Thursday night with an icepack on his wrist. He doesn’t believe it’ll impact him Friday.

“Just more of a shock than anything,” Thomas said.

Thomas then found his way into and out of trouble on the Bear Trap — making double-bogey, then having a par putt slide past the hole on 16, and making birdie on 17. He then birdied the last as well.

Garcia also finished strong, with three birdies in his last four holes.

“It’s a great round, at the end of the day,” Garcia said.

DIVOTS: Fowler went into the water twice and wound up making a triple-bogey on the par-4 sixth, his nemesis hole at PGA National.

Vegas hit the ball with metronomic efficiency to card six-under-par 64 at PGA National in Palm Beach Gardens.

Yet the big talking point in the lead-up to the first round was the absence of most of the game's biggest names from the tournament.

Only three among the top 20 in the world rankings are present - Justin Thomas, Brooks Koepka and Rickie Fowler - making it the weakest field in more than a decade.

Tiger Woods, Dustin Johnson and Rory McIlroy are among those sitting out the event, even though they all live locally.

A number of big events both before and after the Honda Classic has left the longest title sponsor on the PGA Tour facing a problem not of its own making.

Honda began sponsoring the south Florida tournament in 1982 but this year, it comes coming directly after the WGC-Mexico Championship and only two weeks ahead of the Players Championship.

The Players, the most prestigious event outside the four majors, has switched from May to March, while the PGA Championship has moved from August to May.

The tour season will finish in late August, instead of late September.

The scheduling, however, appeared of little concern to Vegas who notched six birdies in benign morning conditions on Thursday.

""I was able to drive... really well today, hit my irons incredibly well,"" said the 34-year-old from Venezuela.

""I only missed three greens and of those I left two within 15 feet of the hole.

""Hitting those irons well to some of these tough pins makes the day a little bit easier. Wind wasn't that hard so you could be a little more aggressive than usual.""

Vegas, ranked 131st in the world, is a three-times PGA Tour winner.

He led by two strokes from South African Ernie Els, American Zach Johnson and Canadian Ben Silverman with half the field back in the clubhouse.

Vegas took advantage on a day to make noise at PGA National, where the wind was down. And that's not typical.

Forecasters correctly said breezes would be relatively light all day and should stay that way until perhaps the weekend, though Johnson -- whose weather apps said breezes were going to be no more than 3 or 4 mph -- was among those who felt the wind was still a factor and fluctuated more than expected.

""We had a stretch there on the front nine where it was a lot more than that,"" Johnson said. ""The ball curving with the wind, depending on the direction, easily 10 to 15 to 20 yards. And then we made the turn and it started to be more consistent, not as gusty. ... It was not Honda wind. I don't think we're going to get Honda wind until Sunday.""

Els had no complaints.

Els has won more than 70 tournaments worldwide, 19 of them on the PGA Tour -- the last of those coming in 2012 at the British Open. Getting a 20th on tour, he said, has been a goal for some time.

""Secretly on tour among the players, you know when you win No. 20 you get some benefits,"" Els said. ""It's late in my career, but I'll take any win now.""

Thomas sizzled at the start with three birdies in his first four holes, and made the turn at 4 under.

That's when his day got eventful.

His drive ended up behind a tree on the 10th, and he figured that his 9-iron would snap on the follow-through of his approach shot. It merely bent instead, and the jolt of the impact meant Thomas was going to be spending some time Thursday night with an icepack on his wrist. He doesn't believe it'll impact him Friday.

""Just more of a shock than anything,"" Thomas said.

Thomas then found his way into and out of trouble on the Bear Trap -- making double-bogey, then having a par putt slide past the hole on 16, and making birdie on 17. He then birdied the last as well.

Garcia also finished strong, with three birdies in his last four holes.

""It's a great round, at the end of the day,"" Garcia said.

Fowler went into the water twice and wound up making a triple-bogey on the par-4 sixth, his nemesis hole at PGA National. In his past four rounds at the Honda, he's 7 over on that hole.

Alex Cejka was disqualified for using an improper greens-reading device, officials said. He withdrew from last year's tournament and missed the cut in 2017.

Cody Gribble had an interesting day -- making quadruple-bogey on No. 6, triple-bogey on the par-4 11th, and then eagle on the par-5 18th. He shot a 77.",Vegas shoots 64 to take lead at Honda Classic,Espn.com,http://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/26106833/vegas-shoots-64-take-lead-honda-classic

Vegas hit the ball with metronomic efficiency to card six-under-par 64 at PGA National in Palm Beach Gardens.

Yet the big talking point in the lead-up to the first round was the absence of most of the game's biggest names from the tournament.

Scroll to continue with content Ad

Only three among the top 20 in the world rankings are present -- Justin Thomas, Brooks Koepka and Rickie Fowler -- making it the weakest field in more than a decade.

Tiger Woods, Dustin Johnson and Rory McIlroy are among those sitting out the event, even though they all live locally.

A number of big events both before and after the Honda Classic has left the longest title sponsor on the PGA Tour facing a problem not of its own making.

Honda began sponsoring the south Florida tournament in 1982 but this year, it comes coming directly after the WGC-Mexico Championship and only two weeks ahead of the Players Championship.

The Players, the most prestigious event outside the four majors, has switched from May to March, while the PGA Championship has moved from August to May.

The tour season will finish in late August, instead of late September.

The scheduling, however, appeared of little concern to Vegas who notched six birdies in benign morning conditions on Thursday.

""I was able to drive... really well today, hit my irons incredibly well,"" said the 34-year-old from Venezuela.

""I only missed three greens and of those I left two within 15 feet of the hole.

""Hitting those irons well to some of these tough pins makes the day a little bit easier. Wind wasn't that hard so you could be a little more aggressive than usual.""

511,Empty,2019-02-27T19:00:08Z,"“Just looking at that journey, it’s really kind of insane.”","Photo: HBO

In the book Poking a Dead Frog, Adam McKay talks about the types of characters he and Will Ferrell have been most often drawn to over the last 20 years: “They have no skills whatsoever, yet they’re completely entitled. Will and I are endlessly fascinated by this cockiness; it’s all just completely unearned. It’s not connected to any reality whatsoever. It’s free-floating. They’re not getting anywhere. They’re stuck and impotent. I find this to be one of the most fascinating things about America right now.”

It makes sense then why the comedy duo was immediately drawn to Fred Simmons, the overconfident Tae Kwon Do instructor played by Danny McBride in 2006’s Foot Fist Way, a self-made movie by college friends and film majors McBride, Jody Hill, and Ben Best.

McKay and Ferrell wanted to help the trio get their next project into production, and three years later the world met Kenny Powers, the brash relief pitcher turned gym teacher who was the central focus of Eastbound & Down.

February marked the ten-year anniversary of Eastbound’s debut, and while Powers was certainly a version of that unearned, Ferrell-esque American bravado, they found an unexpected better half to Powers. Many actors auditioned for the role of Stevie Janowski, a fellow teacher who becomes enamored with Powers in the pilot episode, but they also weren’t sure what to make of the character quite yet, and nobody who came in had inspired them enough to move forward. Then Steve Little, a former main company member at the Groundlings whose most extensive television work at that point had been as a voice on the Cartoon Network’s Camp Lazlo, came in and defined the character in a big way. Little’s presence was so key that Stevie would turn into much more than the small, two-scene role the pilot afforded him. He grew into something that would become as vital to the success of Eastbound as Powers would be.

“It was just those two scenes,” says Little, who figured that if they knew Stevie was going to be this important to the show, he would have had to audition a third time. “Then when we shot the pilot and Danny said, ‘You’re our secret weapon.’” In fact, Little says that Hill told him that they actually forgot to put a wedding ring on him in the pilot and that Stevie was supposed to have been married. “If they had made that choice, then everything would have changed. They had some story lines, like I was going to be in a Christian rock band, but it turned out differently.”

McBride once referred to Stevie as “a filthy, disgusting Don Knotts.” Seeing the pair play off of each other for four seasons — with the benefit of being on HBO, where Stevie can say things like “My dick’s all pruney from being up in that sweet punnany,” and give us moments like him shooting off his prosthetic chin or having Ferrell play a car-dealership owner-slash-racist plantation owner who sexually assaults Stevie while he’s dressed as a geisha — made Eastbound a unique addition to TV history. It’s been five years since the series finale, and Eastbound still projects an air of confidence in the bold choices it made; it feels as dangerous a comedy today as it was from 2009–2013. To mark the anniversary, we asked Little to walk us through his five favorite episodes of Eastbound & Down and the memories that came with doing pretty much any insane thing that was asked of him.

“Chapter 6” (Season 1, Episode 6)

Photo: HBO

In its simplest terms, the premise for Eastbound and its pilot episode would seem clear: An overly abrasive and vulgar former World Series hero washes out of Major League Baseball and must go back to his hometown to take a job as a P.E. teacher. But over the course of its first season, and culminating in the finale with a cliffhanger of an ending, it became clear that Eastbound was anything but predictable. “This show is a show about a guy who is teaching high school, but then it just becomes not that at all,” says Little. By the end of season one, Little’s character Stevie, a fellow teacher at the school, is revealed to be a guy who would do anything to be Kenny’s friend, including quitting his job to join him on his journey back to the big leagues — which Kenny reneges on, leaving Stevie jobless. Still, this does not deter Stevie from showing his allegiance by running through the school hallways tripping fire alarms to draw everyone into the parking lot.

“I remember reading the script and it said, ‘Stevie runs down the hallway setting off the fire alarms, reminiscent of Jules and Jim running through the Louvre,’” says Little, referring to the 1962 Truffaut film. “I’d never seen Jules and Jim, but I do remember feeling when I was reading it that they want something iconic. That was inspiring to read. I love that scene of running through the hallways.”

“Chapter 8” (Season 2, Episode 2)

Photo: HBO

If you didn’t realize how critical to the series Stevie was by the end of season one, it was immediately apparent in season two: Powers has moved to Mexico, but Stevie has tracked him down and become further obsessed with him. That includes having sex with a prostitute who Kenny also had sex with just to know what it was like, a moment that gave Little considerable anxiety while shooting because it was his first-ever sex scene. “It was nerve-racking to see how that would go,” says Little. “I don’t know what the acting approach is when you’re pretending to have doggy-style sex with a prostitute.”

After Kenny shoots Stevie in the leg because he mistakes him for a burglar — somehow maybe not the worst thing that Kenny has ever done to him — they spend most of the episode together. Stevie one-liners like “I didn’t know you hoes took credit cards until recently” and “You can see straight into the butthole and right into the pussy” stand out. Little notes that he’s often asked by people about how much is improvised. “It’s a mix,” he confirms. “I think that first one, ‘I didn’t know you hoes took credit cards,’ I think that Jody told me to say that. Then I think it might have been Jody or me who suggested the ‘butthole’ line.” He adds that the show would still be great with just the scripts themselves, but improv helped elevate it even more — especially considering the fact that he was improvising with the person who made the show. “I think that’s a key of improv maybe, to have the creator be in the scene.”

“Chapter 15” (Season 3, Episode 2)

Photo: HBO

McBride, Hill, and Best could not have known this when they were making the series because they had never planned on having a season four, but “Chapter 15” ends up serving as a wonderful midpoint to the 29-episode Eastbound. In a show famous for its moments of harmonious insanity, this episode ends with Kenny and Stevie, who is dressed as a geisha, running from cannonballs being fired by Will Ferrell’s Ashley Schaeffer at an 1800s-style plantation while Korean car salesmen watch in horror and drink Fanta. Schaeffer is attempting to murder Kenny and Stevie, and he’s already killed one person to show he’s serious. But the person who played that murder victim was in fact not an actor and apparently wasn’t afraid to tell Ferrell to slow down.

“In one of the early scenes, there’s two guys at the Kia dealership, Joey [Brinkley] and Jeff Seibenick, who was the editor, and they’re teasing me as I’m waxing the tires,” says Little. Seibenick was one of Eastbound’s lead editors and had been given a role, but had just quit smoking, which added to his nerves, says Little — so they switched and gave his lines to Brinkley, who was the husband of David Gordon Green’s nanny. “He was a real southern dude, shooting guns and stuff. David liked Joey so much that he put him in the scene with all the Korean car salesman.” Little says that despite his lack of experience, Brinkley was pretty bold on set. “Joey a couple times told Will Ferrell to wait and not step on his lines. So you’ve got this guy who has never acted before, he has no lines then has some lines, the next day he’s acting with Will Ferrell. And then at brunch the next day, Danny and David decided that he needs to die from the cannonball to raise the stakes for Stevie and Kenny. A nonactor. You would think that anybody would let Will Ferrell go and do your thing, but Joey wasn’t like that.” (In a deleted scene, you can see Brinkley tell a story about duck hunting to Ferrell and the Korean car salesmen at dinner.)

“Chapter 20” (Season 3, Episode 7)

Photo: HBO

Building toward the end of season three, tensions are heightened when Stevie’s wife, Maria, leaves him after he cheats on her, which prompts him to go to the extreme length of shaving off all the hair on his head as a way to punish himself. But Hill was considering an even bigger conclusion to that scene. “From what I remember, Jody asked if I’d do a nude scene where they wanted me to come out after shaving my head,” says Little, “and I’m completely naked and completely shaved and I make myself a drink or something. Jody wanted me to say ‘What’s going on?’ to Kenny and then vomit on my dick. And then Kenny Powers says, ‘Nothing, just watching you vomit on your dick.’ But I didn’t do that.”

In “Chapter 20,” Stevie decides to wear a wig and fake eyebrows while attempting to win back Maria, but the wig is ripped off of his head and he freaks out, a moment inspired by the cult classic Canadian kids’ movie The Peanut Butter Solution, says Little. “I remember shooting that scene, and we were worried about the light and trying to go fast and just putting marshmallow goo on my head to make sure that it registers on camera. Looking back, it’s just such an absurd moment: that we have to make sure there’s enough marshmallow on this man’s head, that the audience knows why this man’s screaming. And why did Stevie use so much wig glue anyway?”

“Chapter 29” (Season 4, Episode 8)

As far as series finales go, Eastbound & Down did what it was always best at: showing fantastical, heightened versions of TV, which in this case meant borrowing from the Six Feet Under method of flash-forwarding ahead to its characters’ lives. Kenny and April get married and have two kids; the kids grow up and are portrayed by Lindsay Lohan and Alexander Skarsgård. April is shot in the chest and murdered by muggers; Kenny shoots them both dead. Kenny rides a hoverbike into an African village, where he marries a woman and has a bunch of kids and then dies of a heart attack. An older, futuristic Stevie, alongside Lohan and Skarsgård, go there for his Viking funeral. But the show found a way to have its fun while staying grounded in reality, revealing that Kenny is just writing the ending to his screenplay..

“I picked this episode because it’s so insane and such a bold leap,” Little says. “I auditioned for this part where there’s two scenes on the show, and here I am five years later and I’m wearing this space outfit, with those LeVar Burton glasses across my eyes, with Lindsay Lohan and Alexander Skarsgård. Just looking at that journey, it’s really kind of insane.”",Steve Little Walks Us Through His Top 5 Eastbound & Down Episodes,Vulture.com,http://www.vulture.com/article/steve-little-best-eastbound-and-down-episodes.html

Vegas hit the ball with metronomic efficiency to card a bogey-free six-under-par 64 at PGA National in Palm Beach Gardens in south Florida.

The Venezuelan had a two-shot advantage over a trio of major champions in Ernie Els, Zach Johnson and Lucas Glover, along with Canadian Ben Silverman.

Yet the big talking point in the lead-up to the first round was the absence of most of the game’s biggest names.

Only three among the top 20 in the world rankings are present — Justin Thomas, Brooks Koepka and Rickie Fowler — making it the weakest field in more than a decade.

Tiger Woods, Dustin Johnson and Rory McIlroy are among those sitting out the event, even though they all live locally.

A number of big events both before and after the Honda Classic has left the longest title sponsor on the PGA Tour facing a problem not of its making.

Honda, which began sponsoring the tournament in 1982, comes directly after the WGC-Mexico Championship and only two weeks ahead of the Players Championship, a run that is too much golf for many on the tour.

The Players, the most prestigious event outside the four majors, has switched from May to March, while the PGA Championship has moved from August to May.

The tour season will finish in late August instead of late September.

The scheduling was of little concern to Vegas who notched six birdies in benign morning conditions on Thursday.

“I was able to drive... really well today, hit my irons incredibly well,” said 34-year-old Vegas, who is ranked 131st in the world.

“I only missed three greens and of those I left two within 15 feet of the hole.”

Veteran Els compiled six birdies for a share of second place with a round marred only by a double-bogey at the par-three 15th, where his eight-iron came up short and found the water.

The four-times major champion, now ranked 398th in the twilight of his career at age 49, said he enjoyed playing on a course with firm greens.

“They are not very receptive, even this morning, so going to get even firmer but I like that,” he said.

“It means you’ve got to hit it on the fairways. (The ball is) not going to stop out of the rough so I’m trying to hit fairways and then you’ve got to hit it properly to stay on the greens.”

Koepka and Fowler also started well, carding three-under 67, while defending champion Thomas shot 68.

THIS WEEK:

By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP)

It’s Not Real; It’s Puccini: People often suspend realism. In the movie “Spiderman” the hero swings through the canyons of Manhattan using threads of “spider silk” he attaches from building to building as he travels down the street. In Puccini’s La Boheme, the leading lady sings a beautiful aria on her death bed, in the last stages of consumption, tuberculous filling her lungs will bodily fluids. The realist may say that is not possible. The opera buff may respond it’s not real; it’s Puccini.

Human imagination is boundless.

Unfortunately, many scientists, commentators and politicians expect other physicists and commentators to suspend realism when examining climate science produced by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and other reports from similar organizations. Critical thinking is not welcome.

For example, 40 years of calculations from comprehensive satellite data show that the atmosphere is warming modestly, but not over the Antarctic. The calculations are verified using temperature measurements by different instruments in weather balloons, taken over a part of the atmosphere. The greenhouse effect occurs in the atmosphere. The temperature trends in the atmosphere include effects of all greenhouse gases, such as changes in carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor occurring from natural El Niño events.

The IPCC, etc. use surface temperatures, which are not comprehensive and include many other influences such as urbanization and change in land use. Surface temperature trends show a far greater warming rate than atmospheric trends. The IPCC, etc. claim that the primary cause of surface warming is carbon dioxide and that it is dangerous for humans. The advocates of dangerous warming have not produced a substantiated foundation, a tested hypothesis that demonstrates how a minor warming of the atmosphere causes a far greater warming of the surface. Further, the models they use predict a pronounced warming of the upper troposphere above the tropics, a “tropical hot spot.” Observations by balloons, and satellites show that it’s simply not there. It is as if the Climate Establishment is saying about their work: it’s not physics, it’s climate science!

********************

Will Happer – Realist: President Trump did the unthinkable for many. He appointed a distinguished physicist, William Happer, to a committee being formed to review the security risks to the nation from climate change. Readers may recall that TWTW has suggested that the threat assessments are dubious at best. They lack critical thinking. Fort Eustis, VA, on the James River, is listed as one of the military facilities most at risk from sea level rise caused by global warming. The tidal gages in the area show that sea levels are not rising by an unusual extent.

But, the entire area of Norfolk / Newport News, which is on the low coastal plane, is sinking. Land subsidence is occurring, primarily from ground water extraction from two major wells which are forming clear funnels that show subsiding land centered on these wells. One well is at West Point on the York River about 30 miles northeast of Fort Eustis. The other well is in Franklin, Virginia, about 50 miles southwest of Fort Eustis. A cost-effective alternative for water may be to replace these wells with one or two desalination plants similar to that employed in Carlsbad, CA, using prefiltration technology developed in Israel.

When the appointment of Happer was announced, the global warming chorus roared – how dare the president appoint a physicist who may question the threat assessments by experts. The noise may be reminiscent of the uproar the occurred when President Reagan dared question the assessments of the experts who considered that the Soviet economy was comparable to that of the US, including the first US Nobel laureate in economics. After the Soviet economy collapsed, the critics of Reagan forgot their previous economic assessments.

A sample of the response to Happer can be found in an editorial in Science Magazine written by a journalist for an environmental news service, E & E News.

“William Happer, a prominent opponent of climate science in the Trump administration, is heading a new White House effort to downplay the national security risks posed by climate change.”

“Happer, who is not a climate scientist, has rejected mainstream climate science for years. He routinely says that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant and that the world could burn more fossil fuels without harm. Happer heads a group called the CO2 Coalition, which advocates for a rejection of climate science, and he has said the world is in a ‘CO2 drought.’”

“’Frankly, it’s insulting to those in the intelligence community and those who are in our science agencies,’ [Francesco] Femia [co-founder of the Center for Climate and Security] said. ‘Within the Pentagon and within the intelligence community, there are a lot of people who are evidence-driven, fact-driven, science-driven patriots, and they see a risk and they begin to put that into their analysis because they know if you don’t do so, you’re going to have a blind spot on security. And that’s never a good thing.’”

Such comments prompt a response such as, “Why do these evidence-driven, fact-driven, science-driven patriots ignore atmospheric temperature trends, where the greenhouse gas effect occurs?” And “What is fact-based about claims of exponential sea level rise, increasing sea levels by an ever-increasing rate?”

But, perhaps the most pointed response came from physicist Luboš Motl in his blog, The Reference Frame, when addressing political comments by former mayor Michael Bloomberg and Senator Chuck Schumer:

“Can’t they see that Happer clearly knows more about these matters – especially the absorption of electromagnetic radiation (the greenhouse effect is an example) and the relative CO2 famine in the present – than they and their Senate clubs and aides combined? Bullying of a scientist by a politician is the right word here.”

This goes to the core. The enormous benefits of carbon dioxide fertilization are well-documented, substantiated by experiments and real-world observations, but ignored by the IPCC and the climate chorus. Worse, the IPCC, etc. have produced a distorted version of the absorption and reemission of electromagnetic radiation (the greenhouse effect). See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy, Defending the Orthodoxy, Changing Seas, and Other Scientific News.

********************

The Greenhouse Effect: this is the first in a series on the greenhouse effect as it is being measured in the atmosphere.

Greenhouse gases are nearly transparent to sunlight but partially opaque to thermal radiation from Earth’s surface and atmosphere. The greenhouse effect is a predicted warming of the surface and lower atmosphere and a cooling of the stratosphere and upper atmosphere as the concentration of greenhouse gases increases. The most important greenhouse gas is water vapor, H2O. Carbon dioxide, CO2, is of lesser importance. Nitrous oxide, N2O, and methane, CH4, make only minor contributions to greenhouse warming. The most abundant gases in the atmosphere, nitrogen, N2, and oxygen, O2, are not greenhouse gases since they are nearly transparent to both sunlight and thermal radiation. There is no doubt that the greenhouse effect exists, but there is considerable uncertainty about how large it is.

Many economic models show that small warming of any kind will benefit the Earth, for example, by lengthening growing seasons and by lessening human mortality due to extreme cold. Separately, increasing concentrations of CO2 have enormously positive effects on the growth of crops and forests. Greening of the Earth from more CO2 is already being observed from satellites. It is important to resolve whether the greenhouse effect from credible increases in CO2 concentrations will be modest and beneficial or large and harmful. Theoretical uncertainties in science have traditionally been resolved by comparing theoretical predictions with observations. Comparing predicted and observed temperature changes of the surface and lower atmosphere is an incisive way to resolve theoretical uncertainties about the magnitude of the greenhouse effect.

Surface and lower-atmospheric temperatures are expected to warm in response to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases. But surface temperatures, and their global averages, are influenced by other factors, like land-use changes, suburban and urban development. Surface temperatures are measured by thermometers here and there—sometimes in very bad locations—, and effort is made to interpolate between sites, often poorly. In contrast, satellites can measure atmospheric temperatures with nearly full sampling of the globe and with few of the systematic errors that plague surface measurements.

Instruments on satellites measure the intensity of microwave radiation emitted by the atmosphere. Temperatures are deduced from these intensities by methods analogous to those used in scanning temporal thermometers, available in most pharmacies. Atmospheric temperatures determined from satellite observations have been confirmed by direct measurements of temperature from weather balloons, many hundreds of which are launched every day.

Another reason to use atmospheric rather than surface temperatures as the touchstone for testing climate models is that climate models predict maximum warming at altitudes of 5 to 10 km in the tropical atmosphere. Lesser warmings are predicted for the surface, where it is harder to make reliable measurements.

Using atmospheric temperature data, John Christy et al. have repeatedly shown that the global climate models, in general, greatly overestimate the warming of the bulk atmosphere. Using 60 years of weather balloon data, Ross McKitrick and Christy have shown that an assumed pronounced warming centered over the tropics at about 30,000 to 35,000 feet (9 to 11 km, 300 to 200 millibars) is not found. The McKitrick and Christy study reinforces a 2007 study by Douglas, Christy, Pearson and Singer. This “hot spot” may be logically derived from a warming of the surface, whatever the cause. Its failure to appear after 60 years of observations is significant. There is something wrong with the theory. methodology, and/or procedure used by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its followers such as the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and the models on which they rely.

TWTW addressed this lack of a pronounced warming in the context of the widely accepted Global Annual Energy Budget by Kiehl and Trenberth on January 26 and February 2. The vicinity of center of the graphic depicts the concepts at issue “Thermals and Evapotranspiration” at the surface absorbing heat then rising in the atmosphere then releasing latent heat in the atmosphere. Based on the evidence presented by McKitrick and Christy, these processes are not intensifying. Thus, assumptions that storms, floods, droughts, etc. are intensifying are not justified by observational evidence.

Using observed evidence, Christy et al. have shown that the divergence between climate models and actual nature is increasing. The divergence is likely to continue unless the theory and methodology used by the IPCC, et al., are changed substantially. This is the first of several TWTWs that will address our understanding of the actual greenhouse gas effect and why the efforts of the IPCC, et al. are faulty.

Although not comprehensive and not embodied in a coherent theory, significant observational data of the atmosphere are being collected. These data suggest the IPCC has significantly overestimated the total greenhouse gas effect, especially that of carbon dioxide. These data bring into question the right side of what is depicted in the Kiehl and Trenberth diagram, the outgoing surface radiation resulting in far less outgoing longwave radiation. Unfortunately, outgoing longwave radiation, which is in the infrared range, cannot be observed from the surface.

The 1979 Charney report assumed that the greenhouse gas effect of carbon dioxide, which had been measured by laboratory experiments, would be greatly amplified by increased water vapor. Since there were no comprehensive measurements of outgoing longwave radiation, there was no hard evidence supporting or refuting this concept. Thus, the 1979 Charney report embodied speculation concerning the impact of greenhouse gases that may have been appropriate at that time; but, as with atmospheric temperature trends, this speculation has been superseded by observational data.

To better express the effects of greenhouse gases on outgoing infrared radiation, it is useful to think of placing thin layers of slightly smoky glass over a bright light shining through a window with each layer of glass being less smoky, clearer. As more layers are placed on, the total effect increases, but effect of the last layer is less noticeable than the previous one. In terminology that will follow in future TWTWs, if there is no interference with the light (electromagnetic energy) passing through the atmosphere (the window), it is said to be transparent. If there is considerable interference with the light (electromagnetic energy) passing through the atmosphere, it is said to be opaque. Different greenhouse gases interfere with different wavelengths of outbound infrared energy. At a particular wavelength, carbon dioxide may be transparent to infrared energy, yet at a different wavelength, opaque to infrared energy. The ability of greenhouse gases to absorb, then re-emit energy varies with the wavelength of the energy.

Since the advent of the satellite era, several countries have been compiling data on the atmosphere. For example, with what is called the A-Train of multiple satellites, and a similar, lower orbiting, C-Train, satellites from the US, France, and Japan collect a wide variety of data, including visible, infrared and microwave energy, phases of water, studies of vegetation, atmospheric pollutants, greenhouse gases, aerosols, clouds, water levels on land areas, snow depths, etc. The information is shared among international partners.

Future installments in TWTW will discussed how these data, and other data, are compiled and developed into databases that are available to the public and can be downloaded onto personal computers. Further discussions will include how these calculations based on observations contradict the findings of the IPCC, etc., and their models. See links under Defending the Orthodoxy and Measurement Issues – Atmosphere.

********************

Hurricanes and Climate Change: On her web site, Climate Etc., Judith Curry has posted two installments on a series about Hurricanes & Climate Change. The first is on detection, going back about 5,000 years. The second is on attribution which she states must be based on observations, not models. See links under Models v. Observations.

********************

Additions and Corrections: A reader on WUWT wrote that TWTW linked to the headline of comments on a paper changing ocean pH with changing wind patterns. The link created the impression that the paper contradicted recent lowering of pH claimed by many. Actually, the paper showed 159-year reconstruction of pH based on a set of coral collected in the northern South China Sea. TWTW should have made such a comment under the link.

********************

Number of the Week: Not €1.57 billion, but closer to €7 billion. An EU energy study claimed that annual levies on UK consumers in 2016 for subsidies to renewable electricity were €1.57 billion, whereas the correct figure is closer to €7 billion. It seems that subsidies for green energy are experiencing more exponential growth than increases in sea level. See link under Problems in the Orthodoxy.

Climate change science pioneer Wallace Smith Broecker dies

US professor raised early alarms about climate change and popularised term ‘global warming’

By Jonathan Watts, The Guardian, Feb 19, 2019

https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/feb/19/climate-change-science-pioneer-wallace-smith-broecker-dies

“Broecker said his studies suggested that the conveyor belt was the ‘Achilles heel of the climate system’ and a fragile phenomenon that could change rapidly for reasons not fully understood. It would take only a slight rise in temperature to keep water from sinking in the North Atlantic, he said, and that would bring the conveyor to a halt.

“In the 1970s, he worked as a consultant for Exxon and wrote several papers on the effects of carbon dioxide for the oil company.

“His 1975 paper “Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?”, which predicted rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would lead to pronounced heating of the planet. This built on earlier studies and helped to push the subject to a wider audience.”

Hurricanes & Climate Change: Detection

By Judith Curry, Climate Etc. Feb 17, 2019

https://judithcurry.com/2019/02/17/hurricanes-climate-change-detection/#more-24723

“I am preparing a new Special Report on Hurricanes and Climate Change.

“There has not been a timeline or synthesis of these results for the past five thousand years, either regionally or for the entire coastal region. However, it is clear from these analyses that significant variability of landfall probabilities occurs on century to millennial time scales. There appears to have been a broad ‘hyperactive period’ from 3400 to 1000 years B.P. High activity persisted in the Gulf of Mexico until 1400 AD, with a shift to more frequent severe hurricane strikes from the Bahamas to New England occurring between 1400 and 1675 AD. Since 1760, there was a gradual decline in activity until the 1990’s.”

Hurricanes and Climate Change: Attribution

By Judith Curry, Climate Etc. Feb 20, 2019

https://judithcurry.com/2019/02/20/24737/#more-24737

“Models and theory suggest that hurricane intensity and rainfall should increase in a warming climate. There is no theory that predicts a change in the number of hurricanes or a change in hurricane tracks with warmer temperatures.

“Convincing attribution of any changes requires that a change in hurricane characteristics be identified from observations, with the change exceeding natural variability.”

“The IEA WEO 2018 supports a worldwide energy transition and forecasts capacity additions in power generation, by type, by 2020.

“Using data from the IEA chart, the above calculations demonstrate that electricity from coal-fired and NGCC power plants is far cheaper, four times less expensive when comparing NGCC power plants with PV Solar plants, than renewables.

“There is no need to delve into levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and all the minutia associated with LCOE calculations. The cost and output of units being installed worldwide establishes, unequivocally, that wind and PV Solar are more expensive.”

“In the case of the 1976 Swine Flu episode, President Ford, acting on the advice from the country’s best medical advisors, authorized dramatic action — aggressive intervention, in the form of a national immunization campaign — which turned out badly. Many of the advisors that had originally convinced President Ford to act almost immediately had second thoughts, long before the adverse effects started to turn up. Historians have been critical of Ford but the blame stems from the difficulty of decision making under deep uncertainty.”

“Scientists will this week warn that Italy may be forced to import the basic ingredients for pasta, its national food, because climate change will make it impossible to grow durum wheat.

“In a report to be released by Britain’s Met Office today, scientists predict that Italy’s durum yields will start to decline from 2020 and the crop will almost disappear from the country later this century.

“The report will say: ‘Projected climate changes in this region, in particular rising temperature and decreasing rainfall, may seriously compromise wheat yields.’

“The warning is the latest example of the impact climate change could have on lifestyles and diets across Europe.

1. The Green New Deal’s Impossible Electric Grid

Renewable energy can’t consistently balance power supply with demand.

By Robert Blohm, WSJ, Feb 20, 2019

https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-green-new-deals-impossible-electric-grid-11550705997

“Mr. Blohm is an elected member of the Operating Committee and the Standards Committee of the North American Electric Reliability Corp., the continental bulk electric system’s reliability regulator designated by the U.S. Energy Policy Act of 2005 and by all the Canadian provinces’ energy regulators.”

In expressing a critical concern Mr Blohm writes:

“The Democrats’ Green New Deal calls for a fully renewable electric power grid. Regardless of the economic or political challenges of bringing this about, it is likely technologically impossible.

“An electric power grid involves second-by-second balancing between generated supply and consumer demand. In the case of a sudden imbalance—such as from the loss of a generator’s output—all the remaining generators on the grid instantaneously pool together. Each one pitches in a small part of the required power to make up for the lost generator fast enough to keep supply and demand balanced.

“This doesn’t work for wind and solar because you can’t spontaneously increase wind or sunshine. Hydro power is limited and unevenly distributed around the country. And for safety reasons, nuclear power—even if the Green New Dealers accepted it—can’t be cranked up to neutralize imbalances. Nor can consumer demand be suddenly reduced enough.

“Fossil-fuel turbines, by contrast, very naturally compensate for sudden supply outages. The inertia of the spinning mass of rotors provides the extra energy needed to compensate for the loss for the first few seconds. (Wind-rotor inertia is too short-lived.) Meanwhile the generators’ on-line reserve capacity kicks in, giving a rapid boost in power output to prevent the turbines from slowing down. That substitute power, called “governor response,” lasts as long as 15 minutes. During that time a single replacement generator ramps up to compensate entirely for the loss. All the turbines on the grid are thereby restored to their original speed, and the governor response is rearmed for the next disturbance.

An all-renewables grid would require prohibitively expensive battery storage to compensate for sudden power losses. Even with batteries, the lost power would have to be fed through “inverters”—a technology that converts variable-wind-speed alternating current, solar-power direct current, and battery-power direct-current into alternating current—to allow for synthetic inertia and governor response in the case of a disruption.

“But according to a 2017 report from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, if a large enough share of the power grid flows through inverters, the grid itself may collapse. Existing inverter technologies have faced serious software problems and prompted outages where they have been deployed. The IEEE is trying to create a global standard for inverter design—though heavy input by Chinese suppliers bent on commandeering the technology may pose a national-security risk if the U.S. were to incorporate the standard.

“How could the market price in the cost of providing rapid replacement energy that renewable sources can’t provide reliably? The entity that caused the outage should need to pay. Yet the power industry—to say nothing of the Green New Dealers—hasn’t given this much thought. An all-renewables power grid is destined to collapse.”

PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — A year ago at The Honda Classic, Jhonattan Vegas made seven birdies all week.

He’s off to a much better start this time.

Vegas made six birdies and no bogeys Thursday, shooting a 6-under 64 to open a two-stroke lead after the first round. Lucas Glover bogeyed his finishing hole for a 66, leaving him tied with Zach Johnson, Ernie Els and Ben Silverman — who went to college at nearby Florida Atlantic.

“Hit my irons the best I’ve hit them all year and I’ve always liked this golf course,” Vegas said. “It’s kind of one of those courses that I think suits me. You have to hit the ball well and you have to get around really well. And then I made a few putts.”

Brooks Koepka, Rickie Fowler and Sergio Garcia were in a large group at 67, and defending champion Justin Thomas shot 68 after an eventful day that saw him play the last eight holes without a 9-iron after it bent when he hit it against a tree.

“To feel like I gave quite a few back today and shoot 2-under par on this golf course, it’s great,” Thomas said.

Also at 68 was Sam Saunders, the grandson of golf legend Arnold Palmer. Saunders birdied all three holes in the famed “Bear Trap” stretch at PGA National, the run of holes 15 through 17 where a par 4 is sandwiched by a pair of par 3s that can be treacherous even without much wind.

Vegas made 12 bogeys last year at the Honda, along with three doubles and a triple, wound up beating only one of the 74 finishers and wrapped up the week with a final-round 78. He sprayed irons everywhere, missed half of the fairways, more than half of the greens.

But Thursday, he was dialed in — missing only three of 14 fairways and three of the 18 greens, needing only 29 putts to get through the day.

“I felt like I was in control pretty much all day long,” Vegas said.

The 34-year-old Venezuelan has three PGA Tour victories, winning the 2011 Bob Hope Classic and the RBC Canadian Open in 2016 and 2017.

Vegas took advantage on a day to make noise at PGA National, where the wind was down. And that’s not typical.

Forecasters correctly said breezes would be relatively light all day and should stay that way until perhaps the weekend, though Johnson — whose weather apps said breezes were going to be no more than 3 or 4 mph — was among those who felt the wind was still a factor and fluctuated more than expected.

“We had a stretch there on the front nine where it was a lot more than that,” Johnson said. “The ball curving with the wind, depending on the direction, easily 10 to 15 to 20 yards. And then we made the turn and it started to be more consistent, not as gusty. ... It was not Honda wind. I don’t think we’re going to get Honda wind until Sunday.”

Els had no complaints.

Els has won more than 70 tournaments worldwide, 19 of them on the PGA Tour — the last of those coming in 2012 at the British Open. Getting a 20th on tour, he said, has been a goal for some time.

“Secretly on tour among the players, you know when you win No. 20 you get some benefits,” Els said. “It’s late in my career, but I’ll take any win now.”

Thomas sizzled at the start with three birdies in his first four holes, and made the turn at 4-under.

That’s when his day got eventful.

His drive ended up behind a tree on the 10th, and he figured that his 9-iron would snap on the follow-through of his approach shot. It merely bent instead, and the jolt of the impact meant Thomas was going to be spending some time Thursday night with an icepack on his wrist. He doesn’t believe it’ll impact him Friday.

“Just more of a shock than anything,” Thomas said.

Thomas then found his way into and out of trouble on the Bear Trap — making double-bogey, then having a par putt slide past the hole on 16, and making birdie on 17. He then birdied the last as well.

Garcia also finished strong, with three birdies in his last four holes.

“It’s a great round, at the end of the day,” Garcia said.

DIVOTS: Fowler went into the water twice and wound up making a triple-bogey on the par-4 sixth, his nemesis hole at PGA National. In his last four rounds at the Honda, he’s 7 over on that hole. ... Alex Cejka was disqualified for using an improper greens-reading device, officials said. He withdrew from last year’s tournament and missed the cut in 2017. ...

518,Empty,2019-02-28T21:49:44Z,Only three among the top 20 in the world rankings are present in Palm Beach Gardens,"Jhonattan Vegas took the early first-round lead on Thursday at the Honda Classic, a tournament that has recently attracted a stellar field but has fallen victim this year of the PGA Tour’s new condensed schedule.

Vegas hit the ball with metronomic efficiency to card six-under-par 64 at PGA National in Palm Beach Gardens.

Yet the big talking point in the lead-up to the first round was the absence of most of the game’s biggest names from the tournament.

Only three among the top 20 in the world rankings are present - Justin Thomas, Brooks Koepka and Rickie Fowler - making it the weakest field in more than a decade.

Tiger Woods, Dustin Johnson and Rory McIlroy are among those sitting out the event, even though they all live locally.

A number of big events both before and after the Honda Classic has left the longest title sponsor on the PGA Tour facing a problem not of its own making.

Honda began sponsoring the south Florida tournament in 1982 but this year, it comes coming directly after the WGC-Mexico Championship and only two weeks ahead of the Players Championship.

The Players, the most prestigious event outside the four majors, has switched from May to March, while the PGA Championship has moved from August to May.

The tour season will finish in late August, instead of late September.

The scheduling, however, appeared of little concern to Vegas who notched six birdies in benign morning conditions on Thursday.

“I was able to drive really well today, hit my irons incredibly well,” said the 34-year-old from Venezuela.

“I only missed three greens and of those I left two within 15 feet of the hole.

“Hitting those irons well to some of these tough pins makes the day a little bit easier. Wind wasn’t that hard so you could be a little more aggressive than usual.”

Vegas, ranked 131st in the world, is a three-times PGA Tour winner.

He led by two strokes from South African Ernie Els, American Zach Johnson and Canadian Ben Silverman with half the field back in the clubhouse.

519,Empty,2019-02-25T08:01:47Z,"Southern Utah wasn't always a riding paradise, but as they say, if you build it, they will come. The post 2019 Bible Feature Story: Slow Roll appeared first on BIKE Magazine.","As I climbed out of a truck in Utah's Gooseberry Mesa parking lot, toothy, redrock peaks filled the view to the north and east, highlighted by the world-famous skyline of Zion National Park. I'd been told to expect a two- to three-hour ride that was rugged and technical. But perusing our flat surroundings made me skeptical.

Perhaps sensing my apprehension, Jake Weber, a retired Army combat engineer-turned guide with Utah Mountain Biking Adventures, offered a measure of reassurance. ""We get a lot of people who show up and say they want to ride 30 miles every day of their trip,"" he told me. ""But after about 15 miles on their first day, they're like, 'Yeah, we're good,' and they're ready for a beer at the trailhead.""

Welcome to the land of ""mesa miles."" Maybe you've heard of them. In short—no pun intended—they're harder than standard miles which makes them feel longer. The more you ride them, the more comfortable you get disclosing that you ""only"" rode 10 miles today and it still took two hours.

I had never ridden a mesa mile when I got to Washington County, Utah, which is well known to desert aficionados as a singletrack oasis and has hosted the world's premier freeride competition, Red Bull Rampage, off and on since 2001. Still, it remains something of a hidden gem to the rest of the riding world, in part because it's remote: four hours from Salt Lake City, six hours from Phoenix, nine hours from Denver.

St. George, the county seat and a city of roughly 90,000 people, spent decades as a retirement community for golfers and still attracts celebrities like Michael Jordan to its greens come winter. But starting around the mid 2000s, adventure took a bite out of golf's place as the area's top attraction. The number of local outfitters swelled from a dozen to more than 50. Mountain biking overtook road biking as the most popular two-wheeled pursuit. With an almost 90-percent population jump since 2000, Washington County ranks as the fastest-growing metropolitan area in America. It also has a warmer climate than its sometimes-rival, Moab, five hours to the northeast, and offers legitimate riding and 60-degree temps in the belly of winter.

On this beaming morning in early October, photographer Margus Riga and I had joined a local crew for a spin along the South Rim and through Hidden Canyon. Gooseberry, the original mesa ride and still a lot of locals' favorite mesa of the five with trails, carries an almost-mythical reputation among those who know about it. Mostly that is due to Goose's sandstone features and their surprising, albeit intimidating, ridability.

""They're like giant rock biscuits that you can just roll up onto,"" said 54-year-old Kenny Jones, who owns Gooseberry Yurts and once finished 14 straight Leadville 100s back-to-back. ""A lot of the bottom sections of the rocks have a nice, roll-y out. So they look really steep but then the tranny grabs your front wheel and gets you out of the vertical position.""

We followed Quentin Morisette, owner of Over the Edge Sports in nearby Hurricane, as he weaved between puddles in the rock—and the brine shrimp they hold, making it a no-no to ride through them—and abided by the local code not to leave tracks in the dirt. He led us to a playground that he called the Skatepark: two deep, connected bowls that mimic the flow of a purpose-built concrete bowl. From there we swooped between stands of juniper, piñon and cedar trees, as well as the mesa's namesake gooseberry bushes. After 15 minutes of wrestling our bikes up, down and over the sandstone landscape—a full-body workout that longtime local Bill Bergeron compares to ""being stuck in a cage with a gorilla""—we came upon a 20-foot-tall biscuit that looked like a soft-serve ice-cream tower. It was steep and layered, with a small drop at the entry over significant exposure. Morisette hiked to the top for the second time in his life and prepared to drop in.

The line, my riding partners explained, was not to be confused with the Wall of Considerable Consequences, which we'd pass later, or the Wall of Death, which we'd skip. Morisette rolled in, landed the initial drop and rocketed out the bottom as the rest of us filmed it with our phones. ""You've got to be kidding me!"" shouted Weber, who served two tours in Iraq and left the military after a pair of traumatic brain injuries saddled him with PTSD. Now he coaches a local high school team and rarely sees someone test the sharp end, hence his incredulous response.

Morisette let out a sly grin. ""I've been riding here for 23 years, and it just gets better,"" he said. ""When you're on the rock, the sky's the limit.""

As we continued toward Gooseberry's high point, I realized why locals pay attention to their tires' side knobs here: You need a lof of support to grip the off-camber sandstone. It helps that the trail is marked by white dots on the rock, too; otherwise it's easy to wander off track.

We pedaled over a 4-foot-wide plank to the Point, an airy perch overlooking the valley and Zion. The trail only gains 300 vertical feet from the White Trailhead (elevation: 5,100 feet above sea level) to here, but the entire ride includes about 900 feet of gain. ""It's all 10 feet at a time,"" Morisette quipped.

We ogled the old Rampage venue to the north, which includes the notorious King Kong descent, as well as Flying Monkey, a mesa across the valley where the government, legend has it, used to send furry primates down a rail propelled by a rocket at supersonic speeds to test military ejector seats.

Then we returned the way we came, back to the trailhead. Slightly under the weather, I collapsed in the gravelly shade, feeling like I'd ridden 20 miles if not more. Someone informed me it was actually less than 10. I sighed, chalked it up to the mesa effect and closed my eyes for a nap, while the others tipped back beers in the sun.

According to Washington County's GIS department, the local mountain biking scene encompasses 296 miles of mapped trails to go with a gnarliness spectrum ranging from sublime cross-country favorites like Hurricane Rim, J.E.M. and Dead Ringer, to the five local mesas and their sandstone playgrounds, to big-boy gravity lines that attract the world's best freeriders every October.

The area's rise to prominence happened neither quickly nor due to a mass movement. On the contrary, it started in late 1993 when a pair of native sons took up the sport at age 49. Twin brothers Morgan and Mike Harris had grown up in Rockville, a tiny town on the Virgin River at the mouth of Zion Canyon, but because their father forbade them from riding dirt bikes, they didn't start until they were 26. As Morgan tells it, they rode motos for 20 years, then performance ATVs for three, at which point they grew wary of the danger and turned to mountain bikes.

In the early days, Morgan rode a primitive bike with a shoddy fork. ""Boy, I went home bloody a lot,"" he chuckles. A few other locals were riding at the time, but they mainly stuck to the mellow Green Valley Loop. ""There wasn't any real anchor trail to draw people to the area,"" Harris recalls.

He and Mike used to hunt deer, coyotes and rabbits on Gooseberry Mesa, and they often heard visitors talk about slickrock riding in Moab. They knew Gooseberry contained similar features and started poking around, starting with the slab that parallels the White Road. They built a short trail through one of the mesa's mini-canyons, then found out they needed a permit. So they met with the BLM in 1994 to talk about expanding their work to the north and south rims and Hidden Canyon. ""Originally they wanted 15 cents a foot, per year, for the use of the land,"" Harris says. Then the agency softened its stance. ""They said if you can have everything completed by Trail Days of 1996, we'll do a trail dedication. We had it done, but it took them until '98 to dedicate it.""

With Gooseberry complete, the Harris brothers turned their attention to Little Creek Mountain, which they'd been staring at for years from Gooseberry. They started exploring its slabs, ancient petroglyphs and fossils (there's actually a dinosaur bone embedded in the sandstone in one spot) and potential trail corridors that didn't require slaughtering flora. After a year-and-a-half of building there—with unofficial permission from a BLM official, Harris says—the agency changed its mind and asked them to stop. So they did, again shifting to where they thought the next destination could be. In this case it was a long redrock spine that would come to be known as Church Rocks.

Mike Harris quit riding after Little Creek, leaving Morgan to continue alone. Luckily others picked up the slack, and soon enough a growing community of riders had built Guacamole, which fostered its own mini-network on the mesa including The Whole Guacamole, Holy Guacamole and Salt on the Rim.

Harris left to build trails in Nevada after constructing Holy Guacamole, and now, at age 73, he just maintains existing routes. But the foundation he and Mike laid continues to anchor the network. If you ask 20 locals to name their favorite trail, like I did, you could get 15 different answers. The scene now includes a 100-mile race—True Grit, held every March in St. George—and a respected advocacy organization, the Dixie Mountain Bike Trails Association (DMBTA), which was launched in 2010 by True Grit founder Cimarron Chacon. ('Dixie' is a common moniker in Washington County because the early settlers grew cotton, which led to the area being known as 'Utah's Dixie.')

DMBTA only counts about 75 official members, but more than 2,000 people follow the organization on social media, ""and a lot of them come out to our volunteer days,"" says club president Kevin Christopherson. Others hand him money on the trails, even if they're not from the area. In addition, the Rampage organizers have donated about $14,000 to DMBTA each of the past two years.

The roots and robust support keep the area on the broader map, attracting riders from around the world—with a healthy dose of freeriders each spring, an influx that Morisette affectionately calls the Canadian Invasion. The key to providing such a reliable product when so many other destinations in the region cannot, he says, is the geography. Just north of Hurricane, Interstate 15 goes from 3,500 feet in elevation to above 5,000 and stays there, which places Zion on the northern edge of viable winter and early spring riding.

Although a lot of local rides, particularly the mesas, require driving a fair distance to park at a trailhead, not everywhere does. One of the guys we rode Gooseberry with, a diehard XC fanatic named Josh Wolfe, lives in St. George and doesn't own a car. We bumped into him the next morning in the nondescript parking lot for Zen and Barrel Ride, just over a dirt mound from St. George's subdivisions and commercial sprawl. We had just finished up an ambitious combo ride in a group of eight.

Wolfe was on his way out for a midday loop, and after our morning figure-eight on Zen and Barrel, I understood why he lives so close to these trails. Zen features the kind of ledgy, technical terrain that makes your forearms cramp. Kenny Jones called it a ""rim-basher trail,"" and halfway through our descent it delivered. Jake Miller, a Red Rock ambassador and standout local rider, buckled an $1,800 carbon wheel in two places without crashing. Despite its ride-from-home proximity to a city of 90,000, you still feel like you're away from the hectic rush of civilization when you reach the top. Then the real fun begins. Both Riga, who lives in Vancouver and calls the North Shore home, and I deemed it our favorite trail of the week.

We continued on to the freeride-friendly Barrel from there, led by longtime St. George rider Bryce Pratt, who built it 15 years ago, and Mitchell Curwen, who recently refurbished it and added some features. ""If you want to see what a bike can do, this is a great place to take it,"" Curwen said as we pedaled up a wash toward the top. Pratt designed the trail to snake through a series of barrel cactuses, which look like stunted pony kegs with 3-inch-long thorns.

I followed a mother of three named Angie Anderson down the Waterfall, an aptly named chunky section that serves as Barrel's crux, if you don't count the jumps below. Some of those jumps dropped blindly off of giant boulders into perfectly sculpted transitions. Others were gaps, including one over a creek. Everything seemed to flow just as it should until we were back at the parking lot.

""Doing Zen and Barrel in the same day is a big day. They're probably our two most technical trails in St. George City,"" Curwen said. ""If you can get out of here without a broken bike part or broken body part, that's a win.""

Victorious, Riga and I returned to St. George later that afternoon to check out the Snake Hollow St. George Bike Park—the newest addition to the area's stable of radness. Built on 80 acres of city-owned land through a collaboration between DMBTA, the Southern Utah Bicycle Alliance and the Washington County Tourism Office, the facility was funded by $1.6 million in tax dollars and was slated to open the month after our visit. But there were already dozens of kids testing it out after school. This winter, city workers and volunteers are planning to add a 5.5-mile NICA racecourse through the lava field on the lot's southern end. According to county tourism director Kevin Lewis, it will be the only year-round bike park in Utah.

The most recent addition to Washington County's singletrack menu arrived two years ago when DMBTA finished a 7-mile intermediate loop on Wire Mesa. In its first year of existence, trail counters recorded 16,000 visitors—or an average of 44 a day. It's close to Gooseberry and Grafton mesas, so you'd expect it to see traffic, but the number still quantified the area's growing renown. (In total, 178,000 people rode BLM trails around Washington County last year, including 30,000 on Gooseberry.)

The numbers are a far cry from when Morgan Harris broached the idea of a Gooseberry trail to the BLM 25 years ago. ""At that first meeting, they said, 'Being that remote, 7-and-a-half miles off the highway, you're probably only going to see 36 riders a month, at most,'"" Harris recalled. Within three years of Gooseberry's trails being open, the local bike shop owners told Harris they'd seen a 60-percent increase in sales. Five years later, when Harris' fork fell apart, Zion Cycles founder Fred Pagles gave him a new Trek Remedy and free service and parts for life. When Harris protested, Pagles said: ""If you hadn't done what you did, I wouldn't have a business.""

There is still a touch of uncertainty about what will happen to unofficial trails on BLM land that have become wildly popular and mapped, like Little Creek and Dig It on Grafton Mesa. A long-in-the-works travel management plan is nearing completion, and locals are optimistic the BLM will bring them into the fold and declare them legal, since closing them would be more complicated and potentially hurt the area's economic growth.

But whatever happens, the local scene is plenty healthy, as evidenced by a recent show of support for Harris after he was diagnosed with gum cancer. In mid-May, Harris underwent surgery to remove a tumor, and doctors removed his fibula from his lower right leg and used it to rebuild his jaw. Locals held a fundraiser to help cover his medical bills, bringing in nearly $25,000. Over the Edge built a new Ibis Mojo HD for Harris to ride into his 80s. At a post-ride barbecue in October, Harris said he still didn't have the leg power to ride technical terrain, as much as he wanted to.

Instead, he had been maintaining trails he built a generation ago. ""I get out there at daylight and get done before it gets too hot,"" he said. ""Me and the dog, Hazel."" His tools were hidden in the bushes as he spoke.

I asked Harris what he thinks of the community that he and his brother helped to create. ""It amazes me what's happened here,"" he said. ""When I was building trail, I never expected any payback. Payback was people having a smile on their face, loving what you built. I can't believe this came out of us wanting to ride a trail on Gooseberry.""

RIDE: Although most trails are on MTB Project, for a more localized resource check out swutahtrails.com, a brand-new, one-stop tool for trail descriptions, photos and videos with downloadable maps and GPS navigation. Trails are sorted into geographical zones to showcase the various regions throughout the county.

STAY: You'll find ample lodging options throughout the county via Google. We stayed at a rental house in Sand Hollow Resort, which suited our large group well and was convenient to both Hurricane and St. George. You can also check out Gooseberry Yurts for a more primitive, adventurous option—with four days' worth of riding from your front door. The 20-foot-diameter yurts sleep five to seven adults and cost $150 a night.

EAT: Again, options abound, but you can't go wrong with Lonny Boy's BBQ in Hurricane, George's Corner Restaurant in St. George and the Bit and Spur Restaurant and Saloon in Springdale. Affogato is a worthy coffee shop in St. George, while River Rock Roasting Co., in La Verkin, serves tasty food and everything from coffee to beer on the edge of a canyon carved by the Virgin River.

SHOP: Over the Edge Sports in Hurricane treated our team well, whether that meant providing TLC to the day's testing steeds each evening, sharing local beta on where to ride or leading the way on hard-to-follow loops (OTE also runs a free shop ride every Saturday, which is a great way to see the area's nooks and crannies).

Gerry Butts, Trudeau's close friend and former principal secretary, wrote to the committee chair, Liberal MP Anthony Housefather, stating that after watching the testimony of Jody Wilson-Raybould, he believes his evidence would be of assistance as the committee considers alleged interference into the decision to prosecute the Quebec-based engineering and construction company.

I just made the following request of the Justice Committee Chair. <a href=""https://t.co/MUCJwnldui"">pic.twitter.com/MUCJwnldui</a> —@gmbutts

""I need a short period of time to receive legal advice concerning my evidence and to be able to produce relevant documents to the committee,"" the wrote in the letter.

The committee agreed to hear from Butts and will invite him to appear next Wednesday. MPs will also call on Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick and Nathalie Drouin, the deputy minister of justice, back to testify.

Wernick and Drouin appeared last week.

Butts resigned from the PMO on Feb. 18 amid allegations he and others exerted political interference on Wilson-Raybould to override the Public Prosecution Service director's decision to prosecute SNC-Lavalin.

""At all times, I and those around me acted with integrity and a singular focus on the best interests of all Canadians,"" Butts said in a statement at the time.

Need for 'solution'

He said the swirling accusations were distracting from the ""vital work"" the prime minister and his staff were doing for Canadians.

""My reputation is my responsibility, and that is for me to defend. It is in the best interests of the office and its important work for me to step away,"" he said.

Trudeau was asked about his recent dealings with Butts today, and he confirmed that the last time the pair spoke was last Wednesday.

In her testimony to committee Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould detailed a meeting with Butts on Dec. 5, 2018. She said she wanted to speak about several things, including the barrage of people ""hounding"" her and her staff about the impact of prosecuting SNC-Lavalin.

""Towards the end of the meeting I raised how I needed everyone to stop talking to me about SNC as I had made up my mind and the engagements were inappropriate,"" she testified. ""Gerry then took over the conversation and said how we need a solution on the SNC stuff — he said I needed to find a solution.""

Jody Wilson-Raybould’s bombshell testimony prompted calls from the Conservative Party and the NDP to resign. 2:14

Wilson-Raybould said she was pressed by 11 PMO and other government officials, who continued to remind her of the economic and political consequences after she had made her independent decision as attorney general to proceed with the prosecution.

I intend to move these motions at the next Justice Committee meeting. <a href=""https://t.co/zm1gKzo43w"">pic.twitter.com/zm1gKzo43w</a> —@Cooper4SAE

Liberal MP and justice committee chair Anthony Housefather issued a statement saying the committee needs more clarification after reviewing Wilson-Raybould's testimony.

""We believe that it is important that Mr. Butts respond to the account of the meeting of the 18th provided by Ms. Jody Wilson-Raybould, in addition to the other allegations about him and PMO colleagues mentioned in her testimony,"" the statement reads.

Given that Wernick and Drouin appeared prior to cabinet confidence, and solicitor client privilege on the SNC file was waived for testimony before the Committee, and the fact they were mentioned by Wilson-Raybould in relation to the December 19 phone call and subsequent events, the committee wants to hear their recollection of events and conversations, Housefather wrote.

""We will consider next steps following hearing from these witnesses,"" he said.

Conservative MP Michael Cooper tweeted that he wants to call Trudeau to testify for two hours. He also wants Wilson-Raybould to return to testify, without any constraints due to solicitor-client privilege or cabinet confidence.

The government tabled a broad waiver, but Wilson-Raybould said it still limited what she could say about her resignation from cabinet, as well as her time as veterans affairs minister.

Good day, and welcome to the SNC-Lavalin's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Denis Jasmin. Please go ahead, sir.

Denis Jasmin

Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me today are Neil Bruce, President and CEO; and Sylvain Girard, Executive Vice President and CFO.

Our earnings announcement was released this morning, and we have posted a slide presentation on the Investors section of our website. If you are not using today's webcast, please ensure to open the presentation as we will refer to it during this call. The recording of today's call and webcast will also be available on our website within 24 hours. [Operator Instructions]

I would also like to draw your attention to Slide 2 of the presentation. Information in this presentation and remarks made by the speakers today will contain statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and, therefore, subject to risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements represent our expectation as of today and, accordingly, are subject to change. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law. A description of the risk factors that may affect future results is contained in the company's MD&A available on our website and in our filings with the Canadian Securities Administrators.

During today's call, we will also discuss certain non-IFRS financial numbers. You can find reconciliation of these numbers with comparable IFRS measures in the presentation and in our MD&A.

With that, I will turn the conference over to Neil Bruce. Neil?

Neil Bruce

Thank you, Denis, and good afternoon, everyone. Instead of me going through the slides, let me cover a few topics before Sylvain covers the financials. First, a quick summary of the 2018 takeaways. I would like to stress that 2018 had its fair share of positive news. Unfortunately, these stories have been completely overshadowed by the unacceptable news regarding one of our mining projects in South America. There have also been headwinds in terms of overall volatility within the Oil & Gas sector. These headwinds have been amplified by geopolitical issues, which began in August and continued throughout the year and which are impacting some of our prospects going forward.

No doubt, these are two important issues. However, I would like to talk about some of the really good work done by the talented people at SNC-Lavalin. First, Infrastructure, Nuclear and EDPM are performing well. In fact, EDPM recorded an industry-leading margin of 11.2% in the quarter.

Second, in 2018, the company was ranked number three international design firm in the world, and we're incredibly proud of our progress on this front. Third, we were the cochair of the World Economic Forum's Partnership Against Corruption Initiative, and I'm personally incredibly proud about the work that we do in this area.

As we head for 2019, we are disappointed that we're starting a bit further back for the year than what our original expectations were, but we have to note the positives. We have a strong backlog of $14.9 billion. In Q4 of 2018, we booked $2.2 billion of new work and have many really interesting quality projects.

We also gave guidance, which is $2 to $2.20 for the adjusted diluted EPS from E&C and $3 to $3.20 for the adjusted consolidated diluted EPS. We have a clear capital allocation strategy and there is no need for us to raise any form of equity. From this perspective, I think there's a lot to look forward to and there is good news in terms of where we're going in 2019.

Let's now talk about the Mining & Metallurgy project. We are incredibly disappointing -- disappointed with the situation. Ultimately, the project management did not appropriately adhere to the terms and conditions of the contract and this impacted the overall project forecast. Basically, we were accepting commitments within the supply chain prior to getting concurrents on the agreement with our customer. It is a matter that exposes the company to the differential between what's agreed with the customer and what we've actually agreed with our supply chain.

We have gone through the circumstances in absolute detail, conducted peer reviews, examined risk control mechanisms, changed personnel, added oversight and double-checked everything. We are certain that this is an isolated case.

Ian Edwards, our new COO, and I have met with the customer personally, following further negotiations and discussions. I've agreed to settle the dispute through an accelerated arbitration process. We also made the decision that our Mining & Metallurgy segment will cease to bid on lump-sum EPC contracts, and we reinforced our risk controls vigorously internally. There is no known evidence that any similar issues exist on any other projects. We acted quickly and decisively and transformed. We are confident that this is a one-off situation across our business. We expect that anything that we need to cover over time should come back as a positive contribution.

Now moving to Oil & Gas. There are a couple of things going on in the Oil & Gas sector. First, if you look at funding acquired on Oil & Gas back in 2014, oil prices were higher than they have been over the last few years. They have picked up a little bit in the last year, but prices remain volatile. Customers are taking a bit longer for project approvals and their capital allocation strategy. Secondly, we are also involved in contracts where there have been larger length of time changes and that makes it sometimes difficult to recognize revenue in a specific quarter.

And thirdly, we have geopolitical piece. We disclosed back in August the potential effects of the Canadian-Saudi relationship issue. I am confident that this does not affect the work that we do today and the backlog that we currently have in terms of completed work, but it does place major uncertainty right now into the future prospects. However, we are fully committed to the Saudi market and supporting our valued Saudi customers.

When you take the forward-looking prospects and you roll them into your overall accounting and financial models, that's the reason that we took a goodwill impairment within the Oil & Gas business, a level of uncertainty over further prospects. This has been built into our 2019 guidance.

That being said, there have been a number of good contract wins and developments in Q4. Our EDPM segment secured a contract with the U.K. Ministry of Defense as engineering delivering partner for the Defence Equipment & Support as part of the Aurora partnership.

Our Infrastructure sector implemented an earthquake early warning system on the Canada Line in BC. It is the first of its kind in Canada. On the Clean Power front, the John Hart Generating Station operations have been transferred to the new facility. The new facility has been completed and turned on in Q4.

The Oil & Gas sector signed an agreement with Perdaman for the development of the Aurora plant in Western Australia. Argentina's Embalse reactor was brought back into service by our nuclear team, marking the end of the life extension project.

Now let's talk about the events of the last two weeks. This is not easy for me, for the management team or for any of our dedicated, hard-working employees to see SNC-Lavalin's name in the media repeatedly as it has been over the last couple of weeks.

There are a couple of things I would really like to emphasize. First, I want to categorically say that we have done nothing wrong as a company and none of our current employees have done anything wrong. We wanted to raise awareness. We have never asked for the charges to be dropped. We have never asked for anything to be supplemented outside the judicial system. Did we ask for the remediation agreement that was enacted by parliament to be applied in our case? Yes. Without getting into the legal aspect of the details, we believe that ultimately, the public interest would be served through a remediation agreement.

The remediation agreement is constructed to do two things. One is to help bring individuals to justice and to make sure that the innocents, defined as being employees, the pensioners, the shareholders, the supply chain, are not harmed. At the moment, we believe that exactly the opposite is happening. And I have to ask if this is fundamentally fair. From that perspective, the work that we were doing in terms of meetings, and we have had meetings with opposition parties, both federally and provincially, this was an awareness campaign. We ask why shouldn't the remediation agreement apply to the company? And our position still stands.

We believe that a remediation agreement is the right way to take us forward, but we must focus on where we can make a difference. So that is why we are now concentrating solely on defending the company through the courts. We are confident that we will get into the -- that we will get the right outcome despite the fact that this will likely end up in a tenure process. Throughout, we will ensure that we continue to maximize shareholder value and we'll work to protect our innocent employees and stakeholders.

Let me now comment on Ian Edward's appointment. The appointment of Ian as Chief Operating Officer is something that has been in works for quite a while. Ian has done a fantastic job of taking on the Infrastructure sector when it was having difficulties a few years ago and turned it into a breakeven, and then ultimately, to a profitable sector, all while managing a lot of our large contracts in terms of risk management and execution.

We believe that Ian can bring that experience to a wider platform to drive consistent delivery, capability across the company. This is another part of our evolution as a company to ensure that we execute projects in a consistent manner, that we look to capitalize on our fantastic employees and we do not just keep talent within individual sectors.

Let me conclude by summarizing our 2019 priorities. These are clearly cash-generation, long-term sustainable organic growth in terms of what we bid and execute, and with Ian's appointment, consistent delivery across the whole business as well as taking on our whole technology and digital offerings to an even greater level. We have some -- we have done some fantastic work in that area, but we want to make it even bigger part of our business going forward.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Sylvain to go over our financial results.

Sylvain Girard

Thank you, Neil, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start on Slide 8. Our year-to-date adjusted net income from E&C and the consolidated adjusted net income was in line with our revised guidance issued on February 11, 2019, at $0.25 and $1.31 per diluted share, respectively. As disclosed in our January 2018 press release, we have recorded in Q4 a $1.2 billion noncash goodwill impairment charge relating to the Oil & Gas segment.

Total segment EBIT for Q4 2018 amounted to negative $200 million as it included a negative segment EBIT of $349 million in Mining & Metallurgy and a negative segment EBIT of $23 million in Oil & Gas. The drivers that generated these losses were all previously explained in January 28 and February 11 press releases. The Nuclear, Infrastructure and EDPM segments had a strong quarter with segment EBIT margin of 16%, 6% and 11%, respectively.

Corporate SG&A expenses amounted to $61 million for the quarter. Note that this amount included $25 million for a Guarantee Minimum Pension equalization expense for past service costs. This is mainly related to the amendment of the pension formula to equalize benefits for men and women and to adjust for the unequal results produced by the GMP between May 1990 and April 1997. This is a company's preliminary assessment as a ruling rendered in October 2018 by the UK High Court, and put forward a range of possible approaches that could be adopted to equalize GMPs. It is left to individual pension plan trustees and employers to determine their preferred approach.

Total revenues for Q4 2018 amounted to $2.6 billion, which is lower than Q4 2017. The variation was mainly due to lower revenues in Oil & Gas due to completion of major projects and internal power has made a strategic decision to exit this market. This was mostly offset by an increase in infrastructure. Our 2018 revenues were composed of 74% of reimbursable and engineering service contracts and 26% of EPC fixed-price contracts compared to a mix of 72-28 in 2017.

Our backlog was at $14.9 billion at the end of the year. Our book-to-bill ratio was at 0.9% in the quarter and 1.1% for the year. Our bookings for the quarter were $2.2 billion, which includes $0.9 billion in EDPM, $0.6 billion in Oil & Gas and $0.2 billion in Clean Power. Our backlog remains heavily weighted in reimbursable and engineering service contracts with 73% versus 27% for EPC fixed-price contracts.

And lastly on the slide, in order to strengthen the company's balance sheet, the Board of Directors have reduced the quarterly dividend by $0.187 per share to $0.10. On an annual basis, this will allow SNC-Lavalin to retain approximately $131 million of cash, which will be use to deleverage the balance sheet and provide the company additional flexibility in the future.

Now moving to Slide 9. We kept this slide in the presentation to be consistent with previous quarters and I won't spend much time on it. We see the negative segment EBIT in Mining & Metallurgy caused by the 346 million loss on a major EPC project as well as the negative segment EBIT in Oil & Gas, while the Nuclear and Infrastructure segments had a good quarter. The EDPM segment also had a good quarter with an 11% segment EBIT margin.

Turning to Slide 10. Our operations used $112 million in cash in Q4 2018. On a year-to-date basis, our operations used $304 million in cash compared to $236 million in 2017. This was mainly driven by a lower EBIT from E&C segments, the cash outflow of $89 million for the class action settlement and an increase in interest paid, partially offset by a decrease in restructuring costs and income tax paid.

The 2018 cash consumption is primarily driven by the closeout of our terminal business on the major EPC challenging project in Mining & Metallurgy, higher working capital usage in our Oil & Gas business in the Middle East and finding a milestone achievement on major projects in infrastructure. Note that a significant cash consumption related to the revised reforecasted costs on the mining project will occur in Q1 and Q2 2019 as we expect this project to be completed towards the end of Q2.

Moving to Slide 11. We closed the year with $634 million in cash and cash equivalents, $1.7 billion in net recourse debt and $2.1 billion in unused capacity under our $2.6 billion committed revolving credit facility. The net recourse debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio based on our financial statements was 3.3, while this ratio calculated according with the terms of the company's revolving facility agreement as amended was 2.9 times. I remind you that our covenant and ratio calculation with our lenders has been temporally increased to 4 times and that the forecasted loss on the Mining & Metallurgy project is to be considered as a nonrecurring item up to maximum amount of $310 million. Also note that on February 15, DBRS issued a rating report, placing the company under review with negative implications, while S&P on February 12 downgraded the company's rating to BBB minus from BBB, but revised its outlook to stable.

Now turning to my last slide, Slide 12. We've already disclosed our EPS outlook in the February 11, 2019 press release, but we decided to give you additional details, such as adjusted EBITDA from E&C and expected effective tax rate on adjusted E&C in order to help you better assess the year to come. Note that the guidance on EBITDA reflect the adoption of IFRS 16 and does not assume any recoveries from the upcoming arbitration process on the previously mentioned mining project.

This concludes my presentation. We can now open the line for questions. Thank you.

Neil Bruce

We can open the line for questions. Operator?

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Yuri Lynk.

Yuri Lynk

I'll ask the obvious question, Neil. Can you give us an update to the extent possible on 407 process?

Neil Bruce

The 407 process is going fine. It's a confidential piece. It continues to progress. And as soon as we've got some news, we'll let everybody know.

Yuri Lynk

Okay. So no change to -- the time line seems to have slipped. Any -- I mean, can you give us any color on why that's happened?

Neil Bruce

No. It's a detailed process, and it needs to be done properly. So it's progressing. It's progressing well from our perspective and we'll update everybody when it's done.

Yuri Lynk

Okay. What would be the use of proceeds as you see it today? What would be the priorities?

Neil Bruce

Same as they were last quarter and the quarter before.

Yuri Lynk

Okay. Just switching gears. What's the strategy right now within the company? Have you moved on from all hope of remediation agreement? And are you carrying on as if this is going to go to trial and preparing for everything that, that entails?

Neil Bruce

Yes. I mean, our innocent employees are being used as a puck in a political hockey game. And frankly, they don't deserve it, and we've had enough. So we are 100% concentrating now on defending ourselves in court. Unfortunately, if you look at the time involved, so we're 6, 7 years past the events of 2012, highly likely that this is going to go on for a number of -- another number of years. And frankly, we've had enough of all of that, and we're just going to vigorously defend our self in court, and that's our strategy.

Yuri Lynk

Okay. And do you look to focus your growth outside of the country? And as you go down that route or carry on as usual and see what happens? Just curious as to what management and the board are thinking as we go forward here?

Neil Bruce

No. I mean, we've got plenty of opportunities to grow the business outside of Canada. And -- but we're also connect -- we are connected to the Canadian market and to our Canadian employees as well. So from that perspective, we're going to make sure that we defend ourselves through the court process. And we are pretty confident that in the end, we will win through and we'll continue to grow the -- really going to see the ability to grow the Canadian business the way that we should have been doing over the last 6 years.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And we will now take our next question from Mark Neville.

Mark Neville

If I could just ask a follow-up on the 407. I appreciate the very detailed process. But just curious, at this point, if there's been any indicative offers, if this is really a pricing issue. Just curious if you can help us with that.

Neil Bruce

Well, it's a confidential process, so we'll update you once we're in a position to release that information.

Mark Neville

Okay. Then just on free cash. For the earnings guidance for 2019, the $2 to $2.20, I think in the last call, you spoke to a 70% conversion rate by 2020 or 2021. I'm sort of just curious if that is still your expectation, sort of what to expect for free cash flow in 2019?

Sylvain Girard

Yes. So, the 70% conversion out in 2020 and forward remains valid. I think there's a bit of adjustment you've got to make on that with the implementation of IFRS 16. It does change a bit of the geography in the cash flow statement. But that's still unplanned. As it relates to '19, we're obviously impacted quite a bit by the mining project. There is a significant cash outflow that will result from that. So that, we thought we'd be kind of trending towards that 70%, a little bit underneath the halfway point probably, and now with this cash outflow, we'll be more than that. But we'll still be positive on free cash flow conversion.

Mark Neville

And maybe just on the dividend. Just sort of the motivation around the cut. I do appreciate sort of where the balance sheet is at and the need to preserve cash. But just any thoughts on that. Is it really just the E&C business is just not generating enough to cover it right now? Just any thoughts around that.

Sylvain Girard

Yes, I think it goes to my earlier comment. I mean, a little bit more than a couple of hundred million dollars coming out on this mining project from a cash standpoint, so that hurts the free cash flow quite a bit. So the objective here was really to strengthen the balance sheet, produce leverage and protect the investment grade. So that's kind of where we're at. And we feel confident this is what it's going to give us.

Mark Neville

If I can just maybe stick one last one in. Just on the covenant. I guess if I do some math, it looks like the add-backs to debt are about 500 million. Is that ballpark about right?

Sylvain Girard

I'm sorry. What's the...

Mark Neville

Just on the covenant calculation. Yes, the covenant calculation, the 2.9x. I mean, to get there, it looks like there's about 500 million add-back to debt on my math. Is that about right?

Sylvain Girard

I don't have the specific number. I mean, when you need that back in some of the advances and so forth. And then you take the EBITDA and you have to adjust for capital to make it on a cash basis. So we have to come back to you on this. If that's not good enough, that would be the number. And don't forget to adjust for the 310 million of nonrecurring item.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Derek Spronck. Please go ahead.

Derek Spronck

Just on Ian Edwards, I think you reviewed, I guess, the mining projects, but how about other fixed-price contracts in infrastructure? Have you done another review of your fixed-price contracts in infrastructure? And are there any potential concerns out there that you have? And again, I bring up the Champlain Bridge again in light of the fact that we are in a bit of a different situation than we were a few quarters ago.

Neil Bruce

Yes, I mean, I think you've asked a good question. Yes, we have gone through more than 20 of our top contracts. In terms of the work we do in this arena, we've gone through. We've done the peer reviews. We've done all the checks again to make sure that what we approved is what we signed and that they are on track and we don't have anything of any similar nature whatsoever, and we concluded that by exercise. We did that immediately. It took us about a week to do, but we've completed the exercise and we can confirm that there's nothing of the same ilk in any of the sectors, not just the infrastructure sector.

Derek Spronck

Okay, that's great. And then another question. Just on the remediation agreement. I mean, I understand that you're focused 100% on the trial now. The Canadian public prosecutor did say at the time that she wouldn't be inviting you to negotiate an agreement at this time. That was her word, at this time. Is there is still a chance that they could come back and offer a remediation agreement? Again, I understand that you're focused on the trial. But could the Canadian public prosecutor return and look to negotiate with you in the future? And then finally, once the full trial starts, presuming that the preliminary trial results in a full trial, does that then preclude you from negotiating a remediation agreement in the future? Or could you say, a year into the full trial, come back and negotiate a remediation agreement with the Canadian public prosecutor?

Neil Bruce

I think it's really clear -- crystal clear that the DPP has discretion to invite us in at any time. But that's certainly their discretion. If we'll be invited in, of course. Of course, we would because that's basically been our priority. And we believe that whether it's before or during, the DPP does have that discretion. So I mean, it's not really a question for us. I think the only thing we'd really, really want to see is that if we were ever invited in the future, then of course, we would be a willing participant. But frankly, it doesn't look like that today. So what our employees want to hear is that we're moving on and we're going to defend them and the innocent employees through this process and we are going to do that rigorously through the court system.

Operator

And we will take our next question from Jacob Bout.

Jacob Bout

Given all that's happened in the past six months, at what point do you look at a Plan B or a Plan C, for instance, either splitting up the company or selling certain divisions?

Neil Bruce

Well, I think we've mentioned before that we formed a committee in the board in terms of looking at alternatives. I mean, that's obviously a confidential process in terms of the details of all of that. But as we've said before, we are constantly looking at -- our priority is maintaining and looking after shareholder value. And with that in mind, we continue to look at all of our -- all of the future opportunities.

Jacob Bout

You commented on the EDPM margins being quite strong, but revenues were down year-on-year for the quarter. What was the driver there?

Sylvain Girard

I think last year, we had a quite strong activity across the board, especially in the U.S. with the sima remediation work. So we had a bit of a downscale on that.

Jacob Bout

And then my last question here is, I guess with some press out there about potential changes to the integrity regime, there might be some changes to the automatic 10-year suspension. Are you aware of any of this and any comments?

Neil Bruce

I mean, it's public information, so I mean, you've got as much as we've got. And like I said, we just need to get on with the business of defending ourselves in court and that's something further down the line.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Benoit Poirier.

Benoit Poirier

Sylvain, could you provide maybe some color about the cash outlay expected in Q1, Q2 with respect to the mining project?

Sylvain Girard

Yes, I mean, like I said, it's actually over $200 million both in Q1, Q2. I'd say, the biggest piece in Q1. Yes. Yes, over $200 million cumulatively and you split that between Q1 and Q2. Yes, there's a little bit in Q3.

Benoit Poirier

Okay. And for Clean Power, I mean, you're ramping down one project and ramping up another one. The backlog has increased. Could you maybe mention more color about the past for profitability or what we should expect for Clean Power going forward?

Sylvain Girard

Well, I think Clean Power, what you're going to see increasing and continuing is the Linxon activities. So I think we're very pleased with how the John Hart project went. And I think as we close the year, we start to ramp up some of the geographies that Linxon has gone very well. We've still got a few more coming in online this quarter, so that will be where you'll see the increased activity.

Benoit Poirier

Okay. And last one for me. With respect to the potential contract Oil & Gas in Western Australia, obviously, it's something to monitor and that could be pretty sizable. So what's your level of confidence to reaching that build deal or maybe the next milestone for this particular project?

Neil Bruce

Well, I mean, we are optimistic that we can support our customer in terms of developing. And that's -- I mean, ultimately that's a customer decision in terms of the next phase and the economics and everything that go with it. But I mean, it looks like a good prospect.

Operator

And we will take our next question from Michael Tupholme.

Michael Tupholme

Sylvain, earlier when you were commenting on the leverage ratio calculated under the credit agreement versus your own calculations, I just wanted to confirm a couple of things. So first of all, the credit agreement calculation that gets us 2.9x, that does add back $310 million?

Sylvain Girard

Yes. The $310 million is a non-recurring, absolutely.

Michael Tupholme

Okay. And then I think there was -- I missed it, but I think there was reference to some other adjustments to adjusted trailing EBITDA beyond simply that $310 million amount. Can you just go over what those other adjustments were?

Sylvain Girard

At a high-level, it's essentially you've got your capital more on a cash basis. So you look at the dividends coming in, so you kind of remove some of the equity pickups and replace it by dividend or distributions. That's basically what you get. And we have disclosed this number because obviously, we're getting a number of questions and we will continue to disclose that into the upcoming quarters.

Michael Tupholme

And then in terms of free cash flow, you mentioned that for the year, it should be positive. Obviously, that sounds like the biggest drag this year is going to be the inflows from the mining project, which you've quantified. If we were to look at free cash flow excluding the drag from the mining project, would you have been or would you have expected to be somewhere around the same kind of halfway to that 70% conversion that you've previously talked about?

Sylvain Girard

Yes, yes. It would be slightly better actually but yes.

Michael Tupholme

And then Neil, I'm not sure if you can add anything to this, but you did mention that there was a special committee of the board formed to look at options to protect shareholder value and stakeholder value. Can you just talk about sort of how advanced that has become over the last couple of months in terms of any work that's been done? Like have you hired advisers? Have they actually begun to sort of form some options? Or is this still fairly early days?

Neil Bruce

I think your two questions, the answer is yes and yes. So yes, we've got advisers and yes, they've started working.

Michael Tupholme

And maybe just lastly, so now with respect to the Mining & Metallurgy segment, I realize it's going to be a lot smaller here than it was before with the shift out of EPC mining work. But in your 2019 guidance, are you assuming that whatever the Mining & Metallurgy segment contributes in 2019, is it contributing positive EBIT or is there still a loss assumed in the guidance you've given us?

Sylvain Girard

It's thereabouts breakeven, I would say.

Operator

We will take our next question from Devin Dodge. Please go ahead.

Devin Dodge

I just wanted to come back to the decision to reduce the dividend. On the one hand, it seems prudent as it allows more cash to be directed towards debt repayment. But at the same time, you're looking to sell down your stake in the 407, which would potentially be a pretty significant deleveraging event. How should we be thinking about this? Just wondering is there any change in the commitment to proceed with the 407 sale or whether there's a timing difference in that transaction versus when you need the cash? Or I'd say the lenders, when you negotiated your covenant relief, whether they insisted on this? Just any color there would be helpful.

Sylvain Girard

Yes, It's not your last point, for sure. I think it's more like in any M&A process, there's uncertainty around the finalization, the timing and all that. And I think when we look at where we're at and how, especially this level of cash out we're going to impact in the first half of the year, the fact that we've got downgraded by the rating by S&P. So like exactly what you said, it's a prudent thing to do.

Devin Dodge

Okay. And maybe going to the Oil & Gas business. I recognize there's a lot of moving parts here, including increasing the focus on the North American market. But how should we be expecting or what should we be expecting doing revenues for this business in 2019? I know in Q4, revenues were down about 40%. I don't suspect that is a good go-forward kind of revenue growth expectation. But just how should we be thinking about that in 2019?

Neil Bruce

Yes, I mean, I think part of what's linked to that is we -- as I said before, I mean, a large part of our revenues are in the Middle East, and they are on top of what we're doing in America. And a large part of that has been exciting. I mean, we are completely and definitely committed to supporting or signing customers in terms of what they need and the value that we can bring. However, as we've said before, there is a degree of uncertainty around what we will be selected for. So that's why in the 2019 guidance, we've actually taken down our expectations around the Oil & Gas, specifically around the Middle East just in case that turns out to be the fact. So it's a bit difficult to be any more precise at this time on that, but within our 2019 guidance, it includes taking out a degree of uncertainty around the oil and gas market that we do in the Middle East.

Michael Tupholme

Okay. Yes, that's fair, okay. And then maybe just one last one. Just wondering if the, I would say, the strained relationship between Canada and Saudi Arabia, obviously, it's impacted your ability at work in Saudi Arabia. But has that also extended outside of the KSA?

Neil Bruce

No.

Operator

We will take our next question from Chris Murray.

Chris Murray

Neil, maybe just thinking about all the different moving parts we've got going into this year. You talked about walking away from certain portions of the mining business. And then I guess, there's also been some commentary around your ability to bid on new work. How should we think about your ability to maintain your backlog through the year? And can you maybe give us an idea of where you think you still have opportunities to grow and maybe offset some of these losses? And I guess what I'm trying to think about is, do you have a reasonable expectation you can maintain at least a 1x book-to-bill ratio for the year?

Neil Bruce

Yes, I mean, so to answer the question in the middle of that first. We have absolutely no restrictions whatsoever on bidding and winning anything to do with a Canadian government work. Whether it's federal or provincial, we've got the agreement that was put in place earlier than that. That is maintained until the end of any form of court process. So we are not concerned with that at all. And the restriction doesn't apply. I mean, that form of restriction doesn't apply anywhere else because, ultimately, everywhere else in the world, I mean, basically, they don't penalize you until you're found guilty, and they don't penalize you when you're still innocent. So from that perspective, we are free to bid on anything that we -- I think is going to add value to our customer base and to our employees and to the company. And we're very, very confident around a number of prospects both inside Canada and internationally. So yes, I mean, we had a great Q4. We've got $14.9 billion. And I see absolutely no reason whatsoever why we will not continue to progress that from this point onwards.

Chris Murray

All right. So you believe you actually have a reasonable shot at increasing the backlog year-over-year? Is that a fair way to characterize that?

Neil Bruce

Yes, absolutely. I mean, the only thing that -- what our competitive disadvantage on is the fact that we -- this overhang continues to be there and competitors in the U.S. are pretty ruthless and they use it against us. even when they're using it against us, we continue to win through and we win our fair share, and we expect that to continue.

Chris Murray

Okay, fair enough. And then Sylvain, maybe for you, just a quick question, thinking about cash flow. And I know you've talked about some issues front end of the year. You're bringing the dividend down. Still very conscious about your debt levels. While thinking about your investments in capital -- and let's think about maybe outside the 407 for a moment. You have the recent rating changes or maybe your ability to fund new investments, does that start to impact investments in new concessions as you move through '19, and maybe into 2020? And does that as well on the other side maybe change her perspective on the portfolio and maybe accelerating any potential sales?

Sylvain Girard

Well, we have in the coming year in the '19, we do have a few project completions that we've accounted for in our budget into the investment and we're fine with that. I think we're fully committed to that and there is no issue there, so we'll continue on that. The -- as we look forward on projects, we see ourselves continuing to invest in concessions. So that's -- that's not something we consider a problem. Now what -- when we created the infrastructure partners fund, it was exactly to recycle our cash. Once investment concessions were stabilized, then we would put them into the fund. So I think that strategy's still valid and there's no change to that. I think as in any times, good or bad, we would try to recycle that cash as soon as we could basically, that's basically the purpose of this fund, so nothing changed there either.

Chris Murray

And your change in debt rating doesn't impact your ability to fund any of these transactions?

Sylvain Girard

Not at this point. And I think some of the actions that we're taking now, including the dividend cut, is obviously to secure our balance sheet and investment grade. So I think we're in a good shape for that.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Maxim Sytchev. Please go ahead.

Maxim Sytchev

Sylvain, I just had a clarification question in terms of the comments around mining. So when you're making a reference, the $200 million drag, is that on, I guess, working capital or was that on EBIT?

Sylvain Girard

On cash. So the EBIT impact has been taken. And then as you complete the project, you basically have all your costs to go and your accounts payable to go out essentially. So it's working capital. It's all working capital essentially because the loss has taken. The project is a massive loss, so yes.

Maxim Sytchev

So I guess, it's conceivable, we're going to be sort of in the same position as in last year's H1, like the drag of kind of $439 million for the consolidated entity, right? Because we don't have the breakdown segment-by-segment?

Sylvain Girard

Well, you will see the big drag in Q1, Q2, absolutely.

Maxim Sytchev

And then so in terms of the mining, the question that I have, I mean, obviously, if you stop doing EPC-related work, how do you think about matching the revenue and the headcount in that division on a prospective basis?

Neil Bruce

Well, I think we're going to concentrate very much on a lot of our bread-and-butter in the past, which is EPCM. And so reimbursable, our target cost EPCM work, together with the sustaining capital, that we have actually built up a nice competitive business within that area. So we are absolutely continuing with that. So to be clear, we're not exiting the sector. And what we're also looking as well in terms of how we can potentially utilize resources wider from other sectors within that to make it a bit more competitive.

Maxim Sytchev

And then in terms of -- do you mind maybe providing a bit of color in terms of where you see the opportunities right now in mining? Is it in LatAm? I mean, is it iron-ore-related just so that we can get a better sense where you're tracking those potential contracts?

Neil Bruce

Yes, I think most of it at the moment is either -- the vast majority of the stuff that we're looking at in the moment is really in the Middle East, the bigger and wider Middle East. And it's acid plants, it's some fertilizers, potentially gold projects. And there are also opportunities in the Middle East around aluminum smelters, and work that we have done really successfully in the past, and there's opportunities to sort of reengage and work for some brownfield prospects.

Maxim Sytchev

And it's fair to assume it's going to be outside of the KSA, right, Neil?

Neil Bruce

No, not necessarily. Like we said, I mean, we want to support our customers in KSA. We would like to carry on across not just Oil & Gas but across all of our businesses, in infrastructure in rail and mining in KSA. But that decision is with the individual customers. But we intend to and we have been engaging with them. I mean, I was in Saudi twice last week, and we want to continue to do the work there.

Maxim Sytchev

And the diplomatic sort of spat right now, that would not preclude you from participating in those contracts on the mining side?

Neil Bruce

That's up to the individual customers, but we're not going to take the offer and give up. And that was the reason why I was there twice last week.

Maxim Sytchev

Right. Okay, no, no, fair enough. And so again, just to clarify, for mining, Sylvain, you were talking about, let's call it, breakeven EBIT for the year correct?

Sylvain Girard

Correct, yes.

Maxim Sytchev

And then Neil, if you don't mind going back to Oil & Gas, you're talking about improving EBIT for the entirety of 2019 versus '18. Do you mind maybe talking about the buckets where you're tracking potential contracts? And what gives you the confidence you're going to be able to drive the profitability higher this year?

Neil Bruce

Yes, I mean, I think the -- our prospects list, I mean, we've got a large offer in terms of potential prospects and they are pretty consistent with last year. And so a lot of it across the wider Middle East. Some emerging prospects in Australia and North America, especially on onshore North America both in terms of offshore, downstream, midstream areas. The only -- like we said, we're taking a more cautious approach for Oil & Gas built into our 2019 guidance, recognizing the fact that in Saudi Arabia, the Oil & Gas prospects are not in our control. We will continue to bid there, but ultimately, we just want to be cautious about the outlook on that.

Maxim Sytchev

Okay, fair enough. And then maybe if we can just circle back lastly to the Plan B sort of discussion. Is there -- I guess, two part question. One of them is, what options, I guess, are being considered, if you can discuss any? And then if there is a timeframe by which you will decide to disclose what exactly you think is the right way to protect shareholder value?

Neil Bruce

Yes, I mean, I understand the curiosity, but it is a confidential process. So when the committee and the board are in a position to disclose some of that, then obviously, we will. But until then, I can't really comment on that.

Maxim Sytchev

And so Neil, but in terms of timing, is this a 2019 event or it's kind of a moving target? Just trying to understand that dynamic better.

Neil Bruce

Well, I think it's going to be linked with everything else that's going on. So like we said, we're going to defend ourselves against the charges and we need to make sure that whatever we do minimizes or eliminates the effect should the worst come to worst, which we don't believe actually will, but it's very much linked to that.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Felicia Frederick.

Felicia Frederick

I just had a question surrounding the working capital. And I was just wondering how much working capital was tied up in the Champlain Bridge project and the two projects in South America, the two mining projects.

Sylvain Girard

Yes. We don't disclose the details of that, but it's clear that the Champlain project, with the delays in the construction that we had, we could not achieve some of the milestones that were linked to some of the last remaining steps of the construction, mainly putting the asphalt and so forth. So that's caused a cash pressure in our result in '18. So we're anticipating those to come back in the first half of '19. I think as it relates to your mining question, I guess -- yes, I mean, that's over $200 million cash out expected in the first half. So this is only one project, right, in mining.

Operator

That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Denis Jasmin, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Thank you.

(SNCAF) CEO Neil Bruce on Q4 2018 Results - Earnings Call Transcript,Seekingalpha.com,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4244056-snc-lavalin-group-inc-sncaf-ceo-neil-bruce-q4-2018-results-earnings-call-transcript
523,Empty,2019-02-27T09:00:00Z,Former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould will appear before the House of Commons justice committee to present her version of events surrounding her departure from the federal cabinet.,"Former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould will appear before the House of Commons justice committee Wednesday to present her version of events surrounding her departure from the federal cabinet. While before MPs, the following eight questions are likely to come up in one form or another as the committee tries to determine whether the Prime Minister's Office improperly pressured the former minister.

1. Was Wilson-Raybould threatened with personal or professional consequences by the Prime Minister's Office?

From testimony to the committee last week by Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick it is clear that Wilson-Raybould met with Trudeau and members of his staff to talk about SNC-Lavalin on a number of occasions. Understanding what was said in those meetings is crucial because it could shed light on whether or not Wilson-Raybould was gently nudged toward a decision, or threatened with consequences if she did not make one favourable to the PMO.

Wernick testified Feb. 21 that he did not inappropriately influence Wilson-Raybould to pressure the director of public prosecutions to sign a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with SNC-Lavalin. Trudeau and his former principal secretary, Gerry Butts — who resigned last week in response to the allegations — have also denied any wrongdoing.

It is expected that Wilson-Raybould's version of events will help shed light on whether or not the Shawcross Doctrine was violated. According to the doctrine, the attorney general must consider the impact of prosecution on the public interest. The attorney general can consult with cabinet colleagues, but those discussions are limited to hearing advice, not receiving directions.

Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick told the justice committee last week that Trudeau did not try to direct Wilson-Raybould to make a decision in favour of a deferred prosecution agreement for SNC-Lavalin. ​ (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)

2. Did Wilson-Raybould tell Trudeau she felt the Shawcross Doctrine had been crossed? If yes, when? If not, why not?

Since the Globe and Mail first reported that Wilson-Raybould felt pressured to decide in favour of a DPA for SNC-Lavalin, Trudeau has not only denied the allegations but also the very idea that such pressure, if and when it occurred, was brought to his attention.

Speaking to reporters in Winnipeg the day after Wilson-Raybould resigned from the federal cabinet on Feb. 12, Trudeau said that he was ""surprised and disappointed"" by Wilson-Raybould's decision to step down.

""In regards to the matter of SNC-Lavalin, let me be direct: the government of Canada did its job and to the clear public standards expected of it. If anybody felt differently, they had an obligation to raise that with me. No one, including Jody, did that.""

If Wilson-Raybould says she told Trudeau she felt improperly pressured, that would directly contradict the prime minister's words.

3. Why did Wilson-Raybould accept the move to Veterans Affairs in the January cabinet shuffle if she felt the PMO's conduct was improper?

On the day of the Jan. 14 cabinet shuffle, when Wilson-Raybould was moved into Veterans Affairs and made associate defence minister, she issued a long statement outlining her legislative and non-legislative achievements on the Justice file.

""Moving forward, I am very proud to be the minister of veterans affairs and associate minister of national defence. Any opportunity to serve and support Canada's veterans is a great honour, and I look forward to meeting with veterans across the country, engaging with the crucial matters that must be addressed, and continuing our government's progress to support and honour Canada's veterans,"" she said in a statement at the time.

CBC News coverage of today's testimony

Power & Politics with Vassy Kapelos will have special coverage of today's committee appearance by Jody Wilson-Raybould starting at 2 p.m. ET on CBC News Network. You can also watch P&P's special coverage starting at 3:30 p.m. ET on cbcnews.ca, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook and follow our live blog and updated stories at cbc.ca/politics.

And tune in to World at 6 on Radio One and The National tonight at 10 p.m. on CBC Television for more news and analysis on today's events.

Wernick told the committee last week that Wilson-Raybould did not want to take on either of the two Indigenous cabinet positions. Turning down an Indigenous position in favour of another cabinet post suggests there was some horse-trading when it came to her new position.

If that's the case, explaining why she made the effort to negotiate for her cabinet post with a prime minister that may have acted improperly will shed light on the legal ethics the minister was weighing at the time.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer says that PM Justin Trudeau is obviously hiding something by not allowing Jody Wilson-Raybould to tell her ""truth"" at committee today. 1:37

4. Why did Wilson-Raybould quit the federal cabinet and why did she wait until Feb. 12 to do so?

On Feb. 11, Trudeau took reporters' questions about the SNC-Lavalin affair, dismissing the accusations in the Globe and Mail as false. As partial proof of his argument Trudeau said Wilson-Raybould's ongoing ""presence in cabinet should speak for itself."" The next day Wilson-Raybould resigned.

If Wilson-Raybould tells the committee she felt the Shawcross Doctrine was crossed in the fall of 2018 and she was, in fact, threatened with personal or professional consequences by the PMO, her explanation as to why she decided to remain in cabinet despite that pressure will be key.

5. What was said in the Sept. 17 meeting between Trudeau, Wilson-Raybould and Wernick?

Wernick told the justice committee that the meeting was called by Trudeau to discuss the slow pace of legislation central to the government's Indigenous reconciliation agenda. When Wilson-Raybould asked Trudeau about SNC-Lavalin, Wernick said that Trudeau assured his then-attorney general that any decision in the case was hers to make.



​""He indicated that it was entirely her call to make, that she was the decider,"" Wernick testified. ""And that is a message the PM conveyed to the minister on every situation that I'm aware of that came up.""

6. What happened in the Dec. 5 meeting between Wilson-Raybould and Butts at the Chateau Laurier hotel in Ottawa?

Wernick told the justice committee that he did not know anything about the substance of the meeting, first reported in the Globe and Mail, between Butts and Wilson-Raybould.

According to a source that spoke to CBC News, when a staffer, the clerk or the prime minister himself speaks to a cabinet minister on an issue that will be discussed at cabinet, those conversations are considered a cabinet confidence.

The PMO has given Wilson-Raybould permission to discuss those conversations when she appears before the committee. Learning her version of events from that meeting will help the public understand whether or not Butts was involved in crossing the Shawcross Doctrine.

7. What was said in the Dec. 18 meeting between Wilson-Raybould's former chief of staff Jessica Prince, Gerry Butts and Katie Telford?

While there were no politicians present at the meeting, it stands to reason that whatever Prince heard in that meeting would have been relayed back to Wilson-Raybould. There has been no public account of this meeting, but a source tells CBC News that whatever transpired is crucial to Wilson-Raybould's argument that she was improperly pressured. Shedding some light on that conversation will help verify or discredit facts in the case.

8. What was said during the Dec. 19 phone call between Wilson-Raybould and Wernick?

Wernick told the committee last week that he ""conveyed to [Wilson-Raybould] that a lot of her colleagues, and the prime minister, were quite anxious.

""There were a lot of people worried about what would happen, the consequences — not for her, the consequences for the [SNC-Lavalin] workers and the communities and the suppliers.""

Determining the substance of that conversation will help to inform the committee as to whether or not Wernick applied any improper pressure on Wilson-Raybould.",8 questions the justice committee is likely to ask Jody Wilson-Raybould today,CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-wilson-raybould-snc-lavalin-questions-1.5034730

As early as Tuesday, Canadians could hear directly from Jody Wilson-Raybould on whether she was inappropriately pressured as attorney general to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin prosecution.

But beyond the political scandal, consider the failures of the RCMP and federal prosecutors in the case. Since 2012, the RCMP have charged eight people tied to allegations SNC engaged in bribery of foreign officials. Seven of those accused have had their cases tossed out of court due to delays or problems with evidence. RCMP and the Public Prosecution Service of Canada have yet to convict anyone from the company.

Many are asking whether they are really up to the job.

""Canada has a very poor record of enforcement,"" says James Cohen, head of the watchdog group Transparency International Canada. ""Canadian companies who engage in corruption have sadly been playing the odds that they will not get caught.""

The RCMP and PPSC's umbrella case against the company itself, SNC-Lavalin Group Inc and its subsidiaries, could be prosecutors' last hope.

To put it bluntly — they desperately need a win.

Bribing a dictator

SNC-Lavalin's troubles began in 2011, and unravelled like a spy novel.

The company, whose top construction executive for years paid bribes in Libya to win billions in contracts, moved out of the country temporarily when its patron, dictator Moammar Gadhafi, was ousted and killed.

One month later, as Libya burned, authorities in Mexico arrested a group of alleged plotters accused of trying to smuggle one of Gadhafi's sons to a life in hiding. Among those detained — but released — was an SNC money man, Stéphane Roy.

A month after that, a senior SNC-Lavalin employee invited a CBC reporter to a remote ski hill in Quebec. He whispered news of an internal revolt at SNC-Lavalin over allegations the top construction exec for years paid bribes and laundered money for the Gadhafi regime through Swiss banks, all to keep contracts flowing to SNC-Lavalin.

Those stories made headlines, sparked firings, police investigations, and eventually criminal charges.

In April 2012, that executive, Riadh Ben Aïssa, was arrested in Switzerland where he was held for two and a half years. He pleaded guilty in Switzerland to bribery and laundering millions to win SNC-Lavalin contracts in Libya.

'We've done nothing wrong'

The company has long maintained that any bribes or kickbacks were the work of rogue employees.

The company's latest CEO Neil Bruce told investors on Friday the company will vigorously defend itself against the charge its international construction arm paid bribes.

""We've done nothing wrong as a company and none of our current employees have done anything wrong,"" Bruce said.

To date, the only conviction of anyone at SNC-Lavalin related to foreign bribery was the guilty plea from Ben Aïssa secured by Switzerland.

In Canada, so far every single charge the RCMP has laid has either not stuck — or not yet been to trial.

This month, a charge of obstruction of justice was thrown out against Sami Bebawi due to court delays.

Bebawi was SNC-Lavalin's top construction executive in the years before Riadh Ben Aïssa. RCMP charged Bebawi in 2014, accusing him of sending a lawyer to visit Ben Aïssa in a Swiss prison to offer $10 million if he covered up Bebawi's involvement in Libya. What Bebawi didn't know is that he'd walked into a sting operation. Ben Aïssa has become a vital co-operating witness for the RCMP.

Bebawi still awaits trial in Montreal on fraud and bribery charges tied to SNC-Lavalin's Libya operations..

Roy, the SNC-Lavalin money man detained briefly in Mexico in 2011, also walked out of court free this month. As vice-president of finance under Ben Aïssa, Roy was charged with fraud and bribery tied to Libya. But last week a judge tossed all charges due to ""unreasonable"" delays by the prosecution.

Bangladesh boondoggle

The RCMP and PPSC suffered similar defeats in its case against employees of SNC-Lavalin International in Bangladesh over the company's failed bid to win a $1.3-billion contract to build the Padma Bridge.

The World Bank eventually debarred SNC-Lavalin from bidding on projects for 10 years.

However, Canada's prosecution of five people over the Bangladesh bridge project, including a low level engineer and two executives, eventually failed.

A joint CBC News investigation shows the bribery scandal surrounding Canada’s SNC-Lavalin is even more extensive than first reported, with its own special code involving several foreign countries. 14:55

Charges were dropped against engineer Mohammad Ismail who became a witness, turning over evidence of a widespread system of secret payments used by the SNC-Lavalin division.

The four others were acquitted, after a judge ruled that RCMP wiretap evidence collected by bugging an executive's office was inadmissible.

Complex investigations, changing priorities

Canada has a sparse record of convicting anyone in foreign bribery cases.

To date, the RCMP and PPSC have only ever secured six convictions under the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act since its adoption two decades ago.

The RCMP superintendent who led these international investigations says those convictions nonetheless sent a message to corporate Canada.

""The early cases in Canada which resulted in fines to corporations led to compliance regimes being established country-wide by Canadian firms operating globally,"" says Biagio Carrese, a 29-year veteran anti-money laundering investigator with the RCMP.

Notably, he says, the three-year prison term handed down to Nazir Karagar of CryptoMetrics Canada for attempting to bribe government officials in India put Canadian executives on notice.

""The impact was immediate. It set a precedent,"" said Carrese, who has left the RCMP and now works in the private sector.

He declined to comment on the SNC-Lavalin case, but acknowledges foreign bribery cases can fail — or struggle — due to their international scope, legal and technical complexity, and the need for an intense amount of time, resources and special expertise.

RCMP's National Division had 115 dedicated investigators by 2013. A year later, after the Parliament Hill shootings, and the rise of homegrown ISIS sympathizers, many investigators were reassigned to anti-terrorism, depleting resources in the fight against foreign bribery.

""In a world of ever-changing priorities, this can be difficult. I believe this to be true of police and prosecutors,"" Carrese said.

Watch: SNC-Lavalin affair unfolds in front of the Justice Committee

Canada's top civil servant shared some strong words with the Justice Committee regarding the ever-growing SNC-Lavalin scandal. So what should we make of his testimony? And are we any closer to understanding what actually happened? The At Issue panel is back looking for the answers. 12:57

Transparency International, in its 2018 report Exporting Corruption, noted a recent deterioration in enforcement in Canada, noting no new major cases launched in recent years.

Convictions in Canada

While no SNC-Lavalin employee has been convicted of foreign bribery, the company has faced humiliating headlines over corruption here at home.

Sûreté du Québec and provincial prosecutors won convictions against former CEO Pierre Duhaime and his executive vice-president of construction Ben Aïssa over bribes paid to win the $1.3-billion contract to build the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) superhospital.

RCMP is also still investigating SNC-Lavalin over $2.3 million in kickbacks paid to the head of the Federal Bridge Corp. Appointee Michel Fournier (former chief of staff to Jean Chrétien) is serving a five-and-a-half year prison term for accepting payments to Swiss bank accounts coded named ""Zorro"" while doling out bridge contracts.

Today, as politicians and the public debate the fate of SNC-Lavalin, and whether it ought to be offered an out of court deal to resolve the foreign bribery case, the police and prosecutors who toiled for years no doubt have a thirst to see their work put before the courts.

Beyond the law, the politics, the potential impact on this giant company — our public guardians have spent untold millions building a case and to date have little to show for it.","What's at stake for RCMP, prosecutors in the SNC-Lavalin case",CBC News,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/rcmp-bribery-snc-lavalin-case-1.5031712

Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you to the members of the justice committee for providing me the opportunity for extended testimony today. I very much appreciate it. Starting off I would like to acknowledge the territory, the ancestral lands, of the Algonquin people. For a period of approximately four months, between September and December of 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the Attorney General of Canada in an inappropriate effort to secure a deferred prosecution agreement with SNC-Lavalin. These events involved 11 people, excluding myself and my political staff, from the Prime Minister’s Office, the Privy Council Office and the office of the Minister of Finance. This included in-person conversations, telephone calls, emails and text messages. There were approximately 10 phone calls and 10 meetings specifically about SNC and I and/or my staff were a part of these meetings. Within these conversations there were expressed statements regarding the necessity of interference in the SNC-Lavalin matter, the potential of consequences and veiled threats if a DPA was not made available to SNC. These conversations culminated on December 19 of 2018 with a conversation I had with the Clerk of the Privy Council, a conversation that I will provide some significant detail on.

A few weeks later, on January 7, 2019, I was informed by the Prime Minister that I was being shuffled out of the role of Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada. For most of these conversations I made contemporaneous notes, detailed notes, in addition to my clear memory, which I am relying on today, among other documentation.

Article Continued Below

My goal in my testimony is to outline the details of these communications for the committee and indeed all Canadians, however before doing that let me make a couple of comments. First, I want to thank Canadians for their patience since the February 7 story which broke in The Globe and Mail. Thank you as well specifically to those who have reached out to me across the country. I appreciate the messages and I have read all of them.

With that said, the remainder of my testimony will be a detailed and factual delineation of approximately 10 phone calls, 10 in-person meetings and emails and text messages that were part of an effort to politically interfere regarding the SNC matter for purposes of securing a deferred prosecution. The story begins on September 4, 2008 [sic]. My chief of staff and I were overseas when I was sent a Memorandum for the Attorney General pursuant to section 13 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act, which was entitled, quote, “Whether to issue an invitation to negotiate a remediation agreement to SNC-Lavalin”, end quote, which was prepared by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Kathleen Roussel. The only parts of this note that I will disclose are as follows, quote, “The DPP is of the view that an invitation to negotiate will not be made in this case and that no announcement will be made by the PPSC”, end quote. As with all section 13 notices, the director provides the information so the Attorney General can take such course of action as they deem appropriate. In other words, the director had made her decision to not negotiate a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin. I subsequently spoke to my minister’s office staff about the decision, and I did the standard practice of undertaking further internal work and due diligence in relation to this note, a practice that I have had for many of the section 13 notices that I received when I was the Attorney General. In other words, I immediately put in motion with my department and minister’s office, a careful consideration and study of the matter. Two days later, on September 6th, one of the first communications about the DPA was received from outside of my department.

This same day, my chief of staff exchanged some emails with my minister’s office staff about this, who advised her that the deputy attorney general, Nathalie Drouin was working on something and that my staff were drafting a memo about the role of the Attorney General vis-à-vis the PPSC. It was on or about this day that I requested a one-on-one meeting with the Prime Minister on another matter of urgency, and as soon as possible after I got back into the country. This request would ultimately become the meeting on September 17th between myself and the Prime Minister that has widely been reported in the media. On September 7th, my chief of staff spoke by phone to my then-deputy minister about the call she had received from Ben Chin, and the deputy stated that the department is working on this. The deputy gave my chief a quick rundown of what she thought some options would be. On the same day, I received a note from my staff on the role of the Attorney General, a note that I also shared or that my office also shared with Elder Marques and Amy Archer at the PMO. The same day, staff in my office met with the deputy minister. Some excerpts of the section 13 note were read to the deputy minister, but the deputy minister did not want to be provided with a copy of the section 13 note. On September 8th, my deputy shared the draft note on the role of the Attorney General with my chief of staff who subsequently shared it with me, and over the next day, clarity was sought by my staff with the deputy on aspects of the options that were laid out in her note. A followup conversation between Ben Chin and a member of my staff, François Giroux occurred on September 11th. Mr. Chin said that SNC had been informed by the PPSC that it cannot enter into a DPA. Ben, again, detailed the reasons why they were told that they were not getting a DPA. Mr. Chin also noted that SNC’s legal counsel, Frank Iacobucci and further detailed what the terms were that SNC was prepared to agree to, stating that they viewed this as part of a negotiation. To be clear, up to this point I had not been directly contacted by the Prime Minister, officials in the Prime Minister’s office, or the Privy Council office about this matter. With the exception of Mr. Chin’s discussions, the focus of communications had been internal to the Department of Justice. This changes on September 16th. My chief of staff had a phone call with Mathieu Bouchard and Elder Marques from the Prime Minister’s office. They wanted to discuss SNC. They told her that SNC had made further submissions to the Crown and that there is some softening but not much. They said that they understood that the individual Crown prosecutor wants to negotiate an agreement but the director does not. They said that they understand that there are limits on what can be done and that they can’t direct, but that they hear that our deputy of justice thinks we can get the PPSC to say we think that we should get some outside advice on this. They said that they think we should be able to find a more reasonable resolution here. They told her that SNC’s next board meeting is on Thursday, which was September 20th. They also mentioned the Quebec election context. They asked my chief if someone had suggested the outside idea to the PPSC and asked whether or not we were open to this suggestion. They wanted to know if my deputy could do it. In response, my chief of staff stressed to them prosecutorial independence and potential concerns about the interference in the independence of the prosecutorial functions. Mr. Bouchard and Mr. Marques kept telling her that they didn’t want to cross any lines but they asked my chief of staff to follow up with me directly on this matter.

In the course of reaching this view, I discussed the matter on a number of occasions with my then deputy so that she was aware of my view, raised concerns on a number of occasions with my deputy minister about the appropriateness of communications we were receiving from outside the department, and also raised concerns about some of the options that she had been suggesting. On September 17th the deputy minister said that Finance had told her that they wanted to make sure that Kathleen understands the impact if we do nothing in this case. Given the potential concerns raised by this conversation, I discussed this later with my deputy. This same day, September 17th, I had my one-on-one meeting with the Prime Minister that I requested a couple of weeks ago. . When I walked in, the clerk of the Privy Council was in attendance as well. While the meeting was not about the issue of SNC and DPAs, the Prime Minister raised the issue immediately. The Prime Minister asked me to help out, to find a solution here for SNC, citing that if there is no DPA, there would be many jobs lost and that SNC would move from Montreal. In response I explained to him the law and what I have the ability to do and not do under the Director of Public Prosecutions Act around issuing directives or assuming the conduct of prosecutions. I told him that I had done my due diligence and had made up my mind on SNC and that I was not going to interfere with the decision of the director. In response, the Prime Minister reiterated his concerns. I then explained how this came about and that I had received a section 13 note from the DPP early in September and that I had considered the matter very closely. I further stated that I was very clear on my role as the attorney-general and that I was not prepared to issue a directive in this case, that it would not be appropriate.

The clerk then said that he spoke to my deputy and she said that I could speak to the director. I responded by saying no, I would not, that that would be inappropriate. I further explained to the clerk and the Prime Minister that I had had a conversation with my deputy about options and what my position was on the matter. As a result, I agreed to, and undertook to the Prime Minister that I would have a conversation with my deputy and the clerk, but that these conversations would not change my mind. I also said that my staff and my officials are not authorized to speak to the PPSC, and then we finally discussed the issue that I had asked for the meeting for in the first place. I left the meeting and immediately debriefed with my staff about what was said with respect to SNC and DPAs. On September 19th, I met with the Clerk, as I had undertaken to the Prime Minister. The meeting was one-on-one in my office. The Clerk brought up job losses and that this is not about the Quebec election, or the Prime Minister being a Montreal MP. He said that he has not seen the section 13 note.

I told the Clerk again that I instructed that my deputy is not to get in touch with the director, and that given my review of the matter I would not speak to her directly regarding a DPA. I offered to the Clerk that if SNC were to send me a letter expressing their concerns, their public interest argument, it would be permissible and I would appropriately forward it directly to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Later that day, my chief of staff had a phone call with Elder Marques and Mathieu Bouchard from the Prime Minister’s Office. They wanted an update on what was going on regarding the DPAs, since “we don’t have a ton of time.” She relayed my summary of the meeting with the Clerk and the Prime Minister.

They asked whether that was true, if it wasn’t the Attorney General herself, but it was her staff or the deputy minister. My chief of staff said, “yes it would”, and offered a call with me directly. They said that they “will regroup and get back to you on that”. Still, on September the 19th I spoke to Minister Morneau on this matter, when we were in the House. He again stressed the need to save jobs. I told him that engagements from his office to mine on SNC had to stop, that they were inappropriate. They did not stop. On September the 20th, my chief of staff had phone calls with Mr. Chin and Justin Tao, both members of the Minister of Finance’s office about DPAs and SNC.

The next day, as well, SNC filed a federal court application, seeking to quash the DPP’s decision to not enter into remediation agreement with them. In my view, this necessarily put to rest any notion that I might speak to or intervene with the DPP, or that external review could take place. The matter was now before the courts and a judge was being asked to look at the DPP’s discretion. However, on October the 26th, 2018, when my chief of staff spoke to Mathieu Bouchard and communicated to him that given that SNC has now filed in federal court seeking to review the DPP’s decision, surely we had moved passed the idea of the Attorney General intervening, or getting an opinion on the same question. Mathieu replied that he was still interested in an external legal opinion idea. “Could she not get an external legal opinion on whether the DPP had exercised their discretion properly?” Then, on the application itself, the Attorney General could intervene, “seek to stay the proceedings, given that she was awaiting a legal opinion.”

He said that everybody knows that this is the Attorney General’s decision but that he wants to make sure that all options are being canvassed. Matthew said that if “at the end of the day, the Attorney General is not comfortable, that is fine”. He just doesn’t want any doors to be closed. Jessica, my Chief of Staff said “that I was always happy to speak to him should he wish. In mid-November, the PMO requested that I meet with Matthew Bouchard and [inaudible] to discuss the matter which I did on November 22nd. This meeting was quite long. I would say about an hour and a half. I was irritated by having to have the meeting as I had already told the Prime Minister, etc. that a DPA on SNC was not going to happen and that I was not going to issue a directive. Matthew in this meeting did most of the talking. He was trying to tell me that there were options and that I needed to find a solution. I took him through the DPP Act, section 15, section 10 and talked about the prosecutorial independence as a constitutional principle and that they were interfering. I talked about the section 13 note which they said that they had never received but I reminded them that we sent it to them in September. Matthew and [inaudible] continued to plead their case talking about if I’m not sure in my decision, that we could hire an eminent person to advise me. They were kicking the tires. I said no. My mind had been made up and they needed to stop. This was enough. I will briefly pause at this moment to comment on my own state of mind. In my role as Attorney General, I had received the decision of the DPP in September. I reviewed the matter, made a decision on what was appropriate given the DPA and communicated that to the Prime Minister.

On December 5th, 2018, I met with Gerry Butts. We had both sought out this meeting. I wanted to speak about a number of things including bringing up SNC and the barrage of people hounding me and my staff. Towards the end of our meeting which was in the Chateau Laurier, I raised how I needed everybody to stop talking to me about SNC as I had made up my mind any engagements were inappropriate.

On December 7 I received a letter from the Prime Minister, dated December 6, attaching a letter from the CEO of SNC-Lavalin, dated October 15. I responded to the Prime Minister’s letter on December 6, noting that the matter is before the court so I cannot comment on it, and that the decision re: a DPA was one for the DPP, which is independent of my office. This brings me to the final events in the chronology, the ones that signal, in my experience, the final escalation in efforts by the Prime Minister’s office to interfere in this matter. On December 18 of 2018 my chief of staff was urgently summoned to a meeting with Gerry Butts and Katie Telford to discuss SNC. They wanted to know where I, me, am at in terms of finding a solution. The told her that they felt like the issue was getting worse, and that I was not doing anything. They referenced a possible call with the Prime Minister and the clerk the next day. I will now read to you a transcript of the most relevant sections of a text conversation between my chief of staff and I almost immediately after that meeting:

I texted: MoJAG: So where were things left? Jessica: So unclear. I said I would of course let you know about the conversation, and they said that they were going to kick the tires with a few people on this tonight. The clerk was waiting outside when I left, but they said that they want to set up a call between you and the Prime Minister and the clerk tomorrow. I said that of course you’d be happy to speak to your boss. They seem quite keen on the idea of you retaining an ex-Supreme Court of Canada judge to get advice on this. Katie Telford thinks it gives us cover in the business community and the legal community, and that it would allow the Prime Minister to say we were doing something. She was like, “If Jody is nervous, we would of course line up all kinds of people to write op-eds saying that what she is doing is proper.” On December 19, 2018, I was asked to have a call with the clerk. It was a fairly lengthy call, and I took the call from him and I was on my own, by myself. Given what occurred the previous day with my chief of staff I was determined to end all interference and conversations about this matter once and for all. Here is part of what the clerk and I discussed. The clerk said he was calling about DPAs, SNC. He said he wanted to pass on where the Prime Minister was at. He spoke about the company’s board and the possibility of their selling out to someone else, moving their headquarters, and job losses. He said that the Prime Minister wanted to be able to say that he has tried everything he can within the legitimate tool box. The clerk said that the Prime Minister was quite determined, quite firm, but he wanted to know why the DPA route, which Parliament provided for, wasn’t being used. He said, “I think he is going to find a way to get it done, one way or another. He is in that kind of mood, and I wanted you to be aware of it.” The clerk said he didn’t know if the Prime Minister was planning on calling me directly or, “if he is thinking about somebody else to give him some advice. You know, he does not want to do anything outside of the box of what is legal or proper.” He said that, “The Prime Minister wants to understand more, to give him advice on this or give you advice on this if you want to feel more comfortable you are not doing anything inappropriate or outside the frame.” I told the clerk that I was 100% confident that I was doing nothing inappropriate. I again reiterated my confidence in where I was, and my views on SNC and the DPA had not changed. I reiterated this as a constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence. I warned the Clerk in this call that we were treading on dangerous ground here. I also issued a stern warning because, as the Attorney General, I cannot act in a manner, and the prosecution cannot act in a manner that is not objective, that isn’t independent. I cannot act in a partisan way and I cannot be politically motivated. This all screams of that. The Clerk wondered whether anyone could speak to the director about the context around this, or get her to explain her reasoning. The Clerk told me that he was going to have to report back to the Prime Minister before he leaves. He said again that the Prime Minister was in a pretty firm frame of mind about this, and that he was a bit worried. I asked what he was worried about. The Clerk then made the comment about how it is not good for the Prime Minister and his Attorney General to be at loggerheads. I told the Clerk that I was giving him my best advice and that if he did not accept that advice, then it is the Prime Minister’s prerogative to do what he wants, but I am trying to protect the Prime Minister from political interference or perceived political interference, or otherwise. The Clerk acknowledged that, but said that the Prime Minister does not have the power to do what he wants. All the tools are in my hands, he said. I said that I was having thoughts of the Saturday Night Massacre, but that I was confidant that I had given the Prime Minister my best advice to protect him and to protect the constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence. The Clerk said that he was worried about a collision because the Prime Minister is pretty firm about this. He told me that he had seen the Prime Minister a few hours ago and that this is really important to him. That was essentially where the conversation ended, and I did not hear from the Prime Minister the next day. The Chair: I am just letting everybody know that as chair I choose to give you more than 30 minutes. You have exceeded it. I’d like you to be able to finish your statement. Is there anybody who has any objection to that? Some hon. members: Agreed. Hon. Lisa Raitt (Milton, CPC): No, and I don’t think anyone in the audience does either. The Chair: Okay. Please continue. Hon. Jody Wilson-Raybould: Thank you, Mr. Chair. On January 7 I received a call from the Prime Minister and was informed I was being shuffled out of my role as Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada. I will not go into details of this call or subsequent communications about the shuffle, but I will say that I stated I believed the reason was because of the SNC matter. They denied this to be the case.

My narrative stops here. I must reiterate to the committee my concern outlined in the letter to the Chair yesterday. That is Order in Council No. 2019-0105 addresses only my time as the Attorney General of Canada and therefore does nothing to release me from my restrictions that applied to communications while I proudly served as the Minister of Veterans Affairs and in relation to my resignation from that post or my presentation to cabinet after I resigned. This time period includes communications on topics that some members of the committee have explored with other witnesses and about which there have been public statements by others. The Order in Council leaves in place the various constraints, in particular cabinet confidences that there are on my ability to speak freely on matters that occurred after I left my post as Attorney General. Even with those constraints, I hope that through my narrative today the committee and everyone across the country who is listening has a clear idea of what I experienced and what I know of who did what, and what was communicated. I hope and expect the facts speak for themselves. I imagine Canadians now fully understand that in my view these events constituted pressure to intervene in a matter and that this pressure or political interference to intervene was not appropriate. However, Canadians can judge this for themselves as we now have the same frame of information.

In saying this, I was reflecting what I understood to be the vital importance of the rule of law and prosecutorial independence in our democracy. My understanding of this has been shaped by some lived experiences. I am, of course, a lawyer. I was a prosecutor in the Downtown East Side of Vancouver, so I come to this view as a trained professional and committed to certain values as key to our system of order. My understanding of the rule of law has also been shaped by my experiences as an indigenous person and as an indigenous leader. The history of Crown-indigenous relations in this country includes a history of the rule of law not being respected. Indeed, one of the main reasons for the urgent need for justice and reconciliation today is that in the history of our country we have not always upheld foundational values such as the rule of law in relation to indigenous peoples. I have seen the negative impacts for freedom, equality and a just society this can have first-hand, so when I pledged to serve Canadians as your Minister of Justice and Attorney General, I came to it with a deeply ingrained commitment to the rule of law and the importance of acting independently of partisan political and narrow interests in all matters. When we do not do that, I firmly believe and know we do worse as a society. I will conclude by saying this: I was taught to always be careful what you say because you cannot take it back. I was taught to always hold true to your core values and principles, and to act with integrity. These are the teachings of my parents, my grandparents, and my community. I come from a long line of matriarchs, and I’m a truth teller in accordance with the laws and traditions of our big house. This is who I am, and this is who I always will be. Gila’kasla. Thank you.

(“SNC”) (TSX: SNC) and some of the company’s officers and directors.

The proposed class action has been filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on behalf of all persons, excluding certain persons associated with the defendants, who acquired securities of SNC during the period from September 4, 2018 to October 10, 2018.

The plaintiff alleges that the defendants failed to disclose in a timely manner the decision of the Director of the Public Prosecution Service of Canada that it was not appropriate to invite SNC to negotiate a remediation agreement. Once this information was revealed, the price of SNC securities dropped significantly, causing substantial damages to holders of SNC securities.

“Disclosure is the cornerstone of the Canadian capital markets,” according to Jay Strosberg, a managing partner at Strosberg Sasso Sutts LLP. “We look forward to SNC’s explanation as to why it delayed disclosure until October 10, 2018.”

The plaintiff seeks $75 million in damages for negligent misrepresentation and liability for secondary market disclosure pursuant to Ontario’s Securities Act.

According to AP, Trudeau's government has been on the defensive since the Globe and Mail newspaper reported 7 February that Trudeau or his staff pressured then-justice minister and then-attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to try to avoid criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin over allegations of corruption involving government contracts in Libya.

According to Wilson-Raybould's Wednesday testimony, cited by AP, she asked Trudeau if he was politically interfering with her role as attorney general and told him she would strongly advise against it.

She said Trudeau told her that if Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin didn't get a deferred prosecution there would be jobs lost and the company would move its headquarters from Montreal to London, AP reported Wednesday. Wilson-Raybould also said she was ""barraged"" and subjected to ""hounding"" by members of the government, according to AP.

Trudeau and other officials deny inappropriate pressure was put on Wilson-Raybould. But the case forced the resignation of Trudeau's principal private secretary, Gerald Butts, earlier this month, Reuters reported.

In particular, Trudeau said later on Wednesday, cited by Reuters, that he strongly maintains that he and his staff always acted appropriately in the SNC-Lavalin case, adding that he was worried about the jobs at SNC-Lavalin and the implications for pensioners.

According to Reuters, the recent Canadian opinion polls show that the SNC-Lavalin case is starting to affect the Liberals and Trudeau ahead of the federal election in October.

The Canadian engineering giant SNC-Lavalin is facing accusations that its former executives paid millions of dollars in bribes to win contracts in Libya under Muammar Gaddafi's rule, which collapsed in 2011. In particular, the company is accused of paying nearly $48 million to public officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011 to influence government decisions.

The firm is also charged with fraud and corruption for allegedly defrauding various Libyan organisations of roughly $130 million.

But the long-awaited plan to provide pardons for criminal possession of a drug now deemed legal in Canada is unlikely to satisfy critics, who argue that anything short of full expungement is an uneven, unfair remedy for those burdened by prohibition’s legal hangover.

News of Ottawa’s move came Wednesday afternoon in a tweet from Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, who wrote, “Later today, I will give notice to introduce a bill to provide no-cost, expedited pardons for simple possession of cannabis.” With the announcement arriving just moments before former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould reignited the SNC-Lavalin scandal with explosive new details, cynics quickly accused the government of indulging in the politics of distraction. But for as many a half million Canadians with criminal records for cannabis possession, Goodale’s words were crucial in their own right. In serving notice, Ottawa now is expected to table a bill as early as Friday that will finally reveal the pathway to pardon Ottawa has hinted at for months.

Article Continued Below

Goodale told a news conference last fall that the government was working on such a plan, saying “individuals who previously acquired criminal records for simple possession of cannabis should be allowed to shed the burden and the stigma of that record. “This will eliminate what are disproportionate consequences and break down barriers, which could mean greater access to job opportunities and education and housing and even the ability to simply volunteer for a charity,” he said. Advocates of outright amnesty caution that any such plan could end up being a logistical nightmare, given the nature of police record-keeping in Canada. Estimates vary — and if Ottawa has an official tally, it has never been made public — but there’s a widespread belief that anywhere between 250,000 and half a million Canadians carry the weight of a cannabis conviction. That burden has long been the central plank of the campaign for legalization. Cannabis may not be harmless but the dangers of marijuana, pro-legalization advocates argued, paled compared to the harm imposed by laws that failed to steer people clear of it.

Critics have long argued that cannabis amnesty will not simply be a matter of looking up names and hitting the delete key. Police forces across the country enter drug possession charges into a database maintained by the RCMP — but often without naming the drug in question. The challenge then becomes how to mine the RCMP data in a way that effectively isolates and expunges charges relating strictly to cannabis possession. Meanwhile, there is a $631 alternative: that’s the fee for applicants in Canada who want to apply to have crimes expunged from their records. But applicants often complain the process is glacial and, even after the long wait, success is not assured. Moreover, it’s a terribly expensive way of addressing a crime that numerous studies say has weighed disproportionately on racialized and economically marginalized Canadians.

Article Continued Below

Some law enforcement officials also note that while some possession convictions arose from as little as a pinch of cannabis, others are the results of plea agreements involving more serious charges, including trafficking, which were subsequently dropped. The difference, they argue, means any attempt at a blanket amnesty for possession charges could still yield uneven results. Reading between the lines of Goodale’s tweet, NDP MP Murray Rankin called on the government to go beyond pardons and delete criminal possession records outright, writing: “Now is the time to let Minister Goodale know that pardons are NOT enough! Expungement is the only way to undo past wrongs. Canadians deserve freedom, not forgiveness.” Mitch Potter is a reporter and feature writer based in Toronto. Follow him on Twitter: @MPwrites

(the BS-Line), this is far from a done deal. The unfolding corruption scandal at SNC-Lavalin and the company’s proprietary role in SkyTrain technology puts this Millennium Line extension in question. The underlying assumptions that have been used to justify the subway also do not add up, regarding projections of growth, ridership or technology performance of various options.

The recommendations for a SkyTrain subway to UBC are based on a report that updates the 2012 SNC-Lavalin/Steer Davies Gleave report. Since SNC-Lavalin is the main supplier of SkyTrain throughout the region, it is not surprising SkyTrain was their recommendation, and since the current update is based on the 2012 report, it would come to the same conclusion again.

The Expo and Millennium Lines are a proprietary unconventional railway, of which the technical patents are owned by Bombardier and the engineering patents owned by SNC-Lavalin.

“Only seven lines have been built in almost 40 years, with only three seriously used for urban transport. Why is Metro Vancouver now the only region in the world that continues to build with SkyTrain?” asks Malcolm Johnson of the group Rail for the Valley.

Given SNC-Lavalin’s proprietary rights for SkyTrain technology and its ongoing criminal prosecution for fraud and corruption that could result in a ban from bidding on government projects in Canada, the mayors requested confirmation that other companies beside SNC-Lavalin could competitively provide SkyTrain technology.

SNC-Lavalin is already banned from bidding on Word Bank projects due to corruption, and Bombardier is also being investigated.

There also are the questionable underlying assumptions of growth and ridership projections used to justify a SkyTrain subway.

Simple solutions that could be implemented immediately have been avoided to reinforce the narrative that a subway on Broadway is the only option to serve ridership to UBC and that the system is already at capacity. Commuters have been held hostage for over a decade to justify this scheme.

Alternate routes such as along Fourth Ave. have been under-served while increased commuters from the opening of the Evergreen Line have been dumped on Broadway rather than diverted to other less-congested routes with express or expanded B-Line buses.

Also, the mode comparative costs have been biased to SkyTrain. UBC Professor Patrick Condon has shown how LRT tram systems throughout Europe and North America are built for under $50 million per kilometre, while the evaluation report vastly inflates costs to $282 million per kilometre.

The $4-billion SkyTrain subway 7.1-kilometre extension from Arbutus to UBC would be about $563 million per kilometre. Both LRT and subway estimates include a 30- to 50-per-cent contingency, even though the subway has much more risk of unknowns with underground streams and utilities to divert.

The whole 13-kilometre SkyTrain subway from VCC to UBC would be at least $7 billion. If LRT was used, the whole route could be continuously built without a transfer point for much less than the $2.8 billion already committed for the phase to Arbutus. However, that option is not part of the updated report.

If they proceed with the subway, it will be enormously disruptive and damaging to local businesses all along the route for years. Many business owners are already panicking, knowing that even with a bored tunnel there will be cut and cover at every station and for utilities. And it is still a possibility of a bait and switch like SNC-Lavalin did for Canada Line when approvals were for boring while the resulting contract was for cut and cover. There is a lot of money at stake.

Of course, the biggest money is in the development along the line. Development is really what this is all about.

But this anticipated development is not needed to meet growth and will mostly serve the global capital that will further undermine affordability. The subway extension from Arbutus to UBC is predicated on using development fees to help fund it. This will require large amounts of density bonusing for luxury condos at UBC, Jericho Lands, station areas and other sites, on top of rental development that is exempt from development fees.

So rather than development fees going to pay for civic amenities like replacement of community centre facilities at Jericho Hill, it will be going to pay for the provincial, federal and TransLink responsibilities of transit funding. This is an encroachment onto the municipal tax base. Already, TransLink is getting a regional property tax and development fee to pay for the subway’s first phase to Arbutus.

In October 2016, Green Vancouver Coun. Adriane Carr brought forward a motion, seconded by NPA Coun. Melissa De Genova, that opposed the use of development fees to fund transit. It was voted down by Vision. But now both incumbents and their parties (except for Coun. Colleen Hardwick) voted for the subway extension that included funding from development fees.

Vancouver city staff have confirmed that the number of projected new units is beyond that justified for projected population growth. And existing zoned capacity is already well beyond what is needed to meet projected growth to 2040. Yet the rush to rezone continues.

These policies go back to the failed EcoDensity policies of 2007. Former NPA mayor Sam Sullivan copyrighted the name and his then-director of planning, Brent Toderian, defined the program. After the 2008 election, when Sullivan and the NPA were wiped off council except for one seat, he said that he was a victim of density. But Vision, which promised to reconsider EcoDensity, just rebranded it with Toderian as the Greenest City.

Then Vision also approved the regional change from the Livable Region Strategic Plan to the Regional Growth Strategy. This included regional designation of Frequent Transit Development Areas that Broadway, like Cambie, is destined to become if the subway is implemented.

From 2007, the city was warned that making density and growth a primary objective would lead to massive displacement. Demolition of existing affordable rentals, character/heritage houses, secondary suites, and small businesses, would be replaced with much more expensive new construction. And that has come to pass with an affordability crisis as predicted, that will be expanded with the Broadway subway, BS-Line, corridor planning currently underway.

Sullivan now is a provincial MLA as the B.C. Liberal critic for municipal affairs. He is proposing to take away municipal land-use authority on areas around transit to further expedite this tower development agenda. The B.C. budget makes reference to expediting delivery of development project approvals, so the NDP may be looking at encroaching on municipal land-use authority too.

All this just goes to show that bad ideas are not necessarily left or right politically and can continue through various regimes. Although Vision was wiped off council in the last election, without different directions to staff from the new council, we will continue to have more of the same. But the Broadway subway is not a done deal yet and this can be turned around like the freeways and urban renewal schemes of the 1960s.

533,Empty,2019-02-28T00:23:38Z,Sir John A. Macdonald fused the jobs of justice minister and attorney general as Canada's first prime minister. So is he partly to blame for the SNC-Lavalin controversy?,"In her bombshell testimony before a House of Commons committee, Jody Wilson-Raybould, Canada’s former minister of justice and attorney general, described repeated attempts at “political interference” by top government officials.

She told of “veiled threats” about her job and dark warnings about being headed for “a collision” with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over the issue of helping Québec engineering firm SNC-Lavalin avoid a bribery trial.

Less dramatically — but with the potential to spark a major restructuring of her former ministry — Wilson-Raybould stated that she has long believed Canada should re-examine the conjoined federal department headed by the minister of justice and attorney general and consider “whether or not those two roles should be bifurcated.”

She added that a new structure could see an attorney general who would “not sit around the cabinet table,” referencing the British model that separates the justice minister and attorney general roles.

In the U.K., the office of the Attorney General, a non-cabinet post, is separate from the cabinet position of Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice.

Splitting the two jobs in Canada is an idea that was raised recently by University of Ottawa law professor Adam Dodek, who advanced a timely and important argument about what he calls an “intolerable conflict” within the combined role of minister of justice and attorney general in Canada.

The conjoined cabinet post, he insists, is at the heart of the Wilson-Raybould controversy.

Read more: The SNC-Lavalin affair and the politics of prosecution

He argued it’s time to sever the political, partisan role of the minister of justice from that of the ideally “independent” attorney general — the government’s chief legal adviser and litigator, someone expected to “put aside partisan concerns” in upholding the Constitution. It seems Wilson-Raybould agrees.

Don’t ignore the history

This is all good fodder for serious debate. But we shouldn’t embark on potential reforms by ignoring the history that led to the 1868 creation of this country’s Department of Justice and the yoking of the minister of justice and attorney general jobs in a single cabinet position.

National Portrait Gallery

Neither should we necessarily graft British appendages onto our body politic. As early as the 1840s, leading political reformers such as Robert Baldwin believed a policy-engaged, made-in-Canada version of attorney general “clothed with its present political character” was required “in a community like ours.”

Furthermore, we shouldn’t naively imagine that splitting these positions will somehow magically insulate government legal thinking from the sullying effects or pragmatic influences of politics.

There are, in fact, deep-rooted historical reasons why Canada has a combined minister of justice and attorney general. And as with many other contentious issues in modern Canada, to better understand this ministry we must reflect on the mixed legacy of Canada’s founding prime minister — who was also the first minister of justice and attorney general.

Yes, it could be argued that Sir John A. Macdonald, so often a target for contemporary critics, is ultimately to blame for the Wilson-Raybould affair, too.

Read more: John A. Macdonald should not be forgotten, nor celebrated

Filled the job himself

Or should we credit Macdonald’s peculiar genius for statecraft — including the imperfect but practical compromise he struck between the political and legal imperatives of government — when he created the unified ministerial position in 1868 and promptly filled the job himself?

It’s worth noting that the ministry was formed after Washington spy George W. Brega provided Macdonald with a blueprint of planned changes to the U.S. Attorney General’s office. These matched the kind of dual-role ministry Macdonald was already planning for Ottawa.

Library and Archives Canada , CC BY

The legislation that created Canada’s justice ministry was crafted by Macdonald and his brother-in-law, Hewitt Bernard, deputy attorney general at the time. The project reflected Macdonald’s understanding of 19th-century realpolitik and — as head of a fragile, complicated new country — his perceived need for the law of the land to be informed by, and sometimes governed by, political considerations.

You can hear echoes of Macdonald when Trudeau — in response to accusations of political interference in the SNC-Lavalin case — refers to his government’s commitment “to defend jobs and to make sure that our economy is growing” while simultaneously “upholding the rule of law.”

Unspoken (but also discernible in the government’s handling of the case) are concerns about Liberal election fortunes in Quebec — concerns referenced by Wilson-Raybould in her testimony.

While Macdonald often spoke about the sanctity of the law, he was a pragmatist. He excelled at working in the small spaces and along the edges of the law — in the service of the national interest, as he saw it, but also in his party’s interests.

In the case of the Pacific Scandal, Macdonald wandered well past the edge of the law. He was consequently exiled from the prime ministership for five years following allegations his government accepted election funds from a shipping magnate in exchange for the contract to build the transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railway.

The realities of governing

Macdonald probably spoke of the attorney general being responsible for astute legal counsel. It’s not hard to imagine he likely nodded and winked at the realities of how the business of government actually worked in his day.

Thus the two offices were fused then — and remain so today — because of Macdonald’s sense of how government ought to function. Canada didn’t get a joint minister of justice and attorney general “just because;” it’s the result of Macdonald’s very conscious decisions, and his acceptance of the idea that, of course, legal decisions are political.

The dual position has endured under 22 subsequent prime ministers, both Conservative and Liberal.

But times have changed. As Prof. Dodek rightly points out, conflict-of-interest rules and other guiding principles of good governance have evolved. We may well be able to fashion a better ministerial structure in the 21st century than was envisioned 150 years ago.

But even if we think Macdonald rather cynical, we may find that keeping the justice and attorney general jobs together under one minister is still the best arrangement for this country.

In any case, we shouldn’t approach this worthwhile debate blind to the peculiarities of Canadian history nor swayed too much by the fiction of an apolitical attorney general — whether wearing one hat or two.",Is Sir John A.

These events involved 11 people (excluding myself and my political staff) – from the Prime Minister’s Office, the Privy Council Office, and the Office of the Minister of Finance. This included in-person conversations, telephone calls, emails, and text messages. There were approximately 10 phone calls and 10 meetings specifically about SNC-Lavalin that I and/or my staff was a part of.

Now we have the sex component!

A report by Montreal’s La Presse newspaper says that SNC-Lavalin allegedly paid for a sex-filled trip across Canada for the son of the late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.

“Naked dancers, porn movies and many, many, many prostitutes,” the story states.

Saadi Gaddafi was supposedly working on development issues, specifically making Libya a “new Hong Kong” in North Africa, instead it was all about sex.

Security firm Garda World was hired by SNC to escort Gaddafi across the country as he picked up escorts in city after city.

The total bill was more than $30,000 and one Vancouver escort agency charged as much as $10,000 for a single session.

Bills from other escort agencies ranged from $600 to $7,500 per session.

The SNC-Lavalin case has underscored the need to rethink the approach.","The controversy in Canada involving Québec-based corporate giant SNC-Lavalin highlights the need for a parliamentary review of the legal scheme for fighting foreign corruption.

Underpinning the scandal is a corporate criminal prosecution for the alleged bribery of Libyan officials by SNC-Lavalin officials and the question of a plea deal. Since corporations cannot do jail time, a fine is the obvious punishment. But how large should the fine be, and with what consequences? Should SNC-Lavalin be barred from consideration for future government contracts?

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Paul Chiasson

It was only in 1999 — almost 20 years to the day of the Globe and Mail‘s report about allegations that Canada’s former attorney general felt pressured to help SNC-Lavalin — that the bribery of a foreign public official became a crime under Canadian law.

Until then, paying a bribe or kickback to secure a contract abroad was seen as the cost of doing business in a foreign land.

Pushed as a fast-tracked initiative, with all-party support, passage of the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act was a foregone conclusion. Introduced in the Senate in December 1998, the law received only two days of parliamentary consideration, before it was brought into force in February 1999.

Speedy passage, however, meant that Parliament had not set aside any time to consider the more delicate details, such as the role of plea deals to save court time. And parliamentarians had failed to consider the question of who are the victims of foreign corruption, because plea deals are likely to involve the payment of a victim surcharge to fund victims assistance programs.

Why was Canada so keen to rush this new law into place? The answer lies in international pressure.

The OECD Anti-Bribery Convention

In mid-1998, Canada and other G8 states made a commitment to ratify the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) Anti-Bribery Convention before the year’s end. The OECD is the international club of countries with advanced economies.

Read more: Debate: Getting real about foreign bribery

It was this keenness to join that led Canadian parliamentarians to accept the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act, the legislation that put into motion the OECD convention’s terms. Those terms include a provision that the investigation and prosecution of foreign bribery “shall not be influenced by considerations of national economic interest, the potential effect upon relations with another State or the identity of the natural or legal persons involved.”

Canada also accepted the supply-side focus of the OECD’s approach — often called active bribery — as it focuses on the conduct of the one offering the bribes. But the demand side of foreign bribery isn’t always passive if an individual recipient encourages a corporate payment, and so the demand-side aspect is worthy of further parliamentary review in Canada.

Indeed, after a study in 2008, the Law Commission of England and Wales concluded there should be two general offences of bribery, one for the conduct of the payer and the other for the conduct of the recipient.

Illegal to offer rewards to foreign officials

Corruption takes a variety of forms, with bribery being the standard offence for addressing corruption in the public sphere.

With the Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act in place, it is illegal to offer undue rewards to foreign public officials to obtain improper advantages in the conduct of international business. The act has created work for business lawyers offering compliance advice.

But the act has also fostered disappointment. In 20 years, there have only been four convictions. Three convictions, secured by guilty pleas, have involved Alberta-based companies in the oil-and-gas sector, while the fourth concerned an Ottawa-based individual in the technology sector.

There’s rarely any mention of the tally of closed investigations, acquittals and stayed proceedings. That tally includes the 2017 acquittal of several people associated with SNC-Lavalin and a bridge development project in Bangladesh; the same bridge project that led to SNC-Lavalin’s negotiated acceptance of World Bank debarment in 2013.

Critiques lead to amendments

Criticism of Canada’s performance under the act has resulted in amendments in 2013. And in 2014, new transparency measures were imposed on the natural resources sector.

In 2017, the law’s reach was extended, at last, to cover all forms of bribes, and in 2018, a Canadian version of the deferred prosecution agreement, pioneered in the United States, was added to prosecutors’ toolboxes.

But Canada’s legislative scheme has not kept pace with the multi-jurisdictional realities of fighting foreign corruption.

In its 2018 annual report to Parliament, Global Affairs Canada continued to hail the $10.3 million fine paid by Griffiths Energy International as “the largest to date under the CFPOA.” But no mention is made of the English Court of Appeal’s assessment that this was a “relatively modest sum” given the surge in share value for the successor company in the United Kingdom.

Corruption violates integrity

It is often said that “corruption is not a victimless crime.”

And no less a body than the Supreme Court of Canada has opined that: “Corruption … undermines confidence in public institutions, diverts funds from those who are in great need of financial support, and violates business integrity.”

But more work is needed from Parliament on the definition of a victim. Past plea deals have included the payment of sizeable victim surcharge fees into provincial victims-of-crime funds.

But how do these funds offer assistance to the victims of foreign bribery in, say, Bangadesh or Chad, or to a company’s employees in Canada?

The SNC-Lavalin case has underscored the need to rethink the approach.","The controversy in Canada involving Québec-based corporate giant SNC-Lavalin highlights the need for a parliamentary review of the legal scheme for fighting foreign corruption.

Underpinning the scandal is a corporate criminal prosecution for the alleged bribery of Libyan officials by SNC-Lavalin officials and the question of a plea deal. Since corporations cannot do jail time, a fine is the obvious punishment. But how large should the fine be, and with what consequences? Should SNC-Lavalin be barred from consideration for future government contracts?

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Paul Chiasson

It was only in 1999 — almost 20 years to the day of the Globe and Mail‘s report about allegations that Canada’s former attorney general felt pressured to help SNC-Lavalin — that the bribery of a foreign public official became a crime under Canadian law.

Until then, paying a bribe or kickback to secure a contract abroad was seen as the cost of doing business in a foreign land.

Pushed as a fast-tracked initiative, with all-party support, passage of the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act was a foregone conclusion. Introduced in the Senate in December 1998, the law received only two days of parliamentary consideration, before it was brought into force in February 1999.

Speedy passage, however, meant that Parliament had not set aside any time to consider the more delicate details, such as the role of plea deals to save court time. And parliamentarians had failed to consider the question of who are the victims of foreign corruption, because plea deals are likely to involve the payment of a victim surcharge to fund victims assistance programs.

Why was Canada so keen to rush this new law into place? The answer lies in international pressure.

The OECD Anti-Bribery Convention

In mid-1998, Canada and other G8 states made a commitment to ratify the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) Anti-Bribery Convention before the year’s end. The OECD is the international club of countries with advanced economies.
