People who are off-Island and are registered to vote are required to apply and submit a mail-in ballot through Elections P.E.I.

Jim Honsberger and his wife Donna spend five and a half months in Florida each year and won't be back in time for the election.

He said he would have liked to have seen more information available.

""I'm sure we're not the only ones that are in this boat. It would have been nice to have that information at the get go.""

Honsberger said he contacted his local MLA to ask how he and his wife could submit their vote.

""It's going to be a tight window,"" he said. ""We definitely want to vote.""

April 9 deadline

Tim Garrity, the chief electoral officer for Elections P.E.I., said the mail-in ballot process was launched on the Elections P.E.I. website immediately after the writ was dropped on March 26.

He said to apply for a mail-in ballot, one has to download the application form, fill it out, sign it and then email, fax, mail or submit it in person to Elections P.E.I. by April 9 at 6 p.m.

This means that those requiring mail-in ballots have less than two weeks to submit their applications.

""That is when we have to receive your application … because once you apply for a mail-in ballot, that is the only way that you can vote.""

Once applications are submitted, ballots will then be mailed out to electors on April 10.

Garrity said ballots are mailed through express post and typically take one to two business days within Canada or the U.S.

""Internationally is a challenge but we will do our very best to get the ballots to everyone,"" he said.

After the ballots are sent, it's up to voters to incur the postage cost and send it back to Elections P.E.I. no later than noon on April 23. Garrity said the split ballot will include one ballot to vote for an MLA and one for the referendum.

We do not want to disenfranchise anybody who is eligible to vote. But we have to adhere to the rules that we have. It is a very short time frame. — Tim Garrity

He said as of Thursday morning he had already fielded 30 emails from people travelling overseas.

""We also have had some other people say that they're going to be on a cruise ship. We can't send mail to a cruise ship. It's just not physically possible,"" he said.

""There are some people that unfortunately — this process isn't going to work.""

On top of the short election period, Easter and Good Friday have also made the process more challenging.

Garrity said special provisions were made this year to accommodate those who may not be on the Island on election day due to the holiday, and want to apply for a mail-in ballot.

He said they can register through the mail-in ballot process and then bring it in, in person at the Elections P.E.I. office on April 11, 12, 16 or 17.

""We're allowing that as a bit of a special opportunity because of the challenge around the Easter weekend right before election day.""

Fixed election date could have helped

Garrity said Elections P.E.I. will be doing some advertising through social media to inform Islanders about the voting process.

""We will have all of the dates set up on our website as well. We are looking at doing some other media advertising just so people are aware. We're just hoping to get the word out in any way that we can.""

Garrity said a fixed election date would have alleviated some of these issues.

""We do not want to disenfranchise anybody who is eligible to vote. But we have to adhere to the rules that we have. It is a very short time frame,"" he said.

""We understand that some people, it's not going to fit into their schedules.""

David Coletto, chief executive of the Abacus Data polling firm, conducted the survey for the Broadbent Institute, and will discuss its findings at the left-leaning think tank’s annual Progress Summit in Ottawa on Thursday.

David Coletto, chief executive of the Abacus Data polling firm, says a new survey points to a “common concern” that life is getting less affordable in Canada. ( Adrian Wyld / THE CANADIAN PRESS FILE PHOTO )

The national survey of 2,500 Canadian adults — conducted online between March 3 and 11 — found that 57 per cent of respondents named an affordability concern as the top issue that will determine their vote in this year’s federal election. These issues, identified as top concerns from a list of options, include cost of living, taxes, wages and housing affordability. A comparable, probability-based sample survey of 2,500 people would have a margin of error of plus or minus two per cent, 19 times out of 20. In a memo outlining the results, Coletto points to a “common concern” that life is getting less affordable in Canada, with 68 per cent of respondents saying the cost of things they use and consume daily has gotten “worse” within the last few years. At the same time, 59 per cent said they feel the difference between their personal salaries and those of the “richest one per cent” has gotten “worse,” while a majority — 62 per cent — said the profits of big corporations are better or about the same as they were a few years ago.

“This anxiety seems to be growing and fuelling the rise of populist movements — both on the left and right — which are responding to the pressure and frustration people are feeling,” Coletto writes. For instance, survey respondents who indicated they worry about the cost of living were more likely to agree the economy is creating more threats than opportunities to their quality of life, and that immigrants are a “burden” on jobs, housing and health care. These respondents were also more likely to agree that rich people don’t pay enough taxes and that the government is wasteful and inefficient.

Article Continued Below

“In short,” Coletto writes, “affordability anxiety causes people to feel like they are being left behind and distrust institutions.” Katrina Miller, director of research at the Broadbent Institute, said the survey tells a “cautionary tale” for political parties in this election year. Even if big picture data suggests the economy is doing well — with low unemployment, continued projected GDP growth, and Statistics Canada showing fewer people live below the poverty line — Miller said political parties should heed signs that many people feel life is getting tougher to afford. “There’s deep anxiety out there about the ability to pay for the things you need in your everyday life,” she said. “Political leaders, political movements, even corporate Canada — if they choose to ignore the very real affordability concerns people have in their lives, they do so at great risk.” In his memo about the survey, Coletto points to results that suggest avenues for political parties to tap into these sentiments. Most respondents who said they worry about affordability said they would choose lower costs over higher wages to assuage their concerns, indicating an openness to pocketbook policies that cut individual and household costs, Coletto writes. Forty-six per cent chose the government forcing companies to reduce the cost of goods as one of three responses to affordability concerns, followed by 45 per cent who said it can cut taxes, and 42 per cent who said it can extend public health care to cover more services. For Miller, some of this aligns with what a progressive party like the NDP — the party most closely associated with the Broadbent summit — can offer voters, whether it is creating a national pharmacare program or cracking down on tax havens used by the rich. But the survey also links almost a third of respondents most worried about the future — dubbed “anxious populists” — with higher levels of support for Conservatives, a finding that Miller said indicates progressives still need to find a way to connect with those most concerned about affordability. “What (the progressive movement) need to do is double down on those areas of alignment,” she said of the NDP. “If we go and listen to where this anxiety stems from, we’ll be better able to tune our offers and proposals.” Clarification: This story was edited on March 28, 2019 to reflect that Katrina Miller was speaking about the progressive movement and not the NDP, when she talks about finding ways to connect with those concerned about affordability.

It's being hosted by a media consortium including CBC, CTV, Postmedia and Rogers.

Only parties elected to the legislature under their current party banner were invited to participate.

Freedom Conservative Party Leader Derek Fildebrandt said on Twitter it's ""grossly undemocratic"" that he will not be allowed to debate.

Out of the 5 official parties in the <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/ABleg?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#ABleg</a>, only 3 have elected leaders. One of those is the FCP.

He was elected as a Wildrose MLA in 2015 and was a brief member of the UCP caucus that formed when the Wildrose and PC parties merged in 2017. He left after a series of political scandals and formed the FCP in 2018.

While Fildebrandt is an elected member of the legislature, Mandel and Khan are not, but their parties do hold seats.

Notley's spokesperson Cheryl Oates tweeted that it's their hope to have all elected parties represented in the debate.

Using data from Alberta Health Services, the UCP’s official Twitter account, @UniteAlberta, said wait times for open-heart surgery increased 50 per cent from 2014 to 2018; cataract and hip-replacement surgery waits went up 30 per cent; and knee-replacement surgery waits climbed 23 per cent.

They said “NDP mismanagement” is to blame.

What are the facts?

The UCP’s figures are correct. According to Alberta Health Services’ 2017-2018 annual report and performance measures, wait times for some procedures have gone up since 2014 (page 136):

For a coronary artery bypass, the wait was 14.9 weeks in 2014-15 and 22.2 weeks in 2017-18.

For cataract surgery, the wait was 29.9 weeks in 2014-15 and 38.4 weeks in 2017-18.

For hip replacement surgery, the wait was 28.7 weeks in 2014-15, and 36.7 weeks in 2017-18.

For knee replacement surgery, the wait was 33 weeks in 2014-15, and 40.7 weeks in 2017-18.

The report shows wait times for several operations and treatments also went down.

While waits for radiation therapy dropped from 3.1 weeks in 2014-15 to 2.7 weeks in 2017-18, the time to see a radiation oncologist went up, from 4.9 weeks in 2014-15 to 5.3 weeks in 2017-18.

Between 2016 and 2018, the wait time for breast-cancer surgery dropped 66 per cent in Calgary — from 22.2 days to 7.5 days — and 34 per cent in Edmonton — from 14.1 days to 9.3 days.

The percentage of patients receiving urgent hip fracture repair within 48 hours improved from 86 per cent in 2014 to nearly 93 per cent in 2018.

Under the NDP’s Alberta Referral Pathways initiative, the wait time to see a gastrointestinal specialist in Calgary went down 98 per cent.

The Canadian Institute of Health Information (CIHI) released new wait time data on March 28, which also shows patients in Alberta waited longer for hip and knee replacements and cataract surgery in 2018 than two years earlier.

Just 49 per cent of Albertans received cataract surgery within the recommended wait time of 16 weeks in 2018. In all of Canada, it was 70 per cent.

Public policy think-tank Fraser Institute also released a study on Thursday, which found long waits for surgery and medical treatment cost Canadians $2.1 billion in lost wages last year. The study found the average value of time lost during the work week in 2018 for Alberta patients waiting for treatment was $2,538.

The Fraser Institute says factors like aging and growing populations are contributing to the problem across Canada.

What do the experts say?

Wait times are a problem across Canada, according to Ron Kneebone, the scientific director of the social and health policy research program at the University of Calgary’s School of Public Policy.

“Wait times are basically the result of a number of factors: how much money you throw at the system, how much time you allow operating rooms to be available. It might surprise you to know that operating rooms do not operate 24 hours a day because they’re expensive to run. A government will sometimes only allow operating rooms to be running for eight or 12 hours a day.

“It’s not an easy solution. It’s not just a matter of: ‘Let’s hire more doctors,’ because then you don’t have enough ORs. It’s not enough to just build more ORs because now you have to have the staff to run them.”

WATCH BELOW (March 21): What to do about health care is an issue that often divides Albertans. Fletcher Kent takes a closer look at the debate and why it’s about more than just health.

The Alberta government budgeted $22.7 billion for health for 2019-2020. That’s up from $19.6 billion in 2015.

READ MORE: Report finds health spending in Canada to reach $242B in 2017

And, according to Kneebone, spending more doesn’t seem to reduce wait times.

“Throwing more money at it does not guarantee a solution,” he said.

“What you need to understand is where are the bottlenecks? What can we do to reduce those bottlenecks? It’s not necessarily money that will solve it. It might just be a better process for recording patients’ records. It might be a better process for getting a patient from one doctor to another so you don’t have to wait for weeks at a time to get a consult.

“They may not cost you any money; it’s just efficiencies and I think that’s what governments need to be looking at… There’s a lot of push back on those sorts of efforts.”

READ MORE: Unstable households account for over a third of health care spending in Saskatoon

“One of the solutions that a lot of people are pushing now is that health should be more broadly defined. Rather than just thinking about fixing things, we should be investing more money in keeping people healthy so they don’t break in the first place.”

READ MORE: Health expert calls for new debates on health-care spending in Alberta

Kneebone says it’s not just the current government that has contributed to this problem.

“Alberta has been under PC governments, too. They’ve been pushing a lot of money towards health care but wait times are not coming down. I’m not sure I’d be blaming the NDs for this. I’m looking at all governments for allowing this to happen. Let there be no mistake: this is not an easy problem to solve.”

Using data from AHS’ 2013-14 annual report, wait times for heart, cataract, hip and knee replacement surgeries went down between 2010 and 2014.

“I know Canadians and Albertans don’t like to think about two-tier health care but do you not think there is two-tier health care with those sorts of wait times?,” Kneebone asked. “I’m not going to wait six months to get a surgery I need. If I can afford to do it, I will go to another province where I can get it done more quickly or I might even have to leave the country.

“These sorts of wait times, when they get that long, it just encourages the evolution of two-tier health care and it’s something governments really need to take seriously and start to address.”

WATCH BELOW (March 21): When the Alberta NDP introduced Bill 1 just before the writ dropped, they made it clear that protecting public health care was a priority. But as Heather Yourex-West reports, Alberta health care as it stands is far from universal.

What are the parties’ positions?

NDP

NDP Leader Rachel Notley has promised to spend another $90 million a year to further reduce surgery wait times if the party is re-elected April 16. Notley says the money would also go toward getting patients quicker care in emergency wards.

With that injection of cash, almost 40,000 Albertans would get faster cancer, open-heart and cataract surgeries over the next three years, she said.

The party also pointed to the $40 million its government invested in wait time reductions in the last budget, which UCP members voted against.

READ MORE: UCP Leader Jason Kenney wants to explore private health-care options

UCP

United Conservative Leader Jason Kenney has said he wouldn’t cut health budgets, but would work to reduce bureaucratic bloat in health care and explore private delivery options. Private delivery for minor procedures has improved wait times in other jurisdictions, he said.

Kenney said a UCP government would launch a third-party review of Alberta Health Services to target redundancies and inefficiencies in its 4,000 management positions. The review would include talks with front-line staff and would help determine ways to improve health-care delivery, he said.

A UCP government would mirror Saskatchewan’s surgical model that Kenney said reduced surgical wait times there by 76 per cent by, in part, inviting third-party surgical clinics to bid into the publicly-insured system.

“We will seek to replicate the phenomenal success of the Saskatchewan surgical initiative to meet our goal of a four-month maximum wait time for surgeries.”

READ MORE: Alberta UCP leader would scrap medical superlab planned for Edmonton

Alberta Party

Alberta Party Leader Stephen Mandel said, if elected, his party would decentralize a lot of the decision-making in health care and give that power back to communities.

“It’s allowing communities to make decisions about the priorities they have,” he said. “We would like to see more integration regionally. So for example, Red Deer Hospital needs to be expanded but Red Deer wants to have a catheter program and they should be able to put one in if they can show, within their budget or process, that they can do it. And that goes in other areas.”

The Alberta Party would also invest more money in the specific surgeries that are falling behind and “put the operating time together, so that surgeries can move forward quicker.”

Mandel said he would maintain front-line staff and evaluate the current processes and supports.

“Our health-care system is spectacular. We’re not going to privatize it. There’s a lot of things that could be done to make it more efficient, which we will do.

“Nobody should have to wait the kind of times we’re having in the province of Alberta right now, especially with the money we’re spending on health care. So we need to get to the bottom of that because, it’s not that we’re not putting enough money into the system.”

Liberal Party

Alberta Liberal Leader David Khan said, if elected, his party would review how public dollars are spent.

“We would institute full-value-for-money audits across the health system to figure out where we can spend money more wisely and how we can get those wait times down by spending money on the surgeries and less on the bureaucracy.

“One thing we’ve got to look at is: are we using our operating rooms to the most efficient way possible? I know some operating rooms in some hospitals in Alberta are being left unused for large periods of time.”

Polls suggest the United Conservative Party is on course to win power in the province, Canada’s energy center, capitalizing on voter concerns about a struggling economy and lack of progress on new oil export pipelines.

However, UCP leader Jason Kenney, a former federal cabinet minister, polls behind New Democrat Party Premier Rachel Notley on a number of personal attributes such as honesty, likeability and trustworthiness, and is embroiled in a scandal over his successful party leadership bid in 2017.

Notley, whose late father led the NDP from 1968-1984, is polling well ahead of her party and seeking to profit from that edge.

To overcome that, the UCP is focusing on Trudeau, with repeated references to “the Notley-Trudeau alliance,” emphasizing her one-time close relationship with the prime minister, while images of their own leader are less visible.

Trudeau is an unpopular figure in Alberta, where many feel he failed to support the energy industry. The prime minister also faces a political scandal on whether he unduly pressured Canada’s former justice minister.

“If you look at the signs the NDP are putting up, their logos are not very prevalent, it’s all Rachel Notley,” said Gregory Jack, vice president at polling firm Ipsos. “The UCP signs are all about the UCP and their brand, and underplaying their leader to a certain extent.”

The UCP’s focus on Justin Trudeau may be effective with older Alberta voters who remember the unpopular National Energy Program in 1980, an effort by his prime minister father, Pierre Trudeau, that sought to give Ottawa more control over the oil and gas industry and a higher share of revenues.

“(The UCP) spin on it is Alberta has been mistreated by a Liberal government and the son of another prime minister who did not treat Alberta well,” said Jared Wesley, a political science professor at the University of Alberta.

Alberta’s energy industry contributes C$80 billion a year to Canada’s economy, but opposition from other provinces has shut down new pipelines like TransCanada Corp’s Energy East project and helped stall the Trans Mountain expansion plan.

Congestion on existing pipelines out of landlocked Alberta left crude bottlenecked in storage tanks and sent prices spiraling to record lows last year, prompting the NDP to mandate temporary crude production cuts.

Alberta has posted budget deficits since global oil prices started tumbling in 2014, and more than C$20 billion in foreign capital has fled its energy sector since 2017.

Notley and Trudeau came to power in the same year and initially forged a close partnership aimed at pleasing the oil industry and environmental groups with a dual strategy that supported new pipelines and introduced a carbon tax.

They fell out last year over delays to the Trans Mountain expansion project. Notley’s camp downplays the relationship that the UCP is working so hard to highlight.

“The job of premier is to work with anyone who has a stake in projects like pipelines. I wouldn’t call it an alliance,” said NDP campaign spokeswoman Cheryl Oates. “A lot of people feel Jason Kenney is stuck in Ottawa trying to rehash a battle that his party lost.”

Where the leaders were Thursday on the campaign trail:

NDP Leader Rachel Notley

Alberta NDP Leader Rachel Notley was in Calgary Thursday where she promised to hire nearly 1,000 more teachers this fall if her party returns to power after the April 16 election.

Notley said an additional 15,000 students are projected to be in classrooms when the next school year starts and it’s critical to give them the supports they need.

She said an NDP government would hire 600 teachers and another 400 would come through a $23-million increase in the province’s classroom improvement fund.

The fund is delivered to schools based on student enrolment and is meant to help retain teachers, hire new ones and pay for resources to help students with complex needs.

Notley also promised that the NDP would spend $1.3 billion to build and upgrade another 70 schools. There would also be money to ensure every new and modernized school came with a playground.

Another $5 million a year would go to replace 100 aging and outdated play areas.

She criticizes her opponent, United Conservative Leader Jason Kenney, for failing to promise to fund enrolment growth. She says that would mean cuts and bigger classrooms.

“Parents need to know when they take their kids to school, they want to know that their child is going to be in a class that’s an appropriate size,” Notley said Thursday.

“(Failing to fund growth) will create chaos and will undermine the quality of education that our kids receive. There’s no need to do that. It’s just the wrong priorities.”

Kenney has said he would keep funding at current levels, and possibly increase it, but would be looking to find savings in administration to get more money to teachers.

United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney

The leader of Alberta’s United Conservatives said that, if elected, they would open more beds and expand treatment programs to help people battling drug and opioid addictions.

Jason Kenney said a UCP government would not approve new supervised drug consumption sites without extensive consultations with affected communities.

He also said those sites would ideally be accompanied by treatment services.

Kenney said it’s critical to balance help for users with safe neighbourhoods free of discarded needles and to avoid an increase in drug-related crime.

The opioid plan is part of a broader package of health reforms promised by Kenney in the campaign for the April 16 election.

He is promising that he would review health spending to find $200 million in administrative savings.

He said wait times for surgeries under the NDP are falling behind, and he would explore ways to have more day procedures done by private clinics under the public system to improve service and save money.

READ MORE: Alberta Election Fact Check: Did surgery wait times increase under NDP?

Such a system has been successful in Saskatchewan, he said.

“We will seek to replicate the phenomenal success of the Saskatchewan surgical initiative to meet our goal of a four-month maximum wait time for surgery,” Kenney told a news conference Thursday.

Rachel Notley’s New Democrats are running on a promise not to expand private care within the public system, because that can lead to queue-jumping and even higher costs.

The NDP has promised to keep health-care funding sufficient for a growing population and said Kenney’s refusal to match that promise means hardships and delays for patients.

Alberta Liberal Leader David Khan

Liberal Leader David Khan was in Calgary on Thursday where he unveiled his party’s fiscal plan, which includes the implementation of an eight per cent provincial sales tax.

Khan said a Liberal government would increase the tax-free limit to $57,250 to eliminate personal income tax for “most Albertans.”

“For couples, $114,500 will be tax-free. Almost two-thirds of Albertans will be exempt from personal income tax under our plan. We will cut personal taxes on the rest of Albertans’ income by one point across the board,” Khan said.

The party would also lower the corporate income tax rate from 12 per cent to 10 per cent. A revenue-neutral eight-per-cent sales tax would also be implemented, Khan said.

“Taxes on Albertans will not increase. We are simply shifting our tax burden from income taxation to a sales tax,” the party said.

“Our bold plan will raise nearly $1 billion a year in additional revenue from out-of-province visitors. It will boost economic growth because reducing personal and corporate taxes encourages hard work and investment. It will give our Alberta government a less volatile and more resilient revenue stream.”

Khan planned to door-knock in Calgary-Mountain View for a few hours Thursday afternoon before taking part in a march supporting gay-straight alliances in Calgary on Thursday evening.

Alberta Party Leader Stephen Mandel

Alberta Party Leader Stephen Mandel said his party would create the first corridor for self-driving vehicles in Canada by adding more lanes to the QEII.

“It’s needed A) upgrading and B) investing in,” Mandel said. “So we’re going to add a third lane to QEII going north and south. We think it’s vitally important and the Red Deer section is an important part of this — the QEII — and I think it’ll help Red Deer a great deal and also help move goods and services through the province of Alberta.”

Mandel said the triple lanes would run all the way between Calgary and Edmonton.

“It’s essential. There’s no sense in doing two lanes part way, it’s just not the way to do it. So we’ll put in a third lane,” he said. It’ll also put a lot of people to work.

Mandel said the work the project would create is especially needed “at a time where business is slow and companies need work.”

“There’s not a lot of municipal work being done as far as servicing land and developing land, so we think it’s a good time to get some reasonable prices too.”

Although it has not stated this explicitly, Beijing in the past week appears to have taken additional retaliatory action against Canada over the detention of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver last year.

Following the sudden detention of two Canadian nationals on questionable espionage charges and the trumping-up of charges against another jailed Canadian appealing his sentence, the Chinese government is now believed to be weaponizing trade to ramp up the pressure on Ottawa to intervene politically in the Meng case. Beijing has blocked orders of canola seed from two Canadian sellers, Regina-based Viterra Inc. and Winnipeg-based Richardson International Ltd., on the claim that Chinese authorities have discovered dangerous pests in the products. The ban occurs mere weeks before farmers are expected to plant their seed for the season, with potentially disastrous financial consequences for the targeted firms should they be unable to sell their product to a market on which they have become increasingly reliant.

Story continues below advertisement

By singling out the private sector, Beijing hopes to turn the inconvenience and financial harm caused to companies into groups that will lobby the government into abandoning a specific policy that is believed to be detrimental to China. When the government fails to change its policy – in this case, standing its ground in the Meng dispute – affected firms and local and regional economies will increasingly blame politics and the perceived obstinacy of their government for their misfortune. It will lead to temptations to support parties and candidates who advocate for a more conciliatory stance vis-à-vis China. The lesson is simple: Abide by Beijing’s wishes, with their concerns ranging from territorial disputes to differences on politics, and there will be plenty of money to be made through the lifting of bans and the promise of more purchases, and other inducements. Refuse to give in, and your economy will suffer.

If the canola dispute isn’t resolved soon – and we can expect that it won’t – there is good reason to believe that Beijing will further escalate those efforts to take aim at something even more sacred than our economy: Canada’s October federal election. And why not? It’s worked before, in other parts of the world.

In 2012, Beijing took aim at the Philippines – China is a huge market for produce from the country – by cancelling orders of bananas and restricting Chinese tourism amid an escalating territorial dispute in the South China Sea. Once it won its dispute over the Scarborough Shoal following concessions by President Rodrigo Duterte, Beijing lifted the ban and promised to ramp up orders of commercial crops.

And in Taiwan, where I have lived for the past 13 years, I have witnessed first-hand Beijing’s repeated use of financial sticks-and-carrots and how that approach is used to affect electoral outcomes in the democratic island-nation. Taiwanese jurisdictions, such as the southern port city of Kaohsiung where the mayor takes a pro-Beijing stance, are often rewarded with the purchasing of agricultural products, tour groups and investment, while others are punished for being governed by critics of the Chinese ruling party. Taiwan is just one place where Beijing fuels regionalism by playing one province, city, or county off against others.

Given this practice, it is not difficult to imagine that Beijing could adopt a similar divide-and-conquer strategy to polarize Canadian society ahead of the elections, rewarding candidates and provinces that adopt a more Beijing-friendly attitude while refusing to engage those who argue that Canada must continue to abide by the law and stay the course on the Meng issue. Should Beijing opt to ramp up its targeted economic retaliation against vulnerable sectors in the Canadian economy, it is perfectly conceivable that, ahead of October, we could see the emergence of a candidate who encourages Ottawa’s direct involvement in the Meng case by calling for her immediate release, as Beijing has requested.

And while social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have become targets of outrage in the wake of their reported use to interfere in elections and incite violence in places like Myanmar and Sri Lanka, Canada cannot ignore WeChat. The social media and messaging app has one billion Chinese-speaking users around the world, and a reputation for spreading fake news and censoring politically sensitive content. A large number of Chinese expatriates and Chinese-Canadians rely on the app, which was in the middle of the controversy around federal Liberal candidate Karen Wang’s efforts to mobilize Chinese-Canadians in Vancouver to vote for her rather than Jagmeet Singh in Burnaby South.

The risk of interference can only grow, with Sino-Canadian relations at a nadir.

Jason Kenney in Calgary

UCP Leader Jason Kenney is in Calgary Thursday where he made an announcement regarding “gaps” in the province’s health care system, and providing details of the party’s plan to tackle the opioid crisis.

Part of the UCP’s plan is to reduce increasing administrative costs, Kenney said, adding he expects to find 1-2 per cent of savings in doing a management review.

“We believe there are too many managers managing managers,” Kenney said.

In an effort to combat fentanyl and opioid use, Kenney said the UCP would fund a dedicated opioid investigation team and call on the federal government for mandatory minimum sentences for drug traffickers and stricter drug controls at the borders.

On safe injection sites, Kenney said the UCP would take a “sensible and compassionate” approach, and would only endorse new sites if extensive consultations with affected communities and socio-economic studies were conducted.

To the opioid epidemic. UCP would implement an action plan to tackle addiction & provide more supports for mental health focusing on drug treatment.

Rachel Notley in Calgary

Alberta NDP Leader Rachel Notley is in Calgary Thursday where she announced a plan to invest $1.3 billion to build and upgrade another 70 schools across the province. Also, fully funding enrolment growth and increasing the Classroom Improvement Fund (CIF) from $77 million to $100 million annually.

The party also committed Thursday to fully funding growing student enrolment each year, which would add an estimated 600 new teaching and support staff positions for the 15,000 more students expected to arrive in Alberta schools by the fall.

Notley also reiterated her party’s support for gay-straight alliances (GSAs) in Alberta schools.

“GSAs, quite frankly, are too important—they save lives” Notley said.

Mandel in Edmonton, Red Deer

Alberta Party Leader Stephen Mandel will kick off Thursday at the AUMA Leader’s Panel in Edmonton from 10:45 –11:05 a.m.. Afterwards, he will embark on a trip to Red Deer where he is expected to make an announcement to expand the QEII Highway in an effort to create Canada’s first corridor for self-driving vehicles. Mandel will make the announcement at the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame, 4200 Queen Elizabeth II Highway, at 3 p.m. “Self-driving vehicles are already in use and more are on the way,” Mandel said in the news release. “We can either get ready for this, or get left behind. An Alberta Party government will not only get us ready by building a new lane on the QE2 — we’ll position Alberta as the world leader in self-driving vehicles for colder climates. “This can be an entirely new source of jobs, growth and wealth for our province, fuelled by the incredible minds we have in artificial intelligence.” Afterwards, Mandel will take a tour of DC Inspections Services Ltd., a mobile inspection company working in the oil and gas industry, from 3:45-4:30 p.m., and then he will be taking part in a Pints & Politics event at a Red Deer Boston Pizza, 7494 50 Ave., from 5-6 p.m.

David Khan in Calgary

Alberta Liberal Leader David Khan announced his party’s Bold Fiscal Plan in Calgary Thursday, promising to eliminate personal income tax on the first $57,250 of personal income, and will bring in an HST to deliver stable revenue. “Alberta Liberals will put more cash into the pockets of Albertans,” Khan said in a Thursday news release. “We will help businesses create more jobs. We will provide more stable revenue to better plan our fiscal future and support our public services. We have a smart and effective solution.” Khan will then be door knocking in the Calgary-Mountain View riding from 1-5:30 p.m. and taking part in the Calgary March for Gay-Straight Alliances from 6-8:00 p.m.

Sign up for the Maclean’s politics insider to get Markusoff’s inside track in your inbox every morning.

Jason Kenney leaned on the wisdom of former Saskatchewan NDP treasurer Janice MacKinnon when announcing Thursday apromise to privately contract out publicly insured surgeries. That seems an unconventional information source for Kenney, until you realize McKinnon wrote her report for the Fraser Institute. The western Canadian conservative think-tank has long been feedstock for Kenney’s policy brain. Its research underpins his proposals to slash regulation and corporate taxes, and he further justified his medical wait-times strategy Thursday with a Fraser Institute report conveniently released that morning. Mark Milke, a lead author of the United Conservative Party’s platform, is a Fraser alum—paragraphs of a UCP policy backgrounder were copied verbatim from his recent book on Ralph Klein and Rachel Notley.

Big deal, Markusoff, I can hear you mumble. Conservatives like conservative think-tankery. My point, dear mumbling reader, is that Alberta’s 2019 election is such a showcase of stark ideological opposites, dominated by two parties with polar-opposite orthodoxies offering a many off-the-shelf ideas from the nation’s policy hothouses. Though many Albertans are fond of calling Rachel Notley’s NDP “socialist,” the party’s lodestar is not the Karl Marx bibliography—it’s left-leaning think tanks like the Broadbent Institute and Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, both of which provided basis for the NDP’s daycare policy. Her policy of investing in petrochemical and oil refining projects is an old 1970s-era Alberta Tory invention, but it’s also out of contemporary organized labour playbooks, and a former Alberta Federation of Labour official authored the party’s 2015 platform, much of which is being rehashed four years later. Notley hews to progressive orthodoxy that frowns on corporate taxes, but makes a point recently of citing a not-so-lefty Bloomberg article stating the Trump administration’s corporate tax cuts padded corporate profits but not the economy. (The article explains the cuts had little stimulative impact because the U.S. economy is already red-hot; not so much the case in Alberta.)

By way of proving how strong a current confirmation bias can be in Alberta politics, Kenney’s corporate tax plan relies on research by University of Alberta economist Bev Dahlby, who predicts solid economic growth if the business tax rate drops. Kenney is less likely to quote Dahlby’s recent work for the Ecofiscal Commission on carbon taxes: “Carbon pricing is the fairest and cheapest way to fight climate change,” states a new report Dahlby co-authored. Meanwhile, fellow U of A economist Andrew Leach, who led the climate panel which gave the Alberta NDP its carbon tax policy, has praised the Kenney’s corporate tax proposal that Notley derides.

Aside from Notley’s pipeline policy, we’re getting fairly paint-by-numbers ideological platforms from the two parties. Elections are always about choices, but they’re seldom as stark as this one.

The kamikaze candidate’s aide speaks out

Throughout the campaign that may make Jason Kenney premier, more light is being shed on how he became UCP leader in the first place. The RCMP now looking into allegations his campaign perpetrated voter fraud, while Kenney’s integrity has taken a pounding due to revelations of how his campaign coordinated with [scare-quotes] “rival candidate” Jeff Callaway, whose candidacy largely existed to disparage Brian Jean, Kenney’s main competition. Writing for Maclean’s, Jen Gerson unpacks the role of Callaway campaign executive assistant Jeff Park, who wasn’t aware until recently of the extent of collusion between the Callaway and Kenney camps.

Park said that he was led to believe that the Callaway campaign might also provide an opening for him to work for Kenney directly. “It was explained to me that…you know, Jason hasn’t been in Calgary or Alberta all that much and he doesn’t know the Alberta political operatives as well as he should and this would be an an avenue to—if Mr. Kenney was to win the leadership and we were to drop out early, which was always presented as being on the table—to make sure there were more Alberta-based people involved in Mr. Kenney’s leadership campaign and leadership office if he were to win.” (Maclean’s)

Kenney, meanwhile, once again carefully answered reporters’ questions about the RCMP’s contacts with his campaign into estranged organizers’ allegations of voter identification fraud. But he suggested the police force’s sniffing around doesn’t amount to a full-on criminal probe into his team. “We have not been told we are under investigation,” Kenney told reporters.

Party insiders express confidence that voters won’t care much about the Callaway mess and this fraud innuendo—not when economic anxiety remains the top issue on voters’ minds.

From the wilds, a lonely cry for an Alberta sales tax

Ted Morton, a former Tory finance minister, calls PST a “political suicide tax” in Alberta. It’s perfectly normal everywhere else, but oil-rich Alberta has felt immune to the typical laws of fiscal gravity, and that’s held with all mainstream parties for the province’s recent history, even with the decimation of oil royalty revenues.

Which might be our way of saying the Alberta Liberals are not a mainstream party. The party was Official Opposition from 1993 to 2012, but its legislature delegation has rapidly shrunk, and the party is likely to lose its only Alberta seat this year. But party leader David Khan earns bravery points for promising Alberta adopt an eight-per-cent provincial sales tax—and in turn slash income taxes, including an exemption for all income earned until $57,250. It’s an idea lifted from a 2013 University of Calgary public policy school paper. And it’s one worth earnestly debating for fiscally wobbly Alberta, despite how third-rail it is. Which is, sadly, precisely why it will get scarce discussion this campaign. (Canadian Press)

Kenney glowers, Toronto cowers?

Kenney is a undoubtedly a powerful politician with renown and influence across Canada. Even before becoming premier, he claims his oomph helped kill a potential lawsuit against oil companies in Toronto. Centre-of-the-Universe councillors voted against forwarding for council consideration a proposal by colleague Mike Layton to study suing oil companies for the costs of climate change. Upon hearing this, Kenney touted his own campaign-trail warnings against this move, at a sensitive time for Alberta—Notley joined his fist-shaking at Layton—and the former Ottawa-based federal minister suggested calls to councillors he knows on council slayed this supposed menace to Alberta’s oil patch. “Quite frankly, I don’t know where else they would have gotten that message from if I hadn’t sent that letter to council and made those calls,” he told reporters.

David Rider, the Toronto Star’s City Hall bureau chief, noted that such rejections of councillor motions can be a “very common fate,” not the crowning accomplishment Kenney proclaimed. Moreover, the idea isn’t dead—council merely voted to forward to council’s environment committee for future talks. Layton’s bid will live on another day, should Kenney wish to remain vigilant.

But Albertans have one big council vote in their favour. Toronto Mayor John Tory did tell the Calgary Sun he’s opposed to suing oil companies:

“You can’t very well call out one industry that provides the fuel and then drive your car around and think that somehow there is no connection between the people who provide the fuel for the car and the people who drive the cars or make them.” Tory also sends a message to Albertans. “The city of Toronto and its people and its businesses have benefited immensely from being partners with Alberta in our country,” says the mayor. (Calgary Sun)

What else we’re reading:

Keith Gerein on Kenney’s supervised drug consumption site plan: It’s encouraging he no longer calls them places “helping addicts inject poison into their bodies,” but his promised socioeconomic reviews of existing facilities, with more concern for neighbour complaints about crime and disorder than the thousands of overdoses reversed, shows a not-so-open mind. “In terms of the ‘compassion’ Kenney is seeking, I suspect those who had their lives saved would say they were well served on that score.” (Edmonton Journal)

Andray Domise on candidates’ racism and how it’s covered: “The people behind the bylines and headlines in Alberta’s media class are, as with the rest of the country, very white. They carry with them the sensibilities that often insulate white supremacy, even if inadvertently (as with the Calgary Herald headline that uncritically repeated Kiryakos’s claim that she was the victim of a ‘smear’ campaign)… This is an endless source of frustration for the communities of colour in the province, and across Canada, as we are perpetually dragged back to the same naïve and uncomplicated conversations about racism, even as our communities increasingly come under attack.(Maclean’s)

Licia Corbella on NDP’s power system mismanagment: “Clark says if he had his way, he would hold a royal commission into the Alberta ‘NDP government’s single biggest scandal’ — its meddling with Alberta’s electricity system that led to the en-masse resignation of all but one member from the electricity balancing pool and has cost Alberta taxpayers $2 billion while getting nothing in return.” (Calgary Herald)

Gary Mason on the UCP plan to roll back protections for school gay-straight alliances: “Mr. Kenney needs to ask himself whether he’s prepared to risk Alberta’s reputation over a move that is small, petty and mean-spirited, all to serve the interests of a close-minded, intolerant minority. Ahead of a provincial election, Albertans need to ponder that question as well.” (Globe and Mail) Meanwhile, several hundred Calgarians rallied on the issue on Thursday night. It’s normally near-impossible to get such large crowds out in button-down Calgary for a political protest that’s unrelated to pipelines.","Piping hot from the think-tank microwaves, here come Alberta election ideas",Macleans.ca,https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/piping-hot-from-the-think-tank-microwaves-here-come-alberta-election-ideas/

New Westminster-Burnaby MP Peter Julian said the party intends to focus on Canada's so-called ""tax gap"" to show it can finance big campaign commitments — in areas such as affordable housing and universal pharmacare — by cracking down on corporate tax avoidance, loopholes and offshore havens.

article continues below

The tax gap, which one estimate said could be above $40 billion annually, is the difference between the amount of tax revenue that should have been collected in a year and what was actually brought in.Julian said to reinforce its fiscal plan, the NDP is counting on the findings of an upcoming report from the independent parliamentary budget officer on the size of the tax gap.

""The whole issue of corporate taxation will be a stronger part of what we offer to Canadians, bolstered by the PBO report,"" Julian said in an interview.

""You will hear us repeating what was found in the PBO report. Whether that number is $10 billion or $15 billion or $20 billion or higher... And we will be talking about the fair tax system as a foundation for making the kind of investments that will make a difference in people's lives.""

Details about the NDP's fiscal approach follow last week's release of the final federal budget before October's election.

The budget from the governing Liberals fed political debate on whether or not federal governments should strive to return the books to balance as soon as possible.

The document showed the Liberals are in no hurry. Their budget, which emphasized a need to continue making investments, projected annual deficits of almost $20 billion in each of the next two years and contained no timeline to balance the books.

A few days after the budget's release, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer told a conference that a Tory government would bring books back to balance, but he didn't say when.

The NDP has been less vocal about its pre-election fiscal vision thus far.

In the 2015 election, the NDP vowed to make major investments and still balance the budget by raising corporate taxes and cutting off tax havens.

Following the party's poor results at the ballot box, former leader Tom Mulcair later laid part of the blame on the fiscal commitment, which he said overshadowed the NDP's ""social democratic economic vision.""

Julian declined to say whether the New Democrats will promise balanced books again in 2019 because NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh will roll out of the party's plans over the coming months.

The NDP will renew its focus on corporate tax fairness — and he expects this time to be different.

""I think what we needed in 2015 is what we'll have in 2019 — which is the PBO report on the tax gap,"" Julian said. ""In a sense, we're coming with far more evidence to support what we're saying about having to put in place a fair tax system.""

Other political parties have shown interest that the forthcoming tax gap report could be a source of new fiscal space for election promises, said Yves Giroux, the parliamentary budget officer.

But Giroux warned any federal government would need to make considerable efforts before they can turn the tax gap estimate into a source of revenue.

""We have to be somewhat prudent because even if we come up with an estimate that's high — and I'm not saying it's the case — it's only the beginning,"" Giroux said in an interview.

By Kevin Bissett, THE CANADIAN PRESS





CHARLOTTETOWN -- P.E.I. Premier Wade MacLauchlan called an early election Tuesday night, announcing an April 23 vote that polls suggest could produce Canada's first Green Party government.

""This is Prince Edward Island's time,"" MacLauchlan told a nomination meeting for a local candidate at a Charlottetown hotel. ""We are experiencing a sense of opportunity like never before in our long and distinguished history.""

The Liberal government didn't have to take voters to the polls until Oct. 7 under the province's fixed-date election provisions, but there was an apparent desire to avoid overlap with the federal election this fall.

""It's been four years. We had a mandate and fulfilled it,"" MacLauchlan told reporters when asked about the early call. ""This is an opportunity to ask Islanders for their confidence to build on that record.""

Despite a booming economy, polls suggest the Liberal party is likely facing a rough ride, with the Greens seen as a legitimate contender for power.

In his speech, MacLauchlan called the Progressive Conservatives a party of chaos and opposition -- saying they've had five leaders in four years -- and suggested the Greens would be too risky.

""The Green Party is untested, and the future of our province is too important to risk on uncertain expensive social experiments, led by a career politician,"" he said.

Green Leader Peter Bevan-Baker, a dentist, became the first party member elected to the legislature in 2015, and the Greens snagged a second seat in a 2017 byelection.

A Corporate Research Associates poll released this month suggests the Greens had a healthy lead, followed by the Progressive Conservatives, who picked a new leader, Dennis King, in February.

The Liberals were in third place, the poll suggests.

The Liberals have been in power since 2007, and there are signs MacLauchlan -- a longtime academic who began his political career in 2015 as premier -- is personally unpopular.

""It's about people. It's about you -- and it's about time that the government of the people of P.E.I. understand, respect and live by that message,"" the PC party said in a tweet as MacLauchlan was making his election call.

The Greens, meanwhile, posted a clip Tuesday night of Bevan-Baker playing ""First Call"" on his trumpet.

""What a wonderful way to begin the writ period -- with a blast from Peter's trumpet,"" the party said on Facebook.

In his speech, MacLauchlan touted advancements made by his government on housing, lower taxes and reducing child poverty by more than half.

""Prince Edward Island is working,"" he told the enthusiastic partisan crowd. ""There are now more opportunities for Islanders to get ahead and thrive.""

The standings at dissolution in the Island legislature were 16 Liberals, eight Tories, two Green and one independent member.

The Island has only ever been governed by the Liberals or Tories. The last time a minority government was elected in P.E.I. was 1890.

MacLauchlan said Tuesday night that he notified the other party leaders earlier in the day.

He is scheduled to make his first campaign stop Wednesday morning in Charlottetown.

The election will also include a binding referendum on electoral reform -- asking voters if they wish to stay with the current first-past-the-post system or change to a mixed-member-proportional-representation model.

It won't be the first time P.E.I. voters have been asked to consider electoral reform.

In fact, they voted 52 per cent in favour of switching to mixed member proportional reform during a plebiscite in 2016, but MacLauchlan rejected the results because of a low turnout of about 36 per cent.",Liberal premier calls Prince Edward Island election for April 23,Atlantic CTV News,https://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/liberal-premier-calls-prince-edward-island-election-for-april-23-1.4353298

Premier Brian Pallister has dropped another hint that he may push for an election in 2019.

The Manitoba leader dropped the possible idea Friday afternoon at the Met after the Manitoba150 brand launch, which revealed plans for the province’s 150th anniversary celebration in 2020.

“I’ve actually had a lot of Manitobans tell me they don’t want us to combine political stuff with our party [Manitoba150 celebration],” Pallister said.

“They want to celebrate something that unites us.”

Pallister has said in recent months that he has the right to call an early vote.

The Premier said he thinks it's a great idea to put the province ahead of politics, and he thinks partisanship should be separated from the celebrations.

“I agree with us partying like it’s never happened before in 2020, and making sure Manitoba is the focus of our attention,” Pallister said.

The next election is currently set for Oct. 6, 2020.

PROVINCE PROVIDES FUNDING BOOST TO ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION

Meanwhile, the Premier announced that the province will contribute $2.5 million towards next year’s festivities.

In addition, it will match private donations that could lead to up to $5 million in funding.

“This is a very generous gift,” said Stuart Murray, chair of the Manitoba150 Host Committee.

“This is an opportunity for the proud companies who call Manitoba ‘home’ and give them a chance to participate.”

The Manitoba150 Host Committee unveiled a new logo, website and theme – “United in Celebration” for the province’s sesquicentennial, a theme focused on Indigenous culture. The event will commemorate the anniversary of The Manitoba Act receiving the royal assent, followed by the province joining the Canadian Confederation.

Murray said the committee aims to attract a local and national crowd.

“We want you to be local tourists,” Murray said.

“We will invite Canadians to come to the best province, the heart of Canada, to celebrate in 2020.”

Murray said the event’s budget is in the process of being finalized and expects announcements to be made as 2020 approaches.

And to do that we have to work together.","A woman was murdered every 2.5 days last year in Canada.

This is just one of the many startling statistics contained in the first report issued by the Canadian Femicide Observatory for Justice and Accountability, an organization that was established in 2017 as a response to a call from the United Nations to monitor femicide rates around the world. The goal of this yearly report is to draw attention to the unique circumstances surrounding femicide in the hopes of preventing further violence.

But while the report received some attention when it was released in late January, it doesn’t appear to have riled up a single politician—which is alarming when you consider that all the major federal parties are gearing up for the fall election. Candidates of all stripes are hosting town halls, shaking hands, kissing babies and duking it out over SNC-Lavalin, international relations and border security. But no one seems particularly concerned that 148 women and girls were killed last year or that half of the women were murdered in their home by someone who claimed to love them or that the youngest victim was three weeks old. Not a single candidate has made femicide a talking point on the campaign trail.

As a longtime advocate for women and girls, and as a survivor of intimate partner violence and stalking, I’m outraged. What will it take for politicians to care about the lives of women and girls? During the 10 years that Stephen Harper was prime minister, funding for research on women’s lives ground to a halt. Cuts to Status of Women Canada’s budget along with his cancellation of the long-form census meant it became impossible to measure women’s experiences in the home, workplace and at school. It also meant we had no real sense of how many women were experiencing violence. Trudeau’s election and his commitment to feminism was a moment of exhilaration for advocates—it felt as though change was coming.



And in many ways, they have. Gender-Based Analysis was applied to the federal budget, Status of Women got a profile boost and a strong message was sent across the land that “Feminism is cool.” But the violence continued. At the height of the #MeToo moment, three years into Trudeau’s term, an act of misogynist terrorism unfolded on a sunny afternoon in Canada’s largest city when a man drove a van through the streets of Toronto, mowing down eight women and two men. There were hot takes and head shakes, but no concrete policy changes. Neither Canada’s feminist-ally prime minister nor Ontario’s feminist premier Kathleen Wynne called out the blatant misogyny of the act.

When the CFOAJ report launched last month, I was hopeful that hard data would make a difference. For years, we had been relying on patchwork statistical evidence and the qualitative stories of advocates to paint a picture of femicide in Canada. We finally have a better sense of what is happening across this country.

But if we want the lives of women and girls to be a priority in this election, then we have to take those numbers and get loud. And to do that we have to work together. When a candidate comes knocking at your door or when you find yourself at an election debate, here are some hard-ball questions you can throw their way:

How are you going to address violence against Indigenous women and girls?

Indigenous women make up only 5 percent of the Canadian population, but they were 36 percent of the women and girls killed last year. Does your candidate have a position on the Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women? Do they know that provinces, such as Ontario, are clawing back Indigenous education in schools and denying our youth the truth about colonization? Ask them how they plan to make Canada safer for Indigenous women and girls.

What’s your strategy for addressing the high rates of violence against rural women and girls?

Only 16 percent of Canadians live in a rural area, but 34 percent of the women killed last year lived rurally. Women in the north are particularly at risk, with the highest femicide rate in Nunavut and the Yukon. A triple femicide in Wilno, Ontario in the fall of 2015 highlighted the isolation and lack of support for rural women trying to flee violence.

My colleagues and I are re-thinking how funding should be allocated. Currently, funding for services like shelters and sexual assault centres happens per capita. Yes, there are technically fewer clients in a rural community but the lack of public transportation, patchy cellphone reception and the overall isolation means the cost per client is actually higher than urban areas. Ask your candidate if they’re thinking about the rural reality and if rural survivors are on their radar.

How are you going to make Canada safer for young women and girls?

Across all races and regions, young women are especially vulnerable to violence, with a quarter of femicide victims last year being women aged 25 to 34. We also know that women under 25 have the highest rates of sexual assault in Canada. Ask your candidates where they stand on mandatory consent education in schools, the creation of a national youth mental health strategy and funding for trauma-informed youth services.

The vulnerability of young women was recently made tragically clear with the Amber Alert across Ontario searching for Riya Rajkumar. She was a smart, vibrant girl who was killed on her 11th birthday. Her father was charged with first degree murder and died a few days later in hospital from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

We’re mere weeks into a new year and there have been at least four femicides across Canada already. It’s time for us to demand that the lives of women and girls in Canada be prioritized.",The Election Issue That Isn’t Even On Politicians’ Radar,Chatelaine,https://www.chatelaine.com/opinion/femicide-the-election-issue-that-isnt-even-on-politicians-radar/

People should not take the law into their own hands, but ...","The second week of Alberta’s election campaign featured an array of high-dollar commitments from the NDP, though the United Conservative Party had its fair share of spending plans to address the province’s social issues.

NDP leader Rachel Notley so far has pledged to spend roughly $4.5 billion over a number of years, notably $1.5 billion over five years to expand a $25-a-day child-care program province-wide and $1.35 billion over six years to build a new highway out of Fort McMurray.

Notley has said the child-care program would increase employment, largely with more women entering the workforce, adding $5.95 billion to Alberta’s gross domestic product.

The Fort McMurray road plan, she said, would create 7,500 jobs and ensure Alberta roads will be able to handle the expansion of oil and gas development.

But the UCP is concerned with the high-spending commitments, arguing Alberta is facing accumulated debt of $58.6 billion and can’t handle more deficit spending.

Notley has said her spending plans won’t break the bank, but the UCP believes she has a secret plan to increase taxes, which so far is an unsubstantiated claim.

Other commitments of Notley’s include $110 million annually to give seniors with annual incomes of less than $75,000 full-coverage for prescription drugs and eliminating co-payments, $90 million per year to reduce surgical wait times, a $23 million-per-year boost to the Classroom Improvement Fund and $5 million per year to replace 100 aging playgrounds.

She has also pledged to double incentives for petrochemical companies from $3.6 billion to $7 billion through royalty credits, loan guarantees and grants, which she believes would leverage $70 billion in investment and create 70,000 jobs by 2030.

Rural crime:

The UCP officially unveiled its crime platform this week, notably announcing details that will affect rural communities.

UCP Leader Jason Kenney said he would pursue ways rural Albertans could use reasonable force as self-defence, which would require changes to the Criminal Code of Canada.

“We’re not advocating for vigilantism here. People should not take the law into their own hands, but they have every right to use reasonable force in self-defence, especially when they’re in a remote area and feeling vulnerable,” he said.

Kenney said a UCP government would spend $37 million on crime reduction initiatives, with $20 million of those funds for the Alberta Law Enforcement Response Teams, $10 million for more crown prosecutors and support staff, $5 million to expand drug treatment court and $2 million for electronic monitoring technology.

He said he would shred the provincial directive that mandates crown prosecutors to triage cases based on the Jordan principle, a Supreme Court decision that requires cases to go to trial in a timely manner.

Under the NDP government, the province spent $10 million on a rural crime strategy, hiring more RCMP officers to address chronic offenders and hiring more crown prosecutors.

RCMP say the strategy is working so far, with property crime falling 11 percent and officers laying more charges against offenders.

Kenney said he would keep the NDP’s plan intact if the UCP forms government.

Health:

The UCP announced it would maintain or increase health spending, reviewing the performance of Alberta Health Services.

Any savings found in reviewing AHS, Kenney said, would be re-invested back into the health-care system.

The platform also addresses the province’s opioid crisis, which sees people die daily from drug overdose.

He said a UCP government would spend $100 million over four years to expand mental health and addictions services, as well as provide additional funding for a tele-health program, allowing rural Albertans to receive prescriptions for opioid treatment.

Any safe consumption sites, which allow users to safely consume opioids and access treatment, would have to go through a socio-economic analysis under a UCP government before they could begin operating.

The UCP would provide an additional $1 million to the Alberta Health Quality Council, which measures outcomes for patients, as well as increase the number and scope of nurse practitioners, opticians and paramedics, and lift the cap on midwifery services.

The party also pledged to reduce wait times for surgery by 75 percent for those waiting three months or longer.

Gay-straight alliances in schools:

Large rallies against an aspect of the UCP’s education platform took place this week in Edmonton and Calgary after Kenney outlined a plan that would roll back some protection for LGBTQ youth in schools.

The plan overshadowed other aspects of Kenney’s education platform, given gay-straight alliances (GSAs) are a charged topic in Alberta.

GSAs are peer-support groups that offer safe spaces in schools, similar to many school clubs, and let LGBTQ students and allies connect with another to discuss life challenges.

The NDP government ensured under law that teachers couldn’t tell parents that their kids were attending GSAs, given some LGBTQ kids wouldn’t want their parents to know their sexual orientation. They also say they would not want teachers to possibly out them in public.

Under Kenney’s proposal, however, teachers would be able to tell a parent if their kid is attending a GSA.

He said in some circumstances it makes sense for the parent to be involved in the child’s life, particularly if the child has severe mental health issues and needs professional medical attention.

Many teachers support the NDP law, arguing they wouldn’t feel comfortable telling parents about their child being involved in a GSA.

Youth at the rallies in Edmonton and Calgary were also adamantly opposed to Kenney’s plan, chanting, “Hey Jason, leave our kids alone.”

Kenney’s proposal would also allow charter schools, some of which are private Christian schools, to not have GSAs. He said the party supports GSAs but religious views must be taken into account. Under his proposal, public and catholic schools would still need to have one.

Under the NDP law, all schools, including charters, are required to have GSAs if a student requests one. Charter schools receive large amounts of provincial funding.

As for other aspects of the UCP education platform, Kenney said it would review the funding model for rural schools, implement provincial achievement tests for Grade 3, and introduce standardized math tests for Grade 1, 2 and 3.

RCMP investigating Kenney campaign:

The RCMP is looking into uncorroborated claims of voter fraud during Kenney’s 2017 leadership campaign.

Former UCP MLA Prab Gill, who was turfed from the party for his own ballot-stuffing scandal, wrote in a letter to RCMP alleging the Kenney campaign obtained fake email addresses, which were attached to names of real Albertans, and used those email addresses to obtain passcode numbers to vote in the UCP leadership race.

Votes were done in bulk batches at computer kiosk stations, Gill alleged in the letter, and were set up to work around voting limits per computer.

Kenney has maintained the party has followed all rules and that the UCP legal council has offered assistance to RCMP in the investigation.

“I have not been contacted personally or asked for an interview, but I would comply if I was,” Kenney said earlier this week.

Kenney has also been embroiled in a scandal involving irregular political contributions to Jeff Callaway’s campaign during the UCP leadership race, which the RCMP is also investigating.

Kenney has denied any personal involvement in contributing or funding the Callaway campaign, though it is evident that members of Kenney’s campaign team communicated with Callaway members to undermine former Wildrose leader Brian Jean, who ran for the UCP leadership but lost.

This $5 billion represents 100,000 new jobs annually, each paying $50,000 – or half a million new jobs ...","Politicians talk about what they want to talk about and not what’s necessarily important and relevant to Canadians. There are taboo subjects that no political party will address. Tax laws that legally allow affluent Canadians to use tax havens to avoid paying tax are highly relevant to all Canadians. They’re also at the top of the list of taboo topics political parties refuse to talk about. Canada’s tax regulations have created a two-tier tax system, one for the rich and one for everyone else. Some have called this economic discrimination.

It’s estimated by some experts that the annual lost government revenue due to the legal use of tax havens by individuals is $5 billion, or $25 billion over five years. These billions could fund numerous elections promises without adding to Canada’s deficit. This $5 billion represents 100,000 new jobs annually, each paying $50,000 – or half a million new jobs over five years. It represents the funding of a national Pharmacare plan and investments in growth industries, and environmental and social programs. This lost revenue would enhance the lives of all Canadians, instead of benefiting only Canada’s affluent.

These affluent Canadians are not tax-cheats or tax evaders, nor are they abusing our tax system. They are adhering fully to Canada’s tax laws. These laws need to change.

These lost billions represent the funding of a national Pharmacare plan and investments in growth industries, and environmental and social programs.

The October 2019 election represents the only opportunity for Canadian voters to prohibit affluent Canadians from using tax havens to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. We need to demand political parties engage in discussions about this “taboo” issue before the October election. For instance, in next week’s federal budget.

Politicians don’t talk about the Panama and Paradise Paper disclosures, in which thousands of affluent Canadians were identified as having used tax havens to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. This represents only a fraction of the number of affluent Canadians who benefit from offshore tax havens.

The difference between tax evaders and tax avoiders is that tax avoidance is legal. Tax evasion is illegal. Tax evaders are hunted down by the Canada revenue Agency and face the possibility of going to jail.

By contrast, affluent Canadians who use tax havens are law-abiding citizens, free to continue doing the same year after year. This will only change if Canadians demand our government close tax loopholes. But we are reluctant to take to the streets and challenge political parties to address this issue.

Tax reform that prohibits the use of tax havens by affluent Canadians is not radical. U.S. citizens are forbidden to use tax havens to avoid paying taxes. It is a criminal offence. They respect the sacred principle of tax fairness, under which all citizens must pay their fair share of taxes. In Canada, we have a two-tier tax system, which is unfair and unjust.

The losers in all of this are “average” Canadians. Tax avoidance is a dominant factor for Canadians having inadequate health care and social programs. Investments are not being made to growth industries that would allow them to compete domestically and globally. “Average” Canadians are paying more taxes while our government debt is growing at a staggering rate. This should not be allowed to continue.

A 2017 Environics poll found that nine out of 10 Canadians say the use of tax havens is morally wrong, and 87 per cent said they would like to see tax-haven use criminalized. This poll is an indication as to how voters in October’s federal election might respond to a political party advocating for tax reform.

Both individual and corporate tax avoidance laws are crippling Canada. Solutions to tax avoidance by individuals can be addressed by voting for political parties committed to closing tax loopholes. The nature of corporate tax avoidance is complex and requires long-term solutions.

The goal of The Grassroots Coalition for Tax Reform, is to pressure political parties to address the use of tax havens by affluent Canadians, in their election platforms. Let’s all tell them how we feel. This policy issue should no longer be taboo.

To get you caught up on Alberta politics and to give you a taste of what to expect from the newsletter, here are some of our recent Maclean’s features and articles:

This is Notley and her NDP on pre-election footing, polling well behind Jason Kenney’s United Conservatives and their more aggressive posture toward pipelines and anyone who dares not to advocate for them. She’s largely denied critics the opportunity to label her anti-pipeline, and perhaps it’s her best shot at regaining acceptance—Notley has taken the NDP’s old reputation for Prairie pragmatism and dunked it in oil.

In question period, the governing side often attacks more than it defends, as if it’s auditioning to be the official opposition. With this massive advantage, Kenney plans to test how much of a rightward correction Albertans are willing to make. More than just angling to erase the NDP’s four-year imprint on Alberta, he wishes to roll back the political moderation of the Progressive Conservatives before that, too.

Jen Gerson: We may yet see another oil boom, or two. There will probably be applications for oil and plastics over the next century, and Alberta should be doing everything within its power to supply that demand. But it’s a pretty safe bet that global demand for oil is going to abate within my lifetime, as climate change policies, decarbonization efforts and new technologies come to the fore. These shifts are already starting to happen. My child—a toddler today—will probably drive an electric car. He may never learn to drive at all. So what, exactly, is the plan?

For nine years, Kenney sat in a Harper cabinet beset by competing impulses: on one hand, avid conservatism, on the other, incrementalism—the idea that Canadians had to be brought along gradually to accept the Conservative agenda on taxes and programs. A deﬁning question in the run-up to Alberta’s next election is how much cautious incrementalism Kenney will employ, or how free he’ll feel to untether his conservative id.

As a midterm examination of sorts, Maclean’s interviewed dozens of voters in some parts of Alberta where NDP support surged in 2015.

Trudeau pitched the upcoming election as an opportunity for all Canadians to step up and start talking about the kind of country they want to leave for their children ...","VANCOUVER — Justin Trudeau delivered a feisty, campaign-style speech in Vancouver-Kingsway Sunday night as he introduced former TV news anchor Tamara Taggart as the riding’s Liberal candidate in the fall federal election.

The prime minister fired off a flurry of verbal jabs at Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer, and also former prime minister Stephen Harper, giving a glimpse of what could be a heated campaign for the October election.

“Investing in people and communities is the way to grow the economy. Stephen Harper and the Conservatives still don’t get it. Andrew Sheer doesn’t get it either,” he said to a gym full of enthusiastic supporters.

“Under Stephen Harper, Canada had the worst growth rate we’d had since the depths of the Great Depression under R. B. Bennett.”

Trudeau then accused Sheer’s Conservatives of hoping to continue Harper’s policies by giving tax breaks to the wealthy while cutting programs for the middle and lower classes.

“They still think the way to create economic growth for everyone is to cut programs and give advantages and benefits to the wealthiest,” he said. “Well, that doesn’t trickle down to anyone and it didn’t work for 10 years.”

Trudeau pitched the upcoming election as an opportunity for all Canadians to step up and start talking about the kind of country they want to leave for their children and grandchildren.

“Do we want to invest in the middle class — shine on the world stage,” he asked, before warning that Canada “is seeing the rise of populism, aggressive, fear-based politics, just like the rest of the world.”

The crowd roared its approval when the prime minister suggested the best way to counter divisive populism is by recruiting “strong, compassionate people who’ve focused their lives on bringing people together and on empowering people.”

He lauded Taggart as one of those people from all walks of Canadian life who have invested in their communities in various ways to grow the economy, respond to the challenges of climate change and put Canada on the world stage.

Taggart admitted feeling a bit overwhelmed and emotional at being on stage, especially seeing her children holding up signs that read, “Team Tamara.”

The Order of British Columbia recipient said she wants to be the people’s voice in Ottawa, adding that her media career made her a good listener.

While Taggart steered clear of talking about the specifics of her campaign platform at the event, she has previously said that she wants to focus on affordable housing, protecting the environment while boosting the economy, and women’s health and safety.

She’s likely to face a tough challenge in Vancouver-Kingsway, which has been held by New Democrat MP Don Davies since 2008.

Scroll through your Facebook feed and you’ll see it’s the Wild West for political advertisers on Facebook, communication experts say. As Alberta heads to the polls on April 16, political parties and third-party advertisers are corralling votes through mobile apps and online advertising.



All of this comes as online advertisers and platforms face increasing scrutiny from federal regulators concerned with interference that could ultimately influence election results.

Going Mobile

However, new federal rules won’t impact Albertans who will see their fair share of targeted political messages this coming provincial election.Targeted Facebook AdsFacebook ads are excellent for reaching audiences advertisers want to connect with. But, it’s the ability to target ads at specific demographics that has some experts, like analyst Sara Bannerman, worried.“What’s concerning to me is the lack of transparency. That we really don’t have a tool for monitoring what kind of advertising is out there,” says Bannerman, the Research Chair in Communication Policy and Governance at McMaster University.Bill C-76, introduced by the federal government last December, is attempting to force online platforms to maintain a sharable database of political advertisements.Google Canada has already decided they won’t be hosting political ads for the next Federal Election due to that requirement. In the U.S., U.K., India, and Brazil, Facebook maintains ad libraries that track who purchases political ads, how much they paid, and how the ads performed.Facebook promises to launch a Canadian ad archive in June, before the next federal election, but after Alberta’s provincial election.Under Alberta law, political advertisers only need to disclose their expenses to Elections Alberta. However, Bannerman insists more information, including how organizations are aiming particular messages to certain groups and which groups are being targeted with specific ads, should be shared with the public.“If ads are only seen by the people who [are meant to] see them, then we’re not even participating in the same conversation.”

Mobile apps are one of the newer tools being made available by political parties. Apps can be used to communicate directly with supporters, gather data, and organize campaigns.

Peter Ryan, public relations professor at Mount Royal University, says Albertans should be concerned about how easily these apps collect users’ private information.

The Alberta NDPs app Forward is the only mobile app made available to the general public.

“If they’re downloading a partisan app, we don’t know what information is getting collected by that party … we don’t know how [the data] is being used, and what effect it will have on the election.”



Ryan added there is also no way of knowing what security is in place in the event of a hack.



So far, the Alberta NDP’s app, Forward, is the only one available within the Google Play and Apple app stores.



The app requests biographical information such as name, constituency, phone number, and email.



However, as of March 14, the app wasn’t completely accessible to the public, as users who provided basic information, and granted notification and text message permissions were never sent the invitation code needed to access any in-app content.

Third-party advertisers

While political parties will be doing their share of advertising online, they’re not the only ones with a stake in this election.

Organizations not affiliated with political parties can spend up to $150,000 on advertising, per legislation introduced by the current government back in 2017.

Third-party advertisers and other groups not directly linked to political parties have the capacity and legal ability to advertise as well, which Ryan says is going to show us a lot about their role in our politics.



“We will learn which political parties will be able to leverage the third-party space to effectively amplify their messages to strategically frame their opposition and drive voters to the polls to support their election policies.”



While these third parties can advertise, they are required by law to register with Elections Alberta but can spend no more than $150,000 on advertising.



The Alberta Federation of Labour, the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees, and political-action organizations like Shaping Alberta’s Future are three examples of groups registered as third-party political advertisers with Elections Alberta.

Unregistered groups

Public Facebook groups with thousands of members can spread suspicious news articles to non-members through sharing.

While registered third parties will have their spending monitored by the province, Ryan raises the issues of groups who may not be receiving or spending any money at all, but still exerting great influence.



“If you aren’t receiving any money you can still have a [Facebook] group and post away,” says Ryan.



“A huge group right now is the Yellow Vest movement online, over 100,000 people are following it. That could influence a provincial election.”



Yellow Vests Canada identifies itself as a group that supports the building of pipelines and opposes carbon taxes, globalists and ‘treason’ committed by Canadian politicians. The group’s Facebook page is filled with posts by members sharing from sources such as Debate Post which makes unsubstantiated claims, often about immigration or Prime Minister Trudeau.



Ryan encourages voters to be critical of posts they see online and attempt to verify what they see with trusted media outlets and official government sources, like Elections Alberta.



“If it’s not the mainstream media reporting or circulating information to you, I would say consumers beware of that information.”

For many people living with dementia — and their informal caregivers — cognitive decline is a crushing disease that slowly destroys intellect and memories.

Dr. Samir Sinha in the Acute Care for Elders Unit at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto. ( Nick Kozak / Toronto Star )

Amidst this heartbreak is another sad reality: society so fears dementia that it stigmatizes people with the disease, adding to their isolation. Now, after years of waiting, Canadians have the start of a national dementia strategy that could alleviate some of that pain. The recent federal budget contains a $50-million, five-year commitment for a strategy to support Canadians with cognitive decline, their caregivers and the health professionals who manage or research the disease. Details will be announced later this spring, and the Public Health Agency of Canada is to oversee the roll-out of the strategy.

It had better be worth the wait. In Canada, half a million people now have dementia, with the number expected to top 900,000 in 15 years. By that time, in the 2030s, cognitive decline will cost the health-care system and families more than $20 billion a year. This isn’t a disease that only impacts “others.” A surprising number of us know someone touched by dementia. Many have given up jobs to care for a loved one at home, only to grow exhausted, accept the finality of a nursing home and watch a mother, father or spouse grow isolated in the rush of institutional care. Some watch those families struggle and declare a preference for Canada’s medically assisted suicide, if they were to get the same disease. Perhaps it’s just gallows humour, but too many people see only a bleak future with limited options for support. Globally, Canada is joining 32 other countries that already have strategies in place, a late entry precipitated by legislation called the National Strategy for Alzheimer’s Disease and Other Dementias Act. Now that there’s money in the (pre-election) budget to back the strategy, Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor must ensure that dementia is declared a national health priority. And that’s just the start.

To her credit, Petitpas Taylor has created a strong foundation, with a ministerial advisory board that includes leading geriatricians, a scientist, nurse and advocates, as well members living with dementia and caregivers. All their perspectives are important. Their recommendations will help form the national vision for the strategy, enhancing the work of provincial strategies such as those in Ontario, Alberta and Quebec. Board members like the CEO of The Alzheimer Society of Canada, Pauline Tardif (who is co-chair), and Dr. Samir Sinha, director of geriatrics for Sinai Health System and the University Health Network in Toronto, have long spoken of ideas for change.

For example, the Alzheimer Society rightly wants a public awareness campaign that talks about the possibilities of dementia prevention, telling us about the relationship between brain health and exercise, a heart-healthy diet, life-long learning and socialization. Clearly, we still need education on cognitive decline to end its terrible, isolating stigma. A 2018 online survey commissioned by the society found that half the 1,500 participants said they would not want others to know if they had dementia; one in four said they would feel ashamed or embarrassed if they had the disease. Let’s use the national strategy to change our views of the disease. Explain how cognitive decline begins, with the high school math teacher, the real estate lawyer or the manager of the local grocery store. Make it real. Help us understand that people with dementia are our next-door neighbours, our parents, ourselves. Allow us to grow familiar and unafraid so we can help people with the disease feel included in life — and the local coffee shop or art gallery — instead of afraid and alone. And as Dr. Sinha says, leverage the money for research seeking a cure but also, research the best options for care, like emotion-focused programs that show promise in a few nursing homes. Those best practices should spread to home care or adult day programs, which can help people live at home. Training for health care professionals is key to the strategy’s success. New education must include vitally important soft skills like empathy and emotional intelligence. Workers must learn how to relate to people who are living in memories from say, 1942, seeking comfort from a parent, or waiting for a child to come home for dinner, reliving the days when there was a vibrant purpose to life. Consider it a second language, a way to communicate with people who live through their feelings, not intellect. If the public awareness strategy has one prevailing theme, it should be this: one day dementia will become personal. Research shows that after our traditional retirement age, the odds of developing cognitive decline will roughly double every five years. Sinha, who created much of Ontario’s dementia strategy, says Canada now has the opportunity create a vision that is “not just great on paper, but truly impactful. Not just transactional, but transformational. “Because, we all need it. Any of us who expect to make it to 65? There’s a good chance we will actually be living with dementia down the road.” Canada needs to turn its strategy into action.",Canada’s national strategy on dementia must break the cycle of shame,Toronto Star,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/2019/03/29/canadas-national-strategy-on-dementia-must-break-the-cycle-of-shame.html

When Donald Trump was elected in 2016, many of us Canadians wagged our fingers smugly at our southern neighbour. “What were they thinking?” we said to one another in line at Tim Hortons. We spent the next year or so glued to CNN, more captivated by American politics than what’s happening here.

We might have wanted to pay more attention.

The tide in the Great White North appears to be shifting right — but not in the way we’re used to. This isn’t a typical liberal-conservative tug-o-war, the ebb and flow we’ve seen throughout election cycles. This new movement is one that has already swept through Hungary, Poland, the U.S., it’s fuelled Brexit in the U.K. and has seen the rise of the far-right party Alternative for Germany, who have been compared to the Nazi regime. And it’s tilted so far to the right that it threatens to upend our democracy and the very liberties we’ve fought for.

While conservatives have historically called for less government regulation, lower taxes and a stronger military, today’s Canadian right-wing politics has rebranded itself to include more visible intolerance. Bigotry isn’t just bubbling under the surface these days, it’s out in the open and proudly displayed for when the guests come over.

This ugly, newfound boldness threatens to dominate the next federal election, impacting not only the world’s view of us a fair, diverse and welcoming country, but also the lives of all marginalized Canadians. That keeps me up at night.

As a gay mother with a trans child in the Ontario school system, and as a human rights advocate who spends a lot of time on social media, I’m on the receiving end of a lot of messages from people who think it’s “about time” politicians start standing up to “special interest groups.” We’ve been coddled for too long, they say, and we don’t deserve special treatment. They mock, namecall and outright threaten those of us who fight for the rights of marginalized people to be preserved. They’ve always done this, of course, but their voices, now embolded by the very politicians and public figures they support, are growing in number and getting angrier. I’ve had to file two police reports after my life was threatened — and those are only the incidents I reported.



This swing to the populist right is both in our face and insidious. Donald Trump might be loud and brash, but his win was unexpected by most. We surveyed the damage from up north, thinking it couldn’t possibly happen here. Surely, Canadians know better. We didn’t.

Modern populism has grown quietly, from the pages of right-wing websites to the birth of new neo-fascist groups such as the Proud Boys, now designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Support for the populism movement gained traction through one protest, one meeting, and one tweet at a time. Now it’s loud and it’s everywhere. It unseated Premier Kathleen Wynne and her Ontario government, with Premier Doug Ford and the Conservatives promising little more than a buck-a-beer and the end of teaching gender identity in schools.

And then, in October 2018, Premier Ford met privately with university professor Jordan Peterson. While the premier openly discussed other meetings that had taken place around that time, the public only learned of this one after the CBC obtained his itinerary through a freedom of information request.

Wildly popular in some right-wing circles, Peterson’s views have been slammed as retrograde, problematic and dangerous. He became well-known after taking a stand against using trans people’s chosen pronouns, claiming being forced to do so is an attack on free speech. He argued vehemently against the federal Liberal government’s now-passed trans rights bill, speaking in front of the senate committee overseeing the bill, and warned his followers about the dangers of “compelled speech.” Peterson has also proposed “enforced monogamy” as a way to reduce male violence and believes “crazy women” can’t be controlled by men because men can’t resort to physical violence against them.

Despite, or, perhaps, because of these views, Peterson, who teaches at the University of Toronto, earns tens of thousands of dollars monthly from his Patreon account, a site where fans can pledge financial support to creators of all stripes. These donations are given to him by admirers, many of them Canadians.

Ford, meanwhile, campaigned heavily on the removal of Ontario’s most current incarnation of the sex-ed curriculum, and followed through — a move that has earned much criticism and more than one lawsuit. However, it was also, in part, what earned his party a majority government. A slew of Ontarians has proudly come out in support of Ford’s policies, including the removal of mandatory student funding for certain college and university services, such as pride centres.

A week before meeting with Premier Ford, Peterson had spoken out in a tweet against the Ontario Human Rights Commission, claiming it to be the most “dangerous” organization in Canada, and calling for the Ford government to abolish it. Peterson has previously said he doesn’t agree with the OHRC’s support of gender identity and gender expression. The OHRC had just joined the legal fight against the Ontario provincial government’s removal of the sex-ed curriculum, which covered LGBTQ+ issues, consent and cyber-bullying.

The Ontario Human Rights Commission does exactly what the name implies: using the Ontario Human Rights Code as its guide, it strives to protect all Ontarians from discrimination and harassment. Those who are fiscally-minded might also appreciate how the OHRC first tries to resolve issues between parties out of court, taking the less-expensive mediation approach. It is not the country’s most dangerous organization, but its dismantling could certainly be very dangerous.

The timing of this secret meeting should ring alarm bells for liberals and conservatives alike. Protecting human rights is, after all, supposed to be a closely-held Canadian value.

Trump’s 2016 victory was a dog whistle for bigotry that reached the ears of Canadians. Doug Ford has proven Ontario will welcome similar politics, while Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada, a federal right-wing party formed in 2018, has over 30,000 members and a social media presence that speaks out against “political correctness” and “diversity nonsense.”

Taking a page from the Yellow Vest movement in France, the Facebook group “Yellow Vests Canada” has more than 100,000 members. What began as a place to organize protests around the country quickly became a spot where anti-Liberal sentiments and memes are circulated around the clock, several going so far as to call for the Prime Minister’s death. Immigration is regularly condemned, and Islamophobia is dismissed as a made-up word.

While some of the most offensive posts have been removed over recent weeks, the views are still crystal clear. This group isn’t just anti-tax and pro-oil, it’s filled to the brim with intolerance. This message is consistent throughout provincial groups as well, such as BC Proud, Alberta Proud and Ontario Proud. With a combined total of hundreds of thousands of members in these groups, cries of fake news and the danger of refugees abound.

These sentiments don’t just live online.

Statistics Canada reported hate crimes had reached historically high levels in 2017, rising 47 per cent over the previous year, with Ontario and Quebec leading the pack on reported incidents. Black, Jewish and Muslim people were targeted most. Quebec saw a 50 per cent increase in hate crimes overall, and crimes against Muslims tripled between 2016 and 2017. In January of 2017, a shooter killed six men and injured several others in a Quebec City Mosque. Meanwhile, Ontario saw a 207 per cent increase in hate crimes against Muslims, and an 84 per cent increase against Black people. Crimes against LGBTQ+ people have also climbed. Swastikas have been spray painted on synagogues and other buildings across the country. Intolerance is growing.

Populism has many sources. Perhaps there are people who are tired of looking inward and are now lashing outward. Maybe, for some, it’s simpler to blame immigrants when they can’t find work than the companies who cut minimum wage jobs and still pay their executives millions in bonuses. Maybe it’s easier to find a scapegoat, to call someone like me a child abuser for supporting my transgender teen, than it is to grow and broaden our ideas of what’s normal.

Societal change can be hard and it can make people uncomfortable, but that’s a flimsy excuse for discrimination.

Intolerance has never gone away, it was simply out of fashion for a while. Now it’s back with a fresh new look and a boost from fake news and social media.

We should all care deeply about this frightening political shift and where it could take us.

I know I care, which is why I’m so scared about what’s happening in this country, and what’s yet to come.

Wernick said he is concerned somebody will be assassinated in the upcoming ...","On Monday, Trudeau appointed former Justice Minister Anne McLellan as a ""special adviser"" to examine the question of whether or not the two roles should be made separate.

""The events of the last few weeks have raised important questions about the relationship between the federal government and the minister of justice and Attorney General of Canada,"" a statement from Trudeau's office read.

""Ms. McLellan will assess the structure that has been in place since Confederation of a single minister holding the positions of minister of justice and Attorney General of Canada … She will also analyze the operating policies and practices across the cabinet, and the role of public servants and political staff in their interactions with the (minister).""

Opposition MPs also took issue with Wernick's alarming statements on foreign interference in the upcoming election, as well as the tone and tenor of political discourse in Canada.

Wernick said he is concerned somebody will be assassinated in the upcoming campaign. He also tabled seven angry messages sent to him after his first committee appearance, saying they constituted ""intimidation of a witness.""

As clerk, Wernick was the most senior member of a five-person committee tasked with assessing possible foreign intervention in the upcoming election — and whether or not the Canadian public should be warned.

Last week, the opposition parties expressed no confidence in his ability to do that.

The task now falls to Ian Shugart, who Trudeau named as Wernick's replacement on Monday. Shugart is a lifelong bureaucrat and the current deputy minister of foreign affairs.

Global Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters that Shugart is ""someone I trust completely, someone who is 100 per cent devoted to the Canadian national interest, and someone with excellent judgment.""

""I can't think of a better person to fill the role,"" Freeland said.

""I want to thank Michael Wernick for his extraordinary service to Canada over many, many decades,"" Trudeau told reporters outside the House of Commons.

""We've accomplished a lot as a government over these past three and a half years, and it was definitely in large part because of extraordinary public service and Michael Wernick's leadership.""

The finance minister was faced by a raucous opposition, as the Conservatives shouted down the speech in protest over the ongoing SNC-Lavalin dispute. The Conservatives are demanding that former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Reybould be returned to the Justice committee in order to reply to statements she made to the committee following her resignation from cabinet—allegedly over her transfer to the Veteran’s Affairs ministry, a move she categorized as a demotion not intervening in the criminal case against the massive Quebec engineering corporation.

“Today, I am happy to share our government’s fourth budget: ‘Investing in the Middle Class’,” said Minister Morneau as he began to address the House. “The title should come as no surprise, Mr. Speaker, because investing in the middle class began with our first day in office… and it’s what we’ve been doing every single day since.”

Leader of the Official Opposition Conservatives, Andrew Scheer, derided the Liberal budget as a prop to deflect attention away from the SNC-Lavalin controversy. But it has become a regular function of all federal governments in recent years to release a budget in the early spring.

“This budget shows how disconnected Trudeau’s Liberals are from Canadians’ everyday reality,” said NDP leader Jagmeet Singh in response to the budget. “There is no sense of urgency to act on skyrocketing housing costs, unaffordable childcare, expensive prescription drug costs and senior poverty rates. Canadians were counting on this Liberal government to meet their basic needs, and sadly, they were let down. We will have the courage to make different choices.”

“This is a disappointing budget for Canadians who need help right now to make ends meet,” said Algoma-Manitoulin-Kapuskasing NDP MP Carol Hughes. “This budget is disconnected from most people’s reality and the challenges we are facing together.”

“There are lots of half-measures and nice words, but the money being spent isn’t enough,” continued Ms. Hughes. “The money going into broadband is a good example. The dollar amount sounds great until you realize it’s being rolled out over the next 13 years. The North needs that infrastructure now.”

The NDP maintains that the federal budget also does not address critical issues facing the First Nations, essentially pushing off dealing with them until further down the road.

“‘Investing in the Middle Class’ has demonstrated the important strides the Liberal government has taken to remedy First Nations historical inequity,” reads a statement from the Anishinabek Nation. “I am pleased to see funding committed towards post-secondary education and skills development and training, with a particular focus on supporting our youth. This all aids in unhinging the First Nations labour market,” said Acting Ontario Regional Chief Glen Hare (speaking in that capacity on the federal level, as opposed to his role as Anishinabek Nation Grand Council Chief). Critical funding was left unaddressed, the release goes on to qualify, specifically regarding child welfare and additional housing and infrastructure supports. “This is a missed opportunity for the Trudeau government,” said Acting Ontario Regional Chief Hare, “and something the Chiefs of Ontario will continue to advocate to rectify, especially given the current crises in Ontario communities, such as in Cat Lake First Nation. When the chiefs see children covered in rashes and people dying because of inadequate housing and infrastructure quality, we expect the federal government to do the right thing and rectify these immediate issues.”

Among the budget measures impacting First Nations is $1.2 billion over three years to continue to implement Jordan’s Principle and help ensure that all First Nations children can access the health, social and educational services; $327.5 million over five years to enhance the Post-Secondary Student Support Program while the government engages with First Nations on long-term First Nation-led post-secondary education models; more than $1 billion over five years to improve essential services on-reserve, such as clean drinking water, fire protection, emergency response and supports for residents with disabilities or chronic illnesses; $40 million over five years to help First Nations research and develop their Specific Claims and a commitment to renew and replenish funding for the specific claims Settlement Fund for a further three years; and up to $100 million to establish an Indigenous Growth Fund to further encourage investments in Indigenous-led businesses by aboriginal financial institutions (such as Waubetek Business Development Corporation), including for First Nations entrepreneurs.

“While there was no mention in the budget of child welfare funding commitments,” noted Acting Ontario Regional Chief Hare, “we see hope through the funding commitment to implement Jordan’s Principle over the next three years.”

Budget 2019 proposes to invest an additional $739 million over five years to continue to tackle boil water advisories, beginning in 2019/2020, with $184.9 million per year ongoing. This investment will support ongoing efforts to eliminate and prevent long-term drinking water advisories, funding urgent repairs to vulnerable water systems and providing water operator training and support programs notes the Anishinabek Nation release.

“There is no doubt that the work done to end boil water advisories is a reflection of the legacy of former (Indigenous Services) Minister (Jane) Philpott’s commitment to systematic change in Canada’s approach to First Nations’ service delivery,” he continued. “There is still much work ahead. Though Minister O’Regan has only held the portfolio a short while, he has picked up where Minister Philpott has left off. While Budget 2019 is short on specifics, I was encouraged by the proposed investment in economic development through the Indigenous Growth Fund. With proper input from First Nations, such a venture should provide more opportunity to create sustainable revenue and business ventures for First Nations in Ontario. I look forward to working with this government and chiefs in Ontario to ensure commitments made will be properly implemented.”

“CARP (Canada’s largest advocacy organization for older adults) has been calling for significant changes to safeguard Canadians as we age—the government has listened,” said Laura Tamblyn Watts, CARP’s chief public policy officer. “CARP applauds the federal government for taking decisive action in reducing the GIS claw-back, increasing federal pension protections, supporting deferred annuities for seniors, a new EI caregiving benefit and housing supports for low income seniors.”

“We also are very pleased to see some funding for a National Dementia Strategy, increases to the New Horizons for Seniors Program and automatic enrolment in CPP for adults over 70. Investments in digital connections and municipalities will also reduce social isolation and improve aging in place.”

On the senior front, the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) weighed in on a positive note. “Canadian workers, their families and their communities will benefit from new budgetary measures that lay the groundwork for curbing exorbitant medicine prices, income inequality, and climate change,” said CLC President Hassan Yussuff. “We are pleased to see a budget that acknowledges some of the most pressing issues facing Canadians, because these are the issues that voters will be taking to the ballot box in the federal election.”

The Royal Canadian Legion announced itself “pleased to see a range of investments for veterans and families but awaits additional information on the mechanisms to be used and the programs the funding will support.”

In highlights, the budget also includes: $22.8 billion in new spending over six fiscal years; a 2018-19 deficit projection of $14.9 billion, down slightly from the fall; a 2019-20 deficit projection of $19.8 billion (with a $3 billion risk adjustment); With debt of $685.6 billion, projected to rise to $761.7 billion by 2023-24. This will bring the debt-to-GDP ratio to a projected 30.8 per cent, falling to 28.6 per cent by 2023-24.

As an election goodies budget, the plan includes some $1.25 billion over three years on a shared-equity mortgage program for first-time home buyers; a RRSP withdrawal limit for first-time home buyers rise to $35,000 from $25,000; $3.25 billion to Indigenous Services for water quality, child welfare, education and other supports; $2.2 billion for one-time doubling of Gas Tax cash for cities’ infrastructure spending; $1.2 billion over five years for border security and modernization, and for the asylum system; a Personalized Canada Training Credit of $250 a year (up to $5,000 lifetime) for job retraining; a credit of up to $5,000 for purchases of electric vehicles; the interest rate on Canada Student Loans will be lowered to prime and will be interest-free for six months after graduation; the creation of a Canadian Drug Agency for bulk-buying of drugs and a national strategy on high-cost drugs; the airport security screening agency CATSA will become an arm’s-length agency, with additional funding of $597 million over two years; $553 million more over the next three years—$374 million of it by next April—to fix the failed Phoenix pay system; low-income working seniors will be able to earn more without giving up GIS benefits and $595 million will go to support journalism (including a 15 percent tax credit for digital news subscriptions).

Nearly 25 years later, Alberta finds itself in a similar situation.","Albertans go to the polls on April 16, choosing between Don Getty and Ralph Klein for premier. Or close enough. The incumbent New Democrats are Don Getty come back to life, with a side serving of Trudeau-esque identity politics. The United Conservative Party might be the return of Ralph Klein.

That’s more or less the message of one of the most interesting books on fiscal policy I have read. Yes, I grudgingly concede that it is possible that some of my readers may not find fiscal policy quite as interesting as we economists do, but I would recommend giving Mark Milke — an old Calgary friend of mine — a try. His latest, Ralph vs. Rachel: A Tale of Two Alberta Premiers, is a relatively easy read; it is not impenetrable academic prose. A newspaper columnist who can write for a wide audience, Milke challenges a lot of what we think we know about recent fiscal policy.

The United Conservative Party might be the return of Ralph Klein

The heart of Milke’s argument is that historically profligate Alberta — which still has the highest per-capita government spending in the nation — cannot, when energy revenues fall, tax its way back to fiscal responsibility and greater business investment. Spending restraint is the answer.

Milke submits that Getty’s Progressive Conservatives, 1985-1992, attempted the former and failed. Klein, 1992-2006, implemented the latter and succeeded. The Rachel Notley New Democrats have followed the Getty model, Milke argues, with the same results.

“In 1993 and 2015, two Alberta premiers faced similar economic and fiscal challenges: low or declining energy prices, a weak economy and relatively high government spending by their predecessors,” writes Milke of the situations facing Klein in 1993 and Notley in 2015. “The differences: Notley was forced to grapple with a steeper oil-price drop just as she entered office and anti-Alberta policies from politicians elsewhere in the country; Klein played cleanup for every fiscal problem the Progressive Conservatives let lapse or exacerbated since 1986 and faced significantly higher interest rates.”

Klein and Notley provide about as close a comparison as one can get in the real world of economic fluctuations. Klein was helped by modestly recovering oil prices but hammered by high interest rates on accumulated debt; Notley’s deficit spending has been with cheap debt and more slowly recovering oil prices. Call it a wash and compare the results.

Klein introduced deep spending cuts, as much as 20 per cent. Many Albertans howled, though Alberta’s cuts were simply a return to what most other Canadians, per capita, had long been accustomed to. The fiscal results were impressive.

Klein introduced deep spending cuts, as much as 20 per cent. Many Albertans howled

“Candidate Klein promised a balanced budget in four years and Premier Klein delivered in two,” notes Milke. “Candidate Notley promised three deficit years and then a $25-million surplus by 2019. Premier Notley’s commitment was dead on arrival once the NDP gained power. In power, the NDP modified their balanced budget promise to 2020 and then 2023. It was the late 1980s Progressive Conservative Getty government all over again.”

Klein’s balanced budgets and then surpluses permitted the government to go debt-free by 2005. A government free of debt-service costs can keep taxes low, attracting investment and economic growth, or expand spending. In his first years as premier, Klein faced annual debt-service charges of close to $3 billion. When Alberta became debt-free, that was $3 billion more that Albertans had in tax savings or new spending.

The extravagant spending of Klein’s PC successors — Ed Stelmach, Alison Redford and Jim Prentice — left Alberta with a debt service cost of $722 million in 2015. By 2018, with expanded NDP spending and higher taxes — corporate taxes and carbon taxes — the debt service was up to $1.9 billion. By 2021, it is projected to reach $3 billion. By way of comparison, that would be 15 per cent of health spending, or nearly 50 per cent of social service spending in 2021.

Debt service is a killer of public confidence — it drives a wedge between revenues raised and services delivered, a guarantee that taxpayers do not get what they pay for. If oil prices rise sharply, Alberta’s finances will recover quickly. But if interest rates rise even modestly, Alberta’s fiscal health will be dealt a mortal blow.

While Milke’s book focuses on Alberta, the lessons of Klein after Getty had national implications. Canada’s national finances, which were headed into desperate territory, were saved by the Chretien/Martin cuts of 1995. Nearly 25 years later, Alberta finds itself in a similar situation.

China, citing the discovery of pests, expanded its ban on canola seed imports on Tuesday to include shipments from a second major exporter, Viterra.

Viterra is owned by Glencore’s agricultural arm. Earlier this month, Beijing halted shipments from Richardson International, Canada’s top exporter of canola seed.

Canada’s Liberal government and China have been locked in a trade and political dispute since the chief financial officer of Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies was arrested in Vancouver last December on a U.S. extradition request.

China accounts for about 40 per cent of Canada’s canola seed, oil and meal exports, according to the Canola Council, with seed exports to China worth some $2.7 billion a year.

Canada’s official opposition Conservative party, which opinion polls show could win an election in October, says Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has not done enough to help canola farmers and is bungling ties with China.

“The restrictive measures imposed by China are said to be rooted in science. We have asked for the evidence,” Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said in a statement.

“To date, none has been supplied. We will keep pushing as hard as we can on this vital point,” added Goodale, an MP from Saskatchewan, Canada’s biggest canola-producing province by tonnage since 1990.

Trudeau said on Wednesday he was concerned about the ban and could send a delegation to Beijing. He met with Richardson executives on Tuesday.

Goodale, using sterner language, said “measures that defy science and contravene sound business and trading practices detract from the good reputation for reliability which all trading nations seek to maintain.”

The Chinese embassy was not immediately available for comment.

Canadian food inspection officials say they have found no problems with canola seed exports.

“We will intervene at the right level of seniority and intensity — scientifically, strategically and diplomatically — to have the best possible impact,” said Goodale.

Conservative legislators on Thursday sent a letter requesting an emergency meeting of the Commons agriculture committee on Friday.

“We fear that if this issue is not resolved expeditiously, farmers will suffer significantly because of the prime minister’s ongoing mishandling of the Canada-China relationship,” they said in the letter.

Ottawa: A political meddling scandal threatening Prime Minister Justin Trudeau´s re-election bid was given fresh impetus Friday with the release of messages and a secret recording supplied by his former attorney general.



The House of Commons justice committee, looking into the explosive allegations that Trudeau officials pressured attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to shield engineering firm SNC-Lavalin from trial, released the materials from the now former official.

The controversy comes just months ahead of a re-election bid that looks increasingly uncertain for Trudeau, whose progressive, golden boy image had previously been unblemished.

In the 43 pages of documents, Wilson-Raybould seeks to link her demotion to another portfolio in January to her resistance to allegedly undue pressure to settle the SNC-Lavalin case -- which Trudeau and his staff have denied.

And she hints about why, a month later, she resigned from cabinet, saying she had decided ""that I would immediately resign if the new attorney general decided to issue a directive in the SNC-Lavalin matter.""

Her replacement as attorney general, David Lametti, has so far only said he is considering the issue.

Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin was charged in 2015 with corruption over alleged bribes paid to secure contracts in Libya.

Wilson-Raybould, Canada´s first indigenous attorney general, refused to ask prosecutors to settle, and the trial is set to proceed.

But she later testified to lawmakers that she had faced ""consistent and sustained"" political pressure to intervene, including receiving ""veiled threats"" over her stance.

Trudeau recently addressed the allegations, telling reporters in Ottawa that he had learned ""lessons"" from the crisis -- but denying any wrongdoing.

Another minister quit in protest, and two senior officials in Trudeau´s office accused of bullying Wilson-Raybould also resigned since the scandal erupted in February.

The secret recording made by Wilson-Raybould of a 17-minute call in December with Canada´s top bureaucrat, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, supports her testimony to the justice committee last month.

On the tape, she says Trudeau´s inner circle was on ""dangerous ground"" by attempting to interfere in the SNC-Lavalin prosecution.

Wernick says the prime minister is ""in a pretty firm frame of mind about this.""

""I am a bit worried,"" he goes on to say. ""It is not a good idea for the prime minister and his attorney general to be at loggerheads.""

He also highlights Trudeau´s concerns about the possible loss of 9,000 jobs and ""a signature Canadian firm"" if SNC-Lavalin is found guilty at trial and sanctioned, coming soon after a GM plant closure and Canadian oil sector woes.","New docs, recording released in Canada PM meddling scandal",The News International,https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/451020-new-docs-recording-released-in-canada-pm-meddling-scandal

Senators on the committee say they want to hold meetings and hear from victims to ensure their experiences are shared “so that nobody else is forced into abandoning all hope of having a child.”

The study is intended to determine the scope of the problem and identify people who may have been affected.

A proposed class-action lawsuit was subsequently filed against the province of Saskatchewan, the federal government, regional health authorities, and individual doctors.

Posted on March 27, 2019 by Sunny South News

Government budgets often offer some benefits for voters, but when the budget precedes an election, there’s a lot in common with Christmas — there are plenty of gifts, and you try not to think about having to pay for them later.

So it is with the Liberal government’s federal budget tabled last week that will dole out billions of dollars in new spending on all sorts of goodies for Canadians — many of them aimed at helping middle-class voters save money.

The Liberals were aided by the fact that a stronger economy has produced higher-than expected revenue — a projected extra $27.8 billion over the next six years.

Based on Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s plan, the Liberals will spend $22.8 billion of that additional money.

The budget includes: $1.7 billion over five years, and $586 million a year after that, for a Canada Training Benefit to help workers upgrade their skills and learn new ones while staying in their current jobs; $1.18 billion over five years to tighten border security, including hiring more judges to handle judicial reviews of asylum applications; $3.9 billion for farmers (the majority of them in the vote-rich provinces of Ontario and Quebec) in supply-managed industries affected by new trade agreements with the U.S. and Asian countries; $2.2 billion for municipalities’ and First Nations’ infrastructure projects; $950 million for municipal governments to make their buildings more energy-efficient and to provide subsidy programs to help homeowners do the same; $300 million over three years for rebates of up to $5,000 on electric or hydrogen-fuel-cell vehicles.

The budget also calls for putting money toward lowering the interest rate on Canada Student Loans to the prime rate, and to create a new Canadian Drug Agency to centralize evaluations of new drugs and to buy in bulk nationwide, instead of province-by-province.

The provisions include measures to make housing more affordable, particularly for first-time buyers, by increasing the amount they can borrow from RRSPs and by having the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. contribute a small share of equity for down payments.

The budget also provides new rules that will let working seniors keep more of the money they earn before triggering a claw-back in the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS).

The Canada Training Benefit will provide a tax credit of up to $250 per year to help with covering up to half the cost of job training, such as fees for a college course or other professional training programs. Such training is increasingly becoming crucial to help workers keep their skills up to date in a fast-changing workplace.

Similarly, helping working seniors keep more of their earnings in their pockets will be useful in a world where more seniors are having to remain on the job in order to make ends meet.

Of course, all these goodies have to be paid for, and the money for that ultimately comes from taxpayers’ pockets.

The Canadian Press points out the new budget will result in a 2019-20 federal deficit projection of $19.8 billion, including a $3-billion “risk adjustment,” an increase of $200 million from last year’s forecast. The Liberals’ plan includes a gradual reduction in the deficit, but that will happen more slowly than the government anticipated last year.

Morneau’s 460-page budget is titled “Investing in the Middle Class,” but it could perhaps be more appropriately called “Investing in Middle-Class Voters.”

Rather than using the unexpected windfall to reduce the debt or balance the budget, the Liberals have opted to spend the money like a carefree Vegas vacationer who just got lucky at the slot machines.

Affordability expected to dominate federal election campaign

New research has found that affordability will likely dominate the upcoming federal election.

A new public opinion poll has found 48 per cent of Canadians are worried about the rising cost of living and not having enough income to cover their expenses.

A total of 57 per cent listed issues of affordability, economic inequality, wages and taxes, as their top vote drivers for the upcoming federal election. Pharmacare and healthcare costs also rated highly. When shown options to improve affordability, good jobs, healthcare costs, fairer taxes, reducing costs of products and services received the strongest level of support

The survey also found a strong link between affordability anxiety and broader opinions and attitudes about the future economy, immigration, tax rates for the rich, and government regulation of corporations.

The poll was conducted by Abacus Data and presented at the Broadbent Institute’s Progress Summit in Ottawa to shed light on the roots of rising populism and explore progressive solutions to the problems that worry Canadians most.

“Most Canadians believe that while the cost of living and income inequality has gotten worse over the last few years, corporate profits are doing fine,” said David Coletto, CEO of Abacus Data. “What’s quite striking in the results is that both political leaders and corporate Canada are being held responsible for the worsening financial circumstances many Canadians are experiencing.”

“It’s clear both from the polling and from events here and around the world, ignoring rising affordability fears comes with great risk,” said Katrina Miller, Program Director for the Broadbent Institute.

“Many of the affordability concerns people have are natural ground for progressives,” and stagnant wages,” said Miller. “The research tells us we need to offer concrete proposals on issues like housing, healthcare, good jobs, fairer taxes to address affordability in the short and long-term.”

“We have to be careful. If affordability anxiety grows and people feel left out of the economic shift underway, they will be suspectable to divisive rhetoric that pits people against each other,” said Coletto. “There’s a growing group of what I call ‘anxious populists’ who will have a big influence of the next election. They are the least partisan and most persuadable group, so in a sense, they are up for grabs for whoever can make them the best offer.”

“We can’t stand by and allow the politics of division to take hold,” said Miller. “Progressive movements and leaders must listen closely to what ‘anxious populists’ are saying and provide a well-marked path to economic inclusion that gives them hope for the future.”",Affordability expected to dominate federal election campaign,Blackburn News,https://blackburnnews.com/midwestern-ontario/midwestern-ontario-news/2019/03/28/affordability-expected-dominate-federal-election-campaign/

This scene has been repeated around the world; in Nigeria, Ecuador, Indonesia and elsewhere. In what economists call the “resource curse,” countries with minerals or oil are exploited by foreign powers and end up with damaged land, poisoned waters and sullied air.

In a new twist to an old tale, however, the foreign power in this case is Canada, and the indebted nation is the United States. Specifically, Boulder County, Colorado.

It began in October 2015, when the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), the $368 billion behemoth that invests payroll withholding taxes from Canada’s workers on behalf of 20 million contributors, announced a $609 million USD deal to purchase all of the oil and gas assets in the Denver-Julesburg Basin owned by Canadian oil and gas giant Encana.

Many of Encana’s holdings were located in rapidly growing suburban areas near homes and schools north of Denver astride the Interstate 25 corridor between Colorado’s capital and its fourth-largest city, Fort Collins. Others were in communities that had banned hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, such as Broomfield and Boulder counties. The oil and gas industry challenged those bans, and the legal fight reached the Colorado Supreme Court as the Encana deal was being negotiated. The fracking bans were overturned, and when the dust settled, CPPIB had picked up a chunk of sub-surface Colorado real estate and wells producing approximately 30 per cent less than had been announced just months earlier.

It was moving full-steam ahead into a Colorado firestorm of opposition. With all the investments in the world available to them, why would widows in Winnipeg, retirees in Richibucto and teachers in Toronto choose to invest in Colorado’s escalating fracking wars?

TOXIC ASSETS

It may simply be that the CPPIB was willing to go where other companies wouldn’t – the pension board thought they scored a deal from a distressed seller that would yield strong long-term results for their beneficiaries.

The fact that the CPPIB created a new oil and gas company in Colorado, the CPPIB-registered Crestone Peak Resources LLC, rather than simply investing in an existing Canadian-owned one added another quizzical twist to the deal.

John Bennett, a senior policy advisor at the environmental group Friends of the Earth Canada, suggests it may be because fracking is highly controversial in Canada, where three of 10 provinces have banned the practice.

“I don’t think they would ever have invested in a fracking company in Canada,” says Bennett. “Most Canadians would be surprised to know they own a fracking oil company in Colorado.”

Denise Melanson, 70, is one such Canadian. A retired medical social worker who lives in Richibucto, New Brunswick, Melanson had been involved in passing the moratorium in the province. Melanson also receives two pensions from the CPPIB: one that she paid into during her years of employment, and the other she calls an “old-age” benefit that she started receiving when she was 65.

When she learned that some of her benefits might be coming from fracking operations in Colorado, she said in a phone interview, “I was horrified. I’d much rather not be receiving money that was earned by making other people miserable.”

Most Coloradans would also be surprised to know that Canadian pensioners are invested in drilling operations in suburban backyards.

“I have to wonder if the beneficiaries of the pension fund’s investments understand what they’re investing in,” says Boulder County Commissioner Elise Jones. As far as she knows, virtually every elected official in the county – including those from its municipalities – as well as the overwhelming majority of people who live here, oppose the kind of residential drilling plans Crestone is proposing.

Concerns range from the planned drilling around homes and schools, to negative health effects from the industrial facilities’ emissions, to the oil and gas industry’s impact on the Denver metropolitan area’s persistently poor air quality.

FOLLOWING THE MONEY

Along with its purchase of these controversial assets, Crestone was also invested in Colorado’s 2018 election.

Oil and gas issues figured prominently up and down the ballot, from the governor’s race to several ballot initiatives. And Crestone contributed $607,500 to support groups that directly or indirectly opposed Proposition 112, the failed initiative that would have required new oil and gas development to be placed at least 2,500 feet from homes and schools.

Crestone, for example, donated to the pro-industry group Protect Colorado, which campaigned to defeat 112, and other political groups backing Republican state legislature candidates that unswervingly support the oil and gas industry.

Austin Graham, legal counsel for the Campaign Legal Center in Washington, DC, reviewed Crestone’s contributions for their legality.

Federal law requires that foreign-owned companies’ contributions to state campaigns meet a two-part test: the contributions must be drawn from money made from U.S. operations; and the person making the decision to donate must be a U.S. citizen.

But since Crestone is a privately held, Canadian-owned company, it is not obvious where the money came from or who made the decision to contribute to the election.

Crestone states in an email that it follows all state and federal laws, and as a company operating in Colorado, “Crestone allocates a certain amount of funds each year to dedicate to organizations and initiatives that are important to our team. Crestone leadership ultimately makes the decision on which organizations these funds are donated to.”

Those organizations include “independent expenditure committees,” which are also allowed to receive contributions from foreign-owned corporations.

“Regardless of whether any laws were broken,” says Graham, the CPPIB “spent a substantial amount of money trying to influence Colorado voters.”

RESIDENTIAL IMPACTS OF OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT

Crestone has applied for a Comprehensive Drilling Plan (CDP) to move into Boulder County, but the applications for drilling permits are still awaiting approval from the Colorado Oil & Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC), which is slated to meet about Crestone’s CDP in late April in Boulder.

If approved, the plans will have to survive an ongoing lawsuit filed by Boulder County that a judge recently ruled must wait for the COGCC’s final approval to move forward. The company will be subject to Boulder County’s new oil and gas regulations that went into place in March 2017. A bill that would impose greater regulation upon the industry, in part by beefing up local control of drilling, may bolster Boulder County’s position. However, industry representatives have vowed to develop their mineral rights in accordance with whatever Colorado law permits.

Although Boulder County has not seen any new drilling since its ban was lifted in 2016, the impacts of residential oil and gas development are plain to see.

In Weld County, there are 21,694 active wells, according to COGCC. At the same time, new homes have been built within 120 feet of existing oil and gas facilities.

Pressure has been mounting for years around the state to put some brakes on the industry. There have been repeated fires at oil and gas sites, as well as a deadly explosion in 2017 from an abandoned pipeline located less than 200 feet from a home in Firestone, which killed two people. Recent scientific reports state that Weld County’s hydrocarbon production is sullying Boulder County’s air and contributing significantly to pollution in the Denver metro region, which has placed Colorado in the crosshairs of the Environmental Protection Agency for its worsening “non-attainment” of federal clean air standards.

WELCOME TO ""EERIE""

Perhaps no place illuminates these conflicts better than Crestone’s operations in Erie, a former farming community in Boulder and Weld counties with a population of about 2,000 that has grown to a bedroom community of about 25,000 residents today. The first citizen complaint against Crestone’s operations with the COGCC was filed just three months after the CPPIB/Encana deal was finalized.

Noise from a drilling operation smack in the middle of Erie was so loud it was “like a huge semi truck parked in our driveway,” according to one complaint. Others reported rumbling and shaking of Erie homes, pictures falling from walls and disturbing vibrations night and day for weeks on end. Dank smells emanated from the drilling sites, which were just a few hundred feet away from rows of homes, parks, schools, a skate park and even the city offices. Residents joked that their town should be renamed “Eerie.”

Monica Korber who works from her Erie home as a consultant, recalls trying to sleep while her bed was shaking through the night. Soon dozens of people were sharing stories on social media and asking what Crestone was doing to rattle their lives so viscerally. “We never got a straight answer,” Korber said.

After the rumblings stopped the project, Crestone pressed on. Soon, Erie residents were complaining at COGCC meetings and on the agency’s website about noxious smells, leaks, nosebleeds, headaches, industrial noises and lights burning all night outside their bedroom windows.

Erie’s experience with Crestone isn’t isolated. More than 1,000 complaints against Crestone’s operations were filed with the COGCC between November 2016 and February 2019 – almost twice as many as the next five oil and gas companies conducting business in Colorado combined.

Crestone spokesperson Jason Oates has repeatedly stated that residents have abused the complaint process in Erie by organizing complaining campaigns.

In its email response to my questions, Crestone’s public relations department says that, “while none of the complaints resulted in a violation of state standards by the COGCC or the CDPHE [Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment], we knew we needed to make some changes in our operations. We took an above-and-beyond approach to further lessen the temporary impacts that we may have on neighbouring communities.”

One flurry of complaints came after Crestone’s operations caused a release of toxic gases at a site in Erie just 25 yards from the Aspen Ridge Preparatory School playground in September 2017. Crestone was plugging and abandoning a set of wells, and had been venting large quantities of volatile organic compounds before a resident smelled noxious fumes and complained to the COGCC. Those toxic emissions wafted directly onto the school playground of the Kiddie Academy Childcare Center and the elementary school, according to the COGCC’s report on the incident.

The COGCC ordered Crestone to cease operations until the problem was fixed, but parents say they didn’t hear about the leak for months. Mark Kadlececk, who has three children who attended Aspen Ridge, found the “Notice of Alleged Violation” posted on the COGCC website more than six weeks after the violation.

The COGCC fined Crestone $10,000, according to Mike Leonard, the agency’s community relations manager.

Christiaan van Woudenberg, one of Erie’s newly elected trustees, says that when companies like Crestone come into small communities such as Erie, dangling potential tax revenue and arguing (as Crestone spokesman Oates told a community meeting) that there are “no health impacts” from fracking, it is almost impossible not to be steamrolled. He says local elected officials are also hamstrung by state laws that limit their ability to say no to new oil and gas development.

“Erie is fracked,” van Woudenberg says. “We lost. We’re the cautionary tale.”

INVESTMENT QUESTIONS

Besides the fact that Crestone is seeking to operate in communities that oppose it, there’s a larger question for the CPPIB: is residential drilling in Colorado a smart investment?

Crestone continues to face legal challenges that are increasing the cost of doing business in Colorado. The company has been involved in lawsuits, protests, leaks and alleged violations of state regulations in multiple communities. Crestone, in turn, has sued the state and at least one other oil and gas company, alleging interference in its operations.

While Crestone is private, there are several clues that the CPPIB’s Colorado investment may be problematic. As of last month, the CPPIB’s website stated that the value of the investment had dropped to $543 million from the purchase price of $609 million.

Analysts are also divided about the future of shale development, with some predicting slow growth in 2019 and others convinced that many parts of the industry are burdened with debt and uncertainty regarding future regulatory regimes, international price fluctuations and the increasingly competitive cost of renewable energy technology. Other investors remain bullish on oil stocks but are moving away from riskier investments in politically volatile countries such as Venezuela, Russia, and Saudi Arabia, and are looking to U.S. fracking operations as a safer alternative. Both Noble Energy and Anadarko reported record Colorado oil production in 2018.

Then there’s climate change. Canada, a signatory to the Paris climate agreement, faces some cognitive dissonance with the CPPIB’s fossil fuel portfolio. Financial and legal analysts as well as climate activists point out that Canada cannot export its fossil fuel investments and still claim it is moving to reduce its carbon footprint.

In a report released in January entitled Time To Act, Canadian law professors Janis Sarra (University of British Columbia) and Cynthia Williams (Osgoode Hall Law School at York University) conclude that, “The CPPIB has enormous potential to help shift governance practice to meet the issues discussed in this report.”

That potential has yet to be unleashed, says Williams in an interview. Canada is heavily invested in the oil and gas sector, and all recent indicators are that those investments “already have a lot of risk,” she says, partly exemplified by the drop in value of the Canadian dollar and declining returns from oil and gas investments in comparison to other sectors. “Why would the CPP double down on oil and gas developments?”

Various organizations in Canada have tried to push the CPPIB towards a more sustainable, lower-carbon portfolio, without much success, says Bennett. The CPPIB has expressly avoided committing itself to environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments, stating that, “Consistent with the CPP Investment Board’s belief that constraints decrease returns and/or increase risk over time, we do not screen stocks or eliminate investments based on ESG factors. The CPP Investment Board considers the securities of any issuer all of whose businesses are lawful, and would be lawful if carried on in Canada, as eligible for investment.”

As many of the affected residents have noted, what is lawful in Colorado isn’t necessarily admirable. Many state laws were written in an earlier era of oil and gas exploration. They never anticipated new horizontal drilling and fracking techniques that allow companies like Crestone to build pads of 10, 20 and 30 wells and drill underneath hundreds of people’s homes for miles in every direction. These well pads are accompanied by rows of storage tanks, condensers, combustors and separators, as well as thousands of truck trips a day in and out of these mini-industrial complexes.

BURNING UP THE PLANET

Groups looking to aggressively address climate change are targeting pension funds around the world. As concerns resonate across the globe, investments in fossil fuel companies are increasingly seen as bad bets. Viable alternatives are emerging – with better financial rewards.

In the U.S., the divestment movement has made great strides in the past few years ever since Stanford University made headlines by selling off its coal stocks in 2014. Clara Vondrich, global director of DivestInvest – a philanthropic movement that encourages large institutional investors to move away from fossil fuels in favor of more sustainable investments – says that since 2014, more than 1,000 institutional investors have committed to fossil-free investments, with growth of capital investments rising from $52 billion to more than $8 trillion today.

Various backdated investment comparisons such as those done by the U.S. divestment advocacy group As You Sow confirm that portfolios without fossil fuel investments would have performed better than those with them. Says Vondrich: “These are underperforming assets that are also burning up the planet.” Now, she says, the CPPIB and other large investors “increasingly have a fiduciary duty to explain why they don’t divest, rather than the other way around.”

CALLING EDMONTON

At a January 2019 conference hosted by the Rocky Mountain Mineral Law Foundation, Crestone’s Oates told the audience that the company had met all of the requirements laid out by the COGCC for its drilling plans, and Crestone would forge ahead into Boulder County despite resident and local governments’ objections. “It is how, not if, we are going to drill,” Oates told the audience.

Sara Loflin, executive director of the League of Oil and Gas Impacted Coloradans, attended the conference and was taken aback by the “arrogance” of Oates’ remarks. In response to multiple communities’ concerns ever since it started doing business in Colorado, Loflin said, Crestone has only proposed moving “closer to homes, in higher risk areas, in larger scale developments.”

In its email to this reporter, Crestone disputes this and says it aims “to operate safely, responsibly, efficiently and with minimal impact on local communities, while acting as good stewards for the land, air and water. This is a priority for us because as Coloradans, we value these natural assets, and we live here, too.”

Back in Erie, grandmother Monica Korber says that she and her neighbors suffer not just the proximity of the industrial operations, but also from the discord that they have unleashed on her community. She has joined a lawsuit against her elected officials for not doing more to protect Erie citizens.

Korber’s message to the CPPIB? “Why don’t you drill next to the homes of the people where you’re sending those retirement checks?”

This is likely the Liberals' way of stating that the deal is damaging for many agricultural sectors ...","Most people expected an electoral budget, and that is exactly what Canadians got. For the agrifood sector, the budget was underwhelming at best, and provided little hope for the near future.

Let's start with supply management. It was interesting to see that the Liberals opted to do exactly what the Harper government did in the middle of an election campaign, back in 2015. At the time, the Conservatives hastily announced an out-of-nowhere $4-billion compensation package for supply-managed sectors, amid signing the defunct Transpacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, now known as Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). As in 2015, the Liberals provided no hint as to how they intend to make our supply-managed sectors more competitive in the future. Monies will be allocated based on speculation and presumptions, just to buy peace, since no timeline for the compensation was provided.

This time, the sum of $3.9 billion in funding is budgeted, which includes $2.15 billion in direct compensation. The sum also includes another $1.5 billion for a Quota Value Guarantee Program that would be applied on an on-demand basis when the quota has been sold. In other words, Canadians will be acquiring quotas back from farmers, initially given out years ago, and at no charge. The motivation to procure votes in Quebec for the upcoming election was extremely obvious. To do this right, the budget should have also looked beyond supply management, to support other sectors that are also negatively affected by trade.

So, this is the path chosen by the Liberals. We get to keep an outdated system while subsidizing farmers who have prided themselves for years on not accepting public subsidies. Compensating farmers without a plan for the future of supply management is the worst possible scenario for everyone, starting with the farmers themselves. They will only see their sector shrink further, especially in dairy, and many more farms will disappear with no strategy for less populous regions in the country, like the Prairies and the Atlantic. This will be a slow and painful way to go.

Nothing is planned for other commodities, including canola, pulses and others, affected by quasi-embargoes and trade disputes. There is a small budget, at least, set aside for African Swine Fever, a disaster-in-waiting for our hog sector. It is just a matter of time before the disease hits North America. Once it does, we'll need to brace ourselves for another mad cow type of scenario.

What was interesting is that the compensation program does not extend to concessions made under NAFTA 2.0, also known as the United States, Mexico and Canada Agreement. This is likely the Liberals' way of stating that the deal is damaging for many agricultural sectors and therefore stands little or no chance of being ratified. This is as good an admission as we will get from the Liberals, and we should not expect more. It is also probably the only thing which made sense for the agrifood sector in this budget.

Some provisions were made for a food strategy. If Canada wants to make good on the aspirations of our newly-minted Food Guide, our agricultural landscape will need to change, and follow a new, much needed strategy. We need more fruits and vegetables in this country. However, a budget of $134 million over five years toward this end is hardly anything. Quebec, a province with a population of under nine million and which has just adopted its own food strategy, is spending more than double that sum, in this year alone.

Our food processing folks, who represent the largest manufacturing sector in the country, were given peanuts. The budget plans to award $100 million to support innovation and plant upkeep projects. Given that the cradle of food innovation has always been food processing, that sum is almost insulting to the 250,000 people working in this sector.

A total of $24 million is dedicated to food fraud, in support of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)'s effort to crack down on the cheaters. It is estimated that food fraud is costing our agrifood sector anywhere between $10 to $30 billion a year. This problem is massive, so the CFIA needs all the help it can get.

For agrifood, this budget regrettably doesn't accomplish much, other than admitting that the USMCA trade agreement was a bad deal. But everyone knew that already. For the rest, the budget feels like the Liberals, an urban-focused government, are simply checking boxes to please a sector that it barely understands. But Canadians are smarter than that.",Sylvain Charlebois: Federal budget leaves Canada’s agrifood sector with worst possible scenario,The Hamilton Spectator,https://www.thespec.com/opinion-story/9235612-sylvain-charlebois-federal-budget-leaves-canada-s-agrifood-sector-with-worst-possible-scenario/

Miramar, Florida, mayor declares Democratic presidential bid

A mayor you have never heard of is running for president — and believes he has a shot. Florida Democrat Wayne Messam announced his candidacy on Thursday

By TERRY SPENCER

Associated Press

Unless you are a Florida State University football fan, chances are you have never heard of the newest Democratic candidate for president — but Wayne Messam is hoping to quickly change that.

The mayor of Miramar, Florida, Messam announced Thursday that he is joining the crowded field seeking to unseat President Donald Trump in next year’s election.

Messam, who played for the Seminoles in the 1990s, believes Miramar has much that the rest of the United States would like to have — environmentally-friendly development, high-end manufacturing and major corporate operations.

The 44-year-old construction company owner also knows why pundits say he won’t win: low name recognition and funding; no sitting mayor has ever won the presidency; his lack of political experience and more.

But he is quick to respond with why he can.

Why does he have to be governor or a senator first? Trump wasn’t.

Who says mayors don’t have the necessary experience? Messam says he deals with infrastructure and business needs on a micro level in his Fort Lauderdale suburb in ways governors and senators don’t. Most politicians also haven’t run a small business for 20 years, he says, learning how to balance government regulations needed to protect the environment while allowing room for companies to prosper.

Messam also points out he is the only candidate from battleground Florida and the strategically important Deep South and his positions align with liberal voters. He favours universal health care, student loan forgiveness, infrastructure improvements, working to alleviate climate change and focusing education toward a high-tech future. He would repeal Trump’s tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy to pay for it. He also would ban military-style rifles and tighten background checks for gun purchases.

“When people get elected into Washington with no local government experience, they are so high in the stratosphere that they have no concept, no consciousness of some of the local challenges that cities and communities face. And America is basically a network of cities and communities,” Messam said.

Miramar, with 140,000 residents, is larger than the city of the more attention-getting mayor eyeing the race, Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana. And while South Bend, population 103,000, is known for the University of Notre Dame, Miramar holds the headquarters of Spirit Airlines and has satellite operations for Carnival and Royal Caribbean cruise lines and American Express.

Messam said the United States needs an economic plan that emphasizes educating adults and children to thrive amid ever-increasing automation, and one that better competes internationally.

“China just released a manifesto, a 50-year plan about their dominance and how the world is going to need China’s exceptionalism and greatness and leadership. Where is our plan?” Messam said this week while cruising Miramar in his Cadillac Escalade.

Andy Oxenhorn, the president of JL Audio, said his 570-employee company manufacturers its high-end audio speakers in Miramar because Messam has maintained policies that predate the mayor, who was recently re-elected to a second four-year term. He said Messam, because of his proximity, understands the damage Trump’s tariffs are causing his company, which now pays a 10-per cent tax on imported parts.

“He is business-friendly, he has people working for him who are encouraging to our business and are not putting up obstacles to us getting the job done,” Oxenhorn said.

Messam grew up in South Bay, an agricultural town of 3,500 adjoining Lake Okeechobee. His parents emigrated from Jamaica — his father cut sugar cane before becoming a farm mechanic. His mother was a cook and housekeeper. He starred at Glades Central High, a football powerhouse, before coach Bobby Bowden recruited him to Florida State.

A wide receiver, he played on the Seminoles’ 1993 national championship team and had six catches for 103 yards in their 1996 Orange Bowl win over Notre Dame. After graduating with a degree in management information systems, he and his wife, Angela, started Messam Construction, which focuses on energy-efficient schools and government projects. They have three children in college.

His strategist, Phillip Thompson, believes Messam’s story will resonate in South Carolina, a key early primary state the campaign is focusing on to create momentum elsewhere. The Democratic electorate is 60 per cent African-American, much of the state is rural, college football is king and Messam is visiting the state frequently, courting local party officials.

If Messam gets traction there, Thompson believes, he will qualify for the party’s televised debates, putting him in front of a national audience.

Antjuan Seawright, a South Carolina Democratic strategist not aligned with any campaign, said Messam faces tough competition in the state. Sens. Corey Booker and Kamala Harris, both African-Americans, are popular, as are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Buttigieg is working South Carolina hard.

“I don’t know what group his supporters would be,” Seawright said. “I’ve learned never to count anyone out because you’ll learn you can’t count, but he faces challenges.”",Correction: Election 2020-Florida Mayor story,Leader-Post,https://leaderpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/correction-election-2020-florida-mayor-story/wcm/71063efe-dff2-43a4-a743-5df02667a99b

I have tried to bridge a gap there, the election is over, Drew Dilkens can’t take his finger off — there are two crown jewels in this ...","Sluggish sales of the Windsor-built Chrysler Pacifica have prompted Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to eliminate the third shift at the Windsor Assembly Plant and with it about 1,500 jobs and hundreds of others at feeder plants.

It will be the first time the plant has operated with just two shifts since 1993.

“It’s devastating,” said a visibly emotional Unifor Local 444 president Dave Cassidy at a Thursday afternoon news conference at the Turner Road union hall.

“It’s devastating for everybody.”

They go up and down, we have layoff weeks, there’s inventory adjustment and at that point there was no discussion of that at all

Cassidy and secretary-treasurer James Stewart were summoned to a meeting with Chrysler officials at 2 p.m.

“In our collective agreement they have to provide six months notice, so September of 2019 there could be, potentially, 1,500 jobs lost at Windsor Assembly Plant, going down to two shifts,” said Cassidy.

“This is not a General Motors/Oshawa issue, this is a sales and a business decision. I can tell you we are going to keep pressure on FCA … to fully utilize our facility.”

FCA Canada head of communications LouAnn Gosselin confirmed the news in an emailed statement.

“In order to better align production with global demand at its Windsor Assembly Plant, FCA notified Unifor today that it intends to return the plant to a traditional two-shift operation, beginning Sept. 30, 2019,” Gosselin wrote.

“Retirement packages will be offered to eligible employees. The Company will make every effort to place indefinitely laid off hourly employees in open full-time positions as they become available based on seniority.”

On Tuesday, FCA announced that Windsor Assembly, which currently employs 6,100 people, would be on shutdown for the weeks of April 8 and 15.

It will be the third time the plant is on shutdown this year, but Cassidy said he was blindsided by Thursday’s announcement.

“No, I had no indication,” Cassidy said.

“They announced the two-week shutdown and that’s all we knew. It’s cyclical, right? They go up and down, we have layoff weeks, there’s inventory adjustment and at that point there was no discussion of that at all. At 2 o’clock today James and I received the notice, the company asked us to come to a meeting, we went to a meeting.

“It’s so new.”

Asked about Mayor Drew Dilkens’ state of the city speech earlier this year where Dilkens stressed Windsor’s need to diversify, Cassidy became enraged.

“(Expletive) Drew,” Cassidy said.

“Seriously. Drew Dilkens, I have reached out to Drew Dilkens so many times, I have tried to bridge a gap there, the election is over, Drew Dilkens can’t take his finger off — there are two crown jewels in this city right tied to this local, Windsor Assembly Plant and Casino Windsor. Drew Dilkens needs to pay attention to this. This is devastating for the City of Windsor and I hope that Drew Dilkens might reach out to me.

“That’s it. I’m good.”

Cassidy then abruptly ended the news conference and bolted out of the union hall.

Yearly Canadian sales of the Pacifica were down 186 vehicles to 5,999 in 2018 while Caravan sales slipped by about 14,700 units to 32,253. Sales of the Pacifica in the U.S. (118,322) in 2018 were virtually unchanged. Caravan sales jumped from 125,196 in 2017 to 151,927 last year.

Within hours of the announcement provincial and federal politicians of all stripes weighed in on the news.

“In the face of this extremely disappointing announcement from Fiat Chrysler, our government will not waver in our support for the thousands of men and women that go to work in Ontario’s auto sector every day,” Premier Doug Ford said in a statement.

“I want the employees at the Windsor Assembly Plant to know that my government stands with you and your families. We will fight tooth and nail to protect the jobs of the autoworkers in Windsor.”

Ford said he will be speaking with FCA Canada president Reid Bigland and Unifor president Jerry Dias to urge them to work with him to protect those jobs.

“My message to Fiat Chrysler is this: do not make this decision based on the anti-business policies of the former government over the past 15 years,” Ford said.

“Our government is lowering taxes, lowering electricity rates and slashing red tape. There has never been a better time for auto manufacturers to invest in the Province of Ontario.”

NDP Opposition Leader Andrea Horwath urged the government to move quickly.

“We can be a world-leader in manufacturing the cars of the future for generations to come, but it won’t happen by accident,” Horwath said in a statement.

“We need the provincial government to take action to keep Ontario on the cutting edge of the auto sector. Tens of thousands of Ontario jobs in auto, auto parts and spinoff industries, are at risk if the province fails to take action.”

The federal Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Navdeep Bains also issued a statement.

“I am very disappointed by the news coming from the Windsor Fiat-Chrysler Automotive plant,” Bains said.

“My immediate thoughts are with the affected employees, their families and the community of Windsor. I will be travelling to Windsor tomorrow to offer our government’s unwavering support for these workers and their families, and our commitment to fight for their jobs.”

The three local NDP MPs also released a joint statement about the shift elimination.

“The prime minister and the innovation minister love to talk about innovation and a high tech economy but they have done noting to implement the national auto strategy that would ensure that Canadians actually get jobs,” said Windsor West MP and NDP Innovation, Science, Economic Development and Auto Critic Brian Masse.

“This is what abandoning manufacturing has led to. Prime Minister Trudeau campaigned on transitioning away from manufacturing and apparently he is getting his wish as workers lose their jobs.”

Issues of law and order are always ripe for political debate. But in recent years, there’s been much discussion of an increase in rural crime across the province.

In March 2018, the provincial government issued a seven-point plan, along with $10 million in funding, to mitigate rural crime.

Brooks-Medicine Hat NDP candidate Lynn MacWilliam says this plan created specialized Rural Crime Reduction Units and adds 39 new RCMP officers, 40 civilian staff and 10 prosecutors to focus on rural crime.

According to her, there’s been a 16 per cent reduction in rural crime between December 2017 and December 2018, with 480 fewer homes broken into, 3,500 fewer thefts and 1,200 fewer vehicles stolen.

“I need to stress that not every community has seen the same level of decreases and the problem won’t be solved overnight, but Rachel Notley and the RCMP have been making real progress,” said MacWilliam.

Michaela Glasgo, the UCP candidate in Brooks-Medicine Hat, says combating rural crime would be a major priority of a UCP government, pointing to their July 2018 report, “A Safer Alberta: United Conservative Strategy to Tackle the Rural Crime Crisis.”

“The recommendations contained in the report are actions that can be taken to strengthen police response capability, effectively deal with repeat offenders, improve data collection, combat court delays, improve services for victims, strengthen crime prevention efforts, and reduce property crime in rural communities,” said Glasgo.

She says a UCP government would also introduce a bill modelled after “Clare’s Law” in the U.K., which allows police to notify women if their partner has an abusive past.

According to Statistics Canada, Alberta has the third-highest rate of reported domestic violence in the country, behind Saskatchewan and Manitoba.

The riding’s Alberta Party candidate Jim Black – a former police officer – says the Alberta Party’s shadow budget includes funding for policing in rural municipalities.

“We’ve been saying this for over two years as part of our policy platform, so I think we’re ahead of the NDP in this area by a substantial margin,” he said.

Black says many rural police forces are understaffed and overwhelmed, which makes it harder to dedicate the resources necessary to effectively fight crime.

“That’s not a very pleasant position to be in, when you’re running from scene to scene. You end up chasing your tail because you don’t have enough manpower to support the community’s needs,” he said.

Todd Beasley, the independent conservative candidate for Brooks-Medicine Hat, says he wants to “re-allocate resources so we can improve the response times” for police in rural areas.

“I think we need to put law and order first, and law breakers second,” he said. “Our criminal justice system seems to have it wrong at times.”

He called it “ridiculous” that rural landowners who shoot intruders are criminally charged, the result of a “liberal law system that is protecting the criminal over protecting people in rural areas.”

Beasley says the province should pressure the federal government, which is responsible for amending the Criminal Code, to take a more “punitive” approach.

“I stand by the landowners,” said Beasley. “If you break the law, I’m not on your side. In fact, I’m your enemy.”

He said he likes the UCP’s plan, but “maybe it needs to be a little bit tougher.”

They say that instead of repaying the federal government, that money can now be reinvested in programs, wellness, governance and youth.

Chiefs from the Dehcho, Inuvialuit, Gwich’in, Sahtu, Tlicho and South Slave regions were in Detah on Tuesday to meet with Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations Carolyn Bennett.

The Liberal government earmarked $1.4-billion over seven years for loan forgiveness across Canada in the 2019 federal budget.

Yellowknives Dene First Nation Chief Ernest Betsina said the decision is welcomed.

“This forgiveness grant will be provided to our future generations … and provide more opportunities that can support First Nations,” he said.

Betsina said past federal cutbacks under previous governments affected core funding, negotiations, language planning and housing.

Loan system to negotiate land claims not ‘successful’

In 2018, the federal government adopted a grant system to capture the “actual costs of self-government,” Bennett said.

The 2019 budget also sets aside $40 million over five years for First Nations to research and develop claims.

“Getting to self-government shouldn’t be based on loans anymore. People spending 20 years and then $30-million in debt to not quite get there, has just not been successful,” she said.

Negotiation on a loan basis was a hard-sell for communities, she said.

“If people don’t feel that things are fair then it’s pretty hard for them to get their communities behind them to do the work,” Bennett said.

‘Long ways to go’

Tlicho Grand Chief George Mackenzie told Bennett self-government will improve the future for young Indigenous people.

“Us in the Aboriginal world have a long ways to go yet, but we will not get there if we don’t have the federal support that we are seeking,” he said.

As the federal election approaches, Mackenzie said people will be looking for a party “committed 101 per cent to make things happen.”

“Our young people today, everywhere, are crying for help … we lack resources … we lack the funding,” he said.

Other negotiations proceeding

Yellowknives Dene Chief Ernest Betsina announced that Akaitcho First Nations could have an agreement in principle this year. They have been negotiating since 1992.

Grand Chief Gladys Norwegian reminded Bennett that the Dehcho First Nations have been in talks with Canada for nearly 20 years, and negotiations are stalled over surface and subsurface resource rights.

The Dehcho First Nations want to temporarily set aside land and resources and work on issues like education and self-government, Norwegian said.

“We are trying to decide how that looks like for us. It is a struggle and we really would like to move forward, but make sure that it is on our terms, that we are moving toward self-determination,” Norwegian said.

Meanwhile, K’atl’odeeche First Nation Chief April Martel says the community is leaning toward self-government, but has concerns about keeping reserve status under the Indian Act.

“That’s really powerful to our people because we don’t want to lose that. I want you to recognize that,” she said to Bennett.

The monthly Business Barometer index, by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, increased by 1.8 points in the province but Alberta business owners remain the least confident in the country.

“With a provincial election in full swing, Alberta’s entrepreneurs are looking for the parties to make meaningful policy commitments to help our province’s small and medium-sized business sector shake off the recession and start growing again. Having solid economic policies will be key to reinvigorating Alberta’s business confidence” said Richard Truscott, Vice-President, Alberta and BC, in a statement.

While small business confidence rose to 42.1 points in March, it continues to fall short of the national average of 55.9. The CFIB says the 65 to 75 point range (on the 100 point scale) indicates a healthy and growing economy.

The CFIB survey in Alberta also found that 11 per cent of business owners are expecting their full-time employment levels to go up in the near future, representing a two-point increase from February’s results. Also, 60 per cent expect their full time employment level to remain the same, and 29 per cent expect it to decrease.

The provincial numbers for March were: Nova Scotia (66.8), Quebec (65.3), Prince Edward Island (59.7), Ontario (59.5), New Brunswick (56.6), British Columbia (55.9), Manitoba (51.4), Saskatchewan (50.8), Newfoundland & Labrador (48.7), and Alberta (42.1).

“Small business confidence continues to disappoint. The index moved sideways, near 60, for most of 2018, but has averaged 57 so far in 2019. This subdued performance is consistent with a moderating economy and downwardly revised growth forecasts. Reinforcing this point is an easing in indicators of capacity constraints, including lower gauges of inflationary pressures and reduced incidence of labour shortages as a factor limiting production,” said Omar Abdelrahman, an economist with TD Economics.

“The resource-heavy provinces and natural resource sectors continue to weigh down on the index’s performance. With Alberta’s (oil producation) curtailment plan supporting prices in the near term, some of this weakness should be reversed. That said, confidence in the sector and the province are likely to remain weak for some time given structural issues related to market access, uncertainty related to global oil prices, and weaknesses in the outlook for some other commodities that will impact the Prairies more broadly.”

Updated

Vanessa Rodel, one of the asylum seekers who sheltered American whistle-blower Edward Snowden in Hong Kong in 2013, has been granted asylum in Canada, where she arrived with her daughter earlier this week.

Key points: The Snowden refugees sheltered American whistle-blower Edward Snow while he was hiding in Hong Kong

A Sri Lankan family-of-four and an ex-soldier are still waiting for their claims to be accepted

The five asylum seekers in Hong Kong could be deported to their home countries

Ms Rodel, who fled the Philippines in 2002, was caught in a prolonged process of appealing against a previously rejected asylum application in Hong Kong, which her lawyer alleged was stalled by an Australian lawyer.

The Filipino woman is among a group of seven asylum seekers who took turns sheltering Mr Snowden in Hong Kong after the former NSA contractor leaked documents exposing the US Government's Prism surveillance program.

The group, known as the ""Snowden refugees"", also includes a Sri Lankan family — Supun Kellapatha, his wife Nadeeka Dilrukshi and their two children — as well as ex-Sri Lankan soldier Ajith Kankanamalage.

The refugees were introduced to Mr Snowden in 2013 by a mutual lawyer, Robert Tibbo, who figured their homes in some of Hong Kong's poorest neighbourhoods would be the last place anyone would look for Mr Snowden.

After the group's protection claims in Hong Kong were all rejected by the local government in May 2017, they lodged an appeal with the Hong Kong Government's Torture Claims Appeal Board (TCAB).

In the same year, refugee claims had been filed on their behalf in Canada by Montreal-based lawyer Marc-Andre Seguin.

While Ms Rodel and her seven-year-old daughter have been granted asylum in Canada, the other Snowden refugees are stuck in limbo.

Delay 'literally beyond my comprehension': Tibbo

Mr Tibbo, who represented the Snowden refugees in Hong Kong, claimed an Australian adjudicator who heard Ms Rodel's appeal case in November 2017 sat on her case for almost a year-and-a-half without making a decision.

He told the ABC that the adjudicator — who he revealed to be Gregory Brock, a member of the TCAB — told him at the time that he would make a decision as soon as mid-December 2017.

Meanwhile, he said another Australian adjudicator, Fraser Syme, who heard the case of the Sri Lanka family, rejected their case last October, while the case of the Sri Lankan soldier is still pending a decision.

""What is so disturbing is that Mr Brock didn't let me finish [my oral submission] — which was grossly unfair,"" he told the ABC.

""He said he was going to decide quickly, and then you know what he does? He sits on the case for 17 months and does nothing.

""This is literally beyond my comprehension — how an educated, experienced lawyer acting as an adjudicator can just sit on a case for 17 months.""

Mr Tibbo said Ms Rodel and her daughter Keana were finally granted asylum in Canada this January, but were asked by Hong Kong immigration authorities to withdraw their appeal application.

The ABC approached Mr Brock and Mr Syme for comments but they did not respond by publication time.

'I am so, so happy': Rodel arrives in Canada with daughter

Ms Rodel, who arrived in Quebec on Monday, are now permanent residents in Canada and will reportedly continue to be sponsored by For the Refugees — a Canadian NGO dedicated to helping the Snowden refugees — until they can settle into their new lives.

She told the ABC that her priorities would be to look for a place to live, find a school for her daughter Keana and eventually learn to speak French.

""I am so, so happy,"" she said, adding that she couldn't believe her asylum was granted when Mr Tibbo first called to deliver the news.

""I asked him 'are you joking with me?'

""I can't explain how happy I am right now and I'm so grateful in Quebec.""

However, she hoped that the other asylum seekers in Hong Kong could also have their refugee claims accepted by Canada.

Five other 'Snowden refugees' stuck behind in Hong Kong

Mr Tibbo said after Mr Syme rejected the Sri Lankan family's appeal, the family then filed a ""judicial review leave application"" with the Hong Kong High Court.

He explained that the application was essentially asking permission for their case to be heard in full, but added that the chance of it being approved was slim.

""They're at the end of the road because once the appeals are rejected [by the Hong Kong tribunal] then it's written in legislation and that is final and you can be detained and deported,"" he said.

""The only way to protect them was to have them file a judiciary review leave application in the High Court, so we did that.

WINNIPEG, March 27 (MarketsFarm) – ICE Futures canola contracts were weaker at the end of trading on Wednesday, as tensions between Canada and China has continued to weigh on values.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday he will consider sending a high-level delegation to China to discuss the ongoing situation between the two countries. His announcement came after China banned Viterra from selling canola to the country.

China took the action against Viterra yesterday in the same fashion it banned canola shipments from Richardson International earlier this month – in that Chinese authorities alleged they found hazardous pests in the shipments.

The dispute stems from the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou by Canadian authorities in December at the request of United States authorities. Meng is now facing extradition to the U.S., where she faces fraud charges.

The Canadian dollar was down at 74.57 U.S. cents by mid-afternoon on Wednesday, which provided some support.

Support also came from canola now being more competitive with other vegetable oils and improvements in the crush margins.

About 13,555 contracts were traded on Wednesday, which compares with Tuesday when approximately 24,000 contracts changed hands.

SOYBEAN futures at the Chicago Board of Trade were weaker on Wednesday.

Trade talks between the United States and China are set for Thursday and Friday in China, with a Chinese delegation travelling to the U.S. next week for further negotiations. While a final deal is still expected by the end of April, there are indications it might be delayed. U.S. President Donald Trump wants a deal completed no later than the 2020 Presidential Election, which kicks off early next year.

There are indications that tariffs the U.S. and China have imposed on each other in their trade war will not cease immediately with a final agreement. Rather, the tariffs could be gradually eliminated.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture releases two reports on March 29, its Prospective Planting report and its Grain Stocks report. Traders have been positioning themselves ahead of Friday.

The American Farm Bureau has estimated there is US$76 billion of corn and soybeans in the Mississippi and Missouri River basins that could be at risk to flooding. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has forecast unprecedented flooding this spring in those basins.

CORN futures were also weaker on Wednesday, as Ukraine’s exports are up. As of March 21, Ukraine’s exports stand at 302.3 million tonnes for an increase of 22.7 per cent year-over-year.

WHEAT futures were stronger on Tuesday on news that Russia’s wheat exports were down. The country’s exports dell 5.2 per cent in 2018-19 compared to a year ago.

It proved to be ... immigrating to a less-than-welcoming Canada a hundred years ago.","Dog-whistling politicians don’t usually inspire great art. But inspiration can be a strange thing.

Halifax-based singer-songwriter Ben Caplan says one of the earliest sparks for both his album ""Old Stock"" and the theatre production based on the same songs came from an unlikely source, albeit in a negative way. In 2015, then Prime Minister Stephen Harper used the term “old stock Canadians” in a national debate during his failed attempt at re-election.

It proved to be a controversial and polarizing remark, particularly since it was made when discussing refugees. It immediately brought accusations that Harper had purposely used the term to energize his base and engage in identity politics. Harper denied this. But Caplan was among many Canadians who found the remark deeply unsettling. Why separate new and “old-stock” Canadians, particularly during a debate about health care for refugees?

“It really sounded like a dog-whistle to me,” says Caplan, in an interview with Postmedia during a tour stop in Victoria. “It sounded to me like a call to make an us and a them, to be othering new Canadians.”

Caplan found himself applying it to his own family history, which included his Jewish great-grandparents immigrating to a less-than-welcoming Canada a hundred years ago.

“They were others,” says the songwriter, who will be performing a sold-out show at Festival Hall on April 3. “They were not considered to be the natural Canadian stock and they were not considered the sort of people who could become old-stock Canadians.”

All of this would eventually come to inform both ""Old Stock: A Refugee Love Story"", the theatre piece Caplan co-created with playwright Hannah Moscovitch and songwriter Christian Barry, and Old Stock, the album Caplan adapted from it.

Caplan and Barry teamed up to write a musical — or a “concert-theatre mashup” — with the guiding principle that all the songs should be able to stand on their own outside of a narrative. But initially they struggled with what that narrative should be.

“Partially in response to Harper and partially in response to seeing the image of the young child Alan Kurdi washing up on a beach in Turkey, we realized we wanted to make about refugees and about immigrants,” Caplan says. “That hadn’t been clear to us before, we had been searching for some story. As we began to hone in on a refugee story, Hannah discovered the story of her great-grandparents which had been unknown to her. Having just given birth to her first child, she went on a trip with some relatives to the Pier 21 museum in Halifax and realized she was standing on the very ground that her great-grandparents had passed through in order to make her own life and the life of her child and the life of her child possible for her in Canada. It was a real moving moment for her and really became the underpinning for this theatrical production.”

""Old Stock: A Refugee Love Story"" opened in Halifax in 2017 with Caplan in the lead role. It would later enjoy successful runs in New York and at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Calgarians will get a chance to see it in full next February when Caplan will return as part of Alberta Theatre Projects’ 2019-2020 season.

But on April 3, the singer-songwriter will be performing more of a straight-forward concert, albeit one that draws heavily from the new album and is backed by a five-piece band well-versed in the traditional Jewish and Eastern European strains, including klezmer, that the new songs require. The show will also feature Vancouver singer-songwriter Geoff Berner, a master of klezmer-punk whose songs Widow Bride and Traveler’s Curse are covered by Caplan on Old Stock.

Caplan was born in Hamilton, Ont., but has been based in Halifax since his college days. ""Old Stock"" is his third record and reflects his growing interest in the music of his ancestors.

“I didn’t grow up with Klezmer music as such as much as I grew up going to synagogue and hearing some of these musical modes through liturgical services,” he says. “I really didn’t have a deep sense of the musicality of those kinds of sounds until my early 20s when I had this epiphany listening to a brass band and realizing that this Balkan brass sounded deeply familiar and personal even though it’s totally different than anything I had every heard before. That began a process of exploration and research and digging into those musical styles, which have crept more and more into my musical output from album to album. This album, ""Old Stock"", and this project was really an opportunity for me to dig in with both hands and explore what was there.”

OTTAWA (Reuters) - A former cabinet member at the heart of a crisis that could cost Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau his job on Friday released documents to back up her case that she had been pressured to help a large corporation avoid a corruption trial.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations that officials inappropriately leaned on former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to ensure construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc escaped a trial by paying a fine instead.

The crisis may well threaten Trudeau's reelection chances in a vote this October. Polls show his centre-left Liberals, who as recently as January looked certain to win, could lose to the official opposition Conservatives.

Wilson-Raybould made public around 40 pages of documents revealing more details of what she said were attempts by officials to force her change her mind even after she insisted they desist.

Wilson-Raybould, who was demoted to veterans affairs minister in January and resigned the following month, first made the allegations in almost four hours of testimony to the House of Commons justice committee last month.

Trudeau says officials were trying to make Wilson-Raybould understand that thousands of jobs would be at risk if SNC-Lavalin were found guilty of bribing Libyan officials. Trudeau insists he and his team did nothing wrong.

The affair has so far cost Trudeau two high-profile female cabinet ministers, his closest personal aide and the head of the federal bureaucracy, Michael Wernick.

Wilson-Raybould included a recording of a phone call with Wernick last December in which he told her he was worried about ""a collision"" between her and Trudeau ""because he is pretty firm about this.""

Wilson-Raybould, who stressed she thought the call was inappropriate, told Wernick she was waiting ""for the other shoe to drop"" because she was under no illusion about how Trudeau ""gets things that he wants.""

Opposition legislators said the documents reinforced their demand for a public inquiry into the matter, something Trudeau says is not necessary.

""She is actually trying to speak truth to power, trying to say, 'You can't do this,' ... and it keeps happening,"" New Democratic Party parliamentarian Nathan Cullen told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.

Trudeau's office was not immediately available for comment.

The crisis is opening rifts inside the Liberal Party and some legislators want Wilson-Raybould to be kicked out of the parliamentary caucus, a move Trudeau has so far resisted.

Now, Saskatchewan’s longest-serving Conservative Member of Parliament — and one of just a few left from the Canadian Alliance days — says he won’t stand for re-election when Canadians go to the polls in the fall.

“We’ve put in six terms and at some point there’s a reason to go back to a normal life, particularly around family life,” Anderson said, adding that he spends about two-thirds of his time away from his wife, Sheila.

“It’s time that we started living our life together, not apart, and really enjoying our time together.”

Anderson was first elected to represent Cypress Hills — Grassland in 2000, and was re-elected with wide margins in five subsequent elections. In 2015, he won more than 25,000 votes, good for 69 per cent of the total.

In an interview on Monday, the veteran MP — among current members, only Liberal Ralph Goodale has held a Saskatchewan seat for longer — said he is most proud of the role he played in dissolving the Canadian Wheat Board.

At the time of the still-controversial decision, Anderson was Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture and the Canadian Wheat Board, a supporting role for former agriculture minister and Saskatchewan MP Gerry Ritz.

It is not immediately clear who will seek the nomination in the riding, one of the safest Conservative Party of Canada seats in the country. A party spokesman said the date for a nomination meeting has not been set.

“David — thank you for your dedication and your service to SW Sask and to the country. It has been an honour to work with you over the years,” Anderson’s friend, former Premier Brad Wall, said in a tweet on Monday.

Anderson, meanwhile, said he looks forward to spending less time on the road, but leaving public life behind won’t be easy.

“I don’t think anybody leaves easily. There’s a lot of really good things about this job; it’s an incredible privilege to be able to serve. So yeah, I expect there will be some days where it’ll be difficult, but it is the right thing … for us.”

After a two-day stint in Winnipeg, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau descends on the Greater Toronto Area today, starting with a morning visit to a Scarborough seniors’ support centre, where he’s hoping to “highlight” the new National Dementia Strategy, which was unveiled in last week’s budget.

He’s also planning to join a group of students for a midday tour of the Maker Space at the Pickering Public Library, which, according to the website, includes a recording studio, design centre and “maker lab,” as well as a full selection of “loanable items” — GoPro and DLSR cameras, green screen kits and WiFi hotspots that can be borrowed for use outside the confines of the library itself.

He’s also booked in for an afternoon chat with local seniors about his government’s efforts to “offer Canadians the secure and dignified retirement they deserve.”

Meanwhile, Finance Minister Bill Morneau will take his ongoing cross-country budget-boosting campaign to Edmonton, where he will, once again, explain his plan to “invest in the middle class” during a lunch address to the local chamber of commerce, as well as hit the stage alongside Edmonton Centre MP Randy Boissonnault at a $500-per-head “Evening With…”-style event to support the local Liberal riding association.

Back in Montreal, Official Languages Minister Mélanie Joly teams up with Quebec international relations minister Nadine Girault to celebrate the nomination of Canadian journalist Catherine Cano to serve as administrator of the International Organization of la Francophonie, which, according to Joly, “is a recognition of Canadian leadership in La Francophonie when it comes to promoting the values of democracy, transparency and human rights.”

Author: Sean Rehaag, Associate Professor, Osgoode Hall Law School, York University, Canada

According to media reports, Bill Blair, Canada’s minister of border security, is attempting to close a loophole in the Canada-U.S. Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA).

The agreement allows Canada to send asylum-seekers back to the United States without hearing their refugee claims (and allows the U.S. the same option for those going in the other direction). The loophole is that the STCA only applies to asylum-seekers who present themselves at official land ports-of-entry.

Since President Donald Trump was elected, around 40,000 asylum seekers have used this loophole by crossing into Canada from the U.S. at places other than official ports-of-entry. They are not trying to sneak into Canada undetected. Rather, they cross the border irregularly to avoid being turned away under the STCA and then approach Canadian authorities to make refugee claims.

The number of irregular border-crossers has declined recently, with fewer than 1,000 in January 2019. What’s more, while the overall number of refugee claims made in Canada has been higher than usual in the past two years, it is not far off historical norms.

Nonetheless, the additional 40,000 refugee claims have produced pressures on the refugee determination system and on provincial social programs. There has also been political pushback, with calls from the Conservative party for the government to stem the flow.

However, closing the STCA loophole is a complicated proposition.

Blair reportedly wants irregular border-crossers to be taken to official ports-of-entry and processed as if they had presented themselves there directly. In other words, the STCA would apply both at official ports-of-entry and elsewhere.

To make this work, the U.S. would need to agree, which is the first complication.

More asylum-seekers come to Canada

The purpose of the STCA from a Canadian perspective was to force the U.S. to take responsibility for asylum-seekers who travel to Canada via the United States. Canada had long wanted the STCA because the flow of asylum-seekers is asymmetrical. Far more asylum-seekers come to Canada from the U.S. than the reverse.

For the same reason, the United States has long refused to agree to the STCA. That only changed after 9-11, when Canada offered the U.S. greater border security integration in exchange for the STCA.

Canada now wants to expand the STCA, so the question is: What will Canada have to give the U.S. to get them to agree?

One might expect quite a lot, given that Trump has shown little interest in taking steps that would result in thousands of asylum-seekers who would otherwise go to Canada remaining in the U.S.

The need for a quid pro quo raises a second complication. The STCA is being challenged in Canadian courts by human rights organizations who say that the U.S. is not safe for refugees and that the STCA violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Given the anti-refugee policies of the Trump administration, there is a good chance that courts will strike down the STCA. By negotiating expansions to the STCA without waiting to see whether the regime is upheld, there is a real risk that anything Canada gives to the U.S. in exchange will be for naught.

A third complication: Even if Canada gets the U.S. to agree to expand the STCA, and even if the regime is upheld by the courts, the impact of any expansion is likely to be both counterproductive and dangerous.

A dangerous incentive

If asylum-seekers who are intercepted at irregular border crossings are returned to the U.S., this will create a strong incentive for such asylum-seekers to cross the border without being intercepted.

Currently, irregular border crossings are manageable and organized. Most occur in a single, well-monitored location in Quebec. That crossing is not dangerous. Border officials and RCMP are present. Irregular border-crossers immediately enter into immigration and refugee processing, which includes health, criminality and security screening.

Other countries that have tried to stem flows of asylum-seekers by closing off safe and manageable routes have had a common experience. The flows do not stop but are instead diverted into more remote and hence more dangerous routes. Organized crime gets involved, bringing increased security risks and violence. The inevitable result is lost lives and decreased border security.

In the end, the political pressure on the government to be seen doing something on this file may outweigh these policy considerations. But politics lead to a fourth complication.

During the last federal election campaign, Justin Trudeau distinguished himself from former prime minister Stephen Harper partly through a more compassionate response to the Syrian refugee crisis and the death of Alan Kurdi — himself a tragic victim of cat-and-mouse games between smugglers and governments seeking to keep refugees at bay.

Shortly after Trump’s inauguration, Prime Minister Trudeau further sought the moral high ground when, in response to the president’s anti-refugee policies, he famously tweeted Canadians will welcome those fleeing persecution.

There is no way to close the STCA loophole without the Liberal party turning its back on those progressive values, on the eve of a federal election campaign.

In this context, attempting to expand the STCA may not only be bad policy, it may also be bad politics.

Now, along with Agua Rica, which would make use of Alumbrera’s infrastructure, Canada’s First Quantum Minerals Ltd. is mulling ...","Argentina is eyeing its first major new mining project in two decades, nudged forward by President Mauricio Macri’s market-oriented policies. But there’s no guarantee he’ll be around to take credit.

Argentina’s economy is tanking with the central bank hiking interest rates to ease inflation and save the peso, the worst-performing currency in emerging markets. That could put Macri on shaky ground as he heads toward a presidential election in October where he could face his predecessor, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, a populist who may peel back many of the policies Macri has undertaken.

No matter who wins in October, the ground’s now tilled for a series of mining investments

No matter who wins in October, the ground’s now tilled for a series of mining investments, said Mariano Lamothe, Argentina’s Undersecretary for Mining Development. Two weeks ago, Yamana Gold Inc., Goldcorp Inc. and Glencore Plc said they’re studying a plan to jointly develop the Agua Rica gold and copper project in the country’s northwest. A decision to invest could come within months, Lamothe said.

“We’ve built a solid base,” Lamothe said in an interview in Buenos Aires. “So when President Macri’s term ends, it won’t be subject to the sharp turns that populism has generated in the past.”

The three companies will complete a feasibility study next year. The plan is to combine Glencore’s Alumbrera mine, which began operations in 1997, with the Agua Rica project, with estimated reserves of about 4.5 million tons of copper and 6.5 million ounces of gold. The hoped-for result is an estimated life of 25 years with an annual production of 236,000 tons of copper-equivalent metal for the first 10 years.

Macri has created a safer investment climate for miners by improving ties with authorities in provinces, which own the minerals in their territory, Lamothe said, adding that there’s also been efforts to reduce costs and red tape for prospectors.

Moves to improve regulatory frameworks, push transparency and address environmental issues were “important work, and it makes Argentina’s mining sector more attractive,” said Fiona Mackie, Latin America director at the Economist Intelligence Unit. But potential shifts in currency policy or a return to capital controls have investors on edge, she said.

“The first thing investors ask you is what will happen with Argentina, and that’s an unsolved mystery,” said Gustavo Koch, executive director at Argentina’s mining chamber Caem. “We’re hoping for some kind of continuity of sensible policies.”

Argentina hasn’t seen a significant new mining project since 1997, when work started on Glencore’s Alumbrera gold and copper mine. A new large project in the South American nation would come at a moment when supply is tight and few new mines are being built. Morgan Stanley listed copper as its top pick among metals in a quarterly report and said it expects the market will post a deficit of 406,000 tons this year and of 187,000 tons next.

Multi-billion plans

Now, along with Agua Rica, which would make use of Alumbrera’s infrastructure, Canada’s First Quantum Minerals Ltd. is mulling Taca Taca, a $3 billion gold and copper project in Salta province. Company executives will decide whether they develop Taca Taca or another project in Peru after construction finishes on a mine in Panama.

“Taca Taca would be the easiest one, and it’s more advanced,” First Quantum President Clive Newall said in an interview last month. But that affirmation came with a caveat: “Argentina politically is still not entirely straightforward. Elections are coming up. So clearly there’s this political decision: Do we want to invest there?”

Macri’s best chance of re-election will come if its only Macri and Fernandez de Kirchner running, pollsters say. But the outlook becomes more complex if a third candidate emerges, luring voters who are disillusioned with Macri but unwilling to turn back the clock. In that case, Roberto Lavagna, a former economy minister, may be another option.

No matter who governs at the federal level, one ally for miners in Argentina could be provincial officials looking for revenue from royalties and employment opportunities

No matter who governs at the federal level, one ally for miners in Argentina could be provincial officials looking for revenue from royalties and employment opportunities, the mining chamber’s Koch said. He pointed to San Juan, home to Barrick Gold Corp.’s Veladero gold mine.

At the same time, local governments can add an additional layer of complexity that worries investors. The clearest case in point is Chubut, where provincial mayors have been in talks to lift a prohibition on open-pit mining that’d pave the way for a $1.2 billion silver project.

“The past four years have been about building a base,” according to Victor Rodriguez, a senior consultant for CRU Group in Santiago, Chile. “We should start to see the results of that over the next four years.”

China’s plans will depend heavily on what happens in the fall federal election. “If we have a change in government, everything could change ...","Atlantic Canadian seafood exports could be the next target in growing trade tensions between Canada and China, something experts say would deal a huge blow to the industry.

China, a major market for Canadian canola, is no longer importing the product, citing contamination concerns, something producers say is unwarranted.

But some have suggested that the block has more to do with Canada’s decision to arrest Meng Wanzhouin in December, vice-president of Chinese tech giant Huawei and daughter of the company’s CEO.

“Right now the focus is very much canola because it’s so symbolic. . . . It is the one commodity that is so linked to the Canadian brand across the world, but I wouldn’t exclude embargoes or measures affecting other commodities like beef pork, wheat and of course lobster or seafood,” Sylvain Charlebois, a professor in food distribution and policy at Dalhousie University, told The Chronicle Herald.

Though technically countries cannot issue embargoes for political reasons, Charlebois said it’s a tactic many countries, including China, employ.

“China can’t go out and say because you arrested Ms. Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver we no longer want your product. It’s illegal. ... You’ll be warned by the World Trade Organization or you could even be fined and reprimanded,” he explained. “You have to [cite] other reasons and food safety is often the safe way to do it.”

Charlebois said he expects China’s plans will depend heavily on what happens in the fall federal election.

“If we have a change in government, everything could change, but if we actually stick to what we have now I think a lot of people in Ottawa will need to go back to school and take some diplomacy 101 classes as soon as possible,” he said.

According to government figures, of the $1.5 billion in Atlantic Canadian goods exported to China in 2017, over 43 per cent were seafood, fishing and aquaculture products, with lobster topping the list in terms of value.

“... I think a lot of people in Ottawa will need to go back to school and take some diplomacy 101 classes as soon as possible."" - Sylvain Charlebois

And governments have been putting significant effort into keeping that relationship strong — a joint trade mission to China in the fall that included Atlantic premiers and federal ministers saw a major focus on seafood exports.

Speaking with The Chronicle Herald, Fisheries Minister Keith Colwell said ,while Nova Scotia’s seafood industry hasn’t seen any reduction in sales in China, his department reached out to some key Chinese purchasers as recently as last week to put forward some of these concerns surrounding tensions between China and Canada. Colwell said the conversations were encouraging.

“[According] to discussions we’ve had with them it’s business as usual. ... We’re here to do business, that’s the message we’ve delivered and they’ve told us the same thing,” Colwell said.

“We don’t want to be part of the continuing issues that are happening between the U.S. and China and Canada and China. We look at China as a preferred customer for our products and we really enjoy working with them, it’s been a very good experience for us and we hope it stays that way.”

In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for International Trade Minister Jim Carr said the Canadian government is “committed to expanding opportunities for Canadian businesses of all sizes to compete and succeed in fast-growing markets around the world, and that includes China.”

A perfect storm?

The Canadian seafood industry benefited significantly from the trade war between the U.S. and China, as tariff-free Canadian lobster and other seafood products are now significantly more affordable. In Nova Scotia alone, seafood exports to China increased by 36 per cent in 2018 to $524 million and remains the second-largest market for seafood exports after the U.S., the provincial government said in a news release this month.

But, Stewart Lamont, managing director of Nova Scotia-based Tangier Lobster Company, warned that all could change.

Lamont said, because of China’s retaliatory tariffs on American seafood, which have created an unprecedented 25 per cent comparative advantage over American lobster since they were imposed in July, Atlantic Canada has become extraordinarily dependent on the mainland China market.

“We have priced Chinese demand into our shore pricing for live lobster since October. We are paying fishers two to three dollars more per pound on average above more recent pricing. This is terrific as long as we can pass the greater cost to the marketplace,” Lamont said. “Unfortunately from December to this minute all markets have struggled to pay the new pricing. Canada, America, Europe and Asia all take the position in the marketplace that our pricing is now too high for their clients.”

“We have priced Chinese demand into our shore pricing for live lobster since October."" - Stewart Lamont

Sooner or later, Lamont said, China and the U.S. will end the trade and tariff war that is costing both counties trillions, and live lobster exports from America to China would resume overnight. And because American live lobster is dramatically less expensive than Canadian, U.S. suppliers would go from having a 25 per cent disadvantage to a three dollar per pound advantage almost immediately.

Lamont said he wouldn’t be surprised to see an embargo placed on seafood similar to the one China has placed on canola, as both industries have a similar value. He said if China and the U.S. resolve their trade issues at the same time, the result could spell disaster for Atlantic Canada’s seafood industry.

“If we had a ban, 40 per cent of our international market, in theory, would disappear immediately, the worst nightmare is if the two things happen simultaneously,” Lamont said. “We would not be serving ourselves well in Atlantic Canada if we didn’t factor these [geopolitical concerns] into our model going forward. We should try and mitigate our risk, and we should try to pursue additional markers so we’re not so reliant on any given market.”

Moe has no such problem. This week, the right ...","A budget 19 months in advance of the next provincial election campaign should be starting to give us a clue as to what that campaign will be about.

But it’s what we heard in Monday’s question period, rife with snarling over past arrests and political ties to radicalism, that really gave us a clue as to what the October 2020 provincial election campaign may be like.

Scott Moe and Ryan Meili may not personally dislike each other. But it’s pretty clear the Saskatchewan Party and NDP don’t share much love.

And when the premier and Opposition get into issues like the yellow vest rallies, it’s only likely to fuel that political animosity until the writ is dropped.

Interestingly, the one whose image is likely to suffer the most from this is Moe, which makes one wonder why he wouldn’t see the wisdom of abiding by Meili’s reasonable request that the Saskatchewan government cut all ties to potentially image-harming elements like the yellow vest movement.

Why Moe wouldn’t do this anyway is confounding.

After all, the Sask. Party is an alliance of old PCs and Liberals, and keeping that alliance intact requires occasionally leaning at bit left, as they may have done in Wednesday’s budget.

While it’s a shoddy excuse for failing to always immediately denounce right-wing racism or other extremism, it can be argued that federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer may have to worry about bleeding far-right support to Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada. Moe has no such problem.

This week, the right thing for Moe would have been to at least start messaging that extreme views like the ones we are seeing on the yellow vest Facebook page are both unwanted and actually detrimental to the Sask. Party government’s central message that should be focused on the need for pipelines.

Instead, Moe opted to bicker with reporters whether Facebook messages on the yellow vest page — messages he said he hasn’t seen — were all that reflective.

In politics, when you are apologizing for extremist views that aren’t even really your own, you are losing.

Moe then made matters worse by tapping his designated political enforcer — in this case, Energy Minister Bronwyn Eyre — on the shoulder and sending her over the boards to do battle with Meili over his two-decade-old arrest at the 2001 Summit of the Americas in Quebec City.

One gets why there may be a burning desire in the Sask. Party ranks to paint Meili in the far left corner of Saskatchewan politics — a task eased by Meili’s own desire to hang around that corner, anyway.

So was it really all that necessary or advisable for Eyre to prattle on about Meili hanging around radically dangerous elements — the Sierra Club — at a legitimate public protest where people weren’t threatening harm? Should it have been all that tough for Jeremy Harrison — responsible for immigrant investment — to say this week the yellow vesters’ obsession with with the UN migration compact is a little deranged?

And how smart was it for Eyre to bring up Meili’s “criminal record” when Moe and few other backbench MLAs have a more lasting criminal record involving driving under the influence?

Sure, Eyre and company have had success at getting under Meili’s rather thin skin, evident in his complaints about the Sask. Party’s political ads. And, yes, it was maybe a little greasy of Meili to draw the longbow between Highways Minister Lori Carr and Rural and Remote Health Minister Greg Ottenbreit attending yellow vest rallies and those who would “celebrate” last week’s Christchurch attacks where a white suprematist gunned down 50 innocent people in New Zealand.

But in end, it was Eyre, Moe and the Sask. Party who came out looking the worst. If the Sask. Party is playing the long game, how did this help their own brand?

There again, maybe this is just what Saskatchewan politics is destined to be like for the next 19 months. Buckle up, folks.

Bottom line: Either ...,"Stephen Skyvington is on a mission to have an adult conversation about the dire state of health care in Canada and the need for revolutionary change.

Hired as manager of government relations by the Ontario Medical Association in 1995, Skyvington opened his own PR company PoliTrain Inc. in 2001 — he’s a lobbyist, consultant, pundit, veteran of the health care wars.

“Unfortunately, my detractors would have you believe I have a hidden agenda, that my goal is to foist on Canada a U.S.-style, two-tier health care system,” he quipped.

“The irony, however, is that if we continue to keep our heads buried in the sand like we have for the past 50 years, trying to prop up a system that simply isn’t sustainable, then we’ll indeed end up with exactly what our neighbours to the south have: a health care system that’s a bloody mess.”

In his new book, This May Hurt A Bit: Reinventing Canada’s Health Care System, Skyvington concludes it is time to properly fund Medicare or “free it,” citing the long-running Cambie constitutional trial as a potential watershed moment that might prompt the long-needed transformation.

Or not.

With the face of the challenge, Dr. Brian Day, founder of the private Cambie Surgery Centre and a former president of the Canadian Medical Association, supplying a cheerleading foreword, Skyvington offers a 200-odd-page indictment of the current health care system.

He has nothing but scorn for the present crop of politicians — too mealy-mouthed to tell the truth and too spineless to act.

“Remember those kids who used to sit at the back of the classroom?” Skyvington asked. “The troublemakers? The slow learners? The social misfits? Well, guess what? They’re the ones in charge now.”

In his view, the most vulnerable are put at risk and governments dodge responsibility.

“The solutions are seen in best practices of the many countries that deliver universal care far more effectively and efficiently than we do in Canada. Governments have, with the support of special interest groups, abrogated their duty to care for patients,” Skyvington said.

He pointed to Walid Khalfallah, from Kelowna, a paraplegic thanks to his encounter with the health care system.

“All because those running the show felt it was a reasonable risk for a young boy of thirteen to wait 27 months — that’s right, I said 27 months — for surgery on his spine. By the time Walid had the surgery in 2012, at Shriners Hospital in Spokane, Wash., it was too late.”

Young people better pay particular attention, he warned.

“Baby boomers like me will get $4,000 more health care services than we pay for in our lifetime through taxes, Millennials will pay $18,000 more in taxes than in services received for health care, and the iGens will pay $27,000 more in taxes than in services received because we are always paying for our parents, the generation ahead of us,” Skyvington said.

“The problem is there are too many of us (baby boomers), not enough of the iGens and Millennials, plus they have all this school debt, they’re working two jobs, they’re living in their parents’ basement instead of having a house and building equity.”

How many ministries of health do we currently have in Canada?

“Believe it or not,” he fumed, “the answer is 14! Ten provincial, three territorial, and one federal. Each province and territory has a health minister and a health ministry chock full of civil servants, most of whom never see a patient. That’s a hell of a lot of dollars being spent on things other than frontline patient care.

“How much sense does it make to have all these different ministries negotiating separate deals with Big Pharma? Is it any wonder the cost of prescription medicines is eating up so much of our health care budgets?”

With all the surety of a scientist lamenting climate change, Skyvington is convinced Medicare’s doomsday is around the corner.

“We’re going to have a U.S.-style, two-tier system by 2030 because that’s what happens if we don’t make the changes I’m talking about now.”

He identified three treatment “tsunamis” — diabetes, obesity and dementia — that will swamp the system.

Introduced in 1968, Medicare is showing its age and there is not enough money to keep it from collapsing under its own weight, Skyvington explained.

Canada’s population has more than doubled — from 18.2 million in 1961 to 36.6 million in 2017 — while per-capita spending on health care increased more than 60 fold: From less than $100 per person in the early 1960s to a whopping $6,604 in 2017.

Even with all that money, there are historically long queues for care: Nearly a million patients waiting for treatment in 2016 lost $1.7 billion in wages alone.

Skyvington has a program of 10 solutions, but his book’s strength is not so much his prescription but his etiology and diagnosis.

And he hopes his analysis will spur a realistic discussion: “We have a bad insurance scheme masquerading as a working health care system, a system that is broken and unsustainable because it wasn’t built right in the first place.

“The reality is it puts the vulnerable and disadvantaged in our society in a much worse place than if we actually had a hybrid system. The government should either properly fund health care or — if they can’t or won’t — free it.”

In 2017, he said the Fraser Institute released a report estimating that some 63,000 Canadians traveled abroad for medical care, a 40-per-cent hike from 2016.

“The rich don’t need a second tier,” Skyvington noted. “They already have one. It’s called America.”

Australia, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, and Switzerland all provide universal health care, he said. Unlike Canada, none prohibits user fees or ties the funding of health care to “some kind of sick, perverse ideal of patriotism.”

Instead, each expects patients to share in the costs of health care and imposes either deductibles, co-payments or both on everyone except the poor and most vulnerable.

“If Canada’s health care system is so good, so worth fighting for and preserving, then why hasn’t anyone else copied what we’re doing?” he asked.

“The answer, my friend, is simple: Our system sucks. While we’ve been standing around for the past 50-plus years, admiring our collective navels, everyone else has been embracing not the status quo but change. Real change. Real innovation. Real solutions for an ever-evolving world.”

He hopes to make the crisis a key campaign issue this fall. “We haven’t talked about health care during an election for years. It’s high time we did. This is catastrophic. Bottom line: Either we accept this new reality and change or we’re doomed.”

By Emily Macdonald, Staff Writer



Federal election time is coming up quickly here in Canada and every vote matters. A recent poll following the SNC-Lavalin affair has placed the Conservatives in the lead, 7 points ahead of the Liberals. So how does leader Andrew Scheer, leader of the federal Conservatives since 2017, stack up as a potential Prime Minister?



A quick background on Scheer: he spent four years on Parliament hill during Stephen Harper’s majority government as Speaker of the House of Commons. Scheer is currently a member of Parliament as he holds the riding in Regina and is the leader of the opposition. He attended the University of Ottawa before switching to the University of Regina to finish his degree in history and political science where he met his wife. Scheer and his wife together have five children and he is often referred to as a “family man.” He was originally in the insurance business before entering politics 2004.



Not straying from the norm for any conservative government, Scheer hopes to balance the books within two years if voted in. However, he has not specified how this will be done, leaving Canadians to wonder where the cuts would be coming from. The deficit is estimated to be at 15.8 billion dollars by 2021-2022.



Other plans include a cut to HST/GST on home heating bills and the introduction of a tax benefit for those who send their kids to private school or chose home-schooling to help families who wish to educate their children outside of the public system.



A controversial item on Scheer’s to-do list is to recommit the Canadian Forces to the fight against “radical Islam,” something that the Trudeau government has pulled away from. An anonymous first-year student who is in the military commented on the issue, telling The Argus: “I don’t mind if we provide [a] small logistical support role or even assist with air support by sending CF18s, but boots on the ground would be a terrible idea.” He went on to say, “basically we are too busy and it would be a waste of our resources.”

Scheer has also insisted on the Free Speech mandate, something floating around since early 2018. In Ontario, universities and colleges have already been told to create and implement policies, but he would like to make it nationwide within the post-secondary education system. He has taken a similar approach to Ford, saying that funding will be cut for universities who do not have a full range of free speech. Scheer would also like to cut the unified carbon tax that the Trudeau government, this policy will be implemented in April.

Scheer has been known to be against abortion and same-sex marriage. He voted in favour of a private member’s bill in 2016 that would make it a criminal offence to cause injury or death to a fetus when committing a crime against a pregnant woman and voted against the same-sex marriage bill in 2005. He has stated however, that he will not reopen either issue for debate.



Scheer does not seem to divert from the conservative norm — he wants to make family life easier and balance the books.



No matter how you choose to vote, be sure to do your research. Remember, every vote counts and it is a privilege to choose our government.

TORONTO – A newly arrived refugee who once helped shelter whistleblower Edward Snowden in Hong Kong is calling on Canada to welcome others who helped the American fugitive.

Vanessa Rodel says five other people, including her daughter’s father and her two step-siblings, remain in Hong Kong after their refugee claims were rejected.

She says all her fellow members of a group known as Snowden’s “Guardian Angels” are like family and says she hopes they can join her in Canada, where she secured refugee status two months ago.

Rodel’s comments came at a news conference held after she and her daughter Keana landed in Toronto on Monday night.

They will head to Montreal later today to move into their new home.

Snowden is also calling on Canada to grant refugee status to others like Rodel, who helped him when he fled to Hong Kong after exposing the scope of surveillance operations at the U.S. National Security Agency.

In less than two months, B.C. will have a new MP to fill the seat vacated by new NDP MLA Sheila Malcolmson.

Today, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that a by-election in Nanaimo-Ladysmith will be held on May 6.

Whoever is elected will only sit as an MP for just over five months before a general election will be held on October 21.

The NDP has not yet nominated a candidate.

There are two high-profile declared contestants:

* Lauren Semple, the event director for the last three Nanaimo Pride festivals, a former Nanaimo Pride president, and former riding assistant to Malcolmson;

* and Bob Chamberlin, vice president of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs and elected chief of the Kwikwasut'inuxw Haswa'mis First Nation.

Chief Bob Chamberlin is also trying to win the NDP nomination in Nanaimo-Ladysmith. Amanda Siebert

Four other parties already have nominated candidates:

* Financial-services worker Jennifer Clarke for the People's Party of Canada;

* Management consultant Michelle Cornfield for the Liberals;

* Sun Life Financial manager John Hirst for the Conservatives;

* Filmmaker Paul Manly of the Green Party of Canada.

Last year, Hirst soundly defeated Clarke to become the Conservative candidate.

Paul Manly ran for the Greens in 2015 after being rejected by the NDP.

The Green candidate, Manly, ran in 2015 and is the son of former NDP MP Jim Manly, who represented Cowichan-Malahat–The Islands from 1980 to 1988.

In 2014, Paul Manly said the NDP federal executive denied him the chance to seek a party nomination because of concerns over his position on Israeli-Palestinian issues.

Manly's father was arrested in Gaza in 2012 after being part of group of protesters aboard the MV Estelle that tried to break through an Israeli blockade.

“We had hoped that the New Democrats and other parties also would speak out. Not particularly for me but for the people of Gaza and of Palestine,” Jim Manly told the Straight in 2015. “And they didn’t and this has never been Paul’s central issue. It’s been a very important issue for Eva—my wife—and myself. But it’s never been Paul’s central issue.”

By Keith Currie, President, Ontario Federation of Agriculture

There’s something in this year’s federal budget for everyone, at least that’s the government’s intent ahead of a federal election this year. The good news for Canadian agriculture is the emphasis on food, developing a food policy and new school food programs. Dedicated funding support for farmers in supply managed sectors in response to recent trade agreements and the promise of rural broadband also highlight the 2019 budget announcement for farmers.

Listen here:

The Ontario Federation of Agriculture (OFA), along with the Canadian Federation of Agriculture (CFA) submitted budget recommendations outlining what we believe the agri-food sector needs to be competitive and sustainable. A number of these requests were included in the March 19 budget announcement.

Food security is a must for Canadians and the budget allocation to create a National Food Policy is a welcome promise. OFA is especially encouraged by the 3-year agricultural immigration pilot that will help address year-round agricultural labour shortages, the development of a national school food program and a $25 million commitment to a buy Canadian promotional campaign that are all included in the proposed strategy. A National Food Strategy is a landmark announcement for Canadian agriculture and together, OFA and CFA will be working directly with the federal government to understand how this program will be implemented in support of the whole agri-food sector.

OFA maintains rural access to reliable, high-speed broadband is a must. The federal budget announcement unveiled a plan to implement targets of 95% of Canadians to have high speed internet by 2025 and 100% by 2030. As likely the last 5% to get the service, many farmers and rural communities are looking at another 11 years before being able to actively participate in the digital age. This is not acceptable and defies the real economic potential of rural Ontario.

The $3.9 billion allocated to assist supply managed sectors responds to the market access concessions made through recent trade agreements signals the federal government understands the significant impact our farmers make to the Canadian economy. This monetary support is meant to sustain the incomes of eligible dairy, poultry and egg farmers. While this revenue recovery announcement is good news, relief for those farmers affected by the US-China trade war is missing from the federal budget. It’s hard not to look south of the border where US grain farmers are receiving billions in compensation from their government and not ask Canada’s leaders why they aren’t supporting Canadian farmers.

The housing initiatives aimed at housing affordability and incentives for first-time home buyers will appeal to many Canadians. However, OFA is concerned the real impact of these incentives will see a rise in housing prices in areas where very limited housing supply is already an issue. The housing crisis in Ontario’s Golden Horseshoe will only get worse. OFA maintains the best solution to help Ontarians realize home ownership and alleviate the housing crisis is to enable opportunities across Ontario. Investment in rural areas including realistic broadband targets will create jobs, attract new residents and see our communities outside of the Greater Toronto Hamilton Area flourish.

OFA believes some of the 2019 budget investments in Canadian agriculture will see economic returns for all Canadians. Many budget details have yet to be determined but together, OFA and CFA will work closely with government to ensure effective policies and programs are implemented that will benefit our agri-food sector, one of Canada’s largest economic industries.",OFA: Federal election budget fuels investments in agri-food,Blackburn News,https://blackburnnews.com/agrimedia/commentaries/2019/03/25/ofa-federal-election-budget-fuels-investments-agri-food/

In case you were thinking “hey, aren’t there 10 provinces in Canada?” You would be right — however, the Angus Reid Institute decided that, because of its small population, data from PEI could not be released on account of its inability to draw discreet samples over multiple waves.

BC’s John Horgan dropped down to third place (even though he sustained his 52% rating from last year) as newly elected Quebec Premier François Legault and Saskatchewan’s Scott Moe took the top two spots with 60% and 59% respectively.

The Angus Reid Institute is pulling these numbers from an online survey they conducted between March 11 and 24, using a representative, randomized sample of 5,807 Canadians.

Bringing up the rear is Nova Scotia’s Stephen McNeil, who has seen a significant dip since his high at 66% back in June 2014.

Given that the general trend shows a decrease in approval within the first year of premiership, Notley hasn’t done too bad a job of holding onto what approval remained after her dip back in 2015 — though she’ll need every bit of favour she can get heading into the provincial election this April.

More crucially ...","× Expand National Archives Teamsters battle police during a labor strike, Minneapolis, June 1934. Beginning in the 1960s the power of unions in the United States declined, but grew in Canada.

Many progressives in the United States are prone to making gloomy jokes about moving North whenever conservative forces grip our national institutions. After all: Canadians have unions! They have health care! They don’t pretend that everyone’s middle class!

Why, people wonder, are the politics and labor movements of the two countries so different?

In his new book, Labor and the Class Idea in the United States and Canada, sociology professor Barry Eidlin grapples with this question. His explanation not only illuminates the history but suggests some ideas about a course correction for the U.S. labor movement.

Following World War II, Eidlin tells us, Canadian unions won battles with company owners and consolidated legal power, just as American unions had done previously. But beginning in the 1960s, their fortunes diverged. In the United States, the percentage of workers in unions steadily declined, and unions’ political influence within the Democratic Party was marginalized. After a Democratic President and Congressional supermajority failed to enact labor law reform in 1978, United Auto Workers President Doug Fraser bemoaned the by-then-obvious “one-sided class war.”

Canada, by contrast, strengthened its labor laws. The Canadian labor party—the New Democratic Party—is frequently in power in certain provinces, acting like a left pressure bloc on Canada’s not-quite two party system.

Eidlin locates the source of this reversal of fortune, in part, in how much harder the Canadian unions had to fight to establish themselves. In contrast, an American labor law regime was handed to union organizers by the New Deal. The fight in Canada took a decade longer for the government to recognize a protected right to engage in union activity, and it solidified a class consciousness among Canadian workers that in the United States is a bit more, well, flippy-floppy.

And this raises the perennial question: How can we get the American working class to recognize its own existence and fight like hell for what it deserves?

The United States and Canada are remarkably similar countries in terms of labor politics. We were colonized by the same European nations—England and France—which shaped our political cultures. And U.S. unions colonized Canadian workplaces by chartering locals north of the border. (The “I” in most unions’ acronyms stands not for “Industrial” but for “International,” which basically means, “Oh, and we have some members in Canada.”) For that reason, Canada’s labor law regime was modeled on the U.S. emphasis on government-certified bargaining units with firm-level contract bargaining, exclusive representation, and the union shop.

The union fight in Canada took a decade longer and solidified a class consciousness among Canadian workers that in the United States is a bit more, well, flippy-floppy.

The passage of key pro-union legislation, including the 1935 National Labor Relations Act, preceded and in some ways made possible U.S. labor’s great upsurge in organizing and strike activity, Eidlin argues. Union rights were in effect “granted” by the Roosevelt Administration, which was rewarded, in turn, with the entrance of unions into the Democratic Party coalition as a special interest.

The Canadian government responded to increasing worker militancy during the Great Depression with equal parts repression and indifference. By way of example, Vancouver dockworkers went on strike in 1935 for union recognition. The struggle faced armed resistance from employers and the police, briefly spreading to a general strike punctuated by a bloody street fight—the Battle of Ballantyne Pier. In the United States, the West Coast longshoremen who had gone on strike the year prior, won union recognition through federal pressure and a nascent system of New Deal tripartite arbitration. The Vancouver dockworkers’ fight dragged on another decade until the Canadian government created more labor-friendly laws.

As a result, Canadian workers were far more likely to see themselves as a working class with distinctly different interests than the bosses, government, and two major parties. They made common cause with farmers in a third party—the forerunner of today’s New Democratic Party—that continued to gain votes and threaten the power of the established party. Crucially, they continued to strike during World War II for their rights and in protest of rising inflation.

That electoral threat, combined with the impact of the strikes on wartime production, finally compelled Canada’s government to enact a labor law that protected workers’ rights in 1944.

American unions’ post-war rise in militancy, by contrast, was greeted with legislative repression. The Taft-Hartley Act—which outlawed many forms of strikes and legalized anti-union “right to work” legislation—codified the legal status of unions as a mere special interest, one to be “balanced” against management.

Eidlin explores the key tests of strength faced by unions in the postwar years, and how that shaped the divergence in fortunes. Both countries faced a Red Scare, but unions in the U.S. contended with a 1960s New Left not centered on questions of class.

Canada’s labor movement, in contrast, made room for New Left politics within its New Democratic Party. They were able to tap into the hard-fought recognition of class interests to convince the government to strengthen labor laws as a way to mediate industrial disputes.

Eidlin, I think, underestimates the explanation given by many previous scholars for the lack of an American labor party: that property-based restrictions on voting were abolished before American workers had a chance to fully conceive of themselves as a separate class. The American labor movement entered the Great Depression already an atomized collection of special interests to be courted by the two major parties.

Regardless, a more urgent question for American activists is how to to wake the working-class giant. I suggest two trends—legal reform and political realignment—that contain promise.

One idea for creating a new labor relations system is an old idea that’s gaining traction: wage boards. These are public, tripartite industrial standards boards that can raise wages and working standards across entire industries. They were a cornerstone of the early New Deal framework, and still exist in some states, waiting for a demand to be revived.

The National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933, FDR’s first legislative effort to woo unions into the Democratic fold, is perhaps best remembered for its Section 7 guarantee of workers’ rights to organize unions. Though lacking an enforcement mechanism, the guarantee did inspire workers to sign up for unions in droves and helped get labor’s great uprising going.

The act also created tripartite industrial boards, like the National Longshore Board that arbitrated end of the 1934 strike. These consisted of a representative each from companies, unions, and “the public” for each major industry—with the power to establish minimum wages, work rules and union recognition. Strong unions like the Amalgamated Clothing Workers and United Mine Workers were able to press the boards to raise wages and spread union standards across non-union firms in their industries. In non-union industries where workers didn’t rise up in paralyzing strikes, the boards gave little thought to working conditions.

The National Labor Relations Act was meant to be an enforcement mechanism for the National Industrial Recovery Act’s “right to organize.” The 1935 act outlawed pervasive union-busting techniques like retaliation and surveillance of union activity of employees. It threatened the power of the state to restrain “unfair labor practices,” and it demanded that employers bargain in good faith when workers declared themselves to be a union.

But the National Industrial Recovery Act was declared unconstitutional by an arch-conservative Supreme Court that detested the idea of any kind of federal intervention in the private market. Roosevelt signed the 1935 National Labor Relations Act into law a few weeks after the court struck down the earlier law. His expectation had been that the two laws would exist side by side. The NLRA-created National Labor Relations Board would protect workers’ rights to organize and strike, while the NIRA-created industrial wage boards (and their state-level counterparts) would arbitrate union demands and impose the terms on employers.

University of Michigan law professor Kate Andrias proposes that wage boards, still on the books in states like California and New Jersey, could be used to pioneer a new form of social bargaining in the here and now. This is not pie in the sky. New York’s wage board system was dusted off by Governor Andrew Cuomo in response to the Fight for $15 movement.

Wage boards, still on the books in states like California and New Jersey, could be used to pioneer a new form of social bargaining in the here and now.

American unionists might hear “tripartite” as “two votes to one against the workers.” But what do you call a group of decision-makers who could vote to give you and your peers a wage increase or fairer scheduling practices or the right to several weeks of paid family leave but resists doing so? I call that a boss - a big one that we can run campaigns against.

Let’s imagine a hospitality industry labor board. The board could enact a whole range of changes, from raising the minimum wage to abolishing the practice of tipping. It could ban “clopens,” the practice of assigning an employee to work the first shift of the day after she just finished the last shift of the night before. It could take on issues of harassment in the workplace, like granting cocktail waitresses the right to refuse to wear “uniforms” that are too sexually exploitative.

The workers’ representative on the board could force a vote on any issue. Once that vote is scheduled, every union and workers center with an organizing stake in the industry would agitate for a yes vote. Join us. Sign this petition. Wear this button. Pay your dues. The unions could anticipate which major employers would have the most influence on the other two board members, and target them for disruption with actions like slowdowns, consumer boycotts, and rolling strikes.

Unlike in our current system, where workers are siloed in their bargaining relationships with individual employers, unions could take on entire industries as a class.

Our political system is in the midst of a rare political realignment, suggesting that a class-based party of the people is possible, even in America. As the Republican Party degenerates into authoritarianism and white nationalism, it becomes unelectable in many large city and big urban states. The Democratic Party, meanwhile, remains a big blob of incoherence, grappling with an energized left flank while trying to absorb “former” Republicans who would drag it to the right.

The solution may be regional. We are seeing the ideological fight, appropriately, in primaries, as witnessed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s upset win over Congressman Joseph Crowley, and Cynthia Nixon’s challenge to Andrew Cuomo’s reelection.

But states like New York have essentially a one-party system—there is no threat of a Republican eking out a win in a three-way race. This makes a formation like the Working Families Party a viable second party.

In states like New York, where there is no threat of a Republican eking out a win in a three-way race, the Working Families Party could be a viable second party.

With affiliates in more than a dozen states, the Working Families Party tends to act as a left pressure group in Democratic primaries, but doesn’t shy away from challenging corporate Democrats in general elections. It represents our best chance at an independent labor party in the United States and, like Canada’s New Democratic Party, could work on a regional basis.

More crucially, if the GOP continues its death rattle of naked racism and authoritarian hero-worship, while billionaire vampires like Howard Schutz and Michael Bloomberg abandon its corpse to suck what life remains from the Democratic Party, the rest of us are going to need a party to continue to fight for the survival and uplift of the 99 percent.

That is not to say permanent union opposition to both boss and state is a long-term winning strategy. Eidlin’s book—along with two centuries of union organizing in practice—make clear that workers need state power to restrict the worst impulses of corporations. But a degree of explicitly declared political autonomy within the current Democratic coalition, combined with a labor relations framework that treats workers as a distinct and protected class interest, could revive the class idea in the United States.",Who Wants to Move to Canada?,The Progressive,https://progressive.org/dispatches/who-wants-to-move-to-canada-Richman-190329/

TransAlta will “review Mangrove’s notice and consider the suitability of its nominees and ...","(Bloomberg) -- Brookfield Asset Management Inc. will invest C$750 million ($559 million) in power producer TransAlta Corp. and nominate two directors to its board.

Brookfield could also increase its stake in the Calgary-based utility to about 9 percent under certain conditions, according to a statement Monday. The deal allows Brookfield to convert its investment into an equity interest in TransAlta’s Alberta hydro assets at a later date.

The investment is being made through Brookfield’s publicly traded renewable-energy arm, Brookfield Renewable Partners. Shares of TransAlta rose 3.9 percent in Toronto trading Monday, closing at the highest level since July 2015 and giving the company a market value of about C$2.7 billion.

The two parties have held conversations over the years about various transactions but ultimately decided to proceed with the deal because it allows TransAlta to crystalize the future value of hydro assets and speed up its transition to clean energy, said Dawn Farrell, TransAlta chief executive officer, in an interview.

“Brookfield is a big and sophisticated company that has huge ownership in renewables and hydro,” Farrell said. “No amount of pressure would make this kind of transaction come together. It requires people who understand the industry, understand infrastructure, and understand each other.”

Clean Energy

Brookfield holds a 4.9 percent stake in the company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The deal will see the Canadian asset manager’s vice-chairmen, Harry Goldgut and Richard Legault, nominated to TransAlta’s slate of director nominees at its annual general meeting. Robert Flexon, the former CEO of Dynegy Inc., will also be added to the slate.

The move comes as Calgary-based TransAlta faces pressure from investors Mangrove Partners and C. John Wilder’s Bluescape Energy Partners, which disclosed a 10 percent stake in the company this month and said they planned to push for changes including a potential board revamp. The deal with Brookfield had nothing to do with the activists knocking at its door and is in keeping with its strategy to transition to clean energy, Farrell said.

In a statement on Monday evening, TransAlta said Mangrove plans to nominate five candidates for election to its board at the upcoming shareholder meeting. TransAlta will “review Mangrove’s notice and consider the suitability of its nominees and communicate more fully with its shareholder in due course,” the power producer said in the statement.

Share Buyback

TransAlta began selling shares in its renewable-energy unit in 2013, forming TransAlta Renewables Inc. as a separate company. It’s still the biggest investor in that company, with a stake of about 51 percent -- held jointly with a generation partnership -- that’s valued at about C$1.8 billion based on current share prices.

TransAlta will use about $350 million of the proceeds from the investment to advance its strategy to move from coal to gas generation by 2025, and as much as $250 million on a share buyback, it said.

“We look forward to contributing our capabilities, particularly our long-term expertise in the hydro sector, to enable the company’s growth over the long-term,” said Sachin Shah, Brookfield Renewable Partners’s chief executive officer.

Shares in TransAlta fell about 25 percent last year, but have made a rapid recovery since the start of 2019 as the company generates cash after reporting two straight years of net losses. The stock is up 69 percent this year.

After the court case is ... top two candidates in last October’s mayoral election. In its own presentation to city council ...","A case that has implications for the cost and distribution of electricity in eight Northwest Territories communities, including the capital Yellowknife, is now in the hands of a judge.

The N.W.T. Supreme Court case is part of an ongoing battle by the town of Hay River to transfer Northland Utilities’ power distribution franchise for the town to the Northwest Territories Power Corporation.

The town made the decision to switch three years ago but, so far, breaking up with Northland has been complicated and costly.

And promises of rate reductions — the whole point of the switch — have softened since the town decided to go with NTPC.

In a joint press release issued that day, March 3, 2016, the corporation and town council stated unequivocally the switch would result in an overall reduction of 20 per cent on electricity bills.

A few months later, Louis Sebert, the minister responsible for the corporation, told CBC the price of power with NTPC as distributor was “somewhat of a moving target, but we’re optimistic that once this process is concluded, rate payers in Hay River will see significantly lower power rates.”

In an email last week, an NTPC official said the corporation “continues to believe it can provide lower overall rates in the town of Hay River than the current distributor.”

The power corporation refused CBC’s requests for an interview for this story, saying the town was in the best position to comment on the corporation’s involvement and its ability to deliver on the 20 per cent reduction.

The town did not respond to CBC’s requests for an interview.

Deal-breaker

The central issue Justice Andrew Mahar must decide in the case is how to set a price Hay River must pay to get out of its franchise agreement. Under the agreement, the town must buy all of the infrastructure (power poles, transformers, buildings, vehicles, etc.) that are part of Northland’s distribution system.

Northland is challenging an arbitrator’s decision to allow Hay River to pay market value, plus a 30 per cent premium to recognize the business revenue Northland would lose through the transfer.

“The decisions of the arbitrator are entirely inconsistent with what the case law says,” said the company’s lawyer in court last week. Loyola Keough said one example of that inconsistency was taking into account the cost impact on the town and its ratepayers, “which the courts have said is not relevant.”

Northland argues the price the town should pay is how much it would cost to build a brand new system — including everything from constructing new buildings, transporting and installing generators, and the cost of setting power poles and stringing lines — less depreciation. That method yields a figure of about $40 million, almost three times what the arbitrator suggested.

The lawyer for Hay River said there is nothing in the court decisions Northland referred to that suggests the method it’s proposing is the one that should be used.

Thomas Marriott said using Northland’s formula would render the clause allowing the town to buy out of the agreement meaningless.

“Is it appropriate to say: ‘you have the right to purchase those assets but, if you do, you have to use this methodology that requires you to pay three times book value?'” Said Marriott.

“Why would anybody exercise that right? That has no practical application.”

The town has said if the court decides Northland’s methodology must be used, it will not terminate the franchise agreement.

Whatever the judge decides, Northland will continue distributing power in Hay River for the foreseeable future. Each side has the right to appeal any decision to the N.W.T. Court of Appeal and, after that, the Supreme Court of Canada.

After the court case is decided, the public utilities board will have to approve the cost, the transfer of the franchise agreement and the setting of new rates, if any, for the town.

Other cities to come?

In a presentation to Yellowknife city council earlier this year, NTPC said part of its three-year strategy is to complete the merger of its generation and distribution functions in Hay River and pursue more distribution franchise opportunities.

The only other power distributor in the N.W.T. is Northland, which delivers power to homes and businesses in Yellowknife, Ndilo, Enterprise, Fort Providence, Samba Ke, Wekweti and Kakisa, as well as Hay River.

Yellowknife is the biggest distribution franchise in the territory and one Northland has held for decades. It generates about $45 million in revenues annually.

The city’s franchise agreement with Northland expires on Dec. 31, 2020. Reducing the cost of power (the N.W.T. has the highest in the country) was a campaign commitment of the top two candidates in last October’s mayoral election.

In its own presentation to city council, Northland pointed out that the money it pays to NTPC to purchase the power it distributes in the city accounts for 77 per cent of the price Yellowknifers pay.

Another cost is the $1 million franchise fee Northland pays the Corporation of the City of Yellowknife annually, a cost that is passed on to residents and businesses in their monthly power bills.

Northland says the best system for Northerners is one in which it and the power corporation combine forces. It says that will reduce duplication and, ultimately, lower costs to customers.

Others, including previous ministers responsible for the power corporation, have suggested another way would be to eliminate Northland — and the need to return a profit to its shareholders.

Bert Paul, a long-time Liberal, says a non-partisan inquiry that includes testimony under oath is the only way to find out what happened.

""I believe Canadians should know the truth,"" Paul said in an interview with CTV News Vancouver's Mi-Jung Lee this week.

Developing story: New evidence released Friday

Paul served as the chair of the audit committee of the Federal Liberal Agency, the chief agent of the Liberal Party of Canada.

The party has been under the microscope for weeks after allegations surfaced suggesting political influence in a corruption and fraud case against the Montreal-based engineering and construction company.

There are already two investigations into the affair, being conducted by the justice committee and the federal ethics commissioner.

But Paul feels there should be a third, non-partisan review of what exactly occurred.

""It would be done independent of the parliamentary system,"" he said.

""It would have powers associated with the ability to subpoena, so they could request information, they could request documentation. They could also require individuals to come and to give testimony so that Canadians can find out what the facts are.""

The allegations of obstruction of justice are serious, he said, and should be dealt with before the federal election.

When asked how he thought the scandal was being handled by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Paul said most Canadians find it perplexing.

""The question is, what did he know and when did he know it? I think Canadians are frustrated, as am I, because I believe we have not had a full and independent investigation of the issues, and I think we owe it to the Canadian public to do that,"" he said.

New evidence from former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould regarding SNC-Lavalin is set to be made public Friday.

Additional documents include copies of emails and text messages as well as a new written statement, which Wilson-Raybould is providing to supplement testimony she gave one month ago. Read a recap of that testimony on CTVNews.ca.

Paul also spoke out against recent leaks about the appointment of a Supreme Court Justice, calling them an attempt to undermine Wilson-Raybould's credibility.

Some MPs who don't want to be identified say that if the matter of the two MPs' caucus status isn't on Wednesday's caucus agenda, they'll stand up at the meeting and ask their colleagues to vote on ejecting Wilson-Raybould and Philpott.

Liberal MPs from all regions of the country tell CBC News they feel the two former cabinet ministers can't stay.

""I've come to the conclusion that they both have lost any right to be a part of this team,"" Quebec MP Alexandra Mendès wrote in an email. She said serving in a party caucus requires ""loyalty and team spirit.""

Many caucus members who once said they thought Wilson-Raybould and Philpott could remain now say they don't understand how they can continue to identify as members of the Liberal Party given the damage done to the government by the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Trudeau punts on question of caucus status

At an event in Halifax yesterday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was asked if he thinks the two MPs should be permitted to stay.

""As for what Dr. Philpott and Ms. Wilson-Raybould intend to do as next steps, people are going to have to ask them,"" he replied.

CBC sent emails to Wilson-Raybould and Philpott; so far, neither has responded.

Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet Feb. 12, just days after the Globe and Mail reported that she had been inappropriately pressured by PMO and other officials to overturn a decision by the Director of Public Prosecution Service of Canada to proceed with a criminal prosecution against SNC-Lavalin related to bribery charges for contracts in Libya.

The Montreal-based global engineering and construction company had been seeking an agreement that would allow it to avoid criminal proceedings and a possible 10-year ban on bidding for federal contracts in the event of a conviction.

Philpott resigned from cabinet on March 4, saying she had lost ""confidence"" in the government's handling of the SNC-Lavalin file.

Other senior Liberals have suggested that while the caucus is inclined to expel them, they feel the better option would be for Wilson-Raybould and Philpott to leave of their own accord, as did Whitby, Ont. MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes. She quit the Liberal caucus March 20 to sit as an independent.

Some Liberal MPs aren't ready to say one way or the other.

""Both of them have been great colleagues and, you know, we'll see how that evolves. But again, decision's not going to be mine. I'll be, of course, part of the caucus, but we'll just wait and see how things evolve from here,"" said New Brunswick MP Pat Finnigan.

'It would be a mistake to expel them' — MP Wayne Long

""I mean, any member who wants to stay part of the caucus has to say that they support the prime minister and, obviously, they support the Liberal agenda. We all got elected under the Liberal Party of Canada. I mean, I'll leave that question up to Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott, whether or not they want to remain part of the caucus,"" said Ontario MP Francis Drouin.

Some caucus members say they still think the two MPs should be permitted to remain.

""I strongly believe that our caucus is made stronger by the continued presence of Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott within it, and that it would be a mistake to expel them from caucus,"" New Brunswick MP Wayne Long said in an email.

""I'm proud to be a member of a caucus in which members who share the same set of progressive values are free to express their views, and those of their constituents, on the issues that matter to them, even when they disagree with our leader or the majority of caucus members on those issues.""

A decision on expulsion could come as early as next Wednesday.","Pressure building in Liberal caucus to eject Wilson-Raybould, Philpott",CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/wilson-raybould-philpott-snc-lavalin-trudeau-1.5076998

Grassy Narrows First Nation held a protest and demonstration in Toronto on Wednesday evening during a Liberal Party fundraiser to press the Trudeau government on its promise to fund a specialized mercury treatment facility in the northwestern Ontario community that's about 100 kilometres northeast of Kenora.

During the event, the protester appeared to be escorted out of the room while Trudeau thanked her for her ""donation.""

""From time to time, I'm in situations where people are expressing concerns or protesting a particular thing, and I always try to be respectful and always try to engage with them in a positive way,"" Trudeau told reporters in Halifax on Thursday morning.

""I didn't do that last night — last night I lacked respect towards them and I apologize.""

Grassy Narrows also is pushing for federal help for remediation of the polluted English-Wabigoon River system and better compensation for people affected by the toxic element.

In a video posted to the Council of Canadians' verified Facebook page Wednesday evening, a woman is shown standing in front of the stage where Trudeau is standing; she appears to unfurl a banner that references the prime minister and compensation for the ""mercury crisis."" She is heard saying ""people in Grassy Narrows are suffering from mercury poisoning, you committed to addressing this crisis,"" while appearing to be removed from the room.

Trudeau, still on the stage, is heard saying, while facing the direction in which the woman was taken out of the room, ""Thank you for being here, thank you very much for your donation tonight, I really appreciate it,"" which draws cheers and applause from the crowd.

The Grassy Narrows protest in Toronto was at the Omni King Edward Hotel, where Trudeau was scheduled to appear at a Laurier Club donor ""appreciation event.""

Former Indigenous services minister Jane Philpott pledged in late 2017 that Ottawa would fund the development and construction of a treatment facility for people exposed to mercury-related illnesses in Grassy Narrows. A number of studies have linked the comparatively poor health of people in the community to the dumping of mercury-contaminated effluent by Reed Paper, former owners of the mill in Dryden, into the river where members of the First Nation have traditionally fished.

The dumping also affected Wabaseemoong, another First Nation, about 100 kilometres northwest of Kenora.

""The situation in Grassy Narrows is one that we have been following for quite awhile,"" Trudeau said Thursday. He said representatives from his office will be in touch with the office of Indigenous Services Minister Seamus O'Regan.

Grassy Narrows submitted a feasibility study for the treatment centre in late 2018, said the community's environmental health co-ordinator, Judy Da Silva. But the community is now waiting for Ottawa to commit to funding a detailed work plan — the next step in the project, she said.

""We're really worried this promise won't be fulfilled,"" Da Silva said, with the 2019 federal election drawing closer. ""The crunch is coming ... and we need something concrete in place ... for the mercury home to be a reality.

""As we speak, our people are having to suffer in the Kenora hospital, or in Thunder Bay or in Winnipeg, and the numbers are growing,"" Da Silva said.

Judy Da Silva was in Toronto to help protest what the community is calling a lack of action by the federal government on the Grassy Narrows mercury treatment centre. (CBC)

""We're hoping that ... [Ottawa] will put something in place that will fulfil that promise for a mercury home and for mercury justice for our people.""

Da Silva said Grassy Narrows has also yet to secure a visit from Trudeau, despite chief and council requesting he come to the community.

William Olscamp, a spokesperson for Indigenous Services Canada, said in an email to CBC News that the department has reviewed the mercury treatment centre's feasibility study ""and is actively engaged with the community, the province and other technical experts to continue to effectively map out the required services against the technical requirements of the building.

""Once the requirements have been finalized, the next steps can get underway.""

The elevated levels of mercury in the river that runs adjacent to Grassy Narrows also closed a once-thriving fishery in the 1970s, decimating the local economy. Community leaders have called on senior levels of government for better compensation, saying the existing Mercury Disability Board, established in the 1980s and under provincial jurisdiction, has only resulted in about six per cent of Grassy Narrows members getting any compensation.

While the province has committed to indexing payouts to inflation, there's been little talk about changing the eligibility criteria.

Grassy Narrows highlighted by Amnesty International

The situation in Grassy Narrows was highlighted by Amnesty International on World Water Day in March as one example in Canada of ""environmental racism.""

""There are communities, particularly communities of colour and Indigenous peoples, who daily have to live with threats to their health and well-being from environmental contamination that would be unthinkable for so many other wealthier communities,"" said Craig Benjamin, Amnesty International Canada's Indigenous rights campaigner.

""Really, there's no clearer example of this than Grassy Narrows.""

Amnesty International has been working with the community for close to 20 years, he said, adding specialized health care should have been on the table years ago.

""This isn't something that should be delayed.""

Olscamp said in his email that Indigenous Services Canada ""continues to work collaboratively with the communities of Grassy Narrows First Nation, Wabaseemoong Independent Nations and provincial partners to address the specific health needs in these communities and reform the Mercury Disability Board.

""The timelines for completion of the treatment facility will depend on the project requirements and the final design agreed upon by the federal and provincial project participants and the Grassy Narrows community,"" he added.

Grassy Narrows is about 100 kilometres northeast of Kenora, Ont. (CBC)

""It is too early at this point to provide a definitive date for the project completion.""

Benjamin acknowledged the commitments made by both the federal and provincial governments as being much-needed positive steps that need to be adhered to.

""We also have the fact that there have been these long struggles for justice that, at this point, we finally see them bearing fruit,"" he said.

We had a mandate and fulfilled it,” MacLauchlan told reporters when asked about the early call. “This is an opportunity to ask Islanders for their confidence to build on that record.” Despite a booming economy, polls suggest the Liberal party is likely facing a rough ride, with the Greens seen as a legitimate contender for power.

In his speech, MacLauchlan called the Progressive Conservatives a party of chaos and opposition — saying they’ve had five leaders in four years — and suggested the Greens would be too risky. “The Green Party is untested, and the future of our province is too important to risk on uncertain expensive social experiments, led by a career politician,” he said. Green Leader Peter Bevan-Baker, a dentist, became the first party member elected to the legislature in 2015, and the Greens snagged a second seat in a 2017 byelection. A Corporate Research Associates poll released this month suggests the Greens had a healthy lead, followed by the Progressive Conservatives, who picked a new leader, Dennis King, in February. The Liberals were in third place, the poll suggests.

The Liberals have been in power since 2007, and there are signs MacLauchlan — a longtime academic who began his political career in 2015 as premier — is personally unpopular. “It’s about people. It’s about you — and it’s about time that the government of the people of P.E.I. understand, respect and live by that message,” the PC party said in a tweet as MacLauchlan was making his election call.

The Greens, meanwhile, posted a clip Tuesday night of Bevan-Baker playing “First Call” on his trumpet. “What a wonderful way to begin the writ period — with a blast from Peter’s trumpet,” the party said on Facebook. In his speech, MacLauchlan touted advancements made by his government on housing, lower taxes and reducing child poverty by more than half. “Prince Edward Island is working,” he told the enthusiastic partisan crowd. “There are now more opportunities for Islanders to get ahead and thrive.” The standings at dissolution in the Island legislature were 16 Liberals, eight Tories, two Green and one independent member. The Island has only ever been governed by the Liberals or Tories. The last time a minority government was elected in P.E.I. was 1890. MacLauchlan said Tuesday night that he notified the other party leaders earlier in the day. He is scheduled to make his first campaign stop Wednesday morning in Charlottetown. The election will also include a binding referendum on electoral reform — asking voters if they wish to stay with the current first-past-the-post system or change to a mixed-member-proportional-representation model. It won’t be the first time P.E.I. voters have been asked to consider electoral reform. In fact, they voted 52 per cent in favour of switching to mixed member proportional reform during a plebiscite in 2016, but MacLauchlan rejected the results because of a low turnout of about 36 per cent.

Dear Editor,

I am writing this letter in response to Martyn Brown’s insightful article dated March 21 entitled ”Pardon my French, Prime Minister, but you’re f#*ked”.

I am a former thirty-year director and chair of the audit committee of the Federal Liberal Agency of Canada ""(FLAC)"". FLAC, is the Chief Agent of the Liberal Party of Canada.

I am in full agreement with the comments of former cabinet minister Jane Phillpott. She justifiably complained in MacLeans about “an attempt to shut down the inquiry”. I agree with her assertion that “Canadians would like to know the whole truth.” It is obvious that as Martyn Brown quoted ""There’s much more to the story that should be told.""

I would strongly support that an independent public inquiry be initiated. The powers pursuant to the Inquiry Act permit summoning of witnesses to provide testimony under oath, requiring them to give evidence and produce documents.

A non-partisan inquiry can then address the issues of bearing false witness, contravening the Shawcross Doctrine and Section 5 of the OECD Convention as it relates to anti bribery provisions.

It is vital we protect the public interest relating to the rule of law and address these serious allegations including contravention of our international obligations. Canadians deserve the best government possible.

Sincerely,

The next step is a formal vetting process by a green-light committee, which could take more than a week to complete.

Rene Ephestion, leader of the New Brunswick Liberal Multicultural Inclusion Commission, has also expressed his interest in seeking the leadership. He could not be reached for comment.

A leadership convention has been scheduled for June 21-22 in Saint John.

Vickers issued a statement Friday saying he is looking forward to speaking with Liberals “about a new path forward.”

He has drafted a five-point plan that calls for growing the province’s economy and population, improving health care, “transforming” education, ensuring environmental protection and making sure provincial finances are well managed.

His statement also took a shot at the governing Conservative party.

“With this year’s provincial budget, we saw the finance minister raise his hands in despair against the economic and demographic headwinds that New Brunswick faces,” Vickers said.

“We’ve also seen no provincial action on climate change, despite the fact that we’re a year removed from record flooding in key parts of the province.”

Vickers, who also served as Canada’s ambassador to Ireland, has acknowledged spending many years away from the province, but he has also focused on his deep roots in New Brunswick.

He is hoping to replace former premier Brian Gallant, who lost power last fall after the Liberals failed to form a minority government in the weeks following the Sept. 24 provincial election.

This, according to a new analysis of public opinion polling data by the non-profit Angus Reid Institute. The data was donated to ARI by Angus Reid Global Public Affairs.

The Conservatives capture 37 per cent of the decided and leaning vote – essentially unchanged from where they stood last month – but it is the governing Liberals who have dropped three points to 28 per cent as the SNC-Lavalin affair has remained in the headlines.

The principal beneficiaries of this decline in Liberal support appear to be the New Democratic Party and smaller parties, including the Green Party and the People’s Party of Canada.

These parties are seeing their fortunes rise as the Canadian public expresses unfavourable views of the main parties and their leaders.

More Key Findings:

More Canadians have a favourable view of CPC leader Andrew Scheer (44% do) and New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh (39%) than Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (36%)

VANCOUVER—Though British Columbia should be fertile ground for the Liberals to grow support ahead of October’s general election, the party’s biggest asset in 2015 is now its biggest liability: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Brown’s comments follow a new Research Co. poll released on Tuesday that found a majority of British Columbians believe a new party leader would be better. A third of B.C. residents who voted for the Liberals in 2015 also believe a different party leader would do things better in Ottawa than Trudeau.

“As long as Trudeau is their leader, the party is bound to suffer big time.”

“B.C. is critical to the Liberals’ fortunes, as their strength in Quebec seems to be waning and in Atlantic Canada they’re grossly under attack. They have to look for where they can gain seats,” Brown said in an interview.

And that animosity toward Canada’s current prime minister is pervasive across the province, though strongest outside of the Metro Vancouver region, said Mario Canseco, president of Research Co.

“That’s the danger the Liberals are facing,” Canseco said. “This is more worrisome in urban areas where you can see people gravitate more to the NDP, which places a lot of seats in jeopardy.”

Meanwhile, half of British Columbians think a different party is needed to lead in Ottawa. Notably, a majority of all age groups polled — from millennials to boomers and beyond — felt that way, as well as a quarter of 2015 Liberal voters.

Prior to 2015, the Liberal party held two seats in British Columbia. But after “Trudeaumania” took the country, the Liberals went from third place in the House of Commons to holding a majority government. Now, they hold 17 seats in B.C.

Canseco questioned whether they could sustain that momentum.

And while there wasn’t much of a gender gap in 2015, men are now more likely to be critical and dissatisfied with the Liberals.

Canseco is closely following the millennial reaction to Trudeau, as the previous election saw a significant spike in the youth vote. For Canseco, the big question ahead of the fall election will be exactly where those votes go.

“It’s no longer the idea of Trudeau as a great unifier, and if they find a shinier object out there, will they support it?” he said. “If you’re disenchanted because of environmental decisions, or maybe electoral reform, or the SNC-Lavalin affair, do you stay home or vote Green or NDP?”

Poll results were based on an online study from March 8 to 10 among 800 adults in B.C., with a margin of error of +/- 3.5 percentage points 19 times out of 20.

Left-leaning progressives offended by the SNC-Lavalin affair may be tempted to vote for the NDP or Greens, Brown said, while centre-right leaning and “swing Liberals” will now be swayed to vote Conservative.

Disenchantment with Trudeau — particularly in B.C. — has risen because he has “failed” on so many files, according to Brown, such as proportional representation, balancing the budget, reconciliation and the purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline.

“(All that has) dramatically reduced his party’s fortunes in Greater Vancouver on progressive, environmentally conscious voters,” he said. “On so many files, he’s proven himself to be the opposite of what he purports to be.”

Braeden Caley, a Liberal party spokesperson, says Trudeau and the Liberals are focused on a strong plan for British Columbians “to build more affordable housing, invest in better roads and transit, grow the economy and protect a healthier environment for our kids and grandkids.”

A decline in support for the Liberals is exaggerated, according to Caley. He says grassroots support for the party continues to grow.

“More than 15,000 British Columbians have singed up as new Liberals in the past two years alone,” he said in an email. “The Liberal party is also continuing to be approached by a variety of talented community leaders interested in becoming Team Trudeau candidates throughout British Columbia, building on the strong growth that we’ve seen in our B.C. team and caucus in recent years.”

Brown has been publicly calling for Trudeau to step down to improve the Liberal party’s chances in October, amid the ongoing SNC-Lavalin affair which he said has “dramatically undercut” Trudeau’s personal brand of having the ethical high-ground.

He predicts an RCMP probe on the matter in the near future and told the Star the Liberal party will only have a chance in October if they find a new leader. Brown said that would be in their best “political self-interest,” especially with the support of Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott.

“If they went into an election with those two women behind them saying we’re cleaning up our act and we mean it,” Brown said, “it would suddenly turn the table and make the new Liberal leader potentially the voice of a new ethical government instead of the opposite.”

But for me to publicly criticize the government as a Liberal would undermine the government and ...,"The Walrus/flickr

On September 17, 2018, Parliament’s first day back from summer break, Leona Alleslev, the Liberal MP from Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill, rose in the House of Commons to announce her defection from the governing Liberal Party of Canada. “The government must be challenged openly and publicly. But for me to publicly criticize the government as a Liberal would undermine the government and, according to my code of conduct, be dishonourable,” she said. “After careful and deliberate consideration, I must withdraw from the government benches to take my seat among the ranks of my Conservative colleagues.”

New to politics when she was first elected in 2015, Alleslev is a hard-nosed and plain-spoken air force veteran. Before her dramatic exit, her time in office had been somewhat unexceptional, save for her early career appointment as parliamentary secretary to public-services and procurement minister Judy Foote—a notable promotion for a rookie MP. Still, she was, until she switched sides, little known outside of political and military circles.

The media immediately scoured her social media for signs of dissent but turned up nothing—no instances of serious disagreement with the party, no off-the-cuff clashes with Liberal colleagues, no pretension of sticking it to the man for the sake of her constituents. Rather, by all appearances, Alleslev had fallen in line with the party. Throughout her tenure, she offered reassurances that team Trudeau was on the right track. In July, two months before switching sides, she fawned over the prime minister, foreign-affairs minister Chrystia Freeland, and defence minister Harjit Sajjan in a private email, calling them “truly awesome.” Nine days later, she praised Trudeau’s leadership at a fundraising event.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer wasted no time taking advantage of her move. “For all those Canadians who supported Justin Trudeau in 2015 and are dissatisfied or even angry about the leadership that he’s been giving,” he told a room full of reporters, “the Conservative Party needs you.” He had apparently forgiven her previous anti-Conservative criticism. During a 2015 election debate in her riding, Alleslev lamented having watched the country under Stephen Harper “become something I barely recognize—socially, politically, economically, and internationally.” But the Trudeau government, in the end, apparently fared just as poorly in Alleslev’s eyes. Bidding adieu to her fellow caucus members, she referenced wide-ranging failures on tax reform, trade, foreign policy, defence, and security. She assured everyone who asked that it was never only one issue.

The act of switching teams requires a flexibility uncommon among twenty-first-century politicians. Alleslev considers herself among that rare breed of lawmaker. “As a member of Parliament, it’s my job to listen to everybody,” she told me. “I’m not sure that’s always the most widely held opinion.” She sees in modern politics a tendency to characterize all debate as conflict and worries about where that will lead. “If you look where we are, not only in Canada but in the world, where we’re becoming far more divided, far less able to have conversations with those that we have differing opinions with, we’re at risk of losing the value of debate.”

The resignations of two high-profile cabinet ministers over the Liberals’ mishandling of the SNC-Lavalin affair have since brought the question of debate within parties into greater focus. Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former justice minister and attorney general, and Jane Philpott, the former Treasury Board president, two of Trudeau’s most respected ministers, brazenly stood against the prime minister and his office and still remain in the Liberal caucus. Their actions lend credibility to Alleslev’s story while undermining the necessity of her departure. She chose to keep her quarrels with the party silent, she says, because dissenting openly would jeopardize its ability to govern.

But, in keeping quiet for so long, Alleslev has opened herself up to accusations of political opportunism. “Did you put your finger in the air to see which way the wind was blowing,” pressed CTV’s Don Martin, “and figure it was going to go Conservative in 2019, so you might as well join the parade?” If she hopes to regain her seat in 2019, Alleslev will need to prove those accusations wrong. She will need to convince her supporters that switching sides was more than simply self-interested politics, despite what the opposition says. And the Liberals will come armed with stories spun by former staffers and Liberal hard-liners with an incentive to discredit her. All voters have is her word. Whether she honestly acted in their interest or not, the fallout that ensued suggests intentions are moot. Few things are as politically isolating as crossing the floor.

Since Confederation, 340 MPs have changed party affiliation, willingly or not, between elections. Those who leave tend to opt for independence, with many soon switching again to join another party or to return to their former caucus. While some forty countries have laws pertaining to crossing the floor—in most cases, defecting legislators are forced to give up their seats—there’s no federal convention, legislation, or parliamentary rule regarding it in Canada. Manitoba and New Brunswick have enacted laws forcing outgoing caucus members to sit independently for the remainder of the term. But both the Liberals and Conservatives seem less keen to hamstring members’ freedom. In 2005, the federal government defeated a bill proposing that changes in party affiliation be followed by a by-election. Similar legislation has been introduced regularly in parliamentary sessions since; all have failed to pass first reading.

However, a series of ethics inquiries suggests floor crossers came under greater scrutiny beginning in the early 2000s, as crossing grew in popularity. Some forty-four MPs switched sides between 2001 and 2005, which, according to a 2006 study, outpaced the previous eighty-year average of twenty-three crossings per decade. In 2005, former ethics commissioner Bernard Shapiro was asked to determine whether a member had contravened the Conflict of Interest Code in switching parties. The following year, his attention turned to investigating Prime Minister Stephen Harper. In question was whether Harper had bribed Liberal MP David Emerson into leaving his party with the perks of a cabinet position with the Conservatives. Shapiro found no wrongdoing, but noted, “The discontent expressed by Canadians on this matter cannot be attributed merely to the machinations of partisan politics. Fairly or unfairly, this particular instance has given many citizens a sense that their vote—the cornerstone of our democratic system—was somehow devalued, if not betrayed.”

A number high-profile defections have been viewed as politically expedient, such as those of Belinda Stronach, in 2005, and Eve Adams, in 2015. Stronach left the Conservatives and was granted a cabinet seat with the Liberals, a move she made, some suspect, to help keep Paul Martin’s minority government in power ahead of two important budget votes. Adams deserted the Conservatives over their “mean-spirited leadership” six months after dropping out of a nomination-race in a new riding and was welcomed by Trudeau’s Liberals with open arms.

In Alleslev’s case, journalists and political pundits raised the possibility that she was reacting to the Ontario Liberal Party’s defeat in June 2018. During that provincial election, the riding of Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill saw Conservative Michael Parsa win by more than twice as many votes as the Liberal runner-up. By comparison, in 2014, each of the predecessor districts that now make up the new riding—Newmarket-Aurora, Oak Ridges–Markham, and Richmond Hill—had voted Liberal. The losses are notable, but they offer little insight into the projected electoral outcome for the region in October. According to the CBC, the federal party that has won the most seats in Ontario has been different in 52 percent of elections from the one currently in power provincially.

At the federal level, the ethnically diverse riding of Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill remains a toss-up between the reds and blues. It would be foolish to think Alleslev had special insight, more than one year out, into how the election will unfold. What we know is this: in Ontario, the parties have been neck and neck in the polls since early 2018, and an analysis of polling numbers by the website Calculated Politics, taken only weeks before Alleslev’s defection, projected the Conservatives were on par to win Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill by a margin of just 2 percent.

What seems to set defectors apart is an ability to exploit the divisive nature of politics today to their own advantage. It’s a quality Alleslev seems to have put to work during her 2014 nomination race. Clayton Haluza, president of the federal Liberal riding association in Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill, hadn’t the faintest idea who she was when she approached him at a fundraising event that year. Haluza found her straightforwardness refreshing for a political hopeful. But Alleslev had no ties to the Liberal party, hadn’t served in municipal politics, and wasn’t particularly involved in the community.

Alleslev’s aloofness was the result of having, as she says, “never, ever considered” a life in politics. Instead, she envisioned spending her entire career in the military—a calling she says teaches you to put country first. Her father retired as a two-star general from the Royal Canadian Air Force; his father had resisted the Nazis in Denmark as a member of the Danish underground. She came to believe that “serving one’s country is an honourable profession.” In 1991, she joined the Canadian military as a second lieutenant, logistics officer in Comox, BC, having studied history and political science at the Royal Military College in Kingston, Ontario. A decade later, following her retirement from the military, she worked as a consultant, at times within the federal government, and eventually landed in the private sector at IBM and Bombardier Aerospace.

Alleslev says it was Harper government that motivated her to join the Liberal Party in 2014. She thought their policies weren’t positioning Canada competitively and that, in contrast, the Liberals were making bold promises on everything from foreign policy to infrastructure spending, which she found appealing. Sitting in her Richmond Hill office late last year, she told me she began to sense, around four years ago, that “some pretty dramatic things” were unfolding at home and abroad. She was unsure about running for office, however, until she met Jason Cherniak, who was seeking the nomination. A lawyer based out of Richmond Hill, then in his midthirties, Cherniak was as faithful as they come: a card-carrying Liberal since high school, he went on to serve on the Young Liberals of Canada national executive and later as president of the Richmond Hill federal riding association and as president of the Liberal Party of Canada (Ontario) Central Region.

“Considering how significant the challenges facing the country and world are right now, I’m not sure he’s the right guy to represent me as a member of Parliament,” she said, thinking back. “Ah rats—I’m going to have to run.”

With existing ties to the Liberal Party, Cherniak was confident he had a shot at the nomination. But he began to suspect party upper brass were favouring Alleslev. “That part of it has been very difficult for me,” Cherniak says, “because after all these years of volunteering, I really thought that at the very least I had earned a chance at a fair race.” Alleslev had virtually no political experience, but she was a veteran and strong leader who stood in contrast to Conservative incumbent, Costas Menegakis. She played right into the optimistic, feminist narrative the Liberals were hoping to tell. As the Globe and Mail’s Adam Radwanski has noted, Trudeau “made a point of recruiting a diverse array of candidates who, despite impressive professional credentials, often did not have much partisan political experience.”

So intent was the party to win the riding that it overlooked what one former staffer now considers several “red flags.” Alleslev’s sister Caroline vied for the Conservative seat in Beaches–East York in 2008. And, throughout the nomination race, Alleslev could be found in tow of Greg Beros, a staunch Conservative and Richmond Hill city councillor. “You know that Leona’s a good, dear friend,” Beros would say when introducing her to members of local community groups. “While I can’t vote for her, because she’s with the Liberal Party, she is a great individual and would represent us well.” Beros recused himself from supporting her come the election. “Some people are candidate first, party second,” he says. “I’m always party first, candidate second.”

Alleslev succeeded at connecting with influential members of the riding’s Muslim community, whose support, both financial and otherwise, was “key to her getting the nomination,” says Haluza. She was later able to leverage constituents’ unhappiness with the Conservatives’ anti-immigrant rhetoric over “Canadian values” to garner widespread approval among members of the Muslim community. Without their support, many Liberals believe she would have lost in the general election. In the end, a combination of Alleslev’s own political abilities and the Conservatives’ hardline tactics helped mobilize the Muslim community at the polls, and she clinched the seat by fewer than 1,100 votes.

Following the win, a different picture of Alleslev began to emerge, one the Liberals could attempt to resuscitate during the upcoming election. In several instances, sources speaking on background say Alleslev was reluctant to credit the Muslim community for its role in her electoral success. This, they say, left some supporters feeling hurt and embittered. (In a request for comment, Alleslev apologized. “I like to think of myself as being sensitive,” she said. “So if I have been in any way insensitive, then I’m very sorry for that.”). According to the sources, that resentment was amplified by Alleslev’s decision to join the Conservatives, a party which has shown itself—most recently through its promise to withdraw Canada from the UN’s Global Compact for Safe, Orderly, and Regular Migration—to be less open to refugees and immigrants. In 2019, Alleslev will have to grapple with having alienated a group that fervently supported her only four years ago.

“A political party is made up of the people who are in it at the time and must be judged by what the country needs at the time,” Alleslev has said, in explanation of her actions. By this, she appears to suggest that political parties aren’t monolithic entities but rather are born out of a particular time and place and defined by their caucuses, which presumably have voters’ best interests at heart. This logic enables Alleslev to argue it’s not her principles but rather the needs of Canadians that have changed since she first entered politics.

Her position reveals a grey area, rarely acknowledged in federal politics, that can be exploited by politicians willing to see beyond fervent partisanship. The Liberals and Conservatives may have the tendency to disagree, especially during election years, and their rhetoric may be different, but their track records suggest they’re more similar than they’re wont to admit. “To this day, if you go down line by line and look at what the Conservative and Liberal party stand for,” Haluza says, “at least on paper, it’s shades of grey.”

Alleslev seems to have leveraged this dynamic to her own advantage. Justifying her defection, she accused the Liberals of failing to meet the NATO target that members spend at least 2 percent of GDP on defence, even though Trudeau campaigned on maintaining previous spending levels. The truth is, no sitting government has met NATO’s targets since they were enacted in 2006. Alleslev also rebuked the Liberals’ diplomatic track record, citing tensions with Saudi Arabia, China, and India. This critique ignores the Conservatives’ own failings, such as in 2010, when Canada was forced to withdraw from pursuing a seat on the UN Security Council, a move interpreted by an article in OpenCanada as a “stinging rebuke of Harper’s anti-UN foreign policy.” (Trudeau has pledged to vie for a seat on the council in 2020). Their similarities extend to the economy, where both parties are quick to talk about more free-trade agreements and tax relief for the middle class.

But, if the parties are so alike, why would Alleslev leave one for the other? To the former colleagues who are quick to mention Alleslev’s ambition, it’s easy to craft a tale of opportunity. Alleslev’s political career was off to a strong start when, in late 2015, she was named Foote’s parliamentary secretary. The public-services minister’s mandate included replacing the country’s fleet of aging CF-18s and supporting a national shipbuilding procurement strategy—two areas that would seem to be of strong personal interest to Alleslev. As parliamentary secretary, she supported these files. But she also worked on Phoenix, the payment system for the federal civil service, the deployment of which has been riddled with complications.

According to a 2018 Senate finance committee report, more than half of the Canadian civil service has not been properly paid since Phoenix’s implementation in 2016. The report notes that the project will likely amass $2.2 billion in unplanned costs by 2023, making it an “international embarrassment.” When questioned about Phoenix on Foote’s behalf, Alleslev would assure legislators the system would soon be fixed. But the situation remained chaotic, and following a cabinet shuffle in January 2017, she was demoted from her role as parliamentary secretary. Historically, such appointments have been used to prepare (or rather to test the readiness of) future cabinet ministers. Alleslev would later cite the Liberals’ failure to resolve Phoenix as among her reasons for leaving the party.

Throwing herself in with the Conservatives has, conveniently, allowed her to regain lost momentum. National media attention has made her a familiar face and a champion of the Conservative cause. And, with Scheer swiftly appointing her shadow cabinet secretary for global security, she has reclaimed a prominent role in the House. It may prove to be an important career pick-me-up, given that she was ousted as chair of the Canadian NATO parliamentary association one month after defecting. Like the majority of floor-crossing MPs before her, Alleslev could have ridden out her term as an independent, thereby limiting speculation on her motives, but she says she decided against it, believing that the Canadian system is not “structured for independence.” Independent members rarely sit on committees, are not recognized as often during Question Period, and lose the support of a caucus. They are, in other words, less influential.

Alleslev has always been focused on maximizing her influence. She entered politics with her mind set on transforming the country and, after three years, came to believe she couldn’t do it as a Liberal. An early party switch meant trying to make the most of what could be her last year in office, she says, noting she had the support of her family and many constituents. But it also meant alienating supporters and staff who fought to get her elected and who now have reason to want to see her lose. Later this year, they will get their say on whether her actions were genuine and, above all, justified.",The Politics of Switching Parties,The Walrus,https://thewalrus.ca/the-politics-of-switching-parties/

Within minutes Monday afternoon, two good reporters had stories (here and here) about the Chief Justice of Manitoba, who was a candidate to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada and who, later, wasn’t. Both reporters unfurled similar yarns about a lone Prime Minister standing athwart the tide of conservatism by blocking—shudder—a Harper appointee from sitting on the top court. Jody Wilson-Raybould plays the role of villain in the piece.

Both reporters decorously neglect to mention that Trudeau’s choice for Chief Justice, Richard Wagner, was a Harper appointee.

There are many things we can say about this story, working outward in concentric rings from the thing itself. First, Glenn Joyal’s views, as expressed in speeches that were said to alarm the prime minister, are almost comically orthodox. I first became aware of the notion that Charter litigation systematically airlifts important matters from the parliamentary arena and into the realm of jurisprudence in a Chantal Hébert column in the late 1990s. If I had paid more attention to literally any of my Canadian public administration profs a decade earlier I would have caught the argument then, because it is canvassed in every Canadian political science class. This is not wild-eyed Hayekism.

Second, perhaps the many thousands of Canadians who have applied for federal government appointments under what they thought was a confidential process, introduced by this prime minister, will want to contemplate a class-action suit against him. Because it is now radiantly clear to each of them that their CV is being held hostage by a claque of embattled sorcerers’ apprentices who will cheerfully wheel it over the transom to any waiting scribe if anything about them—their opinions, a fallen political star’s unfortunate decision to argue for their advancement—becomes politically inconvenient. This is the very stuff of the police state.

It was immediately fashionable to wonder on social media how everyone would react if Stephen Harper had done such a thing. It’s germane to note that Stephen Harper never did. Because he had more class. Welcome to the Tet offensive of Charter rights: This was the week it became necessary to destroy the village of good government in order to save it.

Third, Justice Joyal’s wife was in poor health. Apparently we are to believe that 9,000 jobs depended on your knowing that.

If the Trudeau government is not the source of the leak, I assume we will see spectacular efforts deployed in the next 36 hours to find the leaker. Mark Norman-scale efforts. But I’m pretty sure that we needn’t hold our breath, because the government is the source of the leak; that the amiable chap who currently sits in the office once occupied by the Attorney General of Canada will not bestir himself to question Monday’s sickening attack on due process; and that the leak will actually be roundly applauded by the ambient cloud of Liberal and Liberal-adjacent opinion, which became self-aware this weekend and decided Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott are a virus endangering the party’s re-election chances and must therefore be stopped.

That’s right, it’s Judgment Day. As early as March 5, it was possible for Andrew Cohen to publish a column identifying Philpott and Wilson-Raybould as enemies of the (right-thinking) people. But not for the first time, Andrew was ahead of the moment, and when that column ran, he found few takers. The news that the Criminal Code had been amended in ways SNC-Lavalin found congenial as it faced a criminal trial for serious alleged misdeeds was interesting to millions of Canadians, including many Liberals. Justin Trudeau’s slow, tentative response was worrisome to lots of people who support the government, just as it was to many others. It was still possible for many minds to find room for both general support for Liberal re-election and general interest in what Wilson-Raybould and Philpott — recent Liberal rock stars, after all — had to say.

Then Maclean’s published my interview with Philpott last Thursday morning. On Thursday night’s At Issue panel, Chantal said that with Gerald Butts and Michael Wernick no longer working in government, Philpott and Wilson-Raybould were clearly looking for someone else to lose a job, and it must be Justin Trudeau. This interpretation became popular quickly (and probably would have even if Chantal hadn’t given it voice). By Saturday it was easy to find Liberals and friends of Liberals — pollsters, the odd political scientist, about half the party’s Ontario caucus — attributing the worst motives to the two former ministers. They were “infatuated with ephemeral attention,” said Frank Graves. They were committing “an attempted coup d’état,” wrote a lawyer with impressive credentials, Ishat Reza. This behaviour is, she added, “disqualifying.” This is understatement: Historical penalties for coup plotting have been harsher than exclusion from a governing caucus.

Qui veut noyer son chien l’accuse de la rage, we say in Quebec. When you want to drown your dog you say it has rabies.

This SNC-Lavalin business has been bewildering — honestly bewildering, in ways that are surely easy to understand — for many Canadians with good hearts since it began. It is an odd scandal by many standards. No money changed hands illegally, or at least not after the Qaddafis were executed. None of the assorted Liberal staffers and high officials who came at Jody Wilson-Raybould was seeking personal advancement, except insofar as many of them wanted to be on the winning side in an election and, she asserts, kept telling her so. They kept asking whether she’d seek outside advice on a decision that was the public prosecutor’s to make and the AG’s to review. When they were done asking, the prosecutor’s decision held. That would have been the end of that, if she hadn’t been shuffled. Then it became a duel of assertions and interpretations.

It’s easy to understand why all of this would seem minor and technical. An interesting theological debating point, but surely not worth more than a month of headlines and anguished commentary. So it didn’t get real, for many people, until Conservatives took the lead from Liberals in the polls — and Jane Philpott, whom Trudeau had been busy promoting in cabinet, announced that she too doesn’t like whatever she says she knows.

This puts the stakes high indeed. Everything Trudeau advocates is endangered, not by his own increasingly conspicuous limitations as a public administrator, but by the shorter route of a possible Conservative election victory this autumn. So it is all Liberal hands on deck. All of this is easy to understand.

I felt something like this was coming when I wrote, near the bottom of a column I wrote last November that was published in December, that an election is “the crudest possible instrument” for fixing serious shortcomings in public administration. It’s simply not true that if you don’t like something a government does you must replace it. But nor should re-electing the Liberals mean endorsing Justin Trudeau’s increasingly obvious flaws. The issues raised by the SNC-Lavalin controversy shouldn’t be settled by an election. Some misdeeds are worth dealing with as themselves, when they come up. And then let the election settle the election.

What is at stake in this affair is whether you can get the rules changed in mid-stream if you have the right friends or can hire them. Whether the decisions of competent professionals — beginning with an experienced prosecutor and defence lawyer, Kathleen Roussel — should be trumped by appeals to a preferred electoral outcome. This sort of system-rigging has been at the heart of, for instance, Poland’s confrontation with the European Union over judicial “reforms” that systematically benefit associates of the current regime. Reforms that are immensely popular among people who agree with the ruling party that they tilt the balance back toward fairness in a confrontation against political opponents they judge to be moral failures. Because it’s not only in Canada that you can win many arguments by saying, “Of course this helps our side, but that’s okay because our side is right.”

There’s a neat symmetry here. Jody Wilson-Raybould claimed she was approached, again and again, by people who said things had to work out a certain way because it was an election year. The emerging Liberal argument this month has been, not that this claim was untrue, but that of course it is true and should be. Wilson-Raybould and Philpott have sinned against a higher virtue so sure of itself that it cannot be troubled with the fine print. This sin is deemed disqualifying. They will soon be disqualified by their fellow Liberals, for the (synonymous) good of the party and the nation. And if you’ve sent your CV to Ottawa, have no fear. It probably won’t get leaked until it needs to be.

And there’s no end in sight.

There’s only one sure exit from this scandal. The question now is whether the Trudeau Liberal government is willing to consider it. Or determined to continue bleeding, everyday.

Again last week the Liberals attempted to suffocate the story, shutting down the justice committee and tryng to change the channel to their budget. When that failed, Liberals reacted with internecine attacks on former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board President Jane Philpott.

It was another failure. The counter-attacks on Wilson-Raybould and Philpott gave more fodder to pundit shows and newspaper columnists—and picked the weakest ground to fight on. According to IPSOS pollster Darryl Bricker, surveys show Canadians are twice as likely to believe Wilson-Raybould than Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

For seven weeks the Liberal Party has been losing a war of siege and attrition. In January the Conservatives were languishing, the NDP was on its back and the Liberals were cruising. Now the Liberals risk falling beneath 30 per cent support, Nanos and IPSOS show the NDP has rebounded to 20 per cent and the Conservatives have climbed to the mid or high 30s.

Against this siege the Trudeau Liberals have no ammunition. If the Liberals had evidence that Wilson-Raybould’s story was untrue, Liberal MPs would have brought it to the justice committee weeks ago. But none of the justice committee testimony has refuted the central claim that there were multiple improper attempts to interfere in a criminal prosecution.

Now the siege is about to tighten. Soon, Wilson-Raybould will table more evidence, including emails and texts. Only she knows what it will say. But it will not help the PM. And it will be news.

By now it should be crystal clear to Liberal strategists and party grandees they cannot prevent Canadians from getting the truth about the PMO’s interactions with Wilson-Raybould. There is too much interest in this story—rightfully so, because any attempted interference in a criminal prosecution is profoundly serious—and it appears, one way or another, Wilson-Raybould is determined to tell it.

The Trudeau Liberals need to stop doing what can’t work—and take the only path that might.

The Prime Minister needs to tell Canadians he’s done some real soul-searching. He needs to admit to making mistakes. Ask for forgiveness. Call an inquiry. And commit to working hard to get back on agenda and rebuilding trust.

Yes, it will hurt. More PMO staff may resign. There could be a finding that Trudeau broke the constitutionally-embedded legal principle of non-interference in prosecutions.

But the alternative is more painful. The Trudeau Liberal government isn’t just facing weeks of more damaging evidence with a loser communications strategy. An election is seven months away. Based on polls today, the most likely outcome of is some sort of minority Parliament. And that opens the door to the justice committee—even if the Liberals continue to govern—investigating the scandal fully, calling witnesses and issuing subpoenas.

Those who are loyal to their political principles know that defending what’s not defendable isn’t just a fool’s strategy. It’s political tragedy. Mistakes made can’t be unmade. No amount of spin annihilates them. The true test of political principle and loyalty isn’t telling a leader he’s always right, it’s telling him when he’s wrong. For Liberals, it’s that time now.

We’ve all seen the video of the Viking Sky cruise-ship disaster.

The water rushing in. The chaotic scenes from the bow as the ship is tossed to-and-fro. The helpless tub, dead in its tracks, threatening to crash on the rocks.

Ah, yes. The Leaky Ship Liberal.

Perilously listing. Its passengers screaming for help. A showpiece of negligence and neglect, going nowhere fast.

With Captain Trudeau asleep at the wheel and his first mate Lametti lounging as it leaks. Both are completely confounded by the sudden turn of events that has set their once proud and seemingly invincible ship-of-state reeling.

Holy crap. Now we learn that the former chair of the Liberal Agency of Canada audit committee is bolstering calls for a public inquiry into the LavScam debacle.

Do they even know how ridiculous they look, trying to maintain a stiff upper lip while doing diddly squat to respond to their government’s latest self-inflicted catastrophe?

Do they have the faintest clue how inept, insensitive, and foolhardy they appear in posing as mere bystanders in the accident-in-the-making in the name of the partisan flag now in tatters?

I am referring of course to the appalling attempt by some unknown miscreant to discredit former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould by leaking confidential information aimed at painting Chief Justice Glenn Joyal of the Manitoba Court of Queen’s Bench as an avowed enemy of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

If you are not yet quite up to speed on that fiasco—perhaps, because you’ve been too busy throwing up from the other endless sickening swells in the LavScam disaster—you can learn all about it here, here and here.

The attacks on Justice Joyal were vicious, malicious, and possibly criminal in their motivation, in their abuse of power and position, and in their potentially defamatory content and design.

They were enough to prompt him to respond with remarkable self-restraint, “I fear that someone is using my previous candidacy to the Supreme Court of Canada to further an agenda unrelated to the appointment process. This is wrong.”

They were enough to prompt Conservative MP Lisa Raitt to write to Marc Giroux, Commissioner for Federal Judicial Affairs, urging him to investigate the matter.

He responded by stressing that “The release of any such confidential information is wholly inappropriate,” but that “in light of [his] particular role and [its] enabling statute, he is “not in a position to accede to [Raitt’s] request to investigate”.

The deputy leader of the Conservatives, Lisa Raitt, wants an investigation into the leak concerning the chief justice of the Manitoba Court of Appeal.

And what of the intended target of the Liberals’ scurrilous leaks intended to present her as a de facto anti-Liberal, whose own first choice as chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada was supposedly someone who stood to undermine Trudeau’s father’s proudest legacy?

Puglaas has proved yet again that she is a woman of dignity, sound bearing, and righteous resolve who is not to be trifled with or so easily disparaged by those on her Liberal “team” (“more united than ever!”) who are so intent on doing her harm.

She forcefully responded with a call to investigate the breach of confidence, to find the leaker, and to hold him or her or them duly accountable. We should expect no less of her, as someone who could give current attorney general David Lametti lessons in what the office she held really demands in its leader.

“I do feel compelled to say that I have not—as some have suggested—been the source of any of these stories, nor have I ever authorized any person to speak on my behalf,” she said.

“I strongly condemn anyone who would speak about or provide information on such sensitive matters. Any commentary/reporting in this regard with respect to a SCC [Supreme Court of Canada] appointment(s) could compromise the integrity of the appointments process, our institutions and potentially sitting justices.”

And JWR and Raitt were far from the only persons sending out an SOS.

Others called out the nefarious leakers and urged the prime minister and Lametti to act.

The Canadian Bar Association offered this condemnation:

“There is a process to get informed input about the merits of the applicants. It rightly goes on behind closed doors. Keeping the deliberations confidential respects the privacy of applicants and guards against interference,” said CBA president Ray Adlington.

“Breaching confidentiality by releasing the names and commenting on the suitability of the other applicants after the appointment demeans the selection process and ultimately all those who hold the office of judge.”

The Law Society of Manitoba issued this statement:

“The Law Society of Manitoba is very concerned when circumstances arise that will weaken the public’s confidence in the administration of justice. A highly confidential process has been established to encourage the best and brightest candidates to put their names forward for appointment to all levels of courts.

“The integrity of that process is called into question when the confidentiality of deliberations and discussions about candidates appears not to have been maintained.

“Confidentiality is critical to protecting the reputation of all applicants including sitting judges, who are not able to respond to unjust criticism. The aspersions cast in recent media reports on Chief Justice Glenn Joyal of the Manitoba Court of Queen’s Bench represent an unwarranted attack on a distinguished judicial career.”

Oh, yes. Trudeau’s leakers also had no compunctions about compromising CTV’s journalistic best interests in choosing that esteemed forum as the most suitable outlet for their spurious counter-rationale for JWR’s supposed longstanding friction with the prime minister.

A false twist on the true treachery, as it were, that was supposed create new cover for Trudeau’s firing of the main person who could be trusted to protect the rule of law and the independence of her office as Canada’s first Indigenous attorney general.

David Lametti was sworn in as attorney general and justice minister at Rideau Hall as Justin Trudeau looked on. Adam Scotti/Prime Minister's Office

Yet despite that crescendo of outrage crying out for action, echoed by so many pundits, columnists, and others, what have we heard in response from Trudeau and Lametti?

After three days, no less?

Absolutely nothing of hard consequence.

Neither Trudeau nor Lametti apparently have any intention of investigating that wanton breach of public trust.

They have so far failed to take any action to investigate that egregious violation of personal privacy and that calculated smear on a sitting justice and on JWR, which is at its core yet another deliberate affront to justice.

Lametti’s Twitter response was pathetic.

It was as weak as Trudeau’s mealy-mouthed prattle that could be interpreted as he damn well knows or suspects that the leaks came from within his own office. And it seems he won’t be doing anything to try to identify and potentially prosecute the person(s) responsible.

Video of Raitt demands investigation into SCC appointment leaks Watch Lisa Raitt tell CTV why she thinks there needs to be an investigation.

This, from the guy who only last month waxed on about his father’s deep commitment to justice.

Who bleated that “those principles of justice are fundamental to me in what we are as a country, what we want to be as a society. And I have spent my entire political career fighting for justice and for people … the SNC-Lavalin file was not an exception.”

Some fight. He has done more in his single term in office to erode Canadians’ confidence in justice and the rule of law than any other prime minister in living memory.

Meanwhile, the whole Liberal crew hides behind the ludicrous tweets of Sheila Copps, who seems to be quite comfortable debasing herself with no end of attacks aimed at discrediting JWR and former treasury board president Jane Philpott and driving them both out of caucus.

The party that once held itself above all others as a moral force of international repute is now a rudderless vessle awash in its own bilge water.

It doesn’t look, act, or smell anything like its former “renewed” post-Adscam, self. And that won’t change as long as the guy with the real dirt on his hands is at the helm.

His arrogance knows no bounds, as he demonstrated yet again at the Liberal fundraiser in which he laughed off protesters from the Grassy Narrows First Nation who were concerned about mercury contamination in their communities with the sarcastic dismissal: “Thank you very much for your donation tonight. I really appreciate the donation to the Liberal Party of Canada.”

This is what it’s come to, really? Making jokes aimed at disparaging Indigenous peoples whose health is being threatened by mercury poisoning and tainted water supplies that successive governments have done nothing about?

Yeah, that’ll go a long way to advancing the goal of reconciliation.

Despite his belated apology after getting pounded by all who watched the clip, that type of “leadership” goes a long to explaining why Trudeau’s approval rating is now lower than Donald Trump’s, according to one new poll.

I say again, it ought to be Trudeau who walks the plank if his battered ship is to have any chance of winning back the public confidence needed to convince Canadians it’s safe to ride for another term in government.

And if the contrast between Puglaas and Lametti previously flattered the former, the latter is now also looking like he might be unworthy of the independent office that he was invited to uphold.

Get off your sorry butt and at least pretend that you are not so afraid to offend your sinking captain by getting to the bottom of this matter that was so wrongly initiated under his watch and in his perceived partisan interests.

Like the greater LavScam scandal that gave rise to this new wrongdoing, this fiasco threatens to corrode and degrade all it touches in its filthy wake.

The NDP’s standard bearer in the riding will be selected on Saturday.

The byelection already features an interesting cast of characters, including a jilted Conservative who lost a bid for her party’s candidacy and jumped to Maxime Bernier’s Peoples Party of Canada (PPC); a Green candidate who had a falling out with the NDP ahead of the last federal election; and a Liberal Indigenous candidate with as big a profile as Jody Wilson-Raybould when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recruited her for the Liberals in 2015.

Singh, who took a seat in the House of Commons for the first time last week after winning his own byelection in the greater Vancouver riding of Burnaby South last month, will greet the NDP candidate in Nanaimo on Sunday, his office told iPolitics.

A roster of four NDP candidates suggests the New Democrat’s confidence in the riding, despite a late entry into the race and a hike in Green Party support in the past years. Prime Minister Trudeau announced the byelection on March 24.

A day after Trudeau set the byelection date, he surfaced in Nanaimo to circulate and draw attention to a star Liberal candidate, who the party had announced only a week earlier. That candidate, Michelle Corfield, is a prominent and highly successful Indigenous leader who holds a doctorate from Simon Fraser University’s Beedie School of Business.

Corfield is also chair of the Nanaimo Port Authority, chair of the Legislative Council of Ucluelet First Nation and a founding member of a settlement trust at Ucluelet First Nation on the western coast of Vancouver Island. Corfield is an executive resident at the Beedie School’s Indigenous Business and Economic Development Knowledge Exchange.

Despite the credentials of his party’s candidate, or perhaps to ensure Corfield was the one in the limelight during an ongoing confrontation between Trudeau and one of his star 2015 candidates, Vancouver Liberal MP and former justice minister Wilson-Raybould, Trudeau declined to take questions from local news media.

Even with as prominent a candidate as Corfield, the Liberal party faces an uphill battle toward May 6.

Vancouver Island resisted the Liberal wave of 2015, voting in New Democrats in six of the island’s seven federal electoral districts. The seventh, Saanich—Gulf Islands, was won by Green Party Leader Elizabeth May for her second term in the House of Commons.

The contests were close and Angus Reid Institute’s polling analyst Shachi Kurl notes that Vancouver Island has been a tug-of-war between New Democrats and Conservatives over the past years.

“The island has a tendency to swing orange or blue,” Kurl said in a phone interview from her Vancouver office.

Nanaimo News Bulletin reporter Nicholas Pescod says he expects the NDP will continue to hold Nanaimo—Ladysmith. “I suspect the NDP will do well,” he said in a telephone interview from the News Bulletin newsroom.

Kurl noted low-turnout byelections can hinge on local organization, for which the NDP is famous in B.C.

Nanaimo—Ladysmith was left vacant after popular former NDP MP Sheila Malcolmson, announced last fall that she was making the jump to provincial politics. She resigned her Commons seat on Jan. 2 to contest and win a byelection in the provincial electoral district of Nanaimo. That Jan. 30 byelection was crucial for the survival of the province’s NDP coalition government.

For the May 6 federal byelection, the NDP field of four candidates also includes a prominent Indigenous candidate, Bob Chamberlin, who is vice-president of the long-established Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs and chief councillor with the Kwikwasutinuxw Haxwa’mis First Nation at the north end of Vancouver Island.

The other three NDP hopefuls include Lauren Sample, a former constituency assistant to Malcolmson, a past president of Nanaimo Pride, and a women’s rights advocate; Maeve O’Byrne, a founder of the Nanaimo and District Hospital Foundation who coaches volunteers working in refugee camps; and Fred Statham, whose electoral experience includes two attempts at election to Nanaimo city council.

The nominated field for other parties is just as unique.

The Green Party and Conservative candidates launched their nomination bids last fall, after Malcolmson announced she would not seek re-election federally.

Green candidate Paul Manly, who came third against Malcolmson in 2015, was acclaimed as the Green candidate on Feb. 3, after launching his nomination campaign last Oct. 25. According to commenters on a Reddit forum and other media, Manly tried to contest the NDP riding’s general election nomination in 2015, but claimed later his candidacy was rejected because he protested Israel’s treatment of his father, former NDP MP Jim Manley, who was arrested after taking part in an attempt to breach Israel’s 2012 sea blockade of the Gaza Strip.

The nominated Conservative candidate for the byelection, Sun Life office manager John Hirst, won his nomination on Nov. 17 last year. His opponent for the Tory nomination, Jennifer Clarke, was picked up to run for the PPC.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Ben Nelms The prime minister fired off a flurry of verbal jabs at Conservative Party leader ...","VANCOUVER — Justin Trudeau delivered a feisty, campaign-style speech in Vancouver-Kingsway Sunday night as he introduced former TV news anchor Tamara Taggart as the riding’s Liberal candidate in the fall federal election.

The prime minister fired off a flurry of verbal jabs at Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer, and also former prime minister Stephen Harper, giving a glimpse of what could be a heated campaign for the October election.

“Investing in people and communities is the way to grow the economy. Stephen Harper and the Conservatives still don’t get it. Andrew Sheer doesn’t get it either,” he said to a gym full of enthusiastic supporters.

“Under Stephen Harper, Canada had the worst growth rate we’d had since the depths of the Great Depression under R. B. Bennett.”

Trudeau then accused Sheer’s Conservatives of hoping to continue Harper’s policies by giving tax breaks to the wealthy while cutting programs for the middle and lower classes.

“They still think the way to create economic growth for everyone is to cut programs and give advantages and benefits to the wealthiest,” he said. “Well, that doesn’t trickle down to anyone and it didn’t work for 10 years.”

Trudeau pitched the upcoming election as an opportunity for all Canadians to step up and start talking about the kind of country they want to leave for their children and grandchildren.

“Do we want to invest in the middle class — shine on the world stage,” he asked, before warning that Canada “is seeing the rise of populism, aggressive, fear-based politics, just like the rest of the world.”

The crowd roared its approval when the prime minister suggested the best way to counter divisive populism is by recruiting “strong, compassionate people who’ve focused their lives on bringing people together and on empowering people.”

He lauded Taggart as one of those people from all walks of Canadian life who have invested in their communities in various ways to grow the economy, respond to the challenges of climate change and put Canada on the world stage.

Taggart admitted feeling a bit overwhelmed and emotional at being on stage, especially seeing her children holding up signs that read, “Team Tamara.”

The Order of British Columbia recipient said she wants to be the people’s voice in Ottawa, adding that her media career made her a good listener.

While Taggart steered clear of talking about the specifics of her campaign platform at the event, she has previously said that she wants to focus on affordable housing, protecting the environment while boosting the economy, and women’s health and safety.

She’s likely to face a tough challenge in Vancouver-Kingsway, which has been held by New Democrat MP Don Davies since 2008.

The rally, a nomination meeting for MacLauchlan in his home riding of District 8 Stanhope-Marshfield, had more of a feel of a campaign launch than the Liberal meeting Tuesday night, where MacLauchlan announced the beginning of P.E.I.’s election season.

At the Tuesday night meeting, a nomination for longtime Liberal MLA Richard Brown, MacLauchlan called the Progressive Conservative party of Dennis King a “party that practices division.” He also said the Green party was “untested” and referred to leader Peter Bevan-Baker as a “career politician”.

By contrast, Friday night MacLauchlan spoke about his feelings of pride for the record of his government and struck a hopeful tone.

""This is all a family affair, effectively, what we're doing here tonight, from the front to the back of the room,"" MacLauchlan said.

""People have worked together with their hearts and their commitment and with their hard work and vision for a bright future for Prince Edward Island. And that's what we stand for, folks.""

In the gymnasium of L.M. Montgomery Elementary School, MacLauchlan spoke for close to a half hour in front of a crowd of about 260 Liberal supporters.

Prior to MacLauchlan’s speech, each of MacLauchlan’s 26 candidate was called to the stage one by one. Supporters, who chanted “four more years,” bore red T-shirts with the name of their local candidate on their back.

Bobbi-Lynn Gaudet, an educational assistant and mother of four, seconds the nomination of Wade MacLauchlan on Friday night. MacLauchlan was officially nominated as the candidate for Stanhope-Marshfield.

Bobbi-Lynn Gaudet seconded the nomination of MacLauchlan as the Stanhope-Marshfield candidate. She said she was introduced to MacLauchlan by Roxanne Carter-Thompson. Carter-Thompson is the executive director of the Adventure Group, a local non-profit organization that offers supportive programming for marginalized youth and adults. She is also the Liberal candidate for Charlottetown-Belvedere

""Thanks to Wade and this Liberal team, the Adventure Group is now receiving the most financial support for these programs that they ever have,"" Gaudet said.

""This means the world to me as I am a former graduate of the program.""

The audience was also shown a new campaign TV spot on a projection screen. The ad features MacLauchlan describing attending a small schoolhouse in Stanhope as a child.

""There were five students in our Grade 1 class. In typical P.E.I. fashion, three of us were first cousins,"" MacLauchlan says in a voice-over.

""We learned a lot from our teachers, from our families and community and from each other. Most of all, we learned that getting ahead was possible, that if we all worked together, we not only could do well, but should do well.""

The spot outlined what have been the twin themes of the Liberal campaign so far – the MacLauchlan government’s record on economic management and his pledge for better social programs for the poor and middle class.

MacLauchlan has trailed Green Leader Peter Bevan-Baker in recent opinion polls. Bevan-Baker has been ranked as Islanders’ preferred choice for premier in opinion polling for more than two years.

With MacLauchlan’s nomination, all Liberal candidates have been officially been nominated.

Mr. Turtle said the Prime Minister’s dismissive remarks to protesters, Ottawa’s treatment of former minister Jody Wilson-Raybould and a general sense of inaction on Indigenous issues are producing widespread disappointment with the Liberal government.

“Looking at the whole picture … I would say that the Prime Minister has lost confidence with a majority of the native people,” he said in an interview with The Globe and Mail Friday.

Mr. Turtle said the Prime Minister’s reaction to the protesters this week “felt like an insult” and he urged Mr. Trudeau to do more than apologize.

“We acknowledge the apology, but that’s about it. I guess I would say actions speak louder than words. I’ve been asking him to come to Grassy Narrows to visit our community and he’s always brushed it aside, so I guess if he started showing some action, then I would be more impressed,"" he said.

Mr. Turtle raised the issue of Ms. Wilson-Raybould, the former attorney-general who resigned from cabinet in February, and has accused the Prime Minister’s Office of applying inappropriate pressure in relation to a criminal prosecution. Ms. Wilson-Raybould, a former regional chief of the Assembly of First Nations, also expressed frustration last fall with her government’s lack of progress on Indigenous files.

“It’s just the way he handled it,"" Mr. Turtle said. “In terms of reconciliation, [Mr. Trudeau] should have done his best to accommodate her.”

Francis Kavanaugh, Grand Chief of Grand Council Treaty #3, which includes Grassy Narrows and 27 other First Nations, said Mr. Trudeau hasn’t lived up to the expectations set by the Liberals in 2015.

“I’m just very, very disappointed. I had high hopes when he first became the Prime Minister. He ran on a platform of reconciliation – he was going to fix this, he was going to fix that – and I’m just starting to think that he’s a liar,” he said Friday in a phone interview.

Health problems facing residents of Grassy Narrows and neighbouring Wabaseemoong in northwestern Ontario were the focus of a protest that disrupted a speech Mr. Trudeau was delivering Wednesday evening in Toronto at a Liberal Party fundraising event.

When two protesters in the room shouted out that the people of Grassy Narrows are suffering from mercury poisoning and that his government had promised to do something, Mr. Trudeau dismissed them.

“I really appreciate the donation to the Liberal Party of Canada,” Mr. Trudeau replied as the first of the two protesters was escorted away. The audience of donors who contributed $1,500 to the party cheered.

Video of Mr. Trudeau’s response spread quickly online, prompting widespread condemnation from First Nations leaders and others.

Mr. Trudeau apologized Thursday morning in Halifax, saying he had showed “a lack of respect.”

Members of both communities have long experienced health problems linked to toxins released into the river system in the 1960s by a paper mill in Dryden, Ont. The contamination affected the local fish population − a regular source of food and commerce. The waters remain contaminated decades later.

Grassy Narrows and Wabaseemoong are waiting on the federal and Ontario governments to deliver on two key promises that were both made in 2017: a provincial pledge to clean up the contamination and a federal promise to build a new health facility to treat patients affected by mercury.

The Ontario Liberal government’s 2017 announcement promised to place $85-million in a trust fund to pay for cleaning up the mercury contamination in the region. A spokesperson for the current Progressive Conservative government said officials continue to work with the communities on how to spend the money set aside for remediation. However, no firm project plans have been announced.

From the federal government, then-Indigenous services minister Jane Philpott promised in November, 2017, that a specialized health facility would be built in the area to serve people affected by mercury poisoning.

The federal government is assuming responsibility for building a facility, but is looking for provincial help in areas such as health-care staffing.

Indigenous Services Canada received a draft feasibility study for the treatment centre on Nov. 28, 2018, which covered issues such as location, design and estimated operational costs.

Federal Indigenous Services Minister Seamus O’Regan said in a statement that the department continues to work with the communities and the province on plans.

The protester was quickly rushed out of the room by security, but the prime minister had a parting shot.

By David Ljunggren

OTTAWA (Reuters) - A former cabinet member at the heart of a crisis that could cost Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau his job on Friday released documents to back up her case that she had been pressured to help a large corporation avoid a corruption trial.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations that officials inappropriately leaned on former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to ensure construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc escaped a trial by paying a fine instead.

The crisis may well threaten Trudeau's reelection chances in a vote this October. Polls show his center-left Liberals, who as recently as January looked certain to win, could lose to the official opposition Conservatives.

Wilson-Raybould made public around 40 pages of documents revealing more details of what she said were attempts by officials to force her change her mind even after she insisted they desist.

Wilson-Raybould, who was demoted to veterans affairs minister in January and resigned the following month, first made the allegations in almost four hours of testimony to the House of Commons justice committee last month.

Trudeau says officials were trying to make Wilson-Raybould understand that thousands of jobs would be at risk if SNC-Lavalin were found guilty of bribing Libyan officials. Trudeau insists he and his team did nothing wrong.

The affair has so far cost Trudeau two high-profile female cabinet ministers, his closest personal aide and the head of the federal bureaucracy, Michael Wernick.

Wilson-Raybould included a recording of a phone call with Wernick last December in which he told her he was worried about ""a collision"" between her and Trudeau ""because he is pretty firm about this.""

Wilson-Raybould, who stressed she thought the call was inappropriate, told Wernick she was waiting ""for the other shoe to drop"" because she was under no illusion about how Trudeau ""gets things that he wants.""

Opposition legislators said the documents reinforced their demand for a public inquiry into the matter, something Trudeau says is not necessary.

""She is actually trying to speak truth to power, trying to say, 'You can't do this,' ... and it keeps happening,"" New Democratic Party parliamentarian Nathan Cullen told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.

Trudeau's office was not immediately available for comment.

The crisis is opening rifts inside the Liberal Party and some legislators want Wilson-Raybould to be kicked out of the parliamentary caucus, a move Trudeau has so far resisted.

78,Politics,2019-03-26T22:39:00.0000000Z,Toronto MP Nate Erskine-Smith was the only Liberal who spoke during the ethics committee meeting. Although Erskine-Smith has a track record of challenging the party line ... “No one in Canada believes that the justice committee is going to revisit ...,"OTTAWA — Liberal MPs have blocked the latest attempt to provide a venue for former cabinet ministers Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott to testify on the SNC-Lavalin affair.

On Tuesday, the battleground moved to the Commons ethics committee, which considered a Conservative motion to launch a study after the Liberal-dominated justice committee voted to conclude its investigation without calling more witnesses.

But the six Liberals on the ethics committee out-voted the Conservatives, who had two votes, and the NDP, who had one, and the motion failed.

Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre called the result especially ironic given recent comments from some Liberal MPs that it was time for Wilson-Raybould to just say her piece, rather than dribbling out news day-by-day. In the most prominent example, Liberal MP Judy Sgro said in a radio interview over the weekend that Wilson-Raybould needed to “either put up or shut up.”

“Today, the Liberals got together and voted against giving her the chance to say it,” Poilievre told reporters. “You know, this is a cavalcade of contradictions and cover-up.”

Parliament has been seized by the SNC-Lavalin affair for nearly two months now, after The Globe and Mail published an allegation on Feb. 7 that Wilson-Raybould had been politically pressured while attorney general to intervene and defer the corruption prosecution of the construction company.

Toronto MP Nate Erskine-Smith was the only Liberal who spoke during the ethics committee meeting. Although Erskine-Smith has a track record of challenging the party line, and had even previously cast a vote in favour of holding a public inquiry on the matter, he told the committee he felt launching the study was premature.

He noted Wilson-Raybould planned to provide a written submission to the justice committee that included further evidence, including text messages and emails.

“To me, it makes far more sense to see what is said in that public statement, to see how justice (committee) reacts to that, frankly, and whether they think any of that new information is something worth reconsidering their previous decision to close off their study,” Erskine-Smith said.

The NDP’s Tracey Ramsey rejected that, saying the Liberals blocked multiple attempts to keep the investigation going. “No one in Canada believes that the justice committee is going to revisit that,” she said. “There is absolutely no indication that they will entertain any further conversation.”

The Conservatives offered an amendment to call Wilson-Raybould only after her submission to the justice committee, but Erskine-Smith said it was too early to make decisions before seeing what she provided. It is not known when Wilson-Raybould will make her submission, but justice committee chair Anthony Housefather has said it will be made public.

Erskine-Smith also pointed out that Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion is already studying the matter, and said the committee should support Dion’s study rather than launch a parallel process.

Finally, Erskine-Smith argued that the waiver provided by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Wilson-Raybould on cabinet confidence privilege and solicitor-client privilege only covered testimony to the justice committee, not the ethics committee.

That waiver has become its own source of conflict, however. Wilson-Raybould has pointed out it does not apply to events after she was removed as justice minister, and opposition parties have demanded Trudeau provide an expanded waiver to cover that time period. Philpott also said in an interview in Maclean’s magazine last week that there was “much more to the story that should be told.”

This breach of the confidentiality of what is supposed to be a highly confidential judicial appointment process is serious enough to require an investigation on its own

After the meeting, while other Liberal MPs left without making their position clear, Erskine-Smith stayed and said he believed an expanded waiver may be necessary — depending what Wilson-Raybould’s evidence to the justice committee showed.

“If still, to get at the truth, there is additional information that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott need to provide that they are unable to provide because of the confines of the existing waiver, then yes, to get at the truth there should be a broadening of that waiver,” he said.

He said he believed that was only a fair position, given the comments from some of his colleagues that “we should get all of this information out in the open as quickly as possible and deal with it and move on.”

Both the Conservatives and NDP — and even Erskine-Smith — condemned two stories that came out Monday that contained leaks about the Supreme Court of Canada appointment process. The stories cited confidential sources to allege that tension had arisen between Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould when she recommended the appointment of Glenn Joyal, a Manitoba judge who Trudeau felt to be too conservative.

“This breach of the confidentiality of what is supposed to be a highly confidential judicial appointment process is serious enough to require an investigation on its own,” said Conservative MP Peter Kent during the meeting.

Speaking earlier in the day, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau did not respond directly when asked by a reporter whether his office leaked the story.

“Canadians can have confidence in our government’s respect for the institutions, for the Supreme Court,” he said. “Canadians have confidence in the strength of our judiciary in this country. And I have no further comment to make on this issue.”

Wilkinson starts by saying “British Columbians have seen right through Premier Horgan’s last minute “public consultation” on caribou recovery efforts. It is clear that staging a half-hearted public engagement was the only thing the NDP deemed necessary to move forward with their pre-determined plan. Forget listening to local residents with years of experience and deep knowledge of the wildlife and land base, this sham consultation is meant simply to placate every rural and northern British Columbian who lives, works, and plays in the backcountry while ignoring their voices.”

The B.C. Government shared in a press release Tuesday, March 26th, 2019 they have scheduled community engagement sessions allowing the public to provide their feedback on two draft agreements to conserve southern mountain caribou populations.

“Thankfully, nobody is buying it. For months, regional districts and provincial MLAs begged the provincial government to hold meaningful public consultations on how British Columbia would work with Ottawa to put together an effective plan to increase the dwindling caribou population. Despite promises to engage the public, the Horgan government announced that a draft plan had been reached between the province, some First Nations, and the federal government before any consultation occurred. With a draft plan already agreed to, the NDP declared a short five-week consultation period ending on April 25th only a few days before Ottawa’s deadline.

It is said that staff from the Provincial and Federal Governments as well as the Saulteau and West Moberly First Nations will share information about the draft agreements and will answer questions.

Wilkinson shares his concern of this plan will have a major impact on the forest, mining, and tourism industries, noting recreational users may also find themselves unable to access the backcountry as a result.

“We all want caribou numbers to rebound to a healthy level, but this can only be achieved if the public becomes an active part of the conversation. The fact that local knowledge and on-the-ground experience has been so overlooked, and only brought into the picture as a token afterthought once the plan had already been drafted, should trouble any observer,” said Wilkinson

Local MLAs are voicing their concerns about the plan for public consultation;

MLA for Peace River South, Mike Bernier, says he is concerned that the Government took a long time to release a draft and will not provide a long enough time frame for public consultation on the agreement.

Peace River North MLA, Dan Davies, echos the concerns that Bernier has on the issue saying that the Government is not providing enough time for public consultation on the draft and that stakeholders should have been included in the process.

When Donald Trump was elected in 2016, many of us Canadians wagged our fingers smugly at our southern neighbour. “What were they thinking?” we said to one another in line at Tim Hortons. We spent the next year or so glued to CNN, more captivated by American politics than what’s happening here.

We might have wanted to pay more attention.

The tide in the Great White North appears to be shifting right — but not in the way we’re used to. This isn’t a typical liberal-conservative tug-o-war, the ebb and flow we’ve seen throughout election cycles. This new movement is one that has already swept through Hungary, Poland, the U.S., it’s fuelled Brexit in the U.K. and has seen the rise of the far-right party Alternative for Germany, who have been compared to the Nazi regime. And it’s tilted so far to the right that it threatens to upend our democracy and the very liberties we’ve fought for.

While conservatives have historically called for less government regulation, lower taxes and a stronger military, today’s Canadian right-wing politics has rebranded itself to include more visible intolerance. Bigotry isn’t just bubbling under the surface these days, it’s out in the open and proudly displayed for when the guests come over.

This ugly, newfound boldness threatens to dominate the next federal election, impacting not only the world’s view of us a fair, diverse and welcoming country, but also the lives of all marginalized Canadians. That keeps me up at night.

As a gay mother with a trans child in the Ontario school system, and as a human rights advocate who spends a lot of time on social media, I’m on the receiving end of a lot of messages from people who think it’s “about time” politicians start standing up to “special interest groups.” We’ve been coddled for too long, they say, and we don’t deserve special treatment. They mock, namecall and outright threaten those of us who fight for the rights of marginalized people to be preserved. They’ve always done this, of course, but their voices, now embolded by the very politicians and public figures they support, are growing in number and getting angrier. I’ve had to file two police reports after my life was threatened — and those are only the incidents I reported.



This swing to the populist right is both in our face and insidious. Donald Trump might be loud and brash, but his win was unexpected by most. We surveyed the damage from up north, thinking it couldn’t possibly happen here. Surely, Canadians know better. We didn’t.

Modern populism has grown quietly, from the pages of right-wing websites to the birth of new neo-fascist groups such as the Proud Boys, now designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Support for the populism movement gained traction through one protest, one meeting, and one tweet at a time. Now it’s loud and it’s everywhere. It unseated Premier Kathleen Wynne and her Ontario government, with Premier Doug Ford and the Conservatives promising little more than a buck-a-beer and the end of teaching gender identity in schools.

And then, in October 2018, Premier Ford met privately with university professor Jordan Peterson. While the premier openly discussed other meetings that had taken place around that time, the public only learned of this one after the CBC obtained his itinerary through a freedom of information request.

Wildly popular in some right-wing circles, Peterson’s views have been slammed as retrograde, problematic and dangerous. He became well-known after taking a stand against using trans people’s chosen pronouns, claiming being forced to do so is an attack on free speech. He argued vehemently against the federal Liberal government’s now-passed trans rights bill, speaking in front of the senate committee overseeing the bill, and warned his followers about the dangers of “compelled speech.” Peterson has also proposed “enforced monogamy” as a way to reduce male violence and believes “crazy women” can’t be controlled by men because men can’t resort to physical violence against them.

Despite, or, perhaps, because of these views, Peterson, who teaches at the University of Toronto, earns tens of thousands of dollars monthly from his Patreon account, a site where fans can pledge financial support to creators of all stripes. These donations are given to him by admirers, many of them Canadians.

Ford, meanwhile, campaigned heavily on the removal of Ontario’s most current incarnation of the sex-ed curriculum, and followed through — a move that has earned much criticism and more than one lawsuit. However, it was also, in part, what earned his party a majority government. A slew of Ontarians has proudly come out in support of Ford’s policies, including the removal of mandatory student funding for certain college and university services, such as pride centres.

A week before meeting with Premier Ford, Peterson had spoken out in a tweet against the Ontario Human Rights Commission, claiming it to be the most “dangerous” organization in Canada, and calling for the Ford government to abolish it. Peterson has previously said he doesn’t agree with the OHRC’s support of gender identity and gender expression. The OHRC had just joined the legal fight against the Ontario provincial government’s removal of the sex-ed curriculum, which covered LGBTQ+ issues, consent and cyber-bullying.

The Ontario Human Rights Commission does exactly what the name implies: using the Ontario Human Rights Code as its guide, it strives to protect all Ontarians from discrimination and harassment. Those who are fiscally-minded might also appreciate how the OHRC first tries to resolve issues between parties out of court, taking the less-expensive mediation approach. It is not the country’s most dangerous organization, but its dismantling could certainly be very dangerous.

The timing of this secret meeting should ring alarm bells for liberals and conservatives alike. Protecting human rights is, after all, supposed to be a closely-held Canadian value.

Trump’s 2016 victory was a dog whistle for bigotry that reached the ears of Canadians. Doug Ford has proven Ontario will welcome similar politics, while Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada, a federal right-wing party formed in 2018, has over 30,000 members and a social media presence that speaks out against “political correctness” and “diversity nonsense.”

Taking a page from the Yellow Vest movement in France, the Facebook group “Yellow Vests Canada” has more than 100,000 members. What began as a place to organize protests around the country quickly became a spot where anti-Liberal sentiments and memes are circulated around the clock, several going so far as to call for the Prime Minister’s death. Immigration is regularly condemned, and Islamophobia is dismissed as a made-up word.

While some of the most offensive posts have been removed over recent weeks, the views are still crystal clear. This group isn’t just anti-tax and pro-oil, it’s filled to the brim with intolerance. This message is consistent throughout provincial groups as well, such as BC Proud, Alberta Proud and Ontario Proud. With a combined total of hundreds of thousands of members in these groups, cries of fake news and the danger of refugees abound.

These sentiments don’t just live online.

Statistics Canada reported hate crimes had reached historically high levels in 2017, rising 47 per cent over the previous year, with Ontario and Quebec leading the pack on reported incidents. Black, Jewish and Muslim people were targeted most. Quebec saw a 50 per cent increase in hate crimes overall, and crimes against Muslims tripled between 2016 and 2017. In January of 2017, a shooter killed six men and injured several others in a Quebec City Mosque. Meanwhile, Ontario saw a 207 per cent increase in hate crimes against Muslims, and an 84 per cent increase against Black people. Crimes against LGBTQ+ people have also climbed. Swastikas have been spray painted on synagogues and other buildings across the country. Intolerance is growing.

Populism has many sources. Perhaps there are people who are tired of looking inward and are now lashing outward. Maybe, for some, it’s simpler to blame immigrants when they can’t find work than the companies who cut minimum wage jobs and still pay their executives millions in bonuses. Maybe it’s easier to find a scapegoat, to call someone like me a child abuser for supporting my transgender teen, than it is to grow and broaden our ideas of what’s normal.

Societal change can be hard and it can make people uncomfortable, but that’s a flimsy excuse for discrimination.

Intolerance has never gone away, it was simply out of fashion for a while. Now it’s back with a fresh new look and a boost from fake news and social media.

We should all care deeply about this frightening political shift and where it could take us.

I know I care, which is why I’m so scared about what’s happening in this country, and what’s yet to come.

Green Party’s three MLAs – with 83 of the 87 of the MLAs in favour of the legislation, its passage through the legislature is ensured.","83 of the 87 of the MLAs are in favour of the legislation

BC Liberal MLAs are joining forces with the governing NDP to assure that legislation that will guarantee tax breaks for the liquefied natural gas industry in B.C. will become law.

On Monday, the provincial government presented the legislation in the legislature, which immediately faced opposition by B.C. Green Party’s three MLAs – with 83 of the 87 of the MLAs in favour of the legislation, its passage through the legislature is ensured.

“British Columbians are counting on us to attract LNG investment to B.C. This legislation completes the process of creating a fiscal framework that invites investment while creating economic partnerships with Indigenous peoples and protecting our clean air, land and water,” said finance minister Carole James.

The tax breaks are part of a broader range of benefits for the LNG industry announced by premier John Horgan in March last year, including an exemption from provincial sales tax (PST) and being billed for electricity by BC Hydro at the same rate as other industrial users in B.C.

Making the announcement last year, Horgan said the breaks were conditional on a final investment decision (FID) before November 2018 – LNG Canada made its FID in October, a month before the deadline.

From January next year, the new natural gas tax credit will be available to qualifying LNG corporations, calculated at 3 per cent of the cost of natural gas. The tax credit can be used to reduce B.C.’s corporate income tax rate from 12 per cent to 9 per cent.

In addition, the PST break will save LNG Canada nearly $600 million during construction.

LNG Canada CEO Andy Calitz said the measures announced by Horgan last year provided LNG Canada’s joint venture participants with confidence that B.C. supported the project and facilitated its competitiveness against other LNG projects under development or in operations.

“The province’s support for LNG development will result in significant financial benefits over the 40-year operating life of the project. This includes operating performance payments, corporate income tax, carbon tax, royalty payments on gas, motor fuel tax, income tax from labour, PST, municipal tax and payments to First Nations,” said Calitz.

He said the benefits of the project were already beginning to show in B.C. in the form of jobs, training and skills development, social investments and the purchase of local goods along with utilizing B.C. services and trades.

“The value of LNG Canada’s financial contributions goes beyond the money that will become available to government to fund education, healthcare, childcare and the like – but also to the many individuals who will work in well paid skilled trades jobs, and the many apprentices that will begin their careers in the skilled trades working on the LNG Canada project,” added Calitz.

James said the LNG Canada project is currently rated as the cleanest LNG project in the world, despite the consortium’s decision to power its refrigeration and compression equipment by burning natural gas.

Weaver said an LNG plant in Louisiana is already moving to all-electric LNG production for export, meaning LNG Canada will not be the cleanest by the time it begins shipping in 2024.

James said as of December, there were 600 people working on the LNG Canada project, and more work on the pipeline route. Discussions continue with protesters who have built a camp on the route near Houston.

Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners Suddenly, New Attention for List of Harper-Era Abuses Traffic surges for Tyee’s 2015 compilation of 70 Tory law and ethics breaches.

That piece is “Harper: Serial Abuser of Power, The Evidence Compiled: The Tyee’s full, updated list of 70 Harper government assaults on democracy and the law.”

You can find it here.

The article lists dozens of serious abuses of power racked up by former prime minister Stephen Harper and his Conservatives from the time they formed government in 2006 until the date the article was published, Aug. 10, 2015.

The list was not concerned with Tory laws, policies or positions disagreeable to people whose politics don’t lean right.

Instead, The Tyee defined abuses of power to be the opposite of good government, acts ranging from “scams to smears, monkey-wrenching opponents to intimidating public servants… some offences are criminal, others just offend human decency.”

The article drew on suggestions from Tyee readers as well as journalists. Each carefully researched item in the list is linked to credible journalistic sources, including newspapers such as the National Post and the Globe and Mail whose editorial boards had backed the Conservatives in the previous election, and would do so in the fall of 2015.

The article quickly became one of The Tyee’s most read ever, and was one of the most widely read pieces by any news organization covering the federal election. After the contest was won by the Justin Trudeau-led Liberals, traffic for the article faded and it resided in The Tyee’s digital archives.

With another election coming, Trudeau and his party deny improper pressure was applied to former minister of justice and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould in hopes of stopping a criminal trial of Montreal-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board president Jane Pilpott, who say the political interference was real, have resigned from cabinet. Trudeau’s top advisor Gerald Butts and Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick have quit their posts, as well.

After Wilson-Raybould gave testimony to the House justice committee on Feb. 27, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh called for an independent investigation into the affair.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer was more aggressive, demanding that Trudeau step down.

Trudeau had “lost the moral authority to govern,” he charged, and was a “prime minister who allows his partisan, political motivations to overrule his duty to uphold the rule of law. A prime minister who doesn’t know where the Liberal Party ends and where the government of Canada begins.”

Perhaps not coincidentally, that’s when The Tyee’s rap sheet on the last Conservative government began gaining a lot of new readers.

In the past month, the piece has received more than 14,000 page views, a near 2,000-per-cent jump over this time last year. Its numbers topped almost all other Tyee stories this month.

Who is suddenly reading and sharing the article and why?

It’s not hard to imagine why members of both the federal Liberals and NDP would find it apt to promote. The Liberals could point to the bad record of the Conservatives as evidence they were just as scandal-plagued when in power, or more so. The NDP might offer the piece to people souring on the Liberals as proof their party offers a cleaner alternative to the Tories.

Scheer was a Conservative MP throughout the Harper government, rising high in its ranks before becoming House speaker. He was first elected as a Saskatchewan MP in 2004, after accusing his opponent of being soft on child pornography because, in Commons debate, he’d warned against censoring art such as Nabokov’s novel Lolita.

A recent tweet by Tyee web director Bryan Carney noted the article has been popular of late.

This four-year-old Harper power abuses story almost kept up with SNC-Lavalin stories in traffic last weekhttps://t.co/y7z2rcmTjF — Bryan Carney (@bpcarney) March 4, 2019

The story has never flatlined, but Carney points out that the day after Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, traffic began to ramp up. First, the hits came from Google.

Keywords like “did Stephen Harper break campaign rules”, “Harper + ethics violations”, “Harper government members with criminal convictions”, “Harper government scandals” and “what lies did Harper tell the Canadian people” started to show up from Google traffic.

Next, the traffic started to arrive from social media.

People posted reminders:

The LNG industry would pay the same income tax and BC Hydro rates as any other industry, the government said.

article continues below

But enabling legislation introduced today, March 25, on the government’s new LNG tax regime appears to give large projects like LNG Canada a subsidy in the form of a special tax break.

The legislation grants large projects that have project development agreements with the province – like LNG Canada – a special 3% tax credit on the cost of natural gas. This will bring the company’s corporate income tax rate down from 12% to 9%.

It appears smaller projects like Woodfibre LNG won’t be eligible for the tax break, since it only applies to projects that have signed agreements with the province.

Even before the legislation was tabled, Green Party Leader Andrew Weaver slammed the tax incentives being offered the industry as a “general sellout.”

He said the Green Party will not vote in favour of the legislation, which means the NDP government will need at least a few Liberal MLAs to vote in favour of it.

“I think it’s pretty clear the Greens will not vote in support of this legislation,” B.C. Finance Minister Carole James said in a press conference.

“But this is an important investment for British Columbia, and I think certainly the comments that I’ve heard from the BC Liberals show that they’re in support of LNG. You’ll have to ask (Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson) about that, but I expect that this legislation will go forward.”

Asked to defend what amounts to a subsidy, James said other industries also get special tax breaks.

""Whenever government takes a look at industry for British Columbia – whether we're talking about the film industry, whether we're talking about other industries – you take a look at how you can remain competitive to ensure that you continue to see continue to see investments in your province. That's exactly what we did with the LNG industry. We sat down with LNG Canada, we looked at how we could ensure our competitiveness as a province, which meant incentives...when it comes to the LNG tax credits.""

Business groups welcomed the new legislation for taxing the LNG industry.

“Today's announcement acknowledges the competitive realities facing many B.C. export industries,“ Greg D’Avignon, CEO of the Business Council of British Columbia, said in a press release.

The changes being made to the Liberal LNG tax regime not only eliminates a special LNG tax, it also offers the industry the same industrial rate for power that other industries pay, and it provides a $596 million deferral on PST on the project's capital costs.

The deferral applies to the capital spent on the LNG plant in Kitimat, export dock, storage facilities and work camps.

The company will only start paying PST back after the LNG plant in Kitimat is operating, or within seven years, whichever comes first, with payments starting out small and getting larger towards the end of the 20-year payback period. Other manufacturing facilities in B.C. get PST exemptions on capital investments, with no obligations to pay it back, government officials said in a technical briefing.

Despite the incentives being offered, the government estimates it will generate $23 billion in taxes and royalties over a 20-year period.

Under the NDP government's new CleanBC plan, LNG plants that are able to demonstrate that they meet or beat low emissions benchmarks, will also get a break on carbon taxes. They will still pay $30 per tonne. But as the carbon tax rises, they will be eligible for the incremental amount they pay to come back, if they demonstrate their plants meet or beat certain emissions intensity benchmarks.

Work is already underway in Kitimat and along the Coastal GasLink natural gas pipeline.

Author: Sean Rehaag, Associate Professor, Osgoode Hall Law School, York University, Canada

According to media reports, Bill Blair, Canada’s minister of border security, is attempting to close a loophole in the Canada-U.S. Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA).

The agreement allows Canada to send asylum-seekers back to the United States without hearing their refugee claims (and allows the U.S. the same option for those going in the other direction). The loophole is that the STCA only applies to asylum-seekers who present themselves at official land ports-of-entry.

Since President Donald Trump was elected, around 40,000 asylum seekers have used this loophole by crossing into Canada from the U.S. at places other than official ports-of-entry. They are not trying to sneak into Canada undetected. Rather, they cross the border irregularly to avoid being turned away under the STCA and then approach Canadian authorities to make refugee claims.

The number of irregular border-crossers has declined recently, with fewer than 1,000 in January 2019. What’s more, while the overall number of refugee claims made in Canada has been higher than usual in the past two years, it is not far off historical norms.

Nonetheless, the additional 40,000 refugee claims have produced pressures on the refugee determination system and on provincial social programs. There has also been political pushback, with calls from the Conservative party for the government to stem the flow.

However, closing the STCA loophole is a complicated proposition.

Blair reportedly wants irregular border-crossers to be taken to official ports-of-entry and processed as if they had presented themselves there directly. In other words, the STCA would apply both at official ports-of-entry and elsewhere.

To make this work, the U.S. would need to agree, which is the first complication.

More asylum-seekers come to Canada

The purpose of the STCA from a Canadian perspective was to force the U.S. to take responsibility for asylum-seekers who travel to Canada via the United States. Canada had long wanted the STCA because the flow of asylum-seekers is asymmetrical. Far more asylum-seekers come to Canada from the U.S. than the reverse.

For the same reason, the United States has long refused to agree to the STCA. That only changed after 9-11, when Canada offered the U.S. greater border security integration in exchange for the STCA.

Canada now wants to expand the STCA, so the question is: What will Canada have to give the U.S. to get them to agree?

One might expect quite a lot, given that Trump has shown little interest in taking steps that would result in thousands of asylum-seekers who would otherwise go to Canada remaining in the U.S.

The need for a quid pro quo raises a second complication. The STCA is being challenged in Canadian courts by human rights organizations who say that the U.S. is not safe for refugees and that the STCA violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Given the anti-refugee policies of the Trump administration, there is a good chance that courts will strike down the STCA. By negotiating expansions to the STCA without waiting to see whether the regime is upheld, there is a real risk that anything Canada gives to the U.S. in exchange will be for naught.

A third complication: Even if Canada gets the U.S. to agree to expand the STCA, and even if the regime is upheld by the courts, the impact of any expansion is likely to be both counterproductive and dangerous.

A dangerous incentive

If asylum-seekers who are intercepted at irregular border crossings are returned to the U.S., this will create a strong incentive for such asylum-seekers to cross the border without being intercepted.

Currently, irregular border crossings are manageable and organized. Most occur in a single, well-monitored location in Quebec. That crossing is not dangerous. Border officials and RCMP are present. Irregular border-crossers immediately enter into immigration and refugee processing, which includes health, criminality and security screening.

Other countries that have tried to stem flows of asylum-seekers by closing off safe and manageable routes have had a common experience. The flows do not stop but are instead diverted into more remote and hence more dangerous routes. Organized crime gets involved, bringing increased security risks and violence. The inevitable result is lost lives and decreased border security.

In the end, the political pressure on the government to be seen doing something on this file may outweigh these policy considerations. But politics lead to a fourth complication.

During the last federal election campaign, Justin Trudeau distinguished himself from former prime minister Stephen Harper partly through a more compassionate response to the Syrian refugee crisis and the death of Alan Kurdi — himself a tragic victim of cat-and-mouse games between smugglers and governments seeking to keep refugees at bay.

Shortly after Trump’s inauguration, Prime Minister Trudeau further sought the moral high ground when, in response to the president’s anti-refugee policies, he famously tweeted Canadians will welcome those fleeing persecution.

There is no way to close the STCA loophole without the Liberal party turning its back on those progressive values, on the eve of a federal election campaign.

In this context, attempting to expand the STCA may not only be bad policy, it may also be bad politics.

Reid polled the province in December 2013 after McNeil’s Liberal Party formed the government earlier that year.","Nova Scotia’s long-serving premier Stephen McNeil has the lowest approval rating of any premier in Canada, while Quebec’s François Legault is the most popular provincial head of government with roughly six-in-ten Quebeckers approving of him.

The figures come from a new poll released on Tuesday by the Angus Reid Institute.

The institute says Legault’s approval is likely a sign that he’s still enjoying a honeymoon period after the Coalition Avenir Quebec formed government in the wake of Quebec’s provincial election in October.

His support is statistically unchanged from Angus Reid’s poll in December, despite facing criticism over comments that there is no Islamophobia in Quebec and that his government plans to scrap a backlog of more than 40,000 immigration applicants.

Saskatchewan’s Scott Moe has essentially the same approval rating as Legault, with 59 per cent of 842 Saskatchewanians polled saying they approve of his stewardship of the province.

Angus Reid says Moe’s approval has received a seven per cent bump since he succeeded Brad Wall as premier last year.

British Columbia’s John Horgan is the only other premier whose approval remains above 50 per cent, with Horgan receiving 52 per cent of support from B.C. residents.

Horgan’s approval has increased nine per cent since December and ties his highest mark as premier, set in March 2018.

New Brunswick’s Blaine Higgs, Canada’s newest premier, sits one point below a 50 per cent approval rating.

Even with a minority government, the first in the province since the 1920s, Higgs’ approval has risen by nine points since December.

Higgs has recently introduced his first budget which was characterized as tightening the belt in the province in an effort to balance the province’s budget.

With an election on the horizon, Alberta’s Rachel Notley has experienced an increase in popularity for the fifth consecutive quarter.

Angus Reid attributes this to an increase in personal appeal despite being a long shot to retain control of the government when Alberta heads to the polls on April 16.

Manitoba’s Brian Pallister has also had his popularity rise, with it reaching the highest level since March 2017.

Angus Reid’s polling data indicates that 44 per cent of the Manitoba electorate currently approves of him.

McNeil at the bottom of the pack

McNeil’s approval has hit the lowest figure since Angus Reid polled the province in December 2013 after McNeil’s Liberal Party formed the government earlier that year.

Nova Scotia’s premier sits at only 24 per cent support among those polled. In 2013 he sat at 57 per cent approval.

Despite tabling his fourth straight balanced budget on Tuesday McNeil has received criticism for perceived failures to follow through on health-care improvements and allocating $22.3 million on a ferry between Yarmouth, N.S., and Bar Harbor, Maine.

Newfoundland’s Dwight Ball and Ontario’s Doug Ford round out the three premiers who have an approval rating below four-in-ten.

Ford’s approval has dropped four points this quarter to 38 per cent, following criticism of his government’s decision to increase class sizes and an overhaul to the province’s autism funding.

However, a recent ruling by Ontario’s integrity commissioner found that the premier didn’t break the rules that govern legislators when one of his close friends was hired as the province’s top cop last fall.

We hear a dug-in attorney-general insisting that the pressure being brought to bear on her to intervene with an eye to securing Lavalin a deferred prosecution agreement is completely inappropriate. She mentions in particular a meeting the day before between her chief of staff, Jessica Prince, and PMO head honchos Gerald Butts and Katie Telford, in which (per Prince’s notes) Butts said “there is no solution here that does not involve some interference,” and Telford said “we don’t want to debate legalities anymore.” She also mentions the very telephone call in question: “It is wrong,” she tells Wernick.

And we hear a clerk of the Privy Council who sounds genuinely professionally alarmed at the “collision” that he warns Wilson-Raybould is about to occur between her and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau if she sticks to her guns. He sounds flummoxed as to why he can’t break the impasse.

“People are talking past each other,” Wernick twice insists, which seems to be true: the PMO was talking about potential job losses and (per Wernick on the tape) a “signature firm” like Lavalin leaving Quebec so soon “after the Oshawa thing and what’s going on in Calgary.” The PMO just wanted Wilson-Raybould to use everything in her “legal toolbox” to see what could be done for poor Lavalin. Wilson-Raybould, meanwhile, was talking about the basic principle of prosecutorial independence. The PMO seemed not to understand how pressuring her to open her legal toolbox could possibly pose a threat to that.

Most striking is Wilson-Raybould’s insistence that her advice would actually protect the prime minister. She grants she could intercede with the director of public prosecutions, who had decided against granting Lavalin the DPA, but that she would have to announce it in the Canada Gazette. And in her view, she says, that would look terrible.

“This goes far beyond saving jobs,” she tells Wernick. “This is about the integrity of the prime minister. There is no way that anybody would interpret (it) other than (as political) interference, if I was to step in.”

“I do not want anybody to misinterpret that I don’t care about those jobs,” she says. “But this is about the integrity of the government.”

She asks Wernick: “Does (Trudeau) understand the gravity of what this potentially could mean? … This is about interfering with one of our fundamental institutions. This is like breaching a constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence.”

“Well I don’t think he sees it as that,” Wernick meekly responds.

“Well then nobody’s explaining that to him, Michael!” she snaps back.

In recent weeks a certain subspecies of Liberal partisan has delighted in portraying Wilson-Raybould as a hapless political naïf. (This is by no means incompatible in the partisan mind with her being a conniving shrew intent on installing herself as prime minister.) But if we take her at her word here, based on what we’ve seen over the past month, it may well be true.

It has been a mortifying display

She wouldn’t be alone: A lot of us yokels assumed the sight of a Liberal prime minister and his justice minister mucking around to bail out a well-connected company that funnelled tens of thousands of dollars in illegal campaign donations to their party last decade, over some flamboyant alleged malfeasance that involved the enrichment of the Gaddafi regime, would be a really awful look.

How wrong we were. Not just Liberal partisans but ostensibly independent commentators and pundits have stood on line to defend such meddling as entirely appropriate, to demand Wilson-Raybould be banished from the Liberal caucus for her impudence, to grab hold of any alleged imperfection in her character to impugn her entire testimony, to suggest we turn a blind eye because much more terrible things are going on in other countries.

It has been a mortifying display. In a rational universe, what Wilson-Raybould revealed would lead to demands for wholesale change. Instead it seems to be further entrenching the status quo, and the demands are mostly for her to go away. That she hasn’t, against all good sense and reason, is to her credit.

Canada’s official opposition Conservative party, which opinion polls show could win an election in October, says Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has not done enough to help canola ...","Ottawa | Reuters — Canada on Thursday took a notably tougher line with China over its ban on Canadian imports of canola seed, saying Beijing had provided no scientific evidence to justify the move and was hurting its own reputation.

China, citing the discovery of pests, expanded its ban on canola seed imports on Tuesday to include shipments from a second major exporter, Viterra.

Viterra is owned by Glencore’s agricultural arm. Earlier this month, Beijing halted shipments from Richardson International, Canada’s top exporter of canola seed.

Canada’s Liberal government and China have been locked in a trade and political dispute since the chief financial officer of Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies was arrested in Vancouver last December on a U.S. extradition request.

China accounts for about 40 per cent of Canada’s canola seed, oil and meal exports, according to the Canola Council, with seed exports to China worth some $2.7 billion a year.

Canada’s official opposition Conservative party, which opinion polls show could win an election in October, says Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has not done enough to help canola farmers and is bungling ties with China.

“The restrictive measures imposed by China are said to be rooted in science. We have asked for the evidence,” Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said in a statement.

“To date, none has been supplied. We will keep pushing as hard as we can on this vital point,” added Goodale, an MP from Saskatchewan, Canada’s biggest canola-producing province by tonnage since 1990.

Trudeau said on Wednesday he was concerned about the ban and could send a delegation to Beijing. He met with Richardson executives on Tuesday.

Goodale, using sterner language, said “measures that defy science and contravene sound business and trading practices detract from the good reputation for reliability which all trading nations seek to maintain.”

The Chinese embassy was not immediately available for comment.

Canadian food inspection officials say they have found no problems with canola seed exports.

“We will intervene at the right level of seniority and intensity — scientifically, strategically and diplomatically — to have the best possible impact,” said Goodale.

Conservative legislators on Thursday sent a letter requesting an emergency meeting of the Commons agriculture committee on Friday.

“We fear that if this issue is not resolved expeditiously, farmers will suffer significantly because of the prime minister’s ongoing mishandling of the Canada-China relationship,” they said in the letter.

Let Jody Wilson-Raybould have her (additional) say. Stop muzzling her with cabinet confidence and solicitor-client privilege. Waive it.

Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners Suddenly, New Attention for List of Harper-Era Abuses Traffic surges for Tyee’s 2015 compilation of 70 Tory law and ethics breaches.

“The longer he continues this cover-up,” Bergen said of Trudeau, “the longer he moves heaven and earth to keep himself protected, the worse this gets for him.”

Does it get worse? Or will Canadians tire of the saga and move on, as the Liberals this week bet by moving to shut down the inquiry?

Martyn Brown, who as premier Gordon Campbell’s chief of staff handled scandals buffeting the B.C. government during the 2000s, thinks that this week Trudeau has moved closer to the brink of disaster. The heightened prospect of an RCMP investigation makes Trudeau an anchor sinking the party he once rescued with his leadership.

Now, says Brown, it’s time for Liberal insiders to convince Trudeau to step down.

More bad days for the PM

In one twist this week, Wilson-Raybould promised to dump a pile of more documents on the Justice Committee in order to prove her allegations of undue political interference are correct, even if she isn’t allowed to testify in person.

In another turn, Celina Caesar-Chavannes, who said she’d been bullied by a shouting Trudeau, left the Liberal caucus to sit as an independent MP.

Meanwhile, SNC-Lavalin’s CEO said Trudeau’s team is wrong to imply that his company asked to be spared a criminal trial or else it would move from Montreal with 9,000 Canadian jobs sacrificed.

But the biggest bombshell, in Brown’s view, was dropped by former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott, Trudeau’s other cabinet minister to resign in dismay over LavScam.

What Philpott had to say in her interview with Maclean’s magazine on March 21 proves she’d “gone rogue,” says Brown.

“I’m not accusing anybody of anything illegal or contrary to the Criminal Code,” emphasizes Brown. But Philpott raised enough questions to possibly prod the RCMP to launch an investigation, and that would mean a severe hit to Trudeau’s political fortunes.

On the phone with The Tyee March 21, Brown laid out his reasoning:

Philpott is “now basically saying in this interview with Maclean’s that Jody Wilson-Raybould was bullied, that there is much more to the story. And so she’s flatly contradicting [Trudeau’s] version of events.”

Philpott has given “new legs” to the demand by five previous attorneys general and the Tories for an RCMP investigation. In Maclean’s she makes it clear she could not remain in “solidarity with cabinet,” because she “felt that there was evidence of an attempt to politically interfere with the justice system in its work on the criminal trial that has been described by some as the most important and serious prosecution of corporate corruption in modern Canadian history.”

She also reveals that she raised deep concerns about the DPA file on SNC-Lavalin a full month before the affair became public.

She says this, Brown notes, as we find out the PMO’s claims about harm to the public interest if SNC-Lavalin were to be criminally prosecuted are baloney.

“What we need to know is, in this period, particularly after Jan. 14 when the shuffle took place, was cabinet misled by false threats or false information of the sort we’ve now learned about? That SNC was leaving Montreal, which [we know] now is patently untrue. Or that Canada was going to lose 9,000 jobs, which the present CEO now says was patently untrue. Was cabinet misled by that? Because if so, that would be a reason for the RCMP to investigate.”

The Mounties would be particularly interested in finding out, says Brown, “if false information was used to try to pressure Jody Wilson-Raybould to get her to politically intervene for something that anyone in government knew wasn’t true. Or if the government knew that it wasn’t true that jobs would be lost, that the company would move, as it was trying to suggest to her was the reason in the public interest, then the public interest argument goes out the window.

“That’s the only legal argument the government currently has. Even though by law they’re precluded in the Criminal Code from considering the national economic interest, they’re trying to couch it in this phrase, ‘the public interest,’ to say that because it was in the public interest, that’s why they could talk to her.

“But if the public interest argument is based on a lie, and they knew that, then all that you’re left with is a political motive, an electoral motive that would be self-serving. And that to me would raise questions of obstruction of justice, breach of trust, all sorts of things that the RCMP would suddenly be concerned with.

“I think that’s what’s really changed, the stakes have been elevated by both what the present CEO has said and what Philpott has said.”

Veteran of scandal management

Brown was chief of staff for premier Campbell on Dec. 28, 2003, the day RCMP officers arrived at the B.C. legislature and carted away boxes of evidence for what would become a years-long scandal involving the botched billion-dollar sell-off of the province’s public rail system.

Neither Campbell nor Brown was charged with any wrongdoing. But eight years later, Brown was the first witness called for the resulting trial, which ended with guilty pleas to fraud by two ministerial aides.

If Trudeau gets a knock on his door by the Mounties any time soon, he might want to give Brown a call for a bit of advice.

Then again, the PM likely won’t like what he hears. Brown, who writes a column for the Georgia Straight, declares in his latest that the Liberals’ best chance of winning the fall election is to “lance the boil” that is Trudeau.

As he told The Tyee in an email today, “The fear of losing Trudeau needs to be flipped on its head if left-leaning progressives want to minimize the chances of a Scheer victory this fall. The Liberals can now only hope to regain the moral high ground that is so vital for securing the values they purport to represent by replacing their leader. They can own the ethical hill they are now choosing to die upon by defending the indefensible by selecting a new leader who the heroines Wilson-Raybould and Philpott and Celina Caesar-Chavannes can all rally behind.”

Brown figures, “I am perhaps one of the first to suggest that Trudeau should be dumped by his caucus in their party’s political interest.”

As such, he joins a club that includes The Tyee’s Crawford Kilian who wrote a column published here March 5 headlined: “Trudeau’s Resignation Is the Party’s Only Hope.”

She also offers that she thinks all sides should be working across party lines to fix what she calls “fissures and weaknesses ...","OTTAWA – Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould was cautioned about a potential “collision” with the prime minister over the SNC-Lavalin file by outgoing Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, a newly-released audio recording reveals. This caution came a month before she was shuffled out of her role, and nearly two months before the scandal began unfolding publicly.

According to an audio recording of a conversation that the pair had, submitted to the House Justice Committee by Wilson-Raybould, Wernick said he was worried what might happen if Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould remained at “loggerheads” about whether or not to offer a deferred prosecution agreement to the Quebec engineering firm.

In the audio, Wilson-Raybould can be heard issuing repeated and stern warnings that senior officials pressuring her over the SNC-Lavalin case would “look like nothing but political interference” if the Quebec construction and engineering company were granted deferred prosecution. By the time of her recorded conversation with Wernick, Wilson-Raybould says she had already endured months of intense lobbying from such officials.

She said in the audio that she was absolutely confident in her decision -- to back the Director of Public Prosecutions’ decision not to grant the agreement and to continue pursuing the criminal charges -- and in response, Wernick said he was “worried about a collision then because he is pretty firm about this. I just saw him a few hours ago and this is really important to him.”

In a statement late Friday, Trudeau’s office said that he was “not briefed by the Clerk on his conversation with Jody Wilson-Raybould,” and that the PMO was “unaware of the full contents of this recording before today.”

The PMO statement reiterates that Trudeau wishes she would have gone to him directly about the matter, reinforcing his message that there “was clearly an erosion of trust over the past few months” between all key actors in this affair.

“I don't get the covert ops program or holding on to the tape for a convenient moment,” Wernick’s lawyer Frank Addario said in a statement, according to The Canadian Press. According to his lawyer, Wernick was not aware the call had been recorded until it was released on Friday.

“She was the chief legal officer for the country. She didn't give her tape to the RCMP. She didn't give it to the PM or the Ethics Commissioner. She didn't even give it to the committee when she first testified. Most peculiar,” CP quotes him as saying.

The 17-minute audio file was provided to all members of the House Justice Committee on Friday, as part of the new and supplementary evidence related to the SNC-Lavalin scandal that she handed over days ago.

The 43-pages of additional material also includes a 21-page written statement, as well as screen shots of text messages and copies of emails that she referenced during her initial testimony, adding more fodder to the continuously developing controversy that’s dominated political headlines for the last two months.

The secret recording is of a Dec. 19 phone call with Wernick that both parties have previously testified to. In the recording Wilson-Raybould can be heard saying that she was trying to protect Trudeau by issuing these cautions about prosecutorial independence.

She said the way the case was being handled “screams of” political interference and that while she agrees jobs are important, the issue is how it would look if federal prosecutors dropped the criminal charges of fraud and corruption, in exchange for a remediation agreement.

Throughout the scandal -- which touched off on Feb. 7 when The Globe and Mail reported that Wilson-Raybould faced pressure to interfere in a criminal case against SNC-Lavalin -- the federal Liberals have cited the 9,000 jobs at stake as their main motivator for any actions in this case.

Should SNC-Lavalin be found guilty, they could face a 10-year ban on applying for federal contracts, leading to the company having to move out of Canada.

“I feel that I am giving him my best advice. And if he doesn’t accept that advice then it’s his prerogative to do what he wants. But I’m trying to protect the prime minister from political interference, perceived or otherwise,” she said.

Wernick -- who was not made aware during the recording that he was being taped -- can also be heard saying that he “respects” where Wilson-Raybould was coming from, but that Trudeau’s view was that “he’s not asking you to do anything inappropriate or to interfere. He’s asking you to use all the tools that you lawfully have at your disposal, Wernick said.

“You’re not just being attorney general, you’re the minister of justice and a cabinet [minister] – and, you have context within which you exercise your roles and your responsibilities. Like, I’m not seeing anything inappropriate here,” Wernick can be heard saying.

Chair of the committee, Anthony Housefather, has said that ""no redactions have been made"" to Wilson-Raybould’s submission by the committee, though there are portions of the submission that appear to have been redacted by Wilson-Raybould before it was submitted.

Wilson-Raybould, who is still a member of the Liberal caucus, provided this evidence to further bolster the testimony she gave to the committee on Feb. 27, and to respond to contradicting stories that others have offered since her appearance.

RECORDING OF CALL WITH WERNICK

During her initial testimony on this phone call, Wilson-Raybould said she was alone and took the call from home. She said that Wernick wanted to communicate where Trudeau was at regarding the file, and spoke about the company potentially moving its headquarters.

She quoted him saying “I think he is going to find a way to get it done, one way or another....So he is in that kind of mood, and I wanted you to be aware of it.”

When asked about this call during his follow up testimony, Wernick said that it was not his recollection of that call. “I did not wear a wire, record the conversation or take extemporaneous notes,” Wernick said.

“I never raised partisan considerations at any time. I reminded her repeatedly that she was the final decision-maker. I did not attempt to influence her decision. I was giving her relevant context about public interest considerations for a decision that was hers to take. I never suggested consequences for her,” Wernick testified.

The audio call largely confirmed Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, but also backed up Wernick’s assertion that he did not make any direct partisan considerations, like Quebec votes, which Wilson-Raybould has alleged she was consistently reminded of while the file was on her desk. Though he did cite a “rising anxiety” following job losses in Oshawa and tough times in Calgary.

In the recording you can hear her taking a deep breath before the conversation begins.

“I actually feel really uncomfortable having this conversation because it’s wrong,” Wilson-Raybould says on the tape.

“Does he understand the gravity of what this potentially could mean? This is not just about saving jobs. This is about interfering with one of our fundamental institutions. This is like, breaching a constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence,” Wilson-Raybould asks Wernick about Trudeau.

“Well I don’t think he sees it as that,” Wernick said, offering that it was a case of people talking past eachother.

“Well then nobody’s explaining that to him, Michael,” she replied.

The conversation ended with Wilson-Raybould saying that she was “waiting for the other shoe to drop,” and that ""I am not under any illusion how the prime minister has and gets things that he wants. I am just stuck doing the best job that I can.""

After she got off the call, the new evidence shows that she texted her then-chief of staff Jessica Prince that “the s**** is going to hit the fan.”

In her written submission Wilson-Raybould said she recorded the conversation because she “I had reason to believe that it was likely to be an inappropriate conversation.” She said she had never done this before, and has not done so since, recognizing that her recording of this conversation would otherwise be inappropriate

Law societies in Canada prohibit lawyers from knowingly recording conversations with clients without their knowledge, including the Law Society of Ontario, which Wilson-Raybould belongs to. In a statement the Society told CTV News that it “does not comment on possible breaches of the Rules of Professional Conduct.""

“I did this simply to ensure that my notes were accurate and given the ongoing pressure and attempts to interfere in this case, the nature of conversations that had occurred… and my strong suspicion that this matter would continue to escalate in even more inappropriate ways,” she wrote.

Her unprecedented decision to then make the recording public as part of her submission was done, she says, to allow Canadians to decide for themselves whether Wernick’s comments amount to the “veiled threats” that she alleges, and which he denies.

Wernick will soon be retiring from his job as Canada’s top public servant, a decision he says is because there ""is no path for me to have a relationship of mutual trust and respect with the leaders of the Opposition parties,"" after both the Conservatives and New Democrats have called for his resignation given his role in the still unfolding controversy.

COPIES OF TEXTS, EMAILS

In her initial hours-long committee appearance she offered an in-depth account of approximately 20 exchanges --10 phone calls and 10 meetings -- specifically on the SNC-Lavalin case. She also worked through a chronology of communications, ranging from in-person meetings and phone calls, to text messages and emails, from 11 senior staffers from the Prime Minister's Office, Privy Council Office and the finance minister's office.

Throughout her testimony, she cautioned there were limitations in her ability to speak broadly about the case because of the specifics of the waiver of solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had issued.

What she has handed over to the committee stays within the lines of what is permitted in the waiver, which includes any relevant information related to the case against SNC-Lavalin over her years-long tenure as attorney general.

Contained within the new documents are transcripts as well as screen shots of conversations she or Prince had. These include email exchanges with members of Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s office who the documents describe as being involved in the “mucking around” on the case.

In one it details a phone call Prince had with Morneau’s deputy chief of staff Justin To, in which he allegedly said that Wilson-Raybould had “a philosophical problem” with the entire promise of a deferred prosecution agreement, which remains a yet-to-be-used tool that this government passed through an omnibus budget bill last year.

“She hated it the whole time and wouldn't even use it if we could,"" To is quoted as saying to Prince, who said that was incorrect.

It also includes the conversation between Wilson-Raybould and Prince about a meeting Prince was asked to have with Trudeau’s chief of staff Katie Telford and then-principal adviser Gerald Butts.

In the instance of the meeting between Trudeau’s top two staffers and Prince, the text messages back up Wilson-Raybould’s telling of the interactions, and contradicts Butts saying during his March 6 committee appearance that “there was no urgency to attend that meeting.”

The meeting request was labeled “URGENT” the documents show.

Though the texts do not offer any evidence to dispute Butts’ saying that the recounting of the exchange with Prince was taken out of context and that he had a ""very different recollection of that meeting.""

MORE DETAILS ON RESIGNATION

Wilson-Raybould’s submission also shed new light on the series of events that led to her ultimately resigning from her role as veterans’ affairs minister, which she was shuffled into in January.

She had previously told the committee that she believed she was shuffled out of her job because of her refusal to change her mind about the case, but in the new statement Wilson-Raybould said she took Trudeau at his word when he insisted that wasn’t the case.

Though, at the time she says she made the decision to resign if her replacement decided to issue a directive to interfere in the SNC-Lavalin matter, “as this would confirm my suspicions as to the reason for the shuffle of me in particular.”

A deferred prosecution agreement has not been pursued by current Justice Minister and Attorney General David Lametti, though the government has made signals that they aren’t ruling it out.

She also confirmed that she was offered the Indigenous services job, as Butts had testified. She said she was shocked they’d offer it to her since she says she made it clear from the moment the Liberals started assembling a transition team, that she’d never be able to fill that role.

Wilson-Raybould also said that she had a series of meetings with Trudeau in Vancouver after the initial story broke, and in the days before she ended up resigning from cabinet on Feb. 12.

“The prime minister stated publicly when issues about the propriety of the government’s conduct in relation to the SNC matter arose that my ongoing presence in Cabinet spoke for itself. I resigned the next day and I trust my resignation also speaks for itself,” Wilson-Raybould says in her statement.

OPPOSITION RESPONSE

In the opening remarks of the new documents, Wilson-Raybould says her view is that the real issues at the heart of the SNC-Lavalin scandal are not about “how things are ‘experienced’” or considerations like caucus dynamics, political ambitions, or poll numbers. Rather she says it is about prosecutorial independence, the rule of law, and Canada’s democratic institutions.

She also offers that she thinks all sides should be working across party lines to fix what she calls “fissures and weaknesses” in Canadian institutions, and that she looks forward to a future where “we truly do politics differently,” seeming to lean on a phrase Trudeau regularly touted during the 2015 campaign.

The opposition wanted to invite Wilson-Raybould back to testify again -- something she was open to -- but Liberal MPs on the House Justice Committee shut down the study, saying that they’d heard all they needed to.

Wilson-Raybould also offered that while she has nothing further to add to the formal process, if she was asked or compelled to participate in a future investigation or parliamentary process, she would.

In a statement reacting to the new information, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called it “concrete evidence that proves Justin Trudeau led a campaign to politically interfere in SNC-Lavalin’s criminal prosecution.” He called the entire affair “corruption on top of corruption on top of corruption.”

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said the evidence was “so compelling and well-documented” that an independent public inquiry is needed.

“The PMO has tried to spin this as a miscommunication or personal disagreement… The former Attorney General repeatedly made clear to the Prime Minister and those around him that their inappropriate actions would be seen as political interference – and they ignored her,” Singh said in a statement.

Since her testimony, Trudeau has faced calls to resign, the House of Commons agenda has been largely usurped by opposition-prompted procedural moves, and several other high-profile officials have resigned amid insistence that nothing improper occurred.

The PMO’s statement claims that “all facts are on the table now,” and that the Liberal government is focused on “moving forward as a team on the issues that matter to Canadians and governing in the best interests of the country.”

All eyes are set to be on Parliament Hill when MPs return on Monday, particularly when Liberal MPs convene for their weekly caucus meeting on Wednesday. There, it is likely that the developments that have occurred on this file over the last few days will come up, as some of her colleagues are expected to get up and call for her removal.

Remember infrastructure?,"The 2019 federal budget, like all recent federal budgets, is a tribute to the pleasures of endless economic growth.

In the days when inflation was high, interest rates were volatile and growth was very stop and go, budgeting was hard work. Reining in runaway deficits absorbed most of the energies of finance ministers for the better part of three decades.

But since then inflation has been tamed and growth has been steady: Canada has had only one recession in the last quarter-century, and a mild one at that. Budgeting in such times is comparative child’s play — governments, at the federal level at least, have to positively go out of their way to run deficits.

Indeed, so steady has the revenue-gusher been — no government has ever had as much money to play with, measured in inflation-adjusted dollars per citizen — that the Liberals have been obliged to perform quite heroic feats of spending just to keep pace. Though real per capita spending is at all-time record levels, the deficit remains stubbornly below one per cent of GDP — hardly a deficit at all, really. My God, in the fiscal year just ending, the deficit actually fell: revenues came in faster (6.8 per cent) than even the Liberals could spend them (4.9 per cent).

I’ve said before that these are deficits of choice, rather than necessity. A better way to describe them might be deficits for show. Not even the Liberals still pretend deficits of this size would have any impact on growth, nor have they: real growth per capita in the bad old Harper years, from fiscal 2007 to 2016, averaged 0.9 per cent — versus 0.7 per cent, actual and projected, in the shining new era ushered in by the Liberals (2017-2024).

Indeed, they’re not even supposed to. Their impact is, first, symbolic — behold, we run deficits because we like to, whereas the previous government did so only grudgingly! — and second, to permit the government to spend more, mostly on the care and feeding of Liberal client groups.

Remember infrastructure? That was supposed to differentiate the new Liberal deficit spending from the old Liberal deficit spending. It wasn’t about pork-barrel politics, or short-run economic fixes. It was about making strategic investments that would increase productivity for the long run. Only it hasn’t quite worked out that way, has it?

The budget boasts that federal infrastructure spending has increased from $8 billion in fiscal 2016 to $14 billion in the current fiscal year. That’s an increase of $6 billion, which sounds like a lot, until you realize total program spending has increased by $47-billion in the same period. At one point the Liberals used to claim one dollar in three of new spending would go to infrastructure. The actual result: more like one in eight.

It is time, then, for the conversation to move on: from how spending is financed to what it is spent on, from the size of government to its composition, from the macro to the micro. Deficits of this size are not going to ruin us, as the opposition claims; neither would eliminating them, as the finance minister pretends.

The quantity of spending isn’t so much the issue as the quality. It isn’t that we can’t afford it: it’s that, in the rush to get all that spending out the door, little thought appears to have been given to whether the money is being spent in the best way, or whether it should be spent at all.

The most telling table in the budget is the last: the one that tallies up the estimated savings from the several “comprehensive reviews” of spending the government claims to have undertaken. The total annual saving: $237 million. Out of a budget of $323.5 billion.

Perhaps one day something a little more stringent will be attempted. And perhaps this budget’s signature initiatives on training and housing, which give every impression of having been cooked up in the Prime Minister’s Office, if not in party election planning sessions, will be the subject.

The training chapter notes, with evident satisfaction, that the government now spends close to $7.5 billion a year on skill development “across more than 100 distinct programs.” Given the country’s acute and growing skills shortages, some questions might be asked about their efficacy. Some, but not too many: a review of skills programming provided “an opportunity to reflect on past successes and determine where more can be done.”

Such a forgiving attitude to the past does not bode well for the future. Has any serious analysis been done of the new Canada Training Benefit — how it will interact with provincial programs, what sort of training will be eligible, and so on?

Likewise for the government’s suite of new policies to make housing more affordable. The budget acknowledges the only real solution to high house prices in the long run is to increase the supply of houses. But the specific measures it announces would mostly stimulate the demand — notably a First-Time Home Buyer Incentive that would involve the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, worryingly, in lending directly to prospective buyers. The details are sketchier than sketchy, but any benefit would more than likely be capitalized into prices. Would anyone really be made better off?

But why ask hard questions, when growth is endless and budgets need never be balanced? Except … even if the business cycle has been abolished, and growth does persist, it will be much slower growth than we have known, now that the Baby Boomers are hitting their retirement years. That may not be of much concern to the feds, who largely insulated themselves, in the deficit-slashing years, from the fiscal consequences. But it’s a huge problem for the provinces, who will have to pay to look after all those aging Boomers.

What would the budget do to stimulate growth in the long run — to improve Canada’s sluggish productivity record, to arrest the alarming decline in business investment, to reform Canada’s complex, growth-killing corporate and personal income tax system?

Er, nothing, as it happens. For as it has been said, in the long run we are all out of office.","Andrew Coyne: Federal budget a testament to the pleasures of endless growth.

(Photo by Creative Touch Imaging Ltd./NurPhoto via Getty Images) A political meddling scandal threatening Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's re-election bid was given fresh impetus Friday with the release of messages and a secret recording supplied by his former attorney general.

The House of Commons justice committee, looking into the explosive allegations that Trudeau officials pressured attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to shield engineering firm SNC-Lavalin from trial, released the materials from the now former official.

The controversy comes just months ahead of a re-election bid that looks increasingly uncertain for Trudeau, whose progressive, golden boy image had previously been unblemished.

In the 43 pages of documents, Wilson-Raybould seeks to link her demotion to another portfolio in January to her resistance to allegedly undue pressure to settle the SNC-Lavalin case -- which Trudeau and his staff have denied.

And she hints about why, a month later, she resigned from cabinet, saying she had decided ""that I would immediately resign if the new attorney general decided to issue a directive in the SNC-Lavalin matter.""

Her replacement as attorney general, David Lametti, has so far only said he is considering the issue.

Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin was charged in 2015 with corruption over alleged bribes paid to secure contracts in Libya.

Wilson-Raybould, Canada's first indigenous attorney general, refused to ask prosecutors to settle, and the trial is set to proceed.

But she later testified to lawmakers that she had faced ""consistent and sustained"" political pressure to intervene, including receiving ""veiled threats"" over her stance.

Trudeau recently addressed the allegations, telling reporters in Ottawa that he had learned ""lessons"" from the crisis -- but denying any wrongdoing.

Another minister quit in protest, and two senior officials in Trudeau's office accused of bullying Wilson-Raybould also resigned since the scandal erupted in February.

Secret recording

The secret recording made by Wilson-Raybould of a 17-minute call in December with Canada's top bureaucrat, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick, supports her testimony to the justice committee last month.

On the tape, she says Trudeau's inner circle was on ""dangerous ground"" by attempting to interfere in the SNC-Lavalin prosecution.

© Lars Hagberg Canada's former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould says she was pressured by the prime minister's inner circle to shield engineering giant SNC-Lavalin from prosecution She also explains that she is only trying to protect Trudeau from charges of political interference after the head of prosecutions had already decided to go ahead with the trial.

Wernick says the prime minister is ""in a pretty firm frame of mind about this.""

""I am a bit worried,"" he goes on to say. ""It is not a good idea for the prime minister and his attorney general to be at loggerheads.""

He highlights Trudeau's concerns about the possible loss of 9,000 jobs and ""a signature Canadian firm"" if SNC-Lavalin is found guilty at trial and sanctioned, coming soon after a GM plant closure and Canadian oil sector woes.

""The PM wants to be able to say that he has tried everything he can within a legitimate toolbox to try to head that off,"" he said. ""He is quite determined.""

""I think he's gonna find a way to get it done one way or another.""

Divisions within the Liberal party have started to emerge as a result of the scandal, with several MPs publicly calling for Wilson-Raybould to be kicked out of caucus.

Opposition parties, meanwhile, renewed their demands for a public inquiry and for Trudeau to resign.

""The prime minister has lost the moral authority to govern and must resign,"" Tory leader Andrew Scheer said in a statement.

According to the latest poll by Angus Reid, the Liberals have fallen nine points behind the main opposition, to 28 percent, versus 37 percent for the Tories.

Smaller parties such as the New Democrats (17 percent), Greens (eight percent) and the upstart libertarian People's Party (four percent), however, have been the main beneficiaries of the Liberals' loss of support.","New docs, recording released in Canada PM meddling scandal",AFP on MSN.ca,https://www.msn.com/en-ae/news/world/new-docs-recording-released-in-canada-pm-meddling-scandal/ar-BBVpuL5?li=BBqrVLO

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Fred Chartrand

OTTAWA – The Conservatives are asking the federal judicial affairs commissioner to investigate the leak of confidential information about former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould’s controversial choice for chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada.

Conservative justice critic Lisa Raitt has sent a letter to Marc Giroux arguing that the leak “strongly suggests” that “political actors” leaked information about an appointment to the country’s highest court.

If so, Raitt says, it would be “an egregious case of political interference … that severely injures the independence of the judiciary.”

Raitt’s letter comes two days after The Canadian Press and CTV reported that Wilson-Raybould and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau clashed over whom to appoint to the top court upon the retirement of Beverley McLachlin as chief justice in 2017.

Sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss details of the normally confidential process, said Wilson-Raybould urged Trudeau to name Glenn Joyal, chief justice of Manitoba’s Court of Queen’s Bench, to fill both McLachlin’s spot on the bench as a justice from western Canada but also the chief justice role.

They said Trudeau was disturbed to discover that Joyal took a restrictive view of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and had criticized the top court for liberally interpreting it to include “new rights” not explicitly mentioned in the charter; the court’s broad interpretation has led to things like legalization of same-sex marriage and the striking down of Canada’s abortion law and prohibition on medically assisted dying.

Trudeau ultimately appointed Alberta judge Sheilah Martin to fill the western slot on the Supreme Court and elevated sitting Justice Robert Wagner to the role of chief justice.

Wilson-Raybould said Monday there was “no conflict” with Trudeau on the matter but otherwise declined to comment, saying the selection process for Supreme Court justices is confidential and any disclosure “could compromise the integrity of the appointments process and potentially sitting justices.”

However, on Wednesday, citing an anonymous source, the Globe and Mail reported that Wilson-Raybould recommended Joyal as part of a broader plan to appoint an Indigenous judge to the role of chief justice of Manitoba’s Court of Queen’s Bench – which would have been a first for a superior court in Canada. The newspaper also said Wilson-Raybould believed Joyal held a more liberal view on the charter of rights than Wagner, although the report cited evidence to the contrary.

The Canadian Bar Association and the Manitoba Bar Association have also criticized the disclosure of information about the appointment process.

The leaks suggest Trudeau may have had reasons unrelated to the SNC-Lavalin affair to move Wilson-Raybould out of the prestigious justice portfolio in a mid-January cabinet shuffle. She was moved to Veterans Affairs but resigned from cabinet a month later amid allegations that she had been improperly pressured last fall by the Prime Minister’s Office to intervene to stop a criminal prosecution of the Montreal engineering giant.

Wilson-Raybould has since said she believes the move was punishment for her refusal to instruct the director of public prosecutions to negotiate a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin. Such an agreement would have forced the company to pay stiff restitution but saved it from the risk of a criminal conviction, which could threaten the viability of the company.

Raitt said Wednesday that the leaks about the Supreme Court appointment process are more proof of Trudeau’s disrespect for the rule of law.

“The SNC-Lavalin affair has raised serious questions about the rule of law in Canada and the degree to which the Prime Minister’s Office has interfered in it,” she said.

“This most recent episode of potential political interference from the PMO only further damages our democratic institutions and values and requires immediate attention.”

95,LifeStyle,2019-03-28T01:04:00.0000000Z,"MACKAY: Well, the Liberal Party and his supporters have made a big deal ... WELLS: I've talked about how this is such a rich time for cartoonists, in Canada with Justin Trudeau's reign and the dawn of the age of Trump. Looking back to other periods ...","WELLS: On that note, I want to welcome to The Message Graeme MacKay, the Hamilton Spectator's award winning editorial cartoonist. In fact it occurred to me as I was preparing for the episode that the sign Beware of Cartoonist is funny and also has deeper meetings or layers to it, just as your work always does, because in fact you occupy a physical space in the newsroom off on your own — separate from the reporters. And you also play a singular role at The Spectator which is to offer an opinion, a point of view on everything from politics to Hamilton's quirks and the vast canvas of human nature and to do so editorial cartoons. That's me giving my spin how you might see your job. How do you see what you do?

MACKAY: Yeah, I occupy a very isolated corner of the newsroom way at the other end and by the exit door to the newsroom too so there's a symbolic thing there. I guess I'm lucky enough to have a position that I have because it's sort of like a visual columnist. But I guess my job is to poke the powers and do it in a depiction way in a drawing and it's a wonderful job that I have for sure.

WELLS: And you've been in The Spec 22 years this September is my guess. That means you're a young buck compared to me. You started at The Spec four months after I did?

MACKAY: Yes. But I bet you, they probably gave you a computer. Right?

WELLS: They did! You are right about that.

MACKAY: I didn't get a computer for like, three or four years after. And I think it took like half a year to get a phone. That was 1997.

WELLS: Those were the perks back then. So we'll talk a little bit about the road travelled for you and then how you do what you do in this age of Trump and Trudeau. I was thinking I feel the limitations of audio here where your work is so visual.

MACKAY: Sure.

WELLS: But Ayesha Nasir, the producer of The Message, will post some of your work on our site and a link to your website which I was going through. There's a ton of material on there for readers. Archives and —

MACKAY: I'm very proud of my website.

WELLS: It's a great website. I wish I had something that showed some of my past work you know, so yeah, that's terrific. But to start, today's cartoon — by the way you create five editorial cartoons per week at The Spec, is that right?

MACKAY: Right.

WELLS: And your work is nationally syndicated so it appears online and in newspapers throughout Canada and sometimes in the US. The cartoon today, just to take a random one because it's in the paper today, it features Doug Ford.

Editorial cartoon for Wednesday, March 6, 2019. | Graeme MacKay, The Hamilton Spectator

We have Ford. In the background of the cartoon, there's a big carnival happening. Fireworks in the sky and a carnival tent is labelled SNC-LAV-SCAM. Big party happening in the background and in the foreground we have Doug Ford looking very much like a mob boss standing over someone bearing something in the dirt led by car headlights — which symbolize what?

MACKAY: Well there's, obviously, some interference happening on both the provincial and federal level. It's an edgy cartoon and I could have gotten into trouble with that. I had to like go to my editor Howard Elliot, just to make sure that we wouldn't get sued because it's —

WELLS: It's pretty suggestive.

MACKAY: Yeah, it's very suggestive. You're saying what, the premier is killing people off? I guess in a metaphorical way, he did. Or his deputy, one of his deputies, actually fired the deputy commissioner of the OPP.

WELLS: Just this week, right?

MACKAY: Yeah. But, you know, it's just interesting because we've been obsessed by the SNC-Lavalin story for weeks now. And there's other things that are happening. We as cartoonists just have to be careful not to get too obsessed with the media and keep our eye on other, you know, nasty things that might be happening and I think what's happening in Ontario right now is ... it's fodder for cartoons for sure.

WELLS: I've heard and seen some criticism of the coverage of LAV-SCAM, that the media is all in and everyone is now trying to outdo the other, that is, not to say it's not a huge story, which it is. But it's a good opportunity, for you to kind of shine the light somewhere else like you're doing here.

MACKAY: Well, you gotta wonder like, are people really focused in on the LAV-SCAM thing and are they more focused on what's happening with Ford? I mean, I don't know. Until polls come out, we don't know. Maybe for the vast majority of people outside the bubbles that really follow these political things nobody really cares. But I guess time will tell.

WELLS: Would you anticipate when you draw Doug Ford in this sort of manner, do you ever sort of expect to get a an email or call from someone who's a fan and not a fan of yours? Perhaps who is angry about the depiction.

MACKAY: I expect with my job that I'm not gonna have 100% happiness. I think with a good cartoon you're going to get as many people oppose as people who like it. So yeah, on various social media platforms, I get an earful from people who are totally upset with my cartoon. We get the odd letters to the Editor, a lot of them I don't even see. They just cross Howard's desk and he protects me from seeing some of these angry emails and letters and whatnot. But yeah, I think if you're not getting feedback, you're not doing your job properly as a cartoonist.

WELLS: Do you have thick skin as far as that goes? I mean, your job is to stir the pot. I think if I got a letter taking a shot at my story — I'm probably more thin skinned — I might feel defensive at first. I guess it depends on the nature of —

MACKAY: I think I get more defensive when people obviously don't understand and they show they don't understand satire. They're not seeing the bigger picture that sometimes you need to use Certain metaphors and situations that cast affliction on certain people in order to skewer the person who's the power. I think in some countries like in France and Britain, they get that. But here, it's almost like it's a continuous kind of thing where you got ""Well, no, this is how it works here."" And, ""This is what satire is all about."" But I can understand that even satire has to adapt to the changing norms and everything that happens with society.

WELLS: And satire is not polite.

MACKAY: It's not polite and it's not fair sometimes, either.

WELLS: That's right. One of your favourite cartoonists and friends in the fraternity of cartoonists, I suppose, is Michael deAdder. He apologized recently. He did one of the LAV-SCAM cartoons where he depicted Jody Wilson-Raybould tied up with her mouth taped, in a boxing ring, with Trudeau poised to take her on in the ring. So her hands are tied down her back, her mouth is covered up.

MACKAY: I did actually the almost exact same cartoon too.

WELLS: Did you?

MACKAY: Yeah and we were lumped into this whole sort of thing with hate and misogyny and that sort of thing. I posted my cartoon online and deAdder saw it and then he messaged me and said I'm in the middle of tweeting that same cartoon but just giving you the heads-up that this is going in my paper tomorrow. And he's on the Atlantic Coast so he didn't have much of a timeline.

WELLS: Right, he's in Halifax.

MACKAY: Seven o'clock in the evening. So we go ahead and then everything hits the fan the next day it was posted.

WELLS: I saw on Twitter, I mean I just saw a bit of it, but he apologized and then he sort of apologized for the apology. But people started giving a hard time for apologizing.

MACKAY: I think the big difference there is that he's a freelancer so he doesn't answer to an editor. My editor is Howard Elliot and he cleared it. He looked at it and he didn't raise any worry it about or anything. There's been subsequent apologies since then and they all come from freelancers who don't have those filters that thank goodness I have here at The Spectator because I've never apologized for a cartoon.

WELLS: You haven't? I was going to ask you about that.

MACKAY: Not here. I have come close but no I haven't.

Editorial Cartoon for Friday, February 15, 2019 | Graeme MacKay, The Hamilton Spectator -

WELLS: With that one, people are missing the whole boxing analogy. Trudeau was famous at least for people following his career for boxing publicly.

MACKAY: Well, the Liberal Party and his supporters have made a big deal. He punched out Patrick Brazeau and it was, you know, ""Look what he did here!"" and all of you can look at that like well yeah, he was an Indigenous guy too that he punched out. But, you know, it was taken as a positive thing and it was an important thing because it was before he became prime minister. And a lot of people will say hell, he's just a weakling who only cares about his hair and his looks and selfies and that sort of thing. So let's go and prove that he's a capable guy. And I've used that in other cartoons. His punching acumen when dealing with Donald Trump and that sort of thing.

WELLS: Right, right. The first time I covered him ever in Hamilton was when he came here. And he did a big thing at the gym downtown where he put on a big workout. He was quite happy to to sweat for the cameras.

MACKAY: I'm kind of amazed that we as cartoonists haven't really capitalized on this whole thing because you could you can see the good in that. But you can also see the ugly side of being a boxer as well, and I think both Mike and I did that job as was expected in a satirist.

WELLS: How often would you say an editor like Howard or Paul Berton editor in chief comes to you with an idea that they would like to see done, or an issue say that they like to see done by you in the paper? And how often is it just you percentagewise?

MACKAY: They never come to me. I can tell you they never instruct me or say ""Oh, you gotta like lay off."" Although in the early days they would tell me to lay off way back when I started out. I came on and it was a different approach that I had towards my job. I was scathing towards the mayor who was Bob Morrow and I did some nasty cartoons about him and my boss who actually happened to be Howard. Howard has been my boss for a long time and I remember he told me so you gotta back off on the mayor because he's starting to like badger us. I think that says something. There's something about ... it's easier to go after a politician who's in Ottawa or London or Washington but when it comes to City Hall here these are people that you got to deal with.

WELLS: We have reporters.

MACKAY: And reporters have to deal with them as well. If you keep it up they're going to stop answering the phones when a reporter calls.

WELLS: Right. So then each day, the cartoon ... that is you picking the topic and give your spin on it.

MACKAY: Yeah as I say it's like you or Andrew or Jeff Mahoney. I'm given the liberty of a columnist. However it hasn't always been that way. I mean we've had different editors as you know and they have different definitions on what my role is. I can fight against it but they're the ones paying me.

WELLS: Let's roll back a little bit to your road here. So you grew up in Dundas and attended junior art classes at the Dundas Valley School of Art. I was reading from a piece that the spec ran when you were first hired that's on your website. You were a news geek as a kid and used to doodle in class and draw your teachers and classmates and in grade four through the whole class and ran off photocopies for all of them on demand.

MACKAY: Yeah!

WELLS: Does it make you popular or not popular?

MACKAY: Oh sure, sure. I still had bullies going after me and stuff like that. But if you're a pretty good cartoonist or an artist, you often are like a hit, if you can use that art against the authority of a teacher.

WELLS: What cartoons or comics did you enjoy reading most when you were growing up?

MACKAY: You know, I didn't read a heck of a lot of comic books. I was definitely into MAD Magazine and Cracked. I loved MAD Magazine. And I think that's probably because it was parody. It was like an early form. I didn't know who the president United States was when I'm nine or 10 years old but I knew about being bombarded by all these products on TV. Actually I was thinking also of Wacky Packs. Remember Wacky Packs? They're these candy things and you get gum and then inside would be all these stickers that were parodies of products. Instead of Captain Crunch it was a sticker showing a box with Captain Crud. I think that was the germ of my fascination with just making fun of, you know, on a pop culture thing that extended to politics which came very soon after that I guess.

WELLS: In MAD magazine, as a kid, I would enjoy the parodies of movies. In very highly detail, they would go through the plot of the movie and just ridicule notions of it.

MACKAY: Don Martin and Al Jaffee and Sergio ... wonderful, wonderful cartoonists.

WELLS: In the introduction to your book, which was published in 2017, which is titled ""You might be from Hamilton if ..."", The Spectator's Scott Radley wrote the introduction to the book. He mentioned MAD Magazine and he also said that a lot of kids growing up probably wanted to be a cartoonist and I was going to tell you that I can attest to that. Back in grade five or six I gave my speech, when we all had to give speeches back in the day, you to stand in front of class give a speech. I gave mine on how my career aspiration was to be a cartoonist and I was a huge Peanuts fan. Charles M. Shulz, the whole thing. I had sketch books but I couldn't draw and so set me back a little bit. When did you know that you wanted to draw, and for a living, and be a newspaper editorial cartoonist specifically?

MACKAY: Well I've always drawn. I guess I'm the nerd who instead of going out and playing football or hockey or whatever I stayed in and drew. But I guess, like I said, it was parody I was fascinated with. I was a television junkie too let's be honest. With MAD Magazine, I was also into SCTV and Saturday Night Live — a lot of these great comedy shows that would make fun of the politics of the day. So you know you had Saturday Night Live making fun of the president of the day, which they do so fine even to this day. And so, you know, that made me wonder: what are they talking about here? So, I guess I came of age to find the fascination of politics when Ronald Reagan was president. That was the time when Pierre Trudeau was the prime minister and I know I would always hear the family discussions at the dinner table. On Sunday night, my grandparents would come over and they would freak out over the latest thing that Pierre Trudeau was doing to the country. And so that started an interest in reading the newspapers and by that time I was delivering the Hamilton Spectator and I could open the paper and I'd see the wonderful works of Blaine, the cartoonist here for so long. And so that naturally went to well, what are they drawing in the Toronto Star? What are they drawing in the Globe? And so I just became aware of a lot of the cartoonists at that time period in the early 80s and it's a lifetime fascination starting from there.

WELLS: It's interesting. SCTV was, I loved that it was just so clever energy in not just politics with shows like that on SCTV but the powerful, the famous to be skewered and made fun of whether it was Bob Hope or whoever. I'd love to see that on Netflix. They got to bring SCTV on Netflix.

MACKAY: That would be wonderful, wouldn't it?

WELLS: Political cartoons have been around a long time, if you're Googling anyways. It suggests that the first one ever might have been in 1754 by Ben Franklin. And just to give the audience the visual: it's a snake that's been cut into several sections to show disunity among the new colonies that were not yet the United States. And the caption is, join or die. And we were just talking before the show briefly, but how you actually did a cartoon years ago, that was a take on Franklin's cartoon.

MACKAY: Yeah, it was to apply to the amalgamation of Hamilton. So you know, they were amalgamating all the colonies back at that time, and the threats were out there. Well, that was sort of the same thing that was happening back in around 1999 and 2000, when the province, was compelling us to amalgamate. I did that cartoon and I showed it to the editor and he didn't know what I was talking about so much I guess. Typical journalist doesn't know the history of satire.

WELLS: Back to the drawing board.

MACKAY: Exactly.

WELLS: I think that one and your work and the best editorial cartoons show how carefully chosen words of a little bit of information convey so much. Just randomly going through your website ... maybe because this one appeared on my birthday ... but the one that is lamenting the end of summer. It says ""RIP summer"" and it has you know these ...

MACKAY: They're Grim Reapers.

WELLS: Grim Reapers carrying this pumpkin man who's heralding the pumpkin spice is back. I just think it's awesome. Pumpkin spice of course is a great flair but it does signal that something is coming to an end.

MACKAY: I'm just around so many people that say Oh, have you had this beer? It's pumpkin spice. It's like no I don't want pumpkin spice. All the coffee shops were bringing their coffee so that's a perfect cultural thing that gets away from the politics. Like I said, I know that there are people who are who are shutting out the politics and they're sick of it and everything and so it's important for us to do some of the cultural references and sort of jab at it, which means we have to put up with every year like pumpkin spice and whatever.

WELLS: I love that stuff. Of course at Christmas time all the different flavours. I'm just like what is that? You know all the different flavours. I don't even know what they are.

MACKAY: The other thing on coffee that drives me crazy is the Roll Up The Rim thing. It's like a sport for me every year to come up with another, you know, let's mock the Roll Up The Rim campaign because it's just ... I walk to work and I see the results of Roll Up The Rim. All these dirty cups all over the place.

WELLS: I've never done it.

MACKAY: Have you not?

WELLS: I prefer my lattes and stuff from elsewhere. Whatever that makes me I don't know. But you know, you gotta hand it to them. They certainly tapped into something.

MACKAY: I do. But it's, you know, take some responsibility because these cups are all over the place. And I know there's been an outcry and it's been getting louder every year. You know, this is the disposable ... like this is the crap that you're adding to the landscape through this. It's just horrible.

WELLS: Is one of your challenges determining how much information to provide in a cartoon? Some of your work, some of your cartoons, have layers and layers of background information, little bits and minutiae within the cartoon. And others have a very simple — what appears to be simple — message although, as I say, with the one about pumpkin spice, simple yet there's a lot to it. That's kind of under the surface. Is that something you think about consciously, or you just kind of go with it?

MACKAY: It depends on how I feel. I guess it's kind of nice to be able to put those little Easter eggs in and just give a little extra fun for the viewer. I mean, I'm a big fan of the intricate cartoons. I know there's a wonderful thing about simplicity of cartoons, but I think from time to time was nice to do these elaborate things.

WELLS: Where people can kind of dig into it and get what they can out of it. Of course, then some people aren't getting half of what you're trying to convey sometimes.

MACKAY: Also if the gag is kind of weak then it's you know, I spice it up. I pumpkin spice it up with more details.

WELLS: I said you were an award-winning cartoonist and you're a two-time recipient of a United Nation citation. The Ranan Lurie Political Cartoon.

MACKAY: Ranan Lurie. He's a famous cartoonist from — I don't know where he's from — Egypt, I think. And he's obviously very rich. He throws his money around and rewards people.

WELLS: Which is fabulous. And then last year you were nominated for a City of Hamilton Arts Award.

MACKAY: Yeah, I was nominated. I didn't win.

WELLS: So what you do is absolutely art. And it's punditry and commentary. Do you see yourself more as an artist or commentator?

MACKAY: I would love to do more art. And a lot of us cartoonists do. I would like to do more art, I'd like to do oil paintings. I look at our colleague here, Lee Munn who does some outstanding artwork. Landscapes and things like that. Boy, that would be a dream of mine to go back to the basics of what I learned at the DVSA and take a sketch book out there and draw stuff. Because that's what I did. I used to do that. I used to go out to museums and draw vases and statue heads and things like that. It's a wonderful, therapeutic thing to do.

WELLS: Just to quickly go back to the politics. I meant to ask you earlier: I'm sure there are followers of your work, or people who dip in on your work on occasion, who think they can pinpoint ... There are people who think they can pinpoint The Spectator's political leanings. Even if we had one, which I don't think that the paper does. I don't think it has a particular leaning but I'm sure there's some who think they can label you along the spectrum. And they'd probably be wrong no matter what they say.

MACKAY: Yeah. Good luck. Cause I don't even know where I am. That's right. One thing that drives me crazy is partisanship. It drives me nuts because I will put something on Twitter and I can easily predict who's going to be weighing and then saying such and such. But you know, there's your example right there. You've got a Doug Ford cartoon there and I'm making fun of a guy. He happens to be a Progressive Conservative. But the day before, I'm making fun of Justin Trudeau, he happens to be a federal Liberal. And then I'm making fun of Trump and I'm making fun of all kinds of political parties. Again, it isn't about partisanship to be a cartoonist. Put that all away. It's all about jabbing the powers. It just so happens, we are in a really good situation now. We had a Conservative in Queen's Park in a Liberal in Ottawa.

WELLS: It's kind of an ideal situation for you.

MACKAY: Yeah, it is. But I think in the past, I might have come here with a bit of a partisan leaning towards the centre right. But I can't ... I'm not there at all. I think over time and being around smart people like we have The Spectator, you know, you've learned something. And I certainly have being here.

WELLS: I've talked about how this is such a rich time for cartoonists, in Canada with Justin Trudeau's reign and the dawn of the age of Trump. Looking back to other periods in your career to this point, is this the most interesting time or have they all been interesting?

MACKAY: We were having some great scandal times right now. But in 22 years you can think back, I mean, there's the gas plant scandal, the Gomery scandal, money in bags that Mulroney was passing to Karlheinz Schreiber. Look at the scandal happening in Washington right now. So I think what happens is you get a series of scandals adding up and that's what lends itself to the eventual defeat of a government. I don't know if this SNC-Lavalin thing is going to topple the government. I doubt it will. I think in a life of government there's a series. I mean we had a Liberal government in Ontario that was very plagued with scandals and it lasted for how many terms. And now we got a new government that's starting up its own scandals so scandals are just part of life, right?

WELLS: It's the fuel for the fire for a cartoonist. Graeme, I'm fascinated by the work you do. As I've already pointed out I envious because you're doing what I wanted to do when I was a kid. It's great what you bring to the Spectator adding colour and perspective and wit to our pages and you're one of the best in the business. And that's in Canada and the US. So I want to say thanks for coming on the show.

MACKAY: Well, thanks. It's a pleasure. Thanks, Jon and Ayesha.

WELLS: Thanks to the audience. And again, you can see Graeme MacKay's archives and other information on the link that we'll put on our podcast webpage. And my thanks to Ayesha Nasir, as always, and we'll talk to you later on The Message.

John Crawford

LNG Canada says proposed changes to the province's tax structure for liquefied natural gas, announced this week by the BC Government, are a very important step forward in the development of the industry in this province.

Although the company's investors had already given the project final approval, an LNG Canada spokesperson says the announcement shows the NDP is prepared to deliver on its commitments.



Finance Minister Carole James announced on Monday the government's new Income Tax Amendment Act, which she said will ensure the LNG export industry has an even playing field with other resource sectors in the province, and can be globally competitive.

""We're creating jobs, we're creating environmental protection and we're bringing in a fair share of resources to British Columbia,"" she said.

LNG Canada External Affairs Director Susannah Pierce agreed, saying the changes help ensure BC can find a new market for its natural gas resources, and realize the opportunities the LNG sector creates for the province's workers, communities and First Nations.

""It is removing the LNG Income Tax Act, which is something that was unique only to the LNG industry in the province, and so really it's the final chapter of the BC Government's commitment to ensure that there is a sustainable and competitive industry in the province,"" she said.





[PHOTO: Susannah Pierce, LNG Canada -- at October 2018 FID announcement]

Environmental groups aren't happy with the new bill -- nor is the BC Green Party, with leader Andrew Weaver complaining that the NDP basically sold out to the industry.

""They've basically given LNG Canada whatever they want, frankly I'm surprised they haven't given them promises of their second and third children as well!"" he said.

But while the Green Party will vote against the bill, it's likely to pass with the backing of the BC Liberals.

""Our desire is to be supportive, but we still have a job to do, in terms of ensuring that the government fully discloses the benefits and the costs associated with the agreement,"" said Liberal MLA Mike De Jong.

In the meantime, work is proceeding on the project at Kitimat -- and Pierce says local businesses are already seeing the benefits.

""We've begun additional site-clearing and that's to make sure the site is ready for materials when they come on-site to start more of the construction element of this; we've done preliminary dredging, to enable some of the ships to safely enter the area, and also to ensure Rio Tinto has an extension to its wharf, so that when they go off of the former Eurocan wharf, they can go onto a new extension of their wharf closer to shore,"" she explained.

More than 600 workers have already been busy on site, and Pierce says that number is steadily increasing, with a focus on hiring local as much as possible.",LNG Canada Applauds BC Tax Changes,CFTK TV,http://www.cftktv.com/News/LNG-Canada-Applauds-BC-Tax-Changes

Internationally, Canada-China ... Both Liberal MPs from Calgary now sit as ...","Despite ongoing technical conversations, finding a resolution to China’s decision to end all Canadian canola seed imports has been deemed not possible, at least in the short-term.

Canola Council of Canada president Jim Everson said the industry had no choice but to try and find alternative markets.

Those statements confirmed the industry’s worst fears after Chinese officials pulled Richardson International’s export licence because of still unproven concerns about “hazardous organisms.”

Canadian farmers are now caught in the middle of escalating trade and diplomatic tension between Ottawa and China, which buys about 40 percent of the canola Canada exports.

The fear now is whether the situation escalates.

With spring seeding fast-approaching, the fear about what the dispute with China could mean for farmers’ bottom lines grows by the day.

The trade war with China is yet another fire Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s embattled Liberals must fight at a time when the party has spent much of 2019 on the defensive.

Internationally, Canada-China diplomatic relations are severely strained. China remains livid about the fact Canadian authorities detained Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer for Chinese telecom giant Huawei, in December following an extradition requested from the United States.

Chinese officials have since detained two Canadians, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessperson Michael Spavor, who the Chinese have accused of espionage.

The diplomatic dispute has also cost Canada its ambassador to China, who was fired by the prime minister after he suggested to reporters Wanzhou had a strong legal case.

Closer to home, the Trudeau government has spent more than a month combatting allegations the Prime Minister’s Office inappropriately pressured the former attorney general in relation to a file involving SNC Lavalin.

It’s a political crisis that has seen two cabinet ministers, a senior adviser to the prime minister and the clerk of the privy council (this country’s top bureaucrat) resign.

The possibility of a drawn-out dispute with China over canola exports is unlikely to do the Liberals any favours in Western Canada, where the economy is already a hot-button issue thanks to troubles in the energy sector.

In Alberta alone, it’s estimated 3,000 jobs are directly tied to canola, with 70 percent of the province’s exports to China canola-related.

Then, there are the political concerns.

Those who follow Canadian politics know that the East-West political divide in this country is as much reality as the urban-rural spread. With a federal election just around the corner, fears over western alienation are re-emerging.

From the start, the Trudeau government only had a handful of western voices in its caucus outside of British Columbia.

Both Liberal MPs from Calgary now sit as independents. Edmonton MP Amarjeet Sohi, who serves as Trudeau’s natural resources minister, has his hands full with the economic and market access struggles of Canada’s oil and gas sector.

Meanwhile, fellow Edmontonian Randy Boissonault sits on the House of Commons justice committee that until recently was handling the SNC Lavalin affair.

International Trade Minister Jim Carr is a key figure for the Liberals who has been tasked with finding a solution to the canola dispute. The importance of the file is not lost on him. The Richardson’s family has deep ties to Winnipeg, where Carr is from.

Carr has said there is no scientific basis for China’s concerns about pests in Canadian canola.

Carr is scheduled to testify in front of the House international trade committee on the canola-China dispute on April 2 alongside Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau.",Farmers caught in the middle of trade dispute with China,The Western Producer,https://www.producer.com/2019/03/farmers-caught-in-the-middle-of-trade-dispute-with-china/
98,Business,2019-03-26T04:16:00.0000000Z,The former Liberal government in Ontario agreed nearly two years ago ... going at the Dryden plant is to be heard later this month by the Supreme Court of Canada. The issues to be resolved by the court in Resolute FP Canada Inc. et al v.,"More than a half century after a river system in northwestern Ontario was contaminated by mercury poisoning from a pulp and paper plant, there are still health problems for members of two First Nations communities who live in the region.

The impact on the Grassy Narrows First Nation and Wabaseemoong Independent Nations has been referred to as one of the country’s worst environmental disasters.

It also continues to be an environmental and health concern in 2019. The former Liberal government in Ontario agreed nearly two years ago to establish a trust fund for remediation actions in the English and Wabigoon Rivers. The new Conservative government of Doug Ford promised last fall to increase disability payments for local residents with health difficulties related to the environmental problems.

As well, a dispute over the meaning of an agreement signed in 1985 between the province and two companies to end litigation stemming from the mercury poisoning and also to keep pulp and paper operations going at the Dryden plant is to be heard later this month by the Supreme Court of Canada.

The issues to be resolved by the court in Resolute FP Canada Inc. et al v. Ontario could have implications in commercial contracts far beyond that of the scope of the 1985 indemnity. It is also another reminder about the importance of precision in contract drafting. “You have to be cautious to avoid boiler plate language,” says Natalie Mullins, a partner at Gowling WLG in Toronto. “You have to address every issue very specifically,” adds Mullins, whose practice focuses on environmental-based litigation.

A central aspect of the upcoming case before the Supreme Court is whether the indemnity clause agreed to by Ontario in the 1985 agreement applied only to third-party claims against two companies or to so-called “direct” claims stemming from the costs of subsequent environmental orders by the province. Also, if an indemnity is in effect for a corporate property owner, the Supreme Court is being asked to clarify what happens to this protection if there is a transfer of control and a provincial government invokes its environmental powers against any entity that was ever attached to the land.

Adding to the somewhat complicated factual history in this dispute is that judges at every level in the litigation have disagreed on the application of the contractual interpretation template set out by the Supreme Court less than five years ago in Sattva Capital Corp. v. Creston Moly Corp.

In some ways, the issues in the case invoke basic principles of contract law. “It goes back to the debate over contractual interpretation — textual or contextual,” notes Paul Davis, a lawyer at Paliare Roland Rosenberg Rothstein LLP in Toronto. “Our Supreme Court has been moving away from a textual interpretation,” says Davis, who is the co-author of a paper in the Canadian Business Law Journal about the issues raised in Resolute as a result of the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal.

The indemnity in 1985 was part of an agreement between the Ontario government and Reed Ltd. and Great Lakes Forest Products Limited. A predecessor company of Reed was responsible in the 1960s for the release of untreated mercury waste into the local river systems. Great Lakes agreed to purchase the Dryden plant in 1979 after the province, which did not want the pulp and paper operations to close, agreed to limit the potential liability from litigation. The deal also required Great Lakes to spend a significant amount of money to upgrade and modernize the plant.

A settlement with the First Nations bands impacted by the pollution was not reached until 1985. As part of a broad agreement with all parties, including First Nations, the federal government and the two companies, the province agreed to an indemnity provision for both Reed and Great Lakes.

The main clause of this provision stated that Ontario would indemnify the companies from “any obligation” as a result of “any claim, action or proceeding, whether statutory or otherwise” that existed in 1979 when the transaction for the pulp and paper operations went through. The scope of the indemnity extended to claims by individuals, companies, the federal government and “any province” as a result of environmental damage caused previously.

Ownership of the pulp and paper operations and control over the waste disposal site had transferred hands a number of times when, in 2011, the Ontario government issued environmental orders to deal with soil erosion and ongoing water testing.

Weyerhaeuser and predecessor companies to Resolute FP Canada Inc. were named in the order and required to compensate the province more than $270,000 to cover the cost of the remediation. The companies were also informed that they were not relieved from being responsible for any future orders related to site, which, in 2011, had an estimated lifespan of another 35 years.

Weyerhaeuser was named in the order as a result of it owning the property for two years, from 1998 to 2000. Through a number of corporate consolidations over the years, Resolute could be linked back to Great Lakes, one of the two companies that signed the agreement with Ontario in 1985.

The companies named in the order were not responsible for the mercury poisoning, but the powers of the province are quite broad under the Environmental Protection Act, explains Mullins. “To address contamination, the ministry can reach back in time. You just have to have some association with the land and you continue to be exposed even after you sell it,” she says.

Weyerhaeuser initiated an action against the province in 2013 and Resolute was added as a party to the litigation. Superior Court Justice Glenn Hainey ruled that the indemnity was not restricted to third-party claims, as Ontario argued.

“The province wanted to protect Dryden’s economy and encouraged Great Lakes to continue the pulp and paper operation in Dryden and to invest a great deal of money in upgrading the operation. It was well known that the disposal site posed a serious environmental liability,” the judge wrote. “Under the circumstances, it would be commercially absurd to conclude that the parties contemplated that the province could at any time withdraw its commitment to protect Great Lakes and its successors from environmental liability arising from the disposal site,” he added.

The province appealed that decision and, in a 2-1 ruling, the Court of Appeal upheld the finding that the indemnity applied to direct claims. However, the majority also ruled that the predecessor company to Resolute had assigned its benefit to Weyerhaeuser in1998. It also concluded that the motions judge should determine if Weyerhaeuser transferred its benefit when it sold the Dryden mill and other assets in 2007 to another company.

On the first issue of whether the 1985 indemnity was restricted to third-party claims, all three judges referred to the Supreme Court’s decision in Sattva and the instruction to consider the “factual matrix” when deciding the intent of the parties in a contract.

Justice David Brown, with Justice Peter Lauwers concurring, also highlighted this section of the Supreme Court ruling. “While the surrounding circumstances will be considered in interpreting the terms of a contract, they must never be allowed to overwhelm the words of that agreement,” noted Brown.

“I see no legal error in the motion judge’s statement that the interpretation of a contract should start with the language of the contract. That is the logical place to start, especially since the jurisprudence requires the interpreter of a contract to determine the parties’ intention in accordance with the language they use,” wrote Brown.

The majority found that Hainey did not commit a “palpable and overriding error” in his interpretation of the contract and that, depending on the language used, an indemnity can cover direct claims.

Justice John Laskin issued a dissenting judgment and suggested that Hainey’s analysis was in error.

“The motion judge’s starting point for interpreting the 1985 indemnity was to look at the words of the document in isolation, and then only secondarily at the ‘surrounding circumstances.’ His two-stage approach to the interpretation of the 1985 indemnity is not the proper approach. Context controls meaning,” wrote Laskin, who ruled in favour of Ontario on whether the indemnity applied to direct claims.

Ontario and the two companies all sought leave to appeal different aspects of the Ontario Court of Appeal decision. Leave was granted last fall.

Douglas Sarro, a lawyer and co-author with Davis of the paper on the case and its legal issues, says he believes Laskin’s judgment is more in line with the way the Supreme Court has suggested to go about interpreting these kinds of agreements. “I think the Supreme Court is going to have to remind the courts below about the approach it set out in Sattva,” says Sarro, senior advisor, research and regulatory innovation at the Ontario Securities Commission (his comments are not on behalf of the OSC).

“Given the structure of this indemnity, it makes more sense to me as one that covered third-party claims,” Sarro says, in part because of other aspects of the agreement that was signed in 1985 by the provincial and federal governments, the companies and First Nations.

There is not a lot of Canadian case law on the scope of indemnities in circumstances such as the Weyerhaeuser/Resolute case. In their law paper, the lawyers also argue that the majority did not follow the approach of other jurisdictions, both in the United States and some Commonwealth countries, in determining whether the indemnity covered third-party claims. Broad language on its own is not enough to expand the scope of an indemnity without considering the context, they write.

Not surprisingly, the Ontario government is in agreement with the analysis conducted by Laskin in his dissent on whether the indemnity applied to direct claims. “Further, the Court of Appeal ought to have corrected the motion judge’s conclusion that the 1985 indemnity was a business agreement. The settlement was not commercial in nature. It reflected a policy objective to address concerns arising from the mercury contamination,” state Ontario lawyers Leonard Marsello, Tamara Barclay and Nansy Ghobrial in written submissions filed with the Supreme Court.

Agreements with government are different than contracts solely between private-sector entities, they argue, because of the public interest requirements. “Absent express language, courts should not imply an obligation to compensate for breach of contract resulting from future legislation,” they write.

Resolute, in its written submissions, suggests the issues before the court are not actually complex. “In 1979 and again in 1985, the province of Ontario gave indemnities to Great Lakes Forest Products Limited. It gave those indemnities to persuade Great Lakes to buy and invest $200 million in a pulp and paper mill, to settle environmental litigation with First Nations bands and to save the economy of Dryden, a single industry town. . . . [B]ut in 2011, when environmental liabilities arose from the buried mercury, Ontario sought to renege from its bargain,” write Andrew Bernstein, Jeremy Opolsky and Jonathan Silver at Torys LLP.

In his dissent, Laskin did not address whether the companies involved in the litigation still enjoyed the benefit of the indemnity, because he found it only ever applied to third-party claims.

The finding by the majority that the benefit had extinguished over time through the various commercial transactions is criticized by both companies in their written submissions before the Supreme Court, on the basis of failing to apply the standard principles of contractual interpretation. “Those principles required the court to consider the wording of the enurement provision in the context of the indemnity as a whole, the factual matrix, and the principle that commercially unreasonable results should be avoided,” write Weyerhaeuser’s lawyers Christopher Bredt, Markus Kremer and Alannah Fotheringham at Borden Ladner Gervais LLP.

The finding by the majority in the Court of Appeal ruling that more evidence is required to determine if Weyerhaeuser “lost” the benefit of the indemnity in the 2007 sale of the Dryden plant leads to a “commercially absurd result,” they argue. “It would be very difficult for an indemnitee to sell a contaminated property if a purchaser knows that it will be exposed to liability upon becoming the property’s owner. By the same token, few owners would be willing to sell a contaminated property if they know that, by doing so, they will lose the benefit of the indemnity,” they state.

If you are indemnified only while you hold title to the property and theindemnity, but once you sell and assign it you are opened up to an order “doesn’t seem to be a reasonable commercial outcome,” says Mullins. “The ministry would be potentially getting a windfall.” When draftingindemnityagreements, it is important to make clear what you are protected from and who is protected, Mullins adds.

Depending on how the Supreme Court rules in this case, it may be necessary for legal departments to revisit past agreements to determine the scope of an indemnity, says Michael Barbero, a lawyer at McLennan Ross LLP in Calgary, whose practice focuses on environmental law and regulatory compliance.

“Identify whether the agreement has a robust definition of claim, such that you can ascertain whether direct claims, third-party claims or both are captured by the agreement. Then identify whether the commercial context is relevant and worth arguing,” says Barbero.

Davis agrees that reviewing past indemnity agreements may be worthwhile. “You may have to go back and look and see what other sections of the contract say,” he adds. In future agreements, “if the intention is to limit it to third-party claims, use that express language,” Davis says.",Risky business: what is the scope of your indemnity?,Canadian Lawyer Magazine,https://www.canadianlawyermag.com/author/shannon-kari/risky-business-what-is-the-scope-of-your-indemnity-17014/

The “Pardon Truck,” run by the Cannabis Amnesty campaign and licensed cannabis producer DOJA, parked outside the Vancouver Public Library where its small crew of petitioners geared up to collect 10,000 signatures to take to Ottawa.

They spoke with passersby near their ornately decorated “jam van” about their call for policy-makers to pass legislation that goes beyond pardons, and instead expunges simple possession convictions from criminal records.

Before legalization on Oct. 17 last year, people convicted of simple possession could face up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. In 2016, 17,733 people were charged with cannabis possession, down 3,600 from 2015, according to Statistics Canada.

On March 1, Minister of Public Safety Ralph Goodale tabled Bill C-93 to provide no-cost, expedited pardons for simple possession (up to 30 grams) of cannabis. The bill scraps a $631 application fee and five-year waiting period for a pardon after conviction.

But NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and NDP MP Murray Rankin have repeatedly called for expungement instead of pardons for convictions on possession crimes that longer exist in law. Rankin’s Bill C-415 to establish a procedure for expungement, tabled last October, found the support of People’s Party of Canada Leader Maxime Bernier.

The “Pardon Truck” people also believes Goodale’s bill doesn’t go far enough.

“We actually want an expungement, which is completely destroying the record,” said David Duarte, with DOJA. “This will never be brought up again and we can kind of help those people move forward with their lives.”

Duarte said the truck, which did a similar tour last fall, will also stop in Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg and Toronto. Organizers are also soliciting signatures at pardon.life and cannabisamnesty.ca.

Sarah Leamon, a Vancouver criminal defence lawyer, said that a pardon still considers a person culpable for committing an offence, but acknowledges that they have been reintegrated into society and “no longer need to have the label of criminal.” Police officers and border officials can still see the conviction on their record but employers or landlords will not find it during background checks, Leamon said.

“What an expungement says is you were convicted of this criminal act but you never should have been,” Leamon said. “You are not morally culpable for it, this never should have been a crime, we were wrong to have prosecuted it and it was an unjust conviction, essentially.”

Leamon said expungements are rare and most often used in historical prosecutions against LGBTQ people.

She has heard arguments that people fighting past simple possession charges knew they were breaking the law before legalization. Those convictions still carry a moral culpability, in some people’s minds, Leamon said.

On the other hand, some people have been saddled with criminal records for trying to access cannabis for medical purposes, she said.

“I do applaud the Liberal government for recognizing this as something that’s very important, this issue of pardons and amnesty,” she said.

“But I think that there are some arguments to be made that it doesn’t go far enough. I would personally like to see more cannabis-related convictions being eligible for this expedited pardon system, and I would also like them to consider expungements in some cases.”

Outside the library, many people stopped to ask about the truck and petition.

David Stewart, who works for an education company, said he supported the push for expungement.

“I work a job where I send people to go teach English overseas and I’ve had to turn great people away because they have just a minor criminal possession of marijuana (charge),” he said. “It’s long overdue.”

Stewart believes cannabis is relatively harmless, when compared to alcohol, and people shouldn’t be punished for using it.

“We all know that it’s a disproportionate amount of people that are affected that are people of colour, from our First Nations community, so I think to have expungement is just kind of righting the wrongs of the past with cannabis rules,” he said.

Thomas Jordan, who works in hospitality, said a pardon still leaves a person with a “monkey on their back” for life.

“If there’s still a record of what people have done in the past, people can still look it up — like our friends across the border — and cause inconvenience and nonsense,” he said.

“I think they need to just get rid of any record of any contact with the product, because it shouldn’t have been illegal to start with.”

But Liberal members on the committee say they’re not convinced.,"An all-party committee of the legislature delivered recommendations Tuesday on how best to handle ride-hailing in B.C. and is recommending the government allow drivers with Class 5 licences to get behind the wheel.

The committee was asked to deal with specific issues after the government changed laws in 2018 to pave the way for app-based ride-hailing services. Other key recommendations delivered to the legislature include eliminating boundaries for where passengers can be picked up, no limits on fleet size and establishing minimum pricing.

The transportation minister said she’s willing to be flexible on those issues, but not on who gets behind the wheel.

“I will not move on Class 4 licences,” Claire Trevena told reporters in Victoria. “I think people's safety is paramount and Class 4 adds to that safety.”

Asked several times for evidence that shows safety is increased, Trevena stated the commercial licences mean additional safety.

But Liberal members on the committee say they’re not convinced.

“Parents send their children in cars with other parents on field trips and they don't worry that that driver doesn't have a Class 4 license,” said Stephanie Cadieux, who insisted Class 4 licences would be prohibitive for Uber.

The report referred to Alberta and Nova Scotia having Class 4 licences.

They tend to be more intensive to get and cost more. Critics say that will lead to fewer drivers.

In a statement, Uber said Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario allow the more common Class 5 licences. The company wants B.C. to consider the same.

Uber Canada’s Michael van Hemmen wasn’t ready to say what a Class 4 requirement would mean for the company.

“Uber has to see the full regulations before we can comment about whether we can apply or launch,” he told CTV.

Regulations and insurance options are being developed. After that, companies will be able to apply to get ride-hailing vehicles on the road.

The opposition claimed with so much work left to do, a 2019 timeline is unrealistic, and suggested the spring of 2020 is more likely.

Premier François Legault said it’s necessary to protect “our identity.” And a poll conducted after the bill was presented suggests he was right when he claimed the support of the “vast majority” of the people.

So, if fear of “outsiders” doesn’t explain the anti-hijab bill, what does?

“The Quiet Revolution” is the usual answer, referring to the modernization of Quebec starting in the 1960s.

Supposedly, that’s when French-speaking Quebecers turned against a Roman Catholic Church that had oppressed them for centuries, and against religion in general.

This argument has been made by, among others, Gérard Bouchard, co-chair of the province’s 2007-08 commission on religious accommodations, in a recent article in La Presse.

Or, the explanation is “Quebec liberalism,” from a study arguing that liberal social values in this province are different from those in the rest of Canada.

The study notes that in the RoC, social liberals are likely to oppose restrictions on the wearing of minority religious symbols, while in Quebec, they’re likely to support them. But it doesn’t address the question of whether this Quebec liberalism also applies to symbols of the majority, and if not, why not.

This brings us back to the Quiet Revolution.

Usually, revolutionaries are quick to take down or change the symbols of their oppressors, such as their flag, or their monuments.

Or their place names. In Quebec, there has been a tendency to replace English names with French ones approved by a government commission created in 1977 by the language law, Bill 101.

So, the predominantly English-speaking town founded as Montreal West no longer officially exists by that name. Now it’s Montréal-Ouest.

Someone who doesn’t know this province but who reads Bouchard’s history of relations between Quebecers and the Church might expect Catholic symbols here to have received similar treatment.

Related

To explain why Quebecers are “generally less open” than other Canadians to “expressions of religion,” Bouchard described how the Catholic high clergy had oppressed them.

It had betrayed them by collaborating with the British conquerors of New France in return for power. Over the next two centuries, it had used that power to keep the French-Canadians in ignorance, suppress their freedom, and resist their social progress, in particular reducing women to bearers of children.

And yet, despite all this, there has been no movement to, say, remove statues of the Virgin Mary from in front of “non-denominational” public schools, or change the schools’ religious names.

Or to remove the 10,000 “Saints,” 2,329 “Saintes,” and 648 “Notre-Dames” still in the place-names commission’s name bank.

Religious names are still so “abundant” in Quebec, says the commission, that to reduce “confusion,” it prefers “secular” new ones.

But the CAQ bill stipulates that the legislation couldn’t be used to have the courts change the names, or other symbols of Quebec’s “religious cultural heritage.”

One of those symbols is the National Assembly crucifix. After the bill was presented, the Assembly unanimously voted to have it removed.

But that was only after it was shamed into it by Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante’s announcement of the removal of the crucifix from the city council chamber.

And before the government presented the crucifix motion, it ensured it had the opposition’s support, so that no party would gain a partisan advantage by opposing it.

It wasn’t responding to public pressure. On the contrary, polls suggest that, while most Quebecers don’t want to see government employees wearing religious symbols, especially minority ones, they do want to keep the crucifix in the Assembly.

This must make them the only liberated people in history who want to preserve the symbols of their former oppressors.

What they want is the selective secularism that’s been called “Catho-laicity”: secularism for others, but not for themselves.

So, neither the Quiet Revolution nor Quebec liberalism is a convincing explanation for the CAQ bill.

Then what else can it be?

Mackenzie said people will be looking for a party “committed 101 per cent to make things happen.”,"Northern Indigenous leaders are welcoming the federal budget decision to erase debt incurred from land claims and treaty negotiations with the Canadian government.

They say that instead of repaying the federal government, that money can now be reinvested in programs, wellness, governance and youth.

Chiefs from the Dehcho, Inuvialuit, Gwich’in, Sahtu, Tlicho and South Slave regions were in Detah on Tuesday to meet with Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations Carolyn Bennett.

The Liberal government earmarked $1.4-billion over seven years for loan forgiveness across Canada in the 2019 federal budget.

Yellowknives Dene First Nation Chief Ernest Betsina said the decision is welcomed.

“This forgiveness grant will be provided to our future generations … and provide more opportunities that can support First Nations,” he said.

Betsina said past federal cutbacks under previous governments affected core funding, negotiations, language planning and housing.

Loan system to negotiate land claims not ‘successful’

In 2018, the federal government adopted a grant system to capture the “actual costs of self-government,” Bennett said.

The 2019 budget also sets aside $40 million over five years for First Nations to research and develop claims.

“Getting to self-government shouldn’t be based on loans anymore. People spending 20 years and then $30-million in debt to not quite get there, has just not been successful,” she said.

Negotiation on a loan basis was a hard-sell for communities, she said.

“If people don’t feel that things are fair then it’s pretty hard for them to get their communities behind them to do the work,” Bennett said.

‘Long ways to go’

Tlicho Grand Chief George Mackenzie told Bennett self-government will improve the future for young Indigenous people.

“Us in the Aboriginal world have a long ways to go yet, but we will not get there if we don’t have the federal support that we are seeking,” he said.

As the federal election approaches, Mackenzie said people will be looking for a party “committed 101 per cent to make things happen.”

“Our young people today, everywhere, are crying for help … we lack resources … we lack the funding,” he said.

Other negotiations proceeding

Yellowknives Dene Chief Ernest Betsina announced that Akaitcho First Nations could have an agreement in principle this year. They have been negotiating since 1992.

Grand Chief Gladys Norwegian reminded Bennett that the Dehcho First Nations have been in talks with Canada for nearly 20 years, and negotiations are stalled over surface and subsurface resource rights.

The Dehcho First Nations want to temporarily set aside land and resources and work on issues like education and self-government, Norwegian said.

“We are trying to decide how that looks like for us. It is a struggle and we really would like to move forward, but make sure that it is on our terms, that we are moving toward self-determination,” Norwegian said.

Meanwhile, K’atl’odeeche First Nation Chief April Martel says the community is leaning toward self-government, but has concerns about keeping reserve status under the Indian Act.

“That’s really powerful to our people because we don’t want to lose that. I want you to recognize that,” she said to Bennett.

TORONTO—As her office is shuttered by the provincial government, Ontario’s environment commissioner is again warning voters about the Tories’ “frightening” and “inadequate” climate and environment policies.

In tabling her final report to the legislature on Wednesday, Commissioner Dianne Saxe told reporters “Ontario was doing many things right and is basically stopping doing those things.”

[READ MORE: McKenna chides Ford government for carbon tax double speak]

From the axing of the provincial carbon price last year to the cancellation of electricity conservation programs announced last week, Saxe said Premier Doug Ford’s government is “cutting off our nose to spite our face.”

For example, her final report on energy conservation finds that abandoning electricity conservation post-2020 will add about two megatonnes of greenhouse gas emissions annually by 2030.

She said that will offset much of the greenhouse gas emissions reductions the government plans to find in the natural gas sector. That work is supposed to reduce emissions by 3.2 megatonnes by 2030.

Ultimately Saxe finds that by pushing up fossil fuel use, the government will increase energy bills, air pollution, health impacts and greenhouse gas emissions.

“At a time when climate damage is accelerating, Ontario is turning away from the things that we know work,” Saxe said.

Adding that Ontario’s policies are “very inadequate” and “very frightening.”

The province eliminated the energy conservation programs connected to the electricity grid last week as it tries to pair down electricity bills and meet its election promise to lower electricity rates by another 12 per cent.

However, Environment Minister Rod Phillips told reporters that the changes in conservation programs were done to focus conservation where there are emissions, and because Ontario’s electrical grid relies on green energy like hydro and nuclear it’s not worth focusing on those areas.

“Our focus is on working where there’s going to be the biggest impact,” Phillips said.

Last fall the Ford government lowered Ontario’s emissions targets to bring them in line with those set by the Trudeau Liberals.

[READ MORE: Ford government weakens Ontario’s emissions targets]

Ontario plans to reduce emissions by 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. That target is far less aggressive than the previous Liberal plan to reduce Ontario’s emissions by 37 per cent below 1990 levels by 2030.

Phillips told reporters the plan he unveiled last fall, after axing cap-and-trade will meet the new emission goals.

“We have a very clear plan that will get us to that 30 per cent target,” Phillips said. “We will hit the targets that the federal government set.”

Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner disagreed with the minister’s optimism, saying that experts find the new climate change policy wanting.

“Every expert that you talk to, whether economist or climate scientist, has said that the environment plan that was released last fall by this government, will not meet Ontario’s greenhouse gas reduction commitments,” Schreiner said.

Saxe said that the introduction next week of the federal carbon tax could offset some of the changes Ontario is making. But she cautioned that with a fall election the carbon tax doesn’t have a certain future.

Because Canada is among the world’s top 10 emitters, she said what happens here could jeopardize the international agreement on climate change.

“What we’re doing in Ontario, and what we may do in Canada this year, puts the entire Paris Agreement at risk. And if the world can’t hold together on the Paris Agreement, we are toasted, roasted and grilled.”

Confirming the bill to be tabled Thursday will invoke the notwithstanding clause contained in both the Canadian and Quebec charter of rights, Legault said it won’t be the first time a Quebec or Canadian premier makes use of the option.

“Yes, it’s not a small thing,” Legault told reporters. “It’s a big decision but sometimes in order to protect collective rights we have to use it. It has been used at least 40 times by different premiers, including Robert Bourassa.

“It’s never an easy decision. I think we have to protect our identity.”

Asked if minorities don’t deserve the same kind of protection, Legault said state secularism has to be visible and not just be something on paper.

“I think it is important to separate religion and politics in Quebec,” he said. “For many years now there has been a distinction between the government and religion. It has to be shown, especially for people representing the government and being in an authority position.”

The move means that, like previous regimes, the Coalition Avenir Québec government is stepping deeper into the turbulent world of identity politics at its own peril and in the belief that this is what Quebecers want.

“I think we have the support of the vast majority of Quebecers,” Legault said.

He said he anticipates some groups will not be happy about the government’s use of the clause as a way to protect its decision to ban certain authority figures, including teachers, from wearing religious symbols such as the hijab, kippah, crucifix and turban from court challenges.

He said he recognizes the clause has a five-year shelf life but speculated that by then people may be satisfied with the government’s decision and renewing it will not spark discord.

At the same time, down the hall, the minister responsible for the legislation, Simon Jolin-Barrette, delicately issued an appeal for calm in the divisive debate.

“As a person I am always ready to listen to people,” Jolin-Barrette told reporters. “This said, I don’t want things to heat up. We have a collective responsibility to remain calm.”

Neither Legault or Jolin-Barrette would confirm media reports the government has decided to expand the original list of public servants to be covered by the ban.

Radio-Canada reported Tuesday the government wants to include school principals plus any public sector employee carrying a weapon — for example, people ensuring security in courthouses, and wildlife officers.

They would be added to the list of persons already targeted in the bill, including judges, police officers, Crown prosecutors and elementary and high school teachers.

The government will also unearth a little-known recommendation of the 2008 Bouchard-Taylor report and ban the speaker and deputy-speakers of the National Assembly from wearing symbols.

As for the fate of the crucifix hanging over the speaker’s chair of the legislature, the government has decided not to include it in the bill.

Last week, Legault opened the door to possibly moving the crucifix to a less conspicuous location, after the City of Montreal announced it would remove the crucifix from its council chambers.

Sources say the issue has sparked a heated debate inside the CAQ caucus, which was to discuss the matter again at its weekly caucus meeting here Tuesday evening.

What does seem certain is the government plans to include a so-called grandfather clause in the bill that would recognize acquired rights of employees. That means existing public servants who wear religious symbols would not be in danger of losing their job if they refuse to remove them.

The government says there are about 500 people in the public sector in positions of authority who wear such symbols.

At the CAQ’s pre-session caucus in Gatineau in January, Legault said he would be the one to make the final call on acquired rights because the CAQ caucus of MNAs is split on the idea.

The CAQ’s decision to include an acquired-rights clause appears to be political, designed to woo the support of the opposition Parti Québécois, the only party currently supporting the government’s plan. PQ support would be good optics for a government in a hurry to settle the issue and move on.

On Tuesday, interim PQ leader Pascal Bérubé repeated on Twitter he, too, would like to see the issue wrapped up.

.@PascalBerube: «Il n'y a rien qui va nous faire dévier de la nécessaire volonté de régler cette question ce printemps et de collaborer avec le gouvernement, sans l'assurer de notre vote final, mais on veut vraiment une bonne collaboration là-dessus.» #PQ https://t.co/psdavByOxO — Mathieu Lavigne (@MathieuQC) March 26, 2019

The Liberals, however, predicted a long season of court battles for the CAQ.

“Everything they do is going to court or has gone to court and they lose,” Liberal critic Gaétan Barrette told reporters.

Applying the grandfather clause is no simple matter because it implies having to count who in the public sector already wears religious symbols. That issue got the government in trouble in January when it was revealed senior bureaucrats had started to poll the heads of the education, judiciary and police services to try to come up with a number.

On Tuesday, the Fédération autonome de l’enseignement (FAE) — one of the province’s largest teachers’ federations — announced it is taking the Legault government to court to block any future head count.

“We will defend our members’ right to work tooth and nail,” FAE president Sylvain Mallette told reporters.

Mallette noted the union has never received a grievance over a teacher wearing a religious symbol in the classroom and no study exists linking the wearing of such symbols with students feeling intimidated into assuming the teacher’s beliefs.

“Why are they trying to fix a problem that does not exist in the public schools?” Mallette said. “Would we accept in Quebec that we do a head count based on their sexual orientation? Would we accept that teachers be identified based on their political leanings?

“No. We would not accept this. So why would we accept it that people be identified on the basis of their beliefs when it has absolutely nothing to do with their work?”

However, Legault, Jolin-Barrette and Education Minister Jean-François Roberge told reporters the government has no plans for a head count as the union is alleging.

By Shannon Jones

30 March 2019

Autoworkers are reacting with shock and anger to the announcement Thursday afternoon by Fiat Chrysler that it will lay off the third shift at its Windsor Assembly Plant in Canada. The cuts, to take place September 30, will eliminate about 1,500 jobs. The layoffs are permanent.

The Windsor plant, which builds the Chrysler Pacifica minivan and Dodge caravan, has operated on a three-shift schedule since 1993. The plant is the largest employer in Windsor, which has been devastated by the shutting down of auto production in the city, once called the automotive capital of Canada.

There are about 6,000 workers currently employed at the Windsor plant, which underwent retooling in 2015 to build the Pacifica. The plant can build up to 1,500 vehicles per day.

The job cuts are the latest shock in a wave of global downsizing in the auto industry. This week Ford announced the closure of its three factories in Russia, eliminating some 3,700 jobs. That follows its announcement of 5,000 Ford job cuts in Germany and the announcement by Goodyear-Dunlop of 1,100 job cuts in Germany.

The General Motors Oshawa, Ontario plant is set to close later this year as part of plans by GM to close five North American facilities and axe 15,000 jobs. FCA announced in February that it would lay off 1,300 workers at its Belvidere, Illinois assembly plant this spring.

On April 1, Ford will lay off 1,000 workers at its Flat Rock Assembly Plant south of Detroit.

Unifor officials claim to have been blindsided by the Chrysler layoff announcement. In a press conference Thursday, Windsor Unifor Local 444 President Dave Cassidy downplayed the layoffs, calling the cuts “strictly a business decision based on the Pacifica.” He rejected any comparison to the impending shutdown of the Oshawa GM plant.

Meanwhile, right-wing Ontario Progressive Conservative Premier Doug Ford issued a demagogic statement claiming his administration “stood behind” Fiat Chrysler workers. He went on to boast that his administration was dedicated to boosting corporate profits. “Our government is lowering taxes, lowering electricity rates and slashing red tape. There has never been a better time for auto manufacturers to invest in the province of Ontario,” Ford declared.

The New Democratic Party also issued similar hollow statements of solidarity with Windsor autoworkers, while Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau’s Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development, Navdeep Bains, expressed his “disappointment” with FCA management.

Unifor is above all concerned with blocking an independent mobilization by workers against the devastating job cuts. Unifor officials moved in quickly to suppress a sitdown protest by Oshawa workers over the impending closure in January.

In place of a united struggle across national borders to defend jobs, Unifor has promoted a filthy anti-Mexican boycott aimed at pitting US and Canadian workers against their brothers to the south, who staged a historic walkout against maquiladora plants in Matamoros, Mexico earlier this year.

On March 19, Unifor President Jerry Dias suspended the union’s publicity campaign against the closure of the Oshawa plant after GM agreed to continue talks on the Oshawa shutdown. After initial bluster, Dias has now predictably accepted the closure of the Oshawa plant, seeking at most the maintenance of a skeleton crew along with more early retirement buyouts.

A worker at Windsor Assembly, who wished to remain anonymous due to concerns over possible retaliation, spoke to the WSWS Autoworker Newsletter about the layoff announcement.

“They [Unifor] knew about it. They had to know. The writing was on the wall. Orders are very low. We have a two-week layoff coming up starting next week.

“There has been too much going on in the plant. I find it ironic that talks with FCA in the US are coming up. I can see them being asked to take cuts. Unifor may try to save the third shift off our backs.”

The worker said that some 2,500 workers at the plant would not be eligible for supplemental unemployment benefits (SUB) that replace a portion of lost wages in the event of layoff.

“If they didn’t work us to death with overtime, we would be ok. We were working overtime until last summer, then it abruptly stopped.”

There are hundreds of temporary part time workers (TPTs) at Windsor Assembly. They earn about $15 an hour less than senior workers and have no recall rights and are not eligible for SUB. Under terms of the FCA-Unifor contract, TPT workers are only supposed to work Friday, Saturday and Monday. However, Unifor has permitted management to use TPT workers six days a week.

The Windsor plant has already been temporarily shutdown twice this year to “align production with demand.” The FCA Brampton plant also faces a temporary shutdown.

Asked about Premier Ford’s claim to oppose the layoffs, the Windsor Assembly worker replied, “PC, NDP, Liberal, they are all the same.”

Sales of the Pacifica, which retails for around $60,000, have been lagging as consumers opt for less pricey vehicles. A February report showed that sales of the Pacifica were down 60 percent.

Fiat Chrysler reported $4.1 billion in profits in 2018, up 3 percent, due to record global sales of its Jeep and Ram vehicles. Sales were up more than 15 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018.

In moving forward with the plant closures, Fiat Chrysler is answering the call of wealthy investors, who are demanding a greater rate of profit be extracted off the sweat and toil of workers.

Unifor will use the threat of impending layoffs to attempt to browbeat Chrysler workers into accepting further concessions. Just as it is trying to separate the fight of Oshawa and Windsor autoworkers, Unifor is seeking to stoke up anger against workers in the US and Mexico in order to divide and weaken the fight of autoworkers.

The experience of the past 40 years has demonstrated that the program of concessions endlessly promoted by the unions has never saved a single job. No credence either can be given to the professions of support by the big business politicians.

Only the independent political and industrial mobilization of the working class can defend jobs. Workers must advance a program based on the defense of workers’ needs, not the profit interests of the corporations, including the abolition of tiers, the hiring of all TPT workers as full time and the recall of laid off workers.

The Steering Committee of the Coalition of Rank-and-File Committees and the WSWS Autoworker Newsletter organized a February 9 demonstration at GM headquarters in Detroit against plant shutdowns. It called for the building of rank-and-file factory committees independent of the UAW and Unifor and the unity of US, Canadian and Mexican workers in a common struggle to defend jobs.

We urge Windsor Assembly workers to contact the WSWS Autoworker Newsletter to discuss the waging of such a fight.

His party announced on Friday that if elected, they would usher in an Alberta Constitution, a legal framework that would provide more rights to residents, even beyond those in Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

“[It] would include rights to reasonable firearm ownership. Free speech as our most supreme right that can’t be overridden by other Charter issues. Rights to self-defence and defence of property and property rights itself,” he said in an interview with CTV News. “These are very important rights that have been excluded from the federal Charter and provinces have the right to their own Constitutions, so we’re calling for the creation of an Alberta Constitution.”

He says the RCMP has misclassified a number of different firearms on the market, notably the semi-automatic AR-15.

“The AR-15 looks like a scary weapon but it’s essentially if you took a Ford Taurus and put fire stripes on it, it would look like a more badass car than it really is. There are rifles like that are just misclassified because they look scary.”

Fildebrandt says his government would also do more to make sure that people who work in the backcountry on a regular basis would have the protection they need against dangerous predators, provided they are properly trained, screened and have their credentials kept up to date.

“We are not proposing the Wild West here, but we are talking … if you’re a mountain climber; some of my family members are mountain climbers [and] they’ve come across grizzly bears and cougars. We’re talking about a very reasonable expanding of protective measures for people.”

The expanded laws the FCP is proposing also includes more property rights, something that Fildebrandt says would have dealt with the situation faced by an Okotoks farmer a lot faster than it had been.

“It shouldn’t take political pressure to stop this kind of wrongful prosecution, so we propose, in an Alberta Constitution, to add property rights, self-defence and to instruct our Crown prosecutors to stop wasting their time and their resources on victims and go after the people who are actually attacking their property.”

Devon Martin, a competitive shooter who lives in Calgary, says he started out by hunting with his father and has experience with shooting a number of different firearms.

“I own multiple semi-automatic sporting rifles, some bolt action hunting rifles as well as some semi-automatic handguns and I’ve had revolvers too.”

He says many people he knows are touchy about any change in legislation, particular those that could turn a law-abiding gun owner into a criminal overnight.

“A lot of guys have had issues with 10-22 magazines. It’s a .22 long rifle magazine that had a capacity of 25 rounds. But it fit into something else, so they kiboshed that and made it prohibited to have anything over 10. That made a lot of people overnight, criminals.”

Jason Kenney, speaking in Calgary on Thursday, said Albertans who live in rural communities are particularly vulnerable and something more needs to be done to protect them.

“We do not encourage vigilantism, we strongly discourage that. But we do think the unique vulnerability of people in very remote areas should be at least one thing the Crown counsel takes into account.”

He adds that the ability of police to protect someone in an incident should also be considered.

Fildebrandt, who admits to owning as many guns as he likes, says everyone he knows is responsible with their firearms.

“I’m a handgun owner, many Albertans are handgun owners. The vast majority of us store and keep our handguns very safely; we comply with the law.”

The election is scheduled to take place on April 16.

Global News received a tip about concerning Facebook posts shared by Keith Parrill, the FCP’s candidate in Lacombe-Ponoka. One post that caused concern showed a meme about Justin Trudeau with a punchline that involves dousing him in gasoline. The other is a doctored video which shows former U.S. president Barack Obama admitting he was born in Kenya, supporting a debunked conspiracy theory popularized by U.S. President Donald Trump.

The post Parrill shared about Trudeau tells a joke about a driver stuck in a traffic jam on Highway 2 near Red Deer. A man knocks on the driver’s window and tells him that “terrorists have kidnapped Justin Trudeau and they’re asking for $100 million or they will douse him with gasoline and set him on fire.” He then asks the driver for a donation and when the driver asks how much other people are giving, the man tells him “roughly a gallon.”

Watch below: (From January 2019) One of the groups behind the Yellow Vest movement in Canada had its Facebook page taken down, but within a few hours, it was back up. Mercedes Stephenson looks at what happened.

The joke about Trudeau was shared by Parrill on Dec. 19, 2018 and the video about Obama was shared on Dec. 31, 2018.

The FCP declined to comment further on either post, but indicated the Trudeau post had been removed from Parrill’s Facebook account. Global News was unable to verify this as Parrill’s account can no longer be found in a Facebook search.

Global News has asked the FCP for Parrill’s contact information in order to get comment from him. His contact information was not visible on either the FCP website or the Elections Alberta site.

The FCP is a new libertarian conservative party started by former UCP MLA Derek Fildebrandt. The 2019 election will be the first one for the party.

Earlier this week, the FCP removed two candidates; one for anti-Islamic comments and the other for anti-immigrant comments.

Duane Bratt, a political scientist at Calgary’s Mount Royal University suggested it’s not clear to him what the party finds acceptable for a candidate.

“That’s pretty outlandish for a candidate,” Bratt said of the joke about Trudeau. “I mean, those are common statements, unfortunately, that I have seen by conservative trolls. But it’s one thing to be a Facebook or Twitter troll and it’s another to be a candidate for office.

“I can just imagine if this had been a UCP candidate, what the reaction would have been. But the FCP seems to have a much lower standard for bad behaviour.”

Bratt pointed out that Alberta NDP Leader Rachel Notley has been the butt of violent jokes before, like when former Wildrose leader Brian Jean joked about the law preventing him from assaulting her or a man using a photo of Notley’s face as a golfball target. In both of those cases the men apologized.

“People have gotten into trouble for those things in the past… [and] the defence for people is just, ‘I was joking. I was kidding. No big deal,'” Bratt said.

Bratt said the Parrill case is a reminder that candidates need to be mindful of what they post on social media and that parties need to do a better job of vetting their candidates.

“[These jokes and conversations] are now public and available to see and that’s why we’re seeing growing problems with people having it discovered,” he said. “Which is why parties have tried to vet their candidates either by more carefully selecting them or getting them to airbrush or remove questionable material from the past.

“What this says about the Freedom Conservative Party is either as a brand new, small party, do they have the capacity to do that?

This, according to a new analysis of public opinion polling data by the non-profit Angus Reid Institute. The data was donated to ARI by Angus Reid Global Public Affairs.

The Conservatives capture 37 per cent of the decided and leaning vote – essentially unchanged from where they stood last month – but it is the governing Liberals who have dropped three points to 28 per cent as the SNC-Lavalin affair has remained in the headlines.

The principal beneficiaries of this decline in Liberal support appear to be the New Democratic Party and smaller parties, including the Green Party and the People’s Party of Canada.

These parties are seeing their fortunes rise as the Canadian public expresses unfavourable views of the main parties and their leaders.

Woywitka said he knows one social ...","Alberta’s upstart libertarian conservative party, led by former UCP MLA Derek Fildebrandt, says it has replaced two candidates in the upcoming election — one over anti-Islamic social media posts and views, the other for “controversial posts.”

Clayton Knutson

According to a the Freedom Conservative Party’s director of communications, Clayton Knutson was asked to resign as its candidate in Innisfail-Sylvan Lake and was officially removed on March 18 when he wouldn’t step down.

“He had failed to disclose previous information on his candidate nomination package and that includes… financial, personal and prior social media posts,” Cody Johnston told Global News on Tuesday. “We are a small and mighty party and we do our best to make sure that we vet our candidates properly before they get on the paper, and we do expect them to follow the honour system and it was found out that Clayton had failed to disclose controversial and quite frankly, Islamophobic posts in the past.”

When interviewed by Global News, Knutson said he believes a true libertarian party should not kick him out because he is critical of Islam.

“You have to be Shariah-compliant if you’re going to run for a party in Alberta,” he said. “I criticized people that will use the word Islamophobia because I don’t believe in Islamophobia. I think nobody has a phobia if they are actually criticizing Islam. It’s all about: you can’t criticize Islam.

“They asked for my resignation. I said, ‘Absolutely not,’ because they’re saying stuff like, ‘You’re a racist,’ and I’m not a racist, I’m in an interracial marriage.”

Knutson said he was turned off by the UCP after that party turfed a nomination candidate over photos he took with the far-right group Soldiers of Odin. He said he believed the Freedom Conservatives would allow its prospective candidates to have more freedom in their comments and associations.

Watch below: (From October 2018) Rachel Notley responds to the UCP disqualifying Lance Coulter after comments about the Soldiers of Odin.

Johnston said while the Freedom Conservative Party does see itself as a party of conservative libertarians,”there’s no place for Islamophobia in any party… and no one’s going to stand for that type of stuff.”

“He’s truly doubled down in the last few days, trying to prove that he is a racist and he is Islamophobic and I find his comments to be deplorable and we absolutely wholeheartedly reject them.”

Since being removed as the Freedom Conservatives’ candidate, Knutson has been active on Twitter, posting about Islam and saying he would vote for Caylan Ford, who recently resigned as a UCP candidate over comments about race and white supremacist terrorists; Eva Kiryakos, who recently resigned as a UCP candidate for comments she made about gender-neutral washrooms and a post she shared about refugees; and Todd Beasley, who was prevented from running for the UCP after social media posts were discovered in which he said of Islam that he hoped someone in history would have “snuffed this evil cult when they had the chance.”

“I think Mr. Knutson is unfit to be a politician in the province of Alberta,” Johnston said. “We need to be standing up against hate and intolerance and I know that he said we’re a bad libertarian party for not protecting his freedom of speech, but I argue he’s a bad conservative for failing to stand up against terrorism.”

Knutson said he has “the best intentions for every individual Muslim” and that he hopes “they have great lives.”

“But taking away my free speech with regards to religion just because I want to be a political candidate I think is very cowardly of the Freedom Conversative Party.”

Wade Woywitka

On Tuesday, the Freedom Conservative Party confirmed Wade Woywitka, who had been its candidate in Vermilion-Lloydminster-Wainwright, was asked to resign by the party which Woywitka did.

“It was a similar situation [to Knutson’s],” Johnston said when asked why Woywitka was asked to step down. “[He] had made some controversial posts.”

Johnston said he couldn’t immediately elaborate but Woywitka told Global News he believes his involvement in the Yellow Vest movement and views he has expressed on immigrants prompted the call for him to resign.

“[Things were brought up by another party about] stuff I said on the internet about our Yellow Vest movement and of course, as soon as you’re part of the Yellow Vests, you’re painted as a racist and every other thing in the book because we’re against the UN and we want pipelines built and everybody to get back to work,” he said.

“They were taking… just stuff I had said… interviews I had done in Ottawa (when the United We Roll convoy arrived there), and picking and choosing what they wanted to use out of context.”

Watch below: (From February 2019) A pro-pipeline convoy arrived at Parliament Hill Tuesday. Kendra Slugoski and Mike Le Couteur have more on the issues the protesters from across Canada want addressed.

Woywitka said he knows one social media post — that he said he made years ago — in particular helped bring about the end of his candidacy.

“It was in regards to all the immigrants coming in and I said, ‘Yeah, we need someone like (Donald) Trump to keep all the foreigners out of our country because they’re taking over and they’re ruining our country for our children,” he recounted.

“I talked to Derek and he just said, ‘There’s all these things they’re saying about you,’ and I just told him… ‘I’m not doing it (running as a candidate any longer) cause I’m not taking down the Yellow Vest movement for anything.'”

However, Woywitka said he plans to continue to support the Freedom Conservatives going forward.

“I back them 110 per cent,” he said. “That’s how I’m voting this year… I will back Derek [Fildebrandt] 110 per cent.

“We’re here for one reason and that’s to make our country better and to get our sovereignty back and to be a free nation again and not have some globalist government running our country, and I’m pretty sure that the Freedom Conservative Party and most Albertans have the same views that I do.”

Watch below: (From March 21, 20190 The Freedom Conservative Party launched its 2019 election campaign in Calgary on Thursday.

Woywitka, who indicated he was previously active in the Wildrose Party, said he is not sure if he will run for office again but he hopes all Albertans will vote this election, regardless of what party they support.

Chad Miller has now replaced Knutson as the Freedom Conservatives’ candidate in Innisfail-Sylvan Lake while Matthew Powell has now replaced Woywitka as the party’s candidate in Vermilion-Lloydminster-Wainwright.

Albertans head to the polls on April 16.

110,,2019-03-30T06:17:00.0000000Z,"It’s also important to remember that in the Conservative Party of Canada’s recent past, during the time of Stephen Harper, Canada recorded record high immigration and was focused on winning over immigrant communities. So at this critical juncture ...","The ghastly attacks on two mosques in New Zealand recently show that the rise of far-right extremism has not only proven itself to be a major global threat to peace and security, but also an existential threat to conservatism itself, which has come under heavy fire for breeding, or at least tolerating in its ranks, xenophobic elements.

In a way, the New Zealand attacks may prove to become a pivotal moment for the right-wing.

Though the racism of far-right extremism has long been identified as something real and dangerous, it has also, to a large extent, remained under the radar; something ugly simmering under the surface.

But after 50 people (nearly all visible minorities) were slaughtered at a house of worship, in a modern western nation deemed to be one of the safest in the world, that ugliness has boiled over for the world to see.

What’s now clear is that it’s past time for conservatives to utterly separate themselves from any notion or any segment of their membership base that ascribes even remotely to xenophobic or Islamophobic views. It should go without saying that conservatism is a movement in which racists are not welcome. Unfortunately, this is a message that must now be shouted by conservatives across the world, including here in Canada, where anti-immigrant views have, as of late, begun to stain the brand.

READ MORE: When terror strikes the populist leaders cash in

After the New Zealand mosque attack, the leader of the People’s Party of Canada refused to offer comment (even to denounce it). Similarly, the leader of the Conservative Party’s first statement focused on how “freedom” had come under attack (not Muslims), needing a second try to get it right. The delay left the impression that the Conservative Party feared alienating a kind of voter who may hold anti-immigrant views.

Both parties have also been skeptical of Canada’s signing of the UN’s Global Compact for Migration. The Conservatives have argued that it will erode the sovereignty of our borders, while the PPC says it will open the doors to masses of migrants from poor countries. Both claims seem geared toward stoking fear among anti-immigration voters, and contrary to the reality of the massive value of immigration.

Of course, south of the border, the president of the United States has openly fraternized with far right and white supremacists while routinely raising fears about immigrants, whether it’s about building a wall to keep out Mexicans or imposing a travel ban to keep out Muslims.

It’s as if an element of the right has forgotten, or perhaps has simply not truly understood, that there is a huge difference between “nationalism” and “nation building”.

“Nationalism” as we understand it today, is increasingly a movement based on bigotry and fear-based racism—one that’s often associated with populist far right movements in Europe that have ridden a wave of anti-migrant sentiment. “Nation building” however, is a very different and noble cause; one that is about wanting to make your country great—it is not to be associated with the pettiness of racism, bigotry or Islamophobia at all.

There needs to be a refocus on positive conservatism, a movement that embraces immigration and minorities. After all, immigration is what made the U.S. the dominant power in the world, by welcoming and nurturing the best minds to fuel technology and ingenuity. (Immigrants contribute 10 per cent of America’s annual GDP and are, according to the Brookings Institution, more likely to become Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, and physiology or medicine.)

We’ve seen the immense benefits of immigration here as well, but there’s a lot more potential we have yet to tap into. And conservative thinking should be obsessed with wanting to build Canada up to reach its true greatness.

Conservatism at its best is a movement that champions individual liberties and fiscal responsibility; small government and social values. Campassionate conservatives also believe in helping others, be they refugees or fellow citizens. It’s also important to remember that in the Conservative Party of Canada’s recent past, during the time of Stephen Harper, Canada recorded record high immigration and was focused on winning over immigrant communities.

So at this critical juncture, what is stopping Canadian conservatives from building a party that embraces open doors and offers a safe haven to the world’s most needy, while making Canada an economic powerhouse? Nothing. Because most right of centre voters in Canada are welcoming to refugees and immigrants and would welcome the economic growth and innovation they bring.

This is what the new conservatism, a positive conservatism, can look like. It’s got to be about nation building, not nationalism. It’s got to be about achieving the best for Canada, in a way that includes everybody, and cuts at the root of far-right extremism. It’s time to make a separation between racist nationalism, and the positive, inclusive patriotism of nation building.

Yes, you read that right, Andrew Scheer and his Conservative Party think that it's a good idea to send mass-texts to campaign against the federal government's carbon tax.

This new tactic comes on the heels of new campaign ads released this week that accuses Justin Trudeau of being a ""fake feminist"". Canada's official opposition party is still using classic outreach tactics like television advertising and door-to-door campaigning, but this mass-text initiative is a clever new tactic.

In an apparent effort to modernize the campaigning process, Andrew Scheer and his Conservative government believe this to be the best way to reach a massive amount of voters.

The party is taking phone numbers from various databases and will randomly generate other numbers. So even if you're not a card-carrying Conservative, you might just get a text today.

TL;DR Canada's Conservative Party might just send you a mass-text today to campaign against Justin Trudeau's proposed carbon tax. Andrew Scheer and the Conservative party believe that this controversial initiative is all about utilizing 21st-century methods to help with voter outreach. Critics say that this isn't illegal, but it's definitely unconventional.

@cpc_hqembedded via

You might remember that this isn't the Conservative Party's first foray into using technology to attract voters. In 2011, Stephen Harper's government used robocalls to attract voters and to report fake polling information.

After over 40,000 Canadians reported them to the authorities, the Conservatives quickly backtracked and apologized for using such murky campaigning tactics.

According to a CBC report, the federal carbon tax will kick in on April 1st in four provinces, which will increase gas prices by almost 5 cents per litre. In the House of Commons, Trudeau's government has come under fire because of this proposed carbon tax.

@cpc_hqembedded via

Liberals are quick to point out that 90% of the revenue will return to Canadians, as each household in the affected provinces will be able to claim a tax deduction on the carbon tax.

Conservative provincial governments in Ontario and Saskatchewan are challenging the plan in provincial courts, claiming that the carbon tax is unconstitutional.

One of the texts will read ""Andrew Scheer here. Trudeau's carbon tax will raise gas prices 5 cents on Monday, so fill your tank!"" There are a few more texts planned as well.

So the Conservative party is now spamming us with text messages... not cool. Thumbs down! Lost my vote, ha! You never had it to begin with. Solitifies my vote to vote against the conservatives.

Conservatives are quick to accuse the Liberals of instituting a carbon tax as a ""cash grab"". The Liberals retort by saying that this is in the name of environmental protection. Trudeau's government says that this policy is an attempt to meet emissions reduction goals for 2030.

Experts say that placing a carbon tax on the most polluting industries is the easiest and cheapest way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Canadians who are affected by this carbon tax may not agree with that but since Trudeau is offering a tax deduction on affected expenses, they might come to appreciate it.

I'm not sure of how effective it is to mass-text Canadian citizens to promote your political party, but the Conservatives seem to think it'll work out for them. We'll see how this plays out.

If you get a text from a weird number today, that might just be Andrew Scheer hitting you up. You won't be able to text back though!

A Twitter user operating under the handle “@mindful_goat” posted a screenshot Wednesday showing a text message from Calgary Transit’s automated Teletext system, accompanied by the UCP ad.

The ad reads “VOTE Apr 16 UNITED CONSERVATIVE PARTY, Alberta Strong and Free. Donate or Learn more” along with a link to a website authorized by the UCP.

A photo of UCP Leader Jason Kenney surrounded by party supporters appears in the link’s preview within the text message.

The Teletext system tells riders when their bus is scheduled to arrive in real time, by texting the route and stop numbers to a Calgary Transit phone number.

A Calgary Transit spokesman said that any ad displayed on its digital platforms, as well as transit property such as vehicles, stations and bus benches, must adhere to rules set by Ad Standards — Canada.

“The ad that was displayed on Teletext this morning is in alignment with the Canadian ad standards, but we realize that we could do a better job at ensuring that customers understand that Calgary Transit does not endorse or support any of the ads displayed,” Stephen Tauro, a customer information and services co-ordinator for Calgary Transit, said in a statement.

“We are looking at immediate ways to better identify ads in the text application to make this distinction clear for customers.”

Tauro said Calgary Transit has an advertising contract with several vendors to sell ad space on its property and digital platforms.

“We work closely with our vendors to ensure this alignment (with Canadian ad standards),” he stated. “Advertising revenue helps offset the costs of operating our transit system.”

A spokesperson for Elections Alberta said the text message advertisement did not violate any election rules.

The following analysis is based on the candidates' own campaign biographies, tabulated from the latest data available.

UCP Leader Jason Kenney has said on several occasions that his party boasts a more diverse slate of candidates than the NDP.

He's right, at least when it comes to ethnic and cultural diversity, but only by a hair.

Elsewhere, the party tilts heavily toward the private sector, and does not have a single candidate self-proclaimed to be involved in any labour movement.

When tabulated based upon ethnic and cultural diversity, the United Conservative Party led by Jason Kenney comes in as the most diverse. (Albertastrongandfree.com)

By contrast, the NDP is the only one among the major political parties vying to win the 2019 Alberta provincial election to achieve gender parity. The competitors — including the Liberal Party — don't even come close.

Parity YEG has been keeping track of the men and women in the parties:

""I just think for too long we've sort of had one demographic represented predominantly in government and I think we have more nuanced and better decision making when we have more women and more women of colour in politics,"" said Rakhi Pancholi, 41, NDP candidate for Edmonton-Whitemud.

""I believe women have a lot to contribute to government and I think it's a great place for their voices to be heard,"" she said.

Still, a closer look at the New Democrats' slate reveals a tendency to attract union reps and public and non-profit employees such as teachers, health-care professionals and social workers.

The Alberta Party — which likes to position itself as the centrist party — is putting forward a slate of candidates that's remarkably similar to the UCP's, but with the most Indigenous or Métis representation of any party.

Nearly one in four candidates is of a visible minority group

At least 21 of the 86 — or one in four — candidates nominated so far under the United Conservative tent have identified themselves as members of a visible minority group.

They include East Asian, South Asian, black, Middle Eastern, mixed-race as well as Indigenous and Métis, among others.

The Alberta Party has 28, including five with First Nations background.

The NDP is running at least 19 self-proclaimed racially diverse candidates, which is statistically comparable.

Candidates with diverse ethnic backgrounds are largely concentrated in the big cities.

They make up around half of the candidates running in at least 10 ridings in Edmonton, and 10 ridings in Calgary. In some electoral districts — such as Calgary-Falconridge and Calgary-McCall — all the candidates from major parties are visible minorities.

""I never chose Calgary, Calgary chose me,"" said Gar Gar, the Alberta Party candidate for Calgary-East, whose family fled war-torn Sudan and Egypt to settle in Canada.

Breaking down professional backgrounds

At least 19 NDP candidates mentioned being involved in unions or labour movements in their party biographies. That number dwindles to two in the Alberta Party and none in the UCP.

No surprise, given the New Democrats' traditional affiliation with labour movements, and party leader Rachel Notley's previous connections as a labour lawyer for unions.

When it comes to entrepreneurial or business experience, however, UCP trumps all other parties in terms of the number of candidates hailing from the private sector.

Close to 60 UCP candidates claim to have worked in or owned their own business almost twice as many as the NDP.

""I believe it's good to have a cross-section of all people in every type of business and I believe agri-business needs to be represented,"" said Adriana LaGrange, UCP candidate for Red Deer-North. Her family runs a farm on the outskirts of the city.

""It is an essential and will always be an essential piece of the fabric of Alberta,"" said the 57-year-old grandmother.

At least 33 NDP candidates mention work experience in the public sector in their campaign biographies. That number falls to 26 for both the UCP and the Alberta Party.

Irfan Chaudhry, the director of MacEwan University's Office of Human Rights, Diversity and Equity, said it's important to look beyond tokenism, to ensure a true diverse representation of Albertans in elected office.

""Political parties will utilize candidates to enhance their diversity portfolio, and also because they want to ensure that it reflects the demographic of the community that they serve,"" he said.

""It's always important to make sure they form a very broad spectrum of diversity that voters have a general connection to.

""Being a very credible candidate is priority number one — someone that knows the issue is someone that can represent the community well and that's a starting point.""

Bruseker made his comments during an interview on the Ledge, CBC's political podcast.

In 2002, more than 20,000 Alberta teachers went on strike.

It crippled the public school system and left the provincial government scrambling.

This week, the United Conservative Party (UCP), and the NDP released their education platforms. The NDP wants more teachers, schools and playgrounds. The UCP wants better grades and more teacher accountability. 23:37

Ideas from the past given new life

Bruseker's warning went much further than the policy concerns raised earlier this week by the current ATA president.

""Teachers never really want to go out on strike,"" Bruseker said. ""There are times when teachers are driven to a point where they feel such a level of frustration that there is nothing more left for them to do.""

This week, the United Conservative Party and the NDP released their education platforms.

The NDP said it wants to add 1,000 new teachers, and include funding for playgrounds when building new schools.

The UCP said it wants to see improved grades for students, and wants schools, teachers and principals to be more accountable.

UCP Leader Jason Kenney said he wants to improve student performance by bringing back Grade 3 provincial achievement tests, and returning to a 50-50 marking split between course work and diploma exams for Grade 12 students.

""Math and reading scores have continued to decline under the NDP,"" Kenney said at a news conference on Monday. ""It's time to bring common sense to education.""

Bruseker said he was particularly disturbed to see that the UCP appears prepared to resurrect ideas from the former Progressive Conservative government's 2014 task force for teaching excellence.

Frank Bruseker, former Liberal MLA and past-president of the ATA, is warning of labour troubles ahead if old ideas about how to improve education are resurrected. (Frank Bruseker)

ATA president Greg Jeffery said among the ideas his members find particularly ""insulting"" is a recommendation from that report that ""teachers would be evaluated every five years to determine whether their certification to teach should be maintained.""

The ATA is currently involved in centralized contract negotiations with the provincial government.

Bruseker said if the UCP wins the election, teachers could find themselves in a position similar to 2002.

""What that could mean if teachers again at some point feel that level of frustration is you could have a province-wide shut down of education.""

On September 17, 2018, Parliament’s first day back from summer break, Leona Alleslev, the Liberal MP from Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill, rose in the House of Commons to announce her defection from the governing Liberal Party of Canada. “The government must be challenged openly and publicly. But for me to publicly criticize the government as a Liberal would undermine the government and, according to my code of conduct, be dishonourable,” she said. “After careful and deliberate consideration, I must withdraw from the government benches to take my seat among the ranks of my Conservative colleagues.”

New to politics when she was first elected in 2015, Alleslev is a hard-nosed and plain-spoken air force veteran. Before her dramatic exit, her time in office had been somewhat unexceptional, save for her early career appointment as parliamentary secretary to public-services and procurement minister Judy Foote—a notable promotion for a rookie MP. Still, she was, until she switched sides, little known outside of political and military circles.

The media immediately scoured her social media for signs of dissent but turned up nothing—no instances of serious disagreement with the party, no off-the-cuff clashes with Liberal colleagues, no pretension of sticking it to the man for the sake of her constituents. Rather, by all appearances, Alleslev had fallen in line with the party. Throughout her tenure, she offered reassurances that team Trudeau was on the right track. In July, two months before switching sides, she fawned over the prime minister, foreign-affairs minister Chrystia Freeland, and defence minister Harjit Sajjan in a private email, calling them “truly awesome.” Nine days later, she praised Trudeau’s leadership at a fundraising event.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer wasted no time taking advantage of her move. “For all those Canadians who supported Justin Trudeau in 2015 and are dissatisfied or even angry about the leadership that he’s been giving,” he told a room full of reporters, “the Conservative Party needs you.” He had apparently forgiven her previous anti-Conservative criticism. During a 2015 election debate in her riding, Alleslev lamented having watched the country under Stephen Harper “become something I barely recognize—socially, politically, economically, and internationally.” But the Trudeau government, in the end, apparently fared just as poorly in Alleslev’s eyes. Bidding adieu to her fellow caucus members, she referenced wide-ranging failures on tax reform, trade, foreign policy, defence, and security. She assured everyone who asked that it was never only one issue.

The act of switching teams requires a flexibility uncommon among twenty-first-century politicians. Alleslev considers herself among that rare breed of lawmaker. “As a member of Parliament, it’s my job to listen to everybody,” she told me. “I’m not sure that’s always the most widely held opinion.” She sees in modern politics a tendency to characterize all debate as conflict and worries about where that will lead. “If you look where we are, not only in Canada but in the world, where we’re becoming far more divided, far less able to have conversations with those that we have differing opinions with, we’re at risk of losing the value of debate.”

The resignations of two high-profile cabinet ministers over the Liberals’ mishandling of the SNC-Lavalin affair have since brought the question of debate within parties into greater focus. Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former justice minister and attorney general, and Jane Philpott, the former Treasury Board president, two of Trudeau’s most respected ministers, brazenly stood against the prime minister and his office and still remain in the Liberal caucus. Their actions lend credibility to Alleslev’s story while undermining the necessity of her departure. She chose to keep her quarrels with the party silent, she says, because dissenting openly would jeopardize its ability to govern.

But, in keeping quiet for so long, Alleslev has opened herself up to accusations of political opportunism. “Did you put your finger in the air to see which way the wind was blowing,” pressed CTV’s Don Martin, “and figure it was going to go Conservative in 2019, so you might as well join the parade?” If she hopes to regain her seat in 2019, Alleslev will need to prove those accusations wrong. She will need to convince her supporters that switching sides was more than simply self-interested politics, despite what the opposition says. And the Liberals will come armed with stories spun by former staffers and Liberal hard-liners with an incentive to discredit her. All voters have is her word. Whether she honestly acted in their interest or not, the fallout that ensued suggests intentions are moot. Few things are as politically isolating as crossing the floor.

Since Confederation, 340 MPs have changed party affiliation, willingly or not, between elections. Those who leave tend to opt for independence, with many soon switching again to join another party or to return to their former caucus. While some forty countries have laws pertaining to crossing the floor—in most cases, defecting legislators are forced to give up their seats—there’s no federal convention, legislation, or parliamentary rule regarding it in Canada. Manitoba and New Brunswick have enacted laws forcing outgoing caucus members to sit independently for the remainder of the term. But both the Liberals and Conservatives seem less keen to hamstring members’ freedom. In 2005, the federal government defeated a bill proposing that changes in party affiliation be followed by a by-election. Similar legislation has been introduced regularly in parliamentary sessions since; all have failed to pass first reading.

However, a series of ethics inquiries suggests floor crossers came under greater scrutiny beginning in the early 2000s, as crossing grew in popularity. Some forty-four MPs switched sides between 2001 and 2005, which, according to a 2006 study, outpaced the previous eighty-year average of twenty-three crossings per decade. In 2005, former ethics commissioner Bernard Shapiro was asked to determine whether a member had contravened the Conflict of Interest Code in switching parties. The following year, his attention turned to investigating Prime Minister Stephen Harper. In question was whether Harper had bribed Liberal MP David Emerson into leaving his party with the perks of a cabinet position with the Conservatives. Shapiro found no wrongdoing, but noted, “The discontent expressed by Canadians on this matter cannot be attributed merely to the machinations of partisan politics. Fairly or unfairly, this particular instance has given many citizens a sense that their vote—the cornerstone of our democratic system—was somehow devalued, if not betrayed.”

A number high-profile defections have been viewed as politically expedient, such as those of Belinda Stronach, in 2005, and Eve Adams, in 2015. Stronach left the Conservatives and was granted a cabinet seat with the Liberals, a move she made, some suspect, to help keep Paul Martin’s minority government in power ahead of two important budget votes. Adams deserted the Conservatives over their “mean-spirited leadership” six months after dropping out of a nomination-race in a new riding and was welcomed by Trudeau’s Liberals with open arms.

In Alleslev’s case, journalists and political pundits raised the possibility that she was reacting to the Ontario Liberal Party’s defeat in June 2018. During that provincial election, the riding of Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill saw Conservative Michael Parsa win by more than twice as many votes as the Liberal runner-up. By comparison, in 2014, each of the predecessor districts that now make up the new riding—Newmarket-Aurora, Oak Ridges–Markham, and Richmond Hill—had voted Liberal. The losses are notable, but they offer little insight into the projected electoral outcome for the region in October. According to the CBC, the federal party that has won the most seats in Ontario has been different in 52 percent of elections from the one currently in power provincially.

At the federal level, the ethnically diverse riding of Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill remains a toss-up between the reds and blues. It would be foolish to think Alleslev had special insight, more than one year out, into how the election will unfold. What we know is this: in Ontario, the parties have been neck and neck in the polls since early 2018, and an analysis of polling numbers by the website Calculated Politics, taken only weeks before Alleslev’s defection, projected the Conservatives were on par to win Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill by a margin of just 2 percent.

What seems to set defectors apart is an ability to exploit the divisive nature of politics today to their own advantage. It’s a quality Alleslev seems to have put to work during her 2014 nomination race. Clayton Haluza, president of the federal Liberal riding association in Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill, hadn’t the faintest idea who she was when she approached him at a fundraising event that year. Haluza found her straightforwardness refreshing for a political hopeful. But Alleslev had no ties to the Liberal party, hadn’t served in municipal politics, and wasn’t particularly involved in the community.

Alleslev’s aloofness was the result of having, as she says, “never, ever considered” a life in politics. Instead, she envisioned spending her entire career in the military—a calling she says teaches you to put country first. Her father retired as a two-star general from the Royal Canadian Air Force; his father had resisted the Nazis in Denmark as a member of the Danish underground. She came to believe that “serving one’s country is an honourable profession.” In 1991, she joined the Canadian military as a second lieutenant, logistics officer in Comox, BC, having studied history and political science at the Royal Military College in Kingston, Ontario. A decade later, following her retirement from the military, she worked as a consultant, at times within the federal government, and eventually landed in the private sector at IBM and Bombardier Aerospace.

Alleslev says it was Harper government that motivated her to join the Liberal Party in 2014. She thought their policies weren’t positioning Canada competitively and that, in contrast, the Liberals were making bold promises on everything from foreign policy to infrastructure spending, which she found appealing. Sitting in her Richmond Hill office late last year, she told me she began to sense, around four years ago, that “some pretty dramatic things” were unfolding at home and abroad. She was unsure about running for office, however, until she met Jason Cherniak, who was seeking the nomination. A lawyer based out of Richmond Hill, then in his midthirties, Cherniak was as faithful as they come: a card-carrying Liberal since high school, he went on to serve on the Young Liberals of Canada national executive and later as president of the Richmond Hill federal riding association and as president of the Liberal Party of Canada (Ontario) Central Region.

“Considering how significant the challenges facing the country and world are right now, I’m not sure he’s the right guy to represent me as a member of Parliament,” she said, thinking back. “Ah rats—I’m going to have to run.”

With existing ties to the Liberal Party, Cherniak was confident he had a shot at the nomination. But he began to suspect party upper brass were favouring Alleslev. “That part of it has been very difficult for me,” Cherniak says, “because after all these years of volunteering, I really thought that at the very least I had earned a chance at a fair race.” Alleslev had virtually no political experience, but she was a veteran and strong leader who stood in contrast to Conservative incumbent, Costas Menegakis. She played right into the optimistic, feminist narrative the Liberals were hoping to tell. As the Globe and Mail’s Adam Radwanski has noted, Trudeau “made a point of recruiting a diverse array of candidates who, despite impressive professional credentials, often did not have much partisan political experience.”

So intent was the party to win the riding that it overlooked what one former staffer now considers several “red flags.” Alleslev’s sister Caroline vied for the Conservative seat in Beaches–East York in 2008. And, throughout the nomination race, Alleslev could be found in tow of Greg Beros, a staunch Conservative and Richmond Hill city councillor. “You know that Leona’s a good, dear friend,” Beros would say when introducing her to members of local community groups. “While I can’t vote for her, because she’s with the Liberal Party, she is a great individual and would represent us well.” Beros recused himself from supporting her come the election. “Some people are candidate first, party second,” he says. “I’m always party first, candidate second.”

Alleslev succeeded at connecting with influential members of the riding’s Muslim community, whose support, both financial and otherwise, was “key to her getting the nomination,” says Haluza. She was later able to leverage constituents’ unhappiness with the Conservatives’ anti-immigrant rhetoric over “Canadian values” to garner widespread approval among members of the Muslim community. Without their support, many Liberals believe she would have lost in the general election. In the end, a combination of Alleslev’s own political abilities and the Conservatives’ hardline tactics helped mobilize the Muslim community at the polls, and she clinched the seat by fewer than 1,100 votes.

Following the win, a different picture of Alleslev began to emerge, one the Liberals could attempt to resuscitate during the upcoming election. In several instances, sources speaking on background say Alleslev was reluctant to credit the Muslim community for its role in her electoral success. This, they say, left some supporters feeling hurt and embittered. (In a request for comment, Alleslev apologized. “I like to think of myself as being sensitive,” she said. “So if I have been in any way insensitive, then I’m very sorry for that.”). According to the sources, that resentment was amplified by Alleslev’s decision to join the Conservatives, a party which has shown itself—most recently through its promise to withdraw Canada from the UN’s Global Compact for Safe, Orderly, and Regular Migration—to be less open to refugees and immigrants. In 2019, Alleslev will have to grapple with having alienated a group that fervently supported her only four years ago.

“A political party is made up of the people who are in it at the time and must be judged by what the country needs at the time,” Alleslev has said, in explanation of her actions. By this, she appears to suggest that political parties aren’t monolithic entities but rather are born out of a particular time and place and defined by their caucuses, which presumably have voters’ best interests at heart. This logic enables Alleslev to argue it’s not her principles but rather the needs of Canadians that have changed since she first entered politics.

Her position reveals a grey area, rarely acknowledged in federal politics, that can be exploited by politicians willing to see beyond fervent partisanship. The Liberals and Conservatives may have the tendency to disagree, especially during election years, and their rhetoric may be different, but their track records suggest they’re more similar than they’re wont to admit. “To this day, if you go down line by line and look at what the Conservative and Liberal party stand for,” Haluza says, “at least on paper, it’s shades of grey.”

Alleslev seems to have leveraged this dynamic to her own advantage. Justifying her defection, she accused the Liberals of failing to meet the NATO target that members spend at least 2 percent of GDP on defence, even though Trudeau campaigned on maintaining previous spending levels. The truth is, no sitting government has met NATO’s targets since they were enacted in 2006. Alleslev also rebuked the Liberals’ diplomatic track record, citing tensions with Saudi Arabia, China, and India. This critique ignores the Conservatives’ own failings, such as in 2010, when Canada was forced to withdraw from pursuing a seat on the UN Security Council, a move interpreted by an article in OpenCanada as a “stinging rebuke of Harper’s anti-UN foreign policy.” (Trudeau has pledged to vie for a seat on the council in 2020). Their similarities extend to the economy, where both parties are quick to talk about more free-trade agreements and tax relief for the middle class.

But, if the parties are so alike, why would Alleslev leave one for the other? To the former colleagues who are quick to mention Alleslev’s ambition, it’s easy to craft a tale of opportunity. Alleslev’s political career was off to a strong start when, in late 2015, she was named Foote’s parliamentary secretary. The public-services minister’s mandate included replacing the country’s fleet of aging CF-18s and supporting a national shipbuilding procurement strategy—two areas that would seem to be of strong personal interest to Alleslev. As parliamentary secretary, she supported these files. But she also worked on Phoenix, the payment system for the federal civil service, the deployment of which has been riddled with complications.

According to a 2018 Senate finance committee report, more than half of the Canadian civil service has not been properly paid since Phoenix’s implementation in 2016. The report notes that the project will likely amass $2.2 billion in unplanned costs by 2023, making it an “international embarrassment.” When questioned about Phoenix on Foote’s behalf, Alleslev would assure legislators the system would soon be fixed. But the situation remained chaotic, and following a cabinet shuffle in January 2017, she was demoted from her role as parliamentary secretary. Historically, such appointments have been used to prepare (or rather to test the readiness of) future cabinet ministers. Alleslev would later cite the Liberals’ failure to resolve Phoenix as among her reasons for leaving the party.

Throwing herself in with the Conservatives has, conveniently, allowed her to regain lost momentum. National media attention has made her a familiar face and a champion of the Conservative cause. And, with Scheer swiftly appointing her shadow cabinet secretary for global security, she has reclaimed a prominent role in the House. It may prove to be an important career pick-me-up, given that she was ousted as chair of the Canadian NATO parliamentary association one month after defecting. Like the majority of floor-crossing MPs before her, Alleslev could have ridden out her term as an independent, thereby limiting speculation on her motives, but she says she decided against it, believing that the Canadian system is not “structured for independence.” Independent members rarely sit on committees, are not recognized as often during Question Period, and lose the support of a caucus. They are, in other words, less influential.

Alleslev has always been focused on maximizing her influence. She entered politics with her mind set on transforming the country and, after three years, came to believe she couldn’t do it as a Liberal. An early party switch meant trying to make the most of what could be her last year in office, she says, noting she had the support of her family and many constituents. But it also meant alienating supporters and staff who fought to get her elected and who now have reason to want to see her lose. Later this year, they will get their say on whether her actions were genuine and, above all, justified.",The Politics of Switching Parties,The Walrus,https://thewalrus.ca/the-politics-of-switching-parties/

Both parties back the Trans Mountain expansion (TMX) project, and both want to see First Nations have the opportunity to buy a stake in the federally owned pipeline.

Ottawa set down several guiding principles this week for discussions with Indigenous groups interested in buying a piece of the pipeline, which the Trudeau government purchased last year for $4.5 billion.

Those guidelines include Trans Mountain must be operated on a commercial basis, that impacted communities have a chance for meaningful economic participation, and that Indigenous ownership help trigger economic development of their communities.

NDP Leader Rachel Notley, whose government committed last year to invest up to $2 billion into the pipeline’s expansion project if it faces cost over-runs — and receive an equity stake in return — has already spoken to interested First Nations that want to explore an ownership bid.

“We are more than interested and open to having conversations with First Nations groups … as well as supporting them in their efforts to take on a larger equity stake,” she said Thursday.

“We are, at this time, more likely looking at capacity funding for them, or potentially helping them get access to capital.”

Likewise, UCP Leader Jason Kenney said he’s had a number of conversations with groups like the Indian Resource Council of Canada, which have been pressing for Indigenous ownership as a way to reduce poverty and create jobs.

“I am very encouraged. I think this is the way forward,” Kenney said Thursday.

“It’s time that we gave practical expression (of) solidarity with the majority of First Nations who are pro-development. They want the right to move their people from poverty to prosperity and they understand responsible resource development, like TMX, is a way of doing so.”

The UCP will announce next week “practical ways in which we will support aboriginal co-ownership of that and other projects,” he added.

These are positive developments for Alberta, which needs a pipeline, and for Indigenous groups that want a chance to control development that could affect their land — giving them a seat in the board room — while providing economic opportunities.

First Nations’ ownership won’t remove all of the obstacles facing energy infrastructure in this country. Some Indigenous groups in British Columbia object to the pipeline’s expansion, which would triple the amount of Alberta oil moving to the Pacific coast.

However, it would be a constructive step, broadening support for an initiative that will help maximize the value of Canada’s natural resources.

The project first needs to move out of limbo.

The federal government is busy completing consultation with First Nations affected by the Trans Mountain expansion, and it’s expected to make a final decision on the development in the coming weeks.

“There’s no project yet,” federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau said in Calgary this week.

“We are going through the consultation process, so we can’t be putting participation on the table right now, but we’ve said we do want Indigenous equity participation.”

Similarly, Trans Mountain Corp. CEO Ian Anderson told Global News Radio this week that Indigenous ownership would be a “building block” to close the economic gap facing First Nations.

There won’t be any shortage of interested players when the Trudeau government decides to sell Trans Mountain to the private sector, which likely will not occur until the project is built.

Project Reconciliation, a group formed last year to acquire a majority stake in the pipeline, has contacted First Nations across Western Canada to gauge their support for getting involved.

Delbert Wapass, former chief of the Thunderchild First Nation in Saskatchewan and chairman of Project Reconciliation, said the response has been encouraging.

He believes the new federal principles, along with the support of Alberta’s political leaders, are giving the idea momentum.

“This here would be a game changer for many First Nations, where they would have the opportunity to have a better quality of life for their people,” Wapass said Friday.

“We are not asking for preferential treatment or special treatment, or asking to use taxpayer money … we will get the financing, we will do the business in a responsible, structured way. That’s what it means to us as First Nations.”

Other groups have also expressed interest, including the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation and Fort McKay First Nation in Alberta.

Chief Allan Adam of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation noted he’s aware of four different groups considering an ownership bid.

The process is still in preliminary stages, but his interest remains high.

However, Adam cautions the Trudeau government shouldn’t be holding out hope of Indigenous ownership if it’s not serious about taking action.

“If they are going to lead First Nations down a trail where there’s no opportunity at the end, I think it will be very detrimental to Canada,” he said in an interview.

“All First Nations are watching this now.”

In Alberta, the parties themselves are offering political support — and may provide more tangible assistance to help make it happen — although the ball remains in Ottawa’s court.

“There is a role for the Alberta government to play here because … the oil is coming from Alberta,” Adam added.

“Every government player is going to be very critical.”

The NDP’s standard bearer in the riding will be selected on Saturday.

The byelection already features an interesting cast of characters, including a jilted Conservative who lost a bid for her party’s candidacy and jumped to Maxime Bernier’s Peoples Party of Canada (PPC); a Green candidate who had a falling out with the NDP ahead of the last federal election; and a Liberal Indigenous candidate with as big a profile as Jody Wilson-Raybould when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recruited her for the Liberals in 2015.

Singh, who took a seat in the House of Commons for the first time last week after winning his own byelection in the greater Vancouver riding of Burnaby South last month, will greet the NDP candidate in Nanaimo on Sunday, his office told iPolitics.

A roster of four NDP candidates suggests the New Democrat’s confidence in the riding, despite a late entry into the race and a hike in Green Party support in the past years. Prime Minister Trudeau announced the byelection on March 24.

A day after Trudeau set the byelection date, he surfaced in Nanaimo to circulate and draw attention to a star Liberal candidate, who the party had announced only a week earlier. That candidate, Michelle Corfield, is a prominent and highly successful Indigenous leader who holds a doctorate from Simon Fraser University’s Beedie School of Business.

Corfield is also chair of the Nanaimo Port Authority, chair of the Legislative Council of Ucluelet First Nation and a founding member of a settlement trust at Ucluelet First Nation on the western coast of Vancouver Island. Corfield is an executive resident at the Beedie School’s Indigenous Business and Economic Development Knowledge Exchange.

Despite the credentials of his party’s candidate, or perhaps to ensure Corfield was the one in the limelight during an ongoing confrontation between Trudeau and one of his star 2015 candidates, Vancouver Liberal MP and former justice minister Wilson-Raybould, Trudeau declined to take questions from local news media.

Even with as prominent a candidate as Corfield, the Liberal party faces an uphill battle toward May 6.

Vancouver Island resisted the Liberal wave of 2015, voting in New Democrats in six of the island’s seven federal electoral districts. The seventh, Saanich—Gulf Islands, was won by Green Party Leader Elizabeth May for her second term in the House of Commons.

The contests were close and Angus Reid Institute’s polling analyst Shachi Kurl notes that Vancouver Island has been a tug-of-war between New Democrats and Conservatives over the past years.

“The island has a tendency to swing orange or blue,” Kurl said in a phone interview from her Vancouver office.

Nanaimo News Bulletin reporter Nicholas Pescod says he expects the NDP will continue to hold Nanaimo—Ladysmith. “I suspect the NDP will do well,” he said in a telephone interview from the News Bulletin newsroom.

Kurl noted low-turnout byelections can hinge on local organization, for which the NDP is famous in B.C.

Nanaimo—Ladysmith was left vacant after popular former NDP MP Sheila Malcolmson, announced last fall that she was making the jump to provincial politics. She resigned her Commons seat on Jan. 2 to contest and win a byelection in the provincial electoral district of Nanaimo. That Jan. 30 byelection was crucial for the survival of the province’s NDP coalition government.

For the May 6 federal byelection, the NDP field of four candidates also includes a prominent Indigenous candidate, Bob Chamberlin, who is vice-president of the long-established Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs and chief councillor with the Kwikwasutinuxw Haxwa’mis First Nation at the north end of Vancouver Island.

The other three NDP hopefuls include Lauren Sample, a former constituency assistant to Malcolmson, a past president of Nanaimo Pride, and a women’s rights advocate; Maeve O’Byrne, a founder of the Nanaimo and District Hospital Foundation who coaches volunteers working in refugee camps; and Fred Statham, whose electoral experience includes two attempts at election to Nanaimo city council.

The nominated field for other parties is just as unique.

The Green Party and Conservative candidates launched their nomination bids last fall, after Malcolmson announced she would not seek re-election federally.

Green candidate Paul Manly, who came third against Malcolmson in 2015, was acclaimed as the Green candidate on Feb. 3, after launching his nomination campaign last Oct. 25. According to commenters on a Reddit forum and other media, Manly tried to contest the NDP riding’s general election nomination in 2015, but claimed later his candidacy was rejected because he protested Israel’s treatment of his father, former NDP MP Jim Manley, who was arrested after taking part in an attempt to breach Israel’s 2012 sea blockade of the Gaza Strip.

The nominated Conservative candidate for the byelection, Sun Life office manager John Hirst, won his nomination on Nov. 17 last year. His opponent for the Tory nomination, Jennifer Clarke, was picked up to run for the PPC.

VANCOUVER—Though British Columbia should be fertile ground for the Liberals to grow support ahead of October’s general election, the party’s biggest asset in 2015 is now its biggest liability: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Brown’s comments follow a new Research Co. poll released on Tuesday that found a majority of British Columbians believe a new party leader would be better. A third of B.C. residents who voted for the Liberals in 2015 also believe a different party leader would do things better in Ottawa than Trudeau.

“As long as Trudeau is their leader, the party is bound to suffer big time.”

“B.C. is critical to the Liberals’ fortunes, as their strength in Quebec seems to be waning and in Atlantic Canada they’re grossly under attack. They have to look for where they can gain seats,” Brown said in an interview.

And that animosity toward Canada’s current prime minister is pervasive across the province, though strongest outside of the Metro Vancouver region, said Mario Canseco, president of Research Co.

“That’s the danger the Liberals are facing,” Canseco said. “This is more worrisome in urban areas where you can see people gravitate more to the NDP, which places a lot of seats in jeopardy.”

Meanwhile, half of British Columbians think a different party is needed to lead in Ottawa. Notably, a majority of all age groups polled — from millennials to boomers and beyond — felt that way, as well as a quarter of 2015 Liberal voters.

Prior to 2015, the Liberal party held two seats in British Columbia. But after “Trudeaumania” took the country, the Liberals went from third place in the House of Commons to holding a majority government. Now, they hold 17 seats in B.C.

Canseco questioned whether they could sustain that momentum.

And while there wasn’t much of a gender gap in 2015, men are now more likely to be critical and dissatisfied with the Liberals.

Canseco is closely following the millennial reaction to Trudeau, as the previous election saw a significant spike in the youth vote. For Canseco, the big question ahead of the fall election will be exactly where those votes go.

“It’s no longer the idea of Trudeau as a great unifier, and if they find a shinier object out there, will they support it?” he said. “If you’re disenchanted because of environmental decisions, or maybe electoral reform, or the SNC-Lavalin affair, do you stay home or vote Green or NDP?”

Poll results were based on an online study from March 8 to 10 among 800 adults in B.C., with a margin of error of +/- 3.5 percentage points 19 times out of 20.

Left-leaning progressives offended by the SNC-Lavalin affair may be tempted to vote for the NDP or Greens, Brown said, while centre-right leaning and “swing Liberals” will now be swayed to vote Conservative.

Disenchantment with Trudeau — particularly in B.C. — has risen because he has “failed” on so many files, according to Brown, such as proportional representation, balancing the budget, reconciliation and the purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline.

“(All that has) dramatically reduced his party’s fortunes in Greater Vancouver on progressive, environmentally conscious voters,” he said. “On so many files, he’s proven himself to be the opposite of what he purports to be.”

Braeden Caley, a Liberal party spokesperson, says Trudeau and the Liberals are focused on a strong plan for British Columbians “to build more affordable housing, invest in better roads and transit, grow the economy and protect a healthier environment for our kids and grandkids.”

A decline in support for the Liberals is exaggerated, according to Caley. He says grassroots support for the party continues to grow.

“More than 15,000 British Columbians have singed up as new Liberals in the past two years alone,” he said in an email. “The Liberal party is also continuing to be approached by a variety of talented community leaders interested in becoming Team Trudeau candidates throughout British Columbia, building on the strong growth that we’ve seen in our B.C. team and caucus in recent years.”

Brown has been publicly calling for Trudeau to step down to improve the Liberal party’s chances in October, amid the ongoing SNC-Lavalin affair which he said has “dramatically undercut” Trudeau’s personal brand of having the ethical high-ground.

He predicts an RCMP probe on the matter in the near future and told the Star the Liberal party will only have a chance in October if they find a new leader. Brown said that would be in their best “political self-interest,” especially with the support of Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott.

“If they went into an election with those two women behind them saying we’re cleaning up our act and we mean it,” Brown said, “it would suddenly turn the table and make the new Liberal leader potentially the voice of a new ethical government instead of the opposite.”

The evidence, submitted to the House of Commons justice committee Tuesday and made public Friday, shows that Wilson-Raybould repeatedly warned top officials working for Trudeau that they were attempting to politically interfere in a criminal prosecution, violating a constitutional principle.

In an extraordinary 17-minute phone call on Dec. 19, 2018, Wernick can be heard telling Wilson-Raybould that Trudeau was “determined” to find a way for Montreal-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin to get a deferred prosecution, despite Wilson-Raybould’s insistence that it was wrong to overrule the prosecution service’s decision to proceed with a trial.

“This is not a great place for me to be in,” Wilson-Raybould tells Wernick near the end of the phone call. “But what I am confident of is that I have given the Prime Minister my best advice to protect him and to protect the constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence.”

“Alright, but … I am worried about a collision then because he is pretty firm about this,” Wernick replies, referring to Trudeau. “I just saw him a few hours ago and this is really important to him.”

Ending the phone call, Wilson-Raybould tells Wernick she is waiting for “the other shoe to drop.”

“I am not under any illusion how the Prime Minister has and gets things that he wants,” she said.

Less than three weeks after that phone call, Wilson-Raybould was told she would be removed as justice minister and shuffled into a different cabinet role. She said the Prime Minister’s Office denied that it was over the SNC-Lavalin issue.

Wilson-Raybould’s evidence also includes lengthy text-message exchanges between herself and her chief of staff, Jessica Prince. In one conversation, Prince details a conversation she had on Dec. 18, 2018, with Trudeau’s top aides, Chief of Staff Katie Telford and then-Principal Secretary Gerald Butts.

Prince said that Telford and Butts were adamant that SNC-Lavalin get a deferred prosecution, and that Butts in particular didn’t care about respecting the Public Prosecution Service of Canada, given it had been created as an independent body under former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper.

“Gerry kept talking about how it was created by Harper,” Prince said in a text message. “I was like ‘sure but it is what we have and we have to respect the statute.’ No scruples.”

“So crazy,” responded Wilson-Raybould. “Gerry said the same thing to me.”

I am not under any illusion how the Prime Minister has and gets things that he wants

The new material shows that Wilson-Raybould repeatedly said that she felt the pressure being put on her was inappropriate and constituted an attempt at political interference — despite the fact that Trudeau, Butts and Wernick have all contended that Wilson-Raybould did not bring her concerns forward at the time.

“If anyone, particularly the attorney general, felt that we were not doing our job fully, responsibly and according to all the rules, as a government, it was her responsibility to come forward to me this past fall and highlight that directly to me,” said Trudeau on Feb. 12, 2018. “She did not. Nobody did.”

After the material was released, Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer repeated his call for Trudeau’s resignation, which he first made following Wilson-Raybould’s committee testimony on Feb. 27.

“(Trudeau) looked Canadians in the eye and told them that no one had raised concerns with him,” he said in a statement. “This is false and he owes Canadians an explanation. The entire SNC-Lavalin scandal is corruption on top of corruption on top of corruption. Two cabinet ministers have resigned on principle and both Justin Trudeau’s top political advisor and his top civil servant have resigned in disgrace. The Prime Minister has lost the moral authority to govern and must resign.”

NDP leader Jagmeet Singh called the material “so compelling and well-documented that we must have an independent public inquiry to get to the truth.”

“The PMO has tried to spin this as a miscommunication or personal disagreement,” said Singh’s statement. “What we see in this submission is a lawyer acting in her client’s best interests to protect him from his own recklessness.”

The Prime Minister’s Office on Friday evening released a statement saying, “The Prime Minister was not briefed by the Clerk on his conversation with Jody Wilson-Raybould, and we were unaware of the full contents of this recording before today.”

In the introduction to her submission, Wilson-Raybould wrote that the context of the justice committee’s study “is the core principle of prosecutorial independence — a principle that at times appears to have been obscured by layers of commentary, hyperbole, and spin.”

Wilson-Raybould submitted the material after Liberal MPs on the Commons justice committee voted to conclude their study of the issue without inviting her to testify a second time — despite the fact they had invited Wernick twice.

She originally testified before the justice committee on Feb. 27, a four-hour-long appearance in which she described the Dec. 19 phone call with Wernick. She said she felt he was making “veiled threats,” and that she’d told Wernick she was having thoughts of the Saturday Night Massacre — a reference to U.S. President Richard Nixon’s firing of the independent prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal.

Wernick testified to the committee on Feb. 21 and again on March 6. In his second appearance, Wernick disputed Wilson-Raybould’s version of the phone call. “That is not my recollection of the conversation,” he said when asked to respond to her description. But he said he didn’t take notes about it and didn’t have a strong memory of what was said.

“I do not have an independent recollection of the event. I did not wear a wire, record the conversation or take extemporaneous notes,” he said.

In her Feb. 27 appearance, Wilson-Raybould had not told the committee she’d recorded the call. In her submission published today, in which she provided both the transcript and the audio of the call, she said she made the recording because she didn’t have a staff member with her to take notes, and because she “had reason to believe that it was likely to be an inappropriate conversation.”

“So while I typed out notes during the phone call, I took the extraordinary and otherwise inappropriate step of making an audio recording of the conversation without so advising the Clerk,” she wrote. “This is something that I have never done before this phone call and have not done since.”

During the phone call, Wilson-Raybould made clear several times that she was uncomfortable. “Again, I am surprised that you and I are having this conversation, but I’m just saying that I really feel uncomfortable about the appropriateness of this conversation,” she said at one point.

I am not seeing anything inappropriate here

The audio recording confirms Wilson-Raybould’s description of her conversation with Wernick during her February testimony.

In the call, Wernick said Trudeau was concerned about potential job losses and wanted “to be able to say that he has tried everything he can, you know, within a legitimate toolbox, to try to head that off,” including consulting an external legal expert like former Supreme Court Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin.

Wilson-Raybould repeatedly raised concerns about prosecutorial independence. She said that if she were to step in and order the director of public prosecutions to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement, “there is no way that anybody would interpret this other than interference.”

“It does not matter how I would look in doing that — I would be a mockery, and that is not the problem — the bigger problem is what it would look like down the road for the government,” she told Wernick.

“One, it has never been done before, but two, this is going to look like nothing but political interference by the prime minister, by you, by everyone else that has been involved in politically pressuring me to do this.”

Wernick insisted that he and the other officials approaching her on this issue were acting lawfully. “You are not just the attorney general, you are the minister of justice in a cabinet,” he said. “I am not seeing anything inappropriate here.”

Wilson-Raybould was on guard about her conversation with Wernick in part because of the meeting that Prince, her chief of staff, had taken with Telford and Butts the day before.

In a text message on Dec. 18, Prince said there was “nothing new” being provided as evidence from the Prime Minister’s Office on why to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case.

“They want external counsel retained to give you an opinion on whether you can review the DPP’s decision here and whether you should in this case,” she told Wilson-Raybould, noting they had also suggested Beverley McLachlin.

Prince said she told Butts that such a move would amount to interference, to which she said Butts replied, “Jess, there is no solution here that doesn’t involve interference.”

“At least they are finally being honest about what they are asking you to do!” Prince then said to Wilson-Raybould.

The former attorney general responded, “OMG. I do not even know what to say to that.”

Prince said she emphasized to Butts and Telford that it was extremely important to maintain the independence of the attorney general. “They didn’t seem to get or even care. Yup, I was floored,” she said.

After her phone call with Wernick, Wilson-Raybould wrote that the next time she heard from the prime minister or anyone in his office was on Jan. 7, when Trudeau told her she was being shuffled.

Wilson-Raybould also confirmed that she had a “series of meetings” with Trudeau in Vancouver that led to her Feb. 12 resignation from cabinet in the wake of a Globe and Mail article that broke the story of allegations of political interference.

“The Prime Minister stated publicly when issues about the propriety of the government’s conduct in relation to the SNC matter arose that my ongoing presence in cabinet spoke for itself,” she wrote. “I resigned the next day and I trust my resignation also speaks for itself.”

We will continue to listen to Albertans and ...,"Hundreds of people gathered in southwest Calgary Thursday night for a show of support for gay-straight alliances and the current rules that prevent disclosure of participants.

The protest march was in response to United Conservative Party leader Jason Kenney’s plans, should the UCP be elected into government, to replace the School Act with the unproclaimed Education Act of 2014. The change of legislation would lead to the potential for parents and guardians to be notified when a student participates in a GSA.

“I’m here to support GSAs,” said Blake Spence, a participant in the rally. “I think it’s really important for them to pick when and why they come out, not the government.”

“I’m a teacher and a parent and a gay man,” said Andrew Clapperton. “I can’t believe I’m having to fight this battle all over again but I’m here to do it and I’ll be here until we make sure that kids have a right to privacy, they have a right to safer spaces in schools, and so they’re not being overrun by a government that doesn’t really respect them.”

The protesters marched from the parking lot of the Marda Loop Safeway to the office of Doug Schweitzer, the UCP candidate for Calgary-Elbow.

Schweitzer released the following statement Thursday night in response to the march.

“I have always been, and continue to be, an advocate for LGBTQ2S+ community. Today, I am proud that all major political parties supports gay-straight alliances and categorically reject mandatory notification of parents.

To those that marched today, I will never diminish your concerns and feelings of frustration. I am saddened to see that my opponents have turned such a critical issue for our vulnerable youth into a divisive topic, when we should be working to find a strong path forward together.

I am committed, alongside my United Conservative colleagues, to ensuring that Alberta has the strongest legal protections for gay-straight alliances in Canada. We will continue to listen to Albertans and act in the best interests of all our children.”

A similar rally was held Wednesday in Edmonton.

123,Politics,2019-03-28T06:20:00.0000000Z,"But don’t worry, as the Herald columnist pointed out, Jason Kenney’s United Conservative Party has a plan to “fix” all that ... lower taxes than the rest of Canada and a higher labour participation rate. Its more a fear that those that are doing ...","One of the unusual features of the past four years in Alberta has been the remarkable calm that has prevailed in our normally tumultuous, shambolic, sometimes chaotic health care system.

Under the NDP Government, for the first time in the past 30 years at least, health care hasn’t been a continual gong show, spinning ever closer to the edge under a series of conservative governments that couldn’t keep their political paws off the system and swung back and forth from crisis-inducing austerity to hair-on-fire crisis spending.

This may have been because conservative ideology runs counter to reality – no, in health care, “market solutions” do not work very well, no matter what you may wish to believe. Or it may have been because, as some theorize darkly, conservatives don’t really want to see public health care succeed and therefore encourage failure to justify marketization.

Whatever, while many flaws remain in this large, complex and costly system, health care has never run more smoothly than since Rachel Notley’s New Democrats unexpectedly came to power in 2015 and Sarah Hoffman was appointed minister of health.

Paradoxically, this has been to the disadvantage of the NDP as an election approached. Health care, a traditional NDP strength, has been ticking along so smoothly it’s no longer a front-burner issue for most Albertans.

How did the NDP do it? As Calgary Herald political columnist Don Braid pointed out yesterday in a column surprising because it is so at odds with his employer’s drumbeat of attacks on the government, “the NDP calmed down the system, made significant improvements and provided stability for health planners, professionals and workers.”

“Health care access and delivery are far more level and reliable than they were in 2015,” Mr. Braid wrote. And in almost all of the 30 years before that, he could have added.

But don’t worry, as the Herald columnist pointed out, Jason Kenney’s United Conservative Party has a plan to “fix” all that.

Under the Progressive Conservatives, Mr. Braid recalled, “staffing and programs were flatlined, resuscitated and then put through the same survival cycle again. It was chaotic for doctors, nurses and too often for patients.

“Now the UCP proposes something even worse – real-world cuts, with no apparent hope of a corresponding hike the next year.” And all the meaningless Coroplast pledges about protecting health care signed by Mr. Kenney will not change this if he gets to do what he says he’d do.

I was thinking about Mr. Braid’s credible prediction that Mr. Kenney’s vow to impose austerity on health care once again “guarantees a return to the chaos of the Progressive Conservative years, and maybe worse, because there would be no panic spending spikes to save the day,” when I came across another column about health care and conservatives.

The same day as Mr. Braid published his observations, Paul Krugman, economics columnist for the New York Times and a Nobel Prize winning economist, took a look at what drives the U.S. Republican Party to sabotage, and now to attempt to repeal, the Affordable Care Act, Barack Obama’s signature achievement as president.

Given that U.S. President Donald Trump is now proposing to use a legal manoeuver to take health insurance away from more than 20 million Americans in the year before a presidential election, Dr. Krugman observed, “it’s no longer possible to see any of this as part of a clever political strategy, even a nefariously cynical one.”

“It has entered the realm of pathology instead,” he said. “It’s now clear the Republicans have a deep, unreasoning hatred of the idea that government policy may help some people get health care.”

Sometimes it helps to put issues close to home in a larger context. As has been observed here recently, over the past 40 years there has been a significant effort on the right to forge an international ideological consensus through promotion of institutions such as the worldwide network of utopian market fundamentalist “think tanks” and Astro-Turf groups.

As a result, nowadays, there is very little light between conservatives in Washington and their counterparts in Ottawa and Edmonton.

So, is it possible that Mr. Kenney and the UCP have, like their Republican brethren south of the Medicine Line, gone beyond mere cynicism to outright pathology?

It’s not just health care

It’s not just the health care file where this happens, of course.

When Mr. Kenney touted his plan this week to roll back legal protections for LGBTQ students, it seemed weirdly like President Trump’s decision to move against health care that benefits poor and working class Americans. That is, not particularly to the advantage of either politician, under present circumstances, to talk about such schemes.

We have to ask, does the same kind of pathology drive Mr. Kenney to do the wrong thing about protecting LGBTQ youth from persecution – sometimes, sad to say, from their own families – as drives him to promise to return health care in Alberta to the chaos and dysfunction of the PC years?

Hundreds of people gathered at the Alberta Legislature in Edmonton last night to protest against the UCP plan to dump the NDP legislation that protects students who join gay-straight alliances and, instead, to allow teachers and private schools to out them to their families.

It is profoundly to be hoped that does not become reality. The best way to ensure it does not is to reelect the NDP on April 16.",A Tale of Two Columns: What drives the conservative urge to wreck public health care?,Alberta Politics,https://albertapolitics.ca/2019/03/a-tale-of-two-columns-what-drives-the-conservative-urge-to-wreck-public-health-care/

Vis, was in Mission Thursday night to address a crowd of more than 50 people at the leisure centre.

READ: Vis and Sidhu set for 2019 rematch

After briefly commenting on the recent federal budget, Vis said his “big, general concern” is the deficit.

“We’ve seen an exorbitant amount of new spending, $41.3 billion just alone in this budget. A 20 per cent overall increase in what the government is spending money on, but I cannot for the life of me see how that’s going to impact the average person.”

In his opinion the government is increasing the size of the bureaucracy in Ottawa and increasing program spending to narrow interest groups, but he said it is not having an overall effect on the affordability issues that “we’re facing here in the Lower Mainland, especially in Mission-Matsqui- Fraser Canyon.”

He also raised concerns about Canada’s infrastructure situation, noting that the federal Liberals created a program to provide money for infrastructure, but it hasn’t panned out.

“Their thinking was that if we increase the federal cut of the pie, that municipalities and provincial governments were going to step up and provide the funding. What’s actually happened is the municipalities and provincial governments have decreased their commitments because the federal government said they were going to increase it. What we’ve been left with is a bit of a log jam and our projects are not being built.”

He said a Conservative government would keep Ottawa spending in check, move towards a balanced budget over time and have a better use of infrastructure programs.

As for the local riding, Vis said it’s size, 22,000 square kilometes, makes it a challenge.

“The only way, in my opinion that we can apply effective representation through an area like Mission-Matsqui-Fraser Canyon… is if we structure things appropriately, work very closely with all the mayors and councils to get their ideas and I’m going to have to hold myself accountable with all of this information, to keep pushing the major concerns that we’re facing.”

Some concerns he listed were not solely Mission issues. He pointed to major ditching and dredging issues, soil erosion through the Fraser River, people living in poverty in Indigenous communities and communities struggling with basic services like hospitals and busing.

He also pointed to a “huge rate of gang crime” in the riding – largely in Abbotsford – that is growing and federal support is needed.

“I want to address environmental, economical and social issues that we’re facing.”

Finally he said he does not support changing the riding’s name from Mission-Matsqui-Fraser Canyon to Abbotsford-Mission-Fraser Canyon as proposed by current MP Jati Sidhu.

“There was no public consultation on this and it upset a lot of people. Me for example, I was born in Matsqui B.C., my dad was born in Matsqui B.C. and I lived in Matsqui before it amalgamated with Abbotsford. There is also First Nation by the name of Matsqui who lives within our riding.”

He plans to write a letter to the senate, where the bill is tabled, to suggest the first acquire some public input and ask the public what the name means to them and its historical significance.",Federal Conservative candidate talks to Mission voters,BC Local News,https://www.bclocalnews.com/news/federal-conservative-candidate-talks-to-mission-voters/

On Tuesday, the battleground moved to the Commons ethics committee, which considered a Conservative motion to launch a study after the Liberal-dominated justice committee voted to conclude its investigation without calling more witnesses.

But the six Liberals on the ethics committee out-voted the Conservatives, who had two votes, and the NDP, who had one, and the motion failed.

Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre called the result especially ironic given recent comments from some Liberal MPs that it was time for Wilson-Raybould to just say her piece, rather than dribbling out news day-by-day. In the most prominent example, Liberal MP Judy Sgro said in a radio interview over the weekend that Wilson-Raybould needed to “either put up or shut up.”

“Today, the Liberals got together and voted against giving her the chance to say it,” Poilievre told reporters. “You know, this is a cavalcade of contradictions and cover-up.”

Parliament has been seized by the SNC-Lavalin affair for nearly two months now, after The Globe and Mail published an allegation on Feb. 7 that Wilson-Raybould had been politically pressured while attorney general to intervene and defer the corruption prosecution of the construction company.

Toronto MP Nate Erskine-Smith was the only Liberal who spoke during the ethics committee meeting. Although Erskine-Smith has a track record of challenging the party line, and had even previously cast a vote in favour of holding a public inquiry on the matter, he told the committee he felt launching the study was premature.

He noted Wilson-Raybould planned to provide a written submission to the justice committee that included further evidence, including text messages and emails.

“To me, it makes far more sense to see what is said in that public statement, to see how justice (committee) reacts to that, frankly, and whether they think any of that new information is something worth reconsidering their previous decision to close off their study,” Erskine-Smith said.

The NDP’s Tracey Ramsey rejected that, saying the Liberals blocked multiple attempts to keep the investigation going. “No one in Canada believes that the justice committee is going to revisit that,” she said. “There is absolutely no indication that they will entertain any further conversation.”

The Conservatives offered an amendment to call Wilson-Raybould only after her submission to the justice committee, but Erskine-Smith said it was too early to make decisions before seeing what she provided. It is not known when Wilson-Raybould will make her submission, but justice committee chair Anthony Housefather has said it will be made public.

Erskine-Smith also pointed out that Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion is already studying the matter, and said the committee should support Dion’s study rather than launch a parallel process.

Finally, Erskine-Smith argued that the waiver provided by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Wilson-Raybould on cabinet confidence privilege and solicitor-client privilege only covered testimony to the justice committee, not the ethics committee.

That waiver has become its own source of conflict, however. Wilson-Raybould has pointed out it does not apply to events after she was removed as justice minister, and opposition parties have demanded Trudeau provide an expanded waiver to cover that time period. Philpott also said in an interview in Maclean’s magazine last week that there was “much more to the story that should be told.”

This breach of the confidentiality of what is supposed to be a highly confidential judicial appointment process is serious enough to require an investigation on its own

After the meeting, while other Liberal MPs left without making their position clear, Erskine-Smith stayed and said he believed an expanded waiver may be necessary — depending what Wilson-Raybould’s evidence to the justice committee showed.

“If still, to get at the truth, there is additional information that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott need to provide that they are unable to provide because of the confines of the existing waiver, then yes, to get at the truth there should be a broadening of that waiver,” he said.

He said he believed that was only a fair position, given the comments from some of his colleagues that “we should get all of this information out in the open as quickly as possible and deal with it and move on.”

Both the Conservatives and NDP — and even Erskine-Smith — condemned two stories that came out Monday that contained leaks about the Supreme Court of Canada appointment process. The stories cited confidential sources to allege that tension had arisen between Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould when she recommended the appointment of Glenn Joyal, a Manitoba judge who Trudeau felt to be too conservative.

“This breach of the confidentiality of what is supposed to be a highly confidential judicial appointment process is serious enough to require an investigation on its own,” said Conservative MP Peter Kent during the meeting.

Speaking earlier in the day, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau did not respond directly when asked by a reporter whether his office leaked the story.

“Canadians can have confidence in our government’s respect for the institutions, for the Supreme Court,” he said. “Canadians have confidence in the strength of our judiciary in this country. And I have no further comment to make on this issue.”

Will there be a Game 7?

By Canadian Press on March 26, 2019.

CALGARY – Another United Conservative Party candidate who has pulled out of the Alberta election says someone outside the party is threatening to release her past social media comments about Muslim refugees and transgender washrooms in schools.

Eva Kiryakos, who was running in Calgary-South East in the April 16 vote, announced her resignation in a Facebook statement and video released Sunday night.

Kiryakos said she’s been getting threats from someone who wants to release images of things she has said or commented on.

“Someone outside of our party has been threatening to smear me, and I have had enough of the bullies and the threats,” she said in the statement. “This is who I am and I will keep speaking up – for myself and for Albertans.”

In one of the online exchanges, Kiryakos retweeted an article about Germany’s alleged migrant rape crisis called “Rapefugees Not Welcome.”

She said in her statement that everyone retweets and shares articles.

“I admit the image on the article isn’t positive,” she said. “But the article was on women getting raped and the crisis there. When women are being assaulted, I care, no matter the faiths or the backgrounds of the people.”

In another post, Kiryakos wrote about transgender washrooms in Alberta schools. “I should have the right to choose for my children to not be brainwashed into accepting perversions as ‘alternative lifestyles.”’

In her statement, she said she was concerned for her daughter’s safety and voiced her honest opinion.

“It’s OK to disagree.”

UCP Leader Jason Kenney said he appreciates her decision to step down and put the party first. He did not specifically comment on the social media posts.

“I’ve always been clear that the United Conservative Party is a big-tent coalition that respects human dignity and will protect the rights of people regardless of how they pray or who they love,” he said.

“Eva’s also from a minority community herself. She is from a Middle Eastern refugee family, from a community that has faced a history of genocide.”

Kiryakos, a lawyer and mother of two, said she came to Canada as a child with her parents after they fled persecution for their Christian faith in Iraq. She said she was raised in Saskatchewan and taught to speak up and practise her right to freedom of speech.

Last week, Calgary UCP candidate Caylan Ford stepped down after publication of a private 2017 Facebook conversation in which she allegedly spoke about the replacement of white people in their homelands and the collapse of western culture.

Ford has degrees from three universities, including Oxford, and once worked as a policy adviser for what is now Global Affairs Canada under the Harper government. She was considered a star candidate.

At the time, NDP Leader Rachel Notley said she was shocked by Ford’s comments. She said she doesn’t believe Kenney is a racist but that the UCP has a problem with racism.

On Monday, she told reporters that the problem isn’t about the UCP not properly vetting candidates.

“I think this is about the leadership,” she said.

“This is not in my mind, a good look for anybody who is seeking to represent Albertans in the legislature and to lead this province.”

China, citing the discovery of pests, expanded its ban on canola seed imports on Tuesday to include shipments from a second major exporter, Viterra.

Viterra is owned by Glencore’s agricultural arm. Earlier this month, Beijing halted shipments from Richardson International, Canada’s top exporter of canola seed.

Canada’s Liberal government and China have been locked in a trade and political dispute since the chief financial officer of Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies was arrested in Vancouver last December on a U.S. extradition request.

China accounts for about 40 per cent of Canada’s canola seed, oil and meal exports, according to the Canola Council, with seed exports to China worth some $2.7 billion a year.

Canada’s official opposition Conservative party, which opinion polls show could win an election in October, says Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has not done enough to help canola farmers and is bungling ties with China.

“The restrictive measures imposed by China are said to be rooted in science. We have asked for the evidence,” Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said in a statement.

“To date, none has been supplied. We will keep pushing as hard as we can on this vital point,” added Goodale, an MP from Saskatchewan, Canada’s biggest canola-producing province by tonnage since 1990.

Trudeau said on Wednesday he was concerned about the ban and could send a delegation to Beijing. He met with Richardson executives on Tuesday.

Goodale, using sterner language, said “measures that defy science and contravene sound business and trading practices detract from the good reputation for reliability which all trading nations seek to maintain.”

The Chinese embassy was not immediately available for comment.

Canadian food inspection officials say they have found no problems with canola seed exports.

“We will intervene at the right level of seniority and intensity — scientifically, strategically and diplomatically — to have the best possible impact,” said Goodale.

Conservative legislators on Thursday sent a letter requesting an emergency meeting of the Commons agriculture committee on Friday.

“We fear that if this issue is not resolved expeditiously, farmers will suffer significantly because of the prime minister’s ongoing mishandling of the Canada-China relationship,” they said in the letter.

That piece is “Harper: Serial Abuser of Power, The Evidence Compiled: The Tyee’s full, updated list of 70 Harper government assaults on democracy and the law.”

You can find it here.

The article lists dozens of serious abuses of power racked up by former prime minister Stephen Harper and his Conservatives from the time they formed government in 2006 until the date the article was published, Aug. 10, 2015.

The list was not concerned with Tory laws, policies or positions disagreeable to people whose politics don’t lean right.

Instead, The Tyee defined abuses of power to be the opposite of good government, acts ranging from “scams to smears, monkey-wrenching opponents to intimidating public servants… some offences are criminal, others just offend human decency.”

The article drew on suggestions from Tyee readers as well as journalists. Each carefully researched item in the list is linked to credible journalistic sources, including newspapers such as the National Post and the Globe and Mail whose editorial boards had backed the Conservatives in the previous election, and would do so in the fall of 2015.

The article quickly became one of The Tyee’s most read ever, and was one of the most widely read pieces by any news organization covering the federal election. After the contest was won by the Justin Trudeau-led Liberals, traffic for the article faded and it resided in The Tyee’s digital archives.

With another election coming, Trudeau and his party deny improper pressure was applied to former minister of justice and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould in hopes of stopping a criminal trial of Montreal-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board president Jane Pilpott, who say the political interference was real, have resigned from cabinet. Trudeau’s top advisor Gerald Butts and Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick have quit their posts, as well.

After Wilson-Raybould gave testimony to the House justice committee on Feb. 27, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh called for an independent investigation into the affair.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer was more aggressive, demanding that Trudeau step down.

Trudeau had “lost the moral authority to govern,” he charged, and was a “prime minister who allows his partisan, political motivations to overrule his duty to uphold the rule of law. A prime minister who doesn’t know where the Liberal Party ends and where the government of Canada begins.”

Perhaps not coincidentally, that’s when The Tyee’s rap sheet on the last Conservative government began gaining a lot of new readers.

In the past month, the piece has received more than 14,000 page views, a near 2,000-per-cent jump over this time last year. Its numbers topped almost all other Tyee stories this month.

Who is suddenly reading and sharing the article and why?

It’s not hard to imagine why members of both the federal Liberals and NDP would find it apt to promote. The Liberals could point to the bad record of the Conservatives as evidence they were just as scandal-plagued when in power, or more so. The NDP might offer the piece to people souring on the Liberals as proof their party offers a cleaner alternative to the Tories.

Scheer was a Conservative MP throughout the Harper government, rising high in its ranks before becoming House speaker. He was first elected as a Saskatchewan MP in 2004, after accusing his opponent of being soft on child pornography because, in Commons debate, he’d warned against censoring art such as Nabokov’s novel Lolita.

A recent tweet by Tyee web director Bryan Carney noted the article has been popular of late.

This four-year-old Harper power abuses story almost kept up with SNC-Lavalin stories in traffic last weekhttps://t.co/y7z2rcmTjF — Bryan Carney (@bpcarney) March 4, 2019

The story has never flatlined, but Carney points out that the day after Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, traffic began to ramp up. First, the hits came from Google.

Keywords like “did Stephen Harper break campaign rules”, “Harper + ethics violations”, “Harper government members with criminal convictions”, “Harper government scandals” and “what lies did Harper tell the Canadian people” started to show up from Google traffic.

Next, the traffic started to arrive from social media.

John Morris/The Canadian Press

Prince Edward Island’s Green leader is contemplating making history – as the party’s first Canadian premier.

Islanders will go to the polls April 23 in a provincial election announced late Tuesday.

Recent polls have put the Greens out in front, and Leader Peter Bevan-Baker believes his party can win a province that has only ever been governed by the Liberals or Tories.

“That possibility is there. Emotionally, politically and intellectually, I feel like I’m ready for that challenge, in a way that I wasn’t perhaps a year ago,” he said.

“This could be a truly historic moment not only in Canadian politics but for the future of our grandchildren.”

Bevan-Baker, 56, grew up in Scotland and immigrated to Canada in 1985, living in Newfoundland and then Ontario before settling in Prince Edward Island in 2003. He became a Canadian citizen in 1992.

A dentist by profession, he became his party’s first member of the P.E.I. legislature in 2015, following nine unsuccessful bids provincially and nationally for the party.

Since then, the Greens captured a second seat on the Island, and have been successful in getting members elected in other provinces, including three during last year’s New Brunswick election.

Bevan-Baker – who celebrated Tuesday’s election call by playing “First Call” on his trumpet at a nomination meeting – said he believes the time for the Green party has arrived.

“That sort of global movement away from conventional politics and unimaginative politicians, you see that expressed everywhere,” he said, citing recent elections in U.S. and Ontario as expressions of disgruntlement with conventional politics.

“I think what’s happening on P.E.I. is a local expression of that global phenomenon,” he said.

A Corporate Research Associates opinion poll released this month suggests the Greens had a healthy lead, followed by the Progressive Conservatives, who picked a new leader, Dennis King, in February.

The Liberals were in third place, the poll suggests.

Bevan-Baker said that both delights and surprises him. He said he has to accept the possibility of forming government.

“We’ve crafted a platform, that for perhaps the first time ever in Canada, a Green platform that might have to be implemented. You come at it with a different lens. You can’t be just aspirational and vague and uncosted. You have to have a detailed and costed platform, which we have,” he said.

But Liberal Premier Wade MacLauchlan has issued a caution about the Green party, saying the province’s future is too important to risk on uncertain expensive social experiments.

Story continues below advertisement

Bevan-Baker said he’s not sure what MacLauchlan is referring to, but believes it could be his suggestion that P.E.I. would be a good place for a pilot program for a universal basic income. He said that would be expensive at first, but pay off in the long run.

For his part, MacLauchlan used the first full day of the campaign to promise at least 3,500 new jobs over the next four years.

He said that’s in addition to the 5,000 full-time jobs added over the last four years.

“As I have said numerous times since I became premier, the creation of jobs and job choices for Islanders has to be the number one priority of government.”

“Our record in this field is strong. However, our present success is no reason to take the foot off the gas. Support for workers, for employers and for the next generations of workers needs to continue.”

The announcement includes a $4.5 million P.E.I. Worker Benefit to assist 12,600 low-income Islanders.

Story continues below advertisement

The Liberals would also spend $750 million on infrastructure programs to improve roads, bridges and schools, with a focus on job creation.

MacLauchlan said money would also be spent on a number of training programs, including new vocational facilities at Island high schools, and the small business tax rate would be reduced to 2.5 per cent by 2020.

Repeated calls requesting an interview with Progressive Conservative Leader Dennis King were not returned Wednesday.

Bevan-Baker said his party’s platform will be released in its entirety – likely next week.

While the parties have begun to pitch their issues, Don Desserud, a political scientist at the University of Prince Edward Island, said he believes the election will come down to personalities.

“It’s going to be an election based on the personalities of the leaders and people are going to vote according to whether they like or dislike the leaders of the parties,” Desserud said.

Story continues below advertisement

“The Progressive Conservatives are rising in the polls. The Liberals are falling in the polls and the Greens are staying quite steady high in the polls. I think it all has to do with the leaders and how well they’re liked,” he said.

The Island economy has been strong and the Conference Board of Canada recently said P.E.I. would lead the country in economic growth for the year ahead.

Desserud said voters blame the government when the economy is bad, but unfortunately for the Liberals, they don’t often credit the government when the economy is good.

“The Green party has been prudent in the way in which they have presented themselves and their policies and have appealed to the small ‘c’ conservatism of the Island. That’s worked really well for them, but I think right now they’re benefiting from the fact they are the alternative,” Desserud said.","PEI Green Leader says he is ready to form government, make party history",The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-pei-green-leader-says-he-is-ready-to-form-government-make-party/

Author: Sean Rehaag, Associate Professor, Osgoode Hall Law School, York University, Canada

According to media reports, Bill Blair, Canada’s minister of border security, is attempting to close a loophole in the Canada-U.S. Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA).

The agreement allows Canada to send asylum-seekers back to the United States without hearing their refugee claims (and allows the U.S. the same option for those going in the other direction). The loophole is that the STCA only applies to asylum-seekers who present themselves at official land ports-of-entry.

Since President Donald Trump was elected, around 40,000 asylum seekers have used this loophole by crossing into Canada from the U.S. at places other than official ports-of-entry. They are not trying to sneak into Canada undetected. Rather, they cross the border irregularly to avoid being turned away under the STCA and then approach Canadian authorities to make refugee claims.

The number of irregular border-crossers has declined recently, with fewer than 1,000 in January 2019. What’s more, while the overall number of refugee claims made in Canada has been higher than usual in the past two years, it is not far off historical norms.

Nonetheless, the additional 40,000 refugee claims have produced pressures on the refugee determination system and on provincial social programs. There has also been political pushback, with calls from the Conservative party for the government to stem the flow.

However, closing the STCA loophole is a complicated proposition.

Blair reportedly wants irregular border-crossers to be taken to official ports-of-entry and processed as if they had presented themselves there directly. In other words, the STCA would apply both at official ports-of-entry and elsewhere.

To make this work, the U.S. would need to agree, which is the first complication.

More asylum-seekers come to Canada

The purpose of the STCA from a Canadian perspective was to force the U.S. to take responsibility for asylum-seekers who travel to Canada via the United States. Canada had long wanted the STCA because the flow of asylum-seekers is asymmetrical. Far more asylum-seekers come to Canada from the U.S. than the reverse.

For the same reason, the United States has long refused to agree to the STCA. That only changed after 9-11, when Canada offered the U.S. greater border security integration in exchange for the STCA.

Canada now wants to expand the STCA, so the question is: What will Canada have to give the U.S. to get them to agree?

One might expect quite a lot, given that Trump has shown little interest in taking steps that would result in thousands of asylum-seekers who would otherwise go to Canada remaining in the U.S.

The need for a quid pro quo raises a second complication. The STCA is being challenged in Canadian courts by human rights organizations who say that the U.S. is not safe for refugees and that the STCA violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Given the anti-refugee policies of the Trump administration, there is a good chance that courts will strike down the STCA. By negotiating expansions to the STCA without waiting to see whether the regime is upheld, there is a real risk that anything Canada gives to the U.S. in exchange will be for naught.

A third complication: Even if Canada gets the U.S. to agree to expand the STCA, and even if the regime is upheld by the courts, the impact of any expansion is likely to be both counterproductive and dangerous.

A dangerous incentive

If asylum-seekers who are intercepted at irregular border crossings are returned to the U.S., this will create a strong incentive for such asylum-seekers to cross the border without being intercepted.

Currently, irregular border crossings are manageable and organized. Most occur in a single, well-monitored location in Quebec. That crossing is not dangerous. Border officials and RCMP are present. Irregular border-crossers immediately enter into immigration and refugee processing, which includes health, criminality and security screening.

Other countries that have tried to stem flows of asylum-seekers by closing off safe and manageable routes have had a common experience. The flows do not stop but are instead diverted into more remote and hence more dangerous routes. Organized crime gets involved, bringing increased security risks and violence. The inevitable result is lost lives and decreased border security.

In the end, the political pressure on the government to be seen doing something on this file may outweigh these policy considerations. But politics lead to a fourth complication.

During the last federal election campaign, Justin Trudeau distinguished himself from former prime minister Stephen Harper partly through a more compassionate response to the Syrian refugee crisis and the death of Alan Kurdi — himself a tragic victim of cat-and-mouse games between smugglers and governments seeking to keep refugees at bay.

Shortly after Trump’s inauguration, Prime Minister Trudeau further sought the moral high ground when, in response to the president’s anti-refugee policies, he famously tweeted Canadians will welcome those fleeing persecution.

There is no way to close the STCA loophole without the Liberal party turning its back on those progressive values, on the eve of a federal election campaign.

In this context, attempting to expand the STCA may not only be bad policy, it may also be bad politics.

B.C.'s John Horgan finds himself among Canada's most popular premiers, according to a new poll.

The poll conducted by the Angus Reid Institute has Horgan sitting in the third most popular position behind Quebec Premier François Legault and Saskatchewan's, Scott Moe.

British Columbia Premier John Horgan received the approval of more than half of B.C., earning the backing of 52 per cent of B.C. residents. Thats an increase of 9 percentage points since December, when four-in-ten or 43 per cent approved of his performance. The current number ties Horgan’s highest mark as premier, which was set in March 2018.

Most premiers have seen their standing among their own constituencies improve – or at least hold – since December. The two exceptions are Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s approval drops four points this quarter to 38 per cent.

Alberta’s Rachel Notley, currently seeking a second term as Alberta premier, faces long odds ahead of the April 16 election day. Recent polls, including one released by the Angus Reid Institute, have consistently pointed to a substantial lead for the opposition United Conservative Party.

""On the big things that will reduce our climate pollution, allow Canada to fulfil its role under the Paris agreement and show the poorer countries of the world that are suffering ...","

Allison Jones, The Canadian Press





TORONTO -- Ontario's environmental commissioner issued dire warnings Wednesday about the ""frightening"" state of climate policy in the province as she delivered her office's last report.

The Progressive Conservative government announced last fall that it was eliminating the office of the environmental commissioner and merging its functions with the auditor general. In delivering a report on energy conservation, Dianne Saxe said Ontario is heading in the wrong direction on the environment.

""At a time when climate damage is accelerating, Ontario is turning away from the things that we know work,"" she said, describing the government's climate policy as ""very inadequate, very frightening.""

""On the big things that will reduce our climate pollution, allow Canada to fulfil its role under the Paris agreement and show the poorer countries of the world that are suffering the greater damage that we are going to do our part, we are causing great damage.""

Saxe is critical of the government's cancellation of a cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gases, as well as the cancellation of electricity conservation programs and a growth plan that she says increases urban sprawl and therefore reliance on transportation fuels.

""I think that what we're doing in Ontario and what we may do in Canada this year puts the entire Paris Agreement at risk,"" she said, referring to the federal Conservatives' opposition to the upcoming carbon tax.

""If the world can't hold together on the Paris Agreement we are toasted, roasted and grilled.""

The 2015 Paris Agreement sets a target of keeping average global temperatures from rising by more than 2 C, or 1.5 C if possible.

Saxe was critical of the government's recent cancellation of a slew of electricity conservation programs, including rebates for energy-efficient heating and cooling equipment, discounts for buying energy-efficient products such as LED light bulbs, incentives for builders to improve energy performance in new residences, and refrigeration equipment upgrade incentives.

Since 2007, Ontario has made valuable progress in conserving electricity and some progress in conserving natural gas, and without those programs the province would be emitting about six megatonnes more each year in carbon dioxide equivalents, she said.

The government's environment plan doesn't even mention electricity conservation, Saxe said, and abandoning it would increase greenhouse gas emissions from electricity by about two megatonnes.

Environment Minister Rod Phillips said his climate plan will produce a 30 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, the target set by the federal government, without a carbon tax -- which the province continues to rail against.

Phillips said the plan focuses conservation efforts on natural gas instead of electricity.

""We're adding conservation programs around areas that actually produce greenhouse gases, like natural gas production,"" he said. ""The conservation programs related to electricity largely are affecting programs that come from our electricity grid, which because of nuclear power, because of renewables, because of hydro, doesn't produce a great deal of greenhouse gas.""

NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said reports and comments like the ones Wednesday from the environmental commissioner are why the government got rid of Saxe's office.

""They don't want to hear what it takes and what's necessary to meet greenhouse gas emission reduction targets,"" she said. ""Instead, they just want to continue along their merry way and not take seriously our responsibilities when it comes to climate change.""

Green party Leader Mike Schreiner called it a ""tragic loss"" to no longer have a standalone officer to report on facts and evidence that members of the legislature need to make sound policy decisions.

Premier Doug Ford had promised that not a single job would be lost under his government, but Saxe said this move has meant 12 people are losing their jobs.","State of Ontario's climate policy is 'frightening,' watchdog says",CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/state-of-ontario-s-climate-policy-is-frightening-watchdog-says-1.4354564

He says he saw how the current economic climate gripping the province left 100,000 out of work.

So, when his friend Mark Grinder approached him about the Alberta Independence Party, he decided to get involved.

“Mark was involved with the Alberta Independence Party for a while, and thought I would be open to their platform. I did my research, and liked what they were presenting.”

Keller will run for the party in the Fort McMurray-Wood Buffalo riding.

It’s his first time running for office, but the 23-year resident and heavy-duty technician believes his party’s platform is ideal for the region.

“Lower taxes, individually as well as corporate. Our platform is eight and half per cent corporate tax for Alberta companies, and personal tax is 20 per cent flat tax.”

Why “Independence”?

Keller admits the Alberta Independence Party raises eyebrows.

Some argue not voting for the Alberta NDP or United Conservative Party would “split the vote”.

He is more than happy to explain to prospective voters why they should a vote for the Alberta Independence Party.

“We’re looking at the people, who [are] not necessarily are strongly affiliated with another political party, and are open to new suggestions, new ideas. Independence: It’s something new, but unfortunately that’s the only way that we can get things turned around in Alberta.”

Keller adds a vote for Independence is a vote against the federal government.

He believes Ottawa turned their back on the province citing the growing debt and equalization payments.

“It’s not just the oil and gas industry, everybody’s hurting. The federal government doesn’t really seem to care that 100,000 or more [are] out of work. That has spin-off effects with restaurants, clothing stores, and grocery stores.”

What Keller and the Alberta Independence Party would like to see are the three pipelines going to international markets.

Currently, Keller argues Canada fell behind as changes to oil production and shipping by IMO 2020 may render Trans Mountain obsolete.

“In 2020, the Burnaby port is going to be obsolete, so this whole idea of the pipeline going to Burnaby is under false pretences. Canadian taxpayers are going to be paying five billion dollars for nothing.”

Because it’s not only in Canada that you can ...,"We have learned so much. Within minutes Monday afternoon, two good reporters had stories (here and here) about the Chief Justice of Manitoba, who was a candidate to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada and who, later, wasn’t. Both reporters unfurled similar yarns about a lone Prime Minister standing athwart the tide of conservatism by blocking—shudder—a Harper appointee from sitting on the top court. Jody Wilson-Raybould plays the role of villain in the piece.

Both reporters decorously neglect to mention that Trudeau’s choice for Chief Justice, Richard Wagner, was a Harper appointee.

There are many things we can say about this story, working outward in concentric rings from the thing itself. First, Glenn Joyal’s views, as expressed in speeches that were said to alarm the prime minister, are almost comically orthodox. I first became aware of the notion that Charter litigation systematically airlifts important matters from the parliamentary arena and into the realm of jurisprudence in a Chantal Hébert column in the late 1990s. If I had paid more attention to literally any of my Canadian public administration profs a decade earlier I would have caught the argument then, because it is canvassed in every Canadian political science class. This is not wild-eyed Hayekism.

Second, perhaps the many thousands of Canadians who have applied for federal government appointments under what they thought was a confidential process, introduced by this prime minister, will want to contemplate a class-action suit against him. Because it is now radiantly clear to each of them that their CV is being held hostage by a claque of embattled sorcerers’ apprentices who will cheerfully wheel it over the transom to any waiting scribe if anything about them—their opinions, a fallen political star’s unfortunate decision to argue for their advancement—becomes politically inconvenient. This is the very stuff of the police state.

It was immediately fashionable to wonder on social media how everyone would react if Stephen Harper had done such a thing. It’s germane to note that Stephen Harper never did. Because he had more class. Welcome to the Tet offensive of Charter rights: This was the week it became necessary to destroy the village of good government in order to save it.

Third, Justice Joyal’s wife was in poor health. Apparently we are to believe that 9,000 jobs depended on your knowing that.

If the Trudeau government is not the source of the leak, I assume we will see spectacular efforts deployed in the next 36 hours to find the leaker. Mark Norman-scale efforts. But I’m pretty sure that we needn’t hold our breath, because the government is the source of the leak; that the amiable chap who currently sits in the office once occupied by the Attorney General of Canada will not bestir himself to question Monday’s sickening attack on due process; and that the leak will actually be roundly applauded by the ambient cloud of Liberal and Liberal-adjacent opinion, which became self-aware this weekend and decided Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott are a virus endangering the party’s re-election chances and must therefore be stopped.

That’s right, it’s Judgment Day. As early as March 5, it was possible for Andrew Cohen to publish a column identifying Philpott and Wilson-Raybould as enemies of the (right-thinking) people. But not for the first time, Andrew was ahead of the moment, and when that column ran, he found few takers. The news that the Criminal Code had been amended in ways SNC-Lavalin found congenial as it faced a criminal trial for serious alleged misdeeds was interesting to millions of Canadians, including many Liberals. Justin Trudeau’s slow, tentative response was worrisome to lots of people who support the government, just as it was to many others. It was still possible for many minds to find room for both general support for Liberal re-election and general interest in what Wilson-Raybould and Philpott — recent Liberal rock stars, after all — had to say.

Then Maclean’s published my interview with Philpott last Thursday morning. On Thursday night’s At Issue panel, Chantal said that with Gerald Butts and Michael Wernick no longer working in government, Philpott and Wilson-Raybould were clearly looking for someone else to lose a job, and it must be Justin Trudeau. This interpretation became popular quickly (and probably would have even if Chantal hadn’t given it voice). By Saturday it was easy to find Liberals and friends of Liberals — pollsters, the odd political scientist, about half the party’s Ontario caucus — attributing the worst motives to the two former ministers. They were “infatuated with ephemeral attention,” said Frank Graves. They were committing “an attempted coup d’état,” wrote a lawyer with impressive credentials, Ishat Reza. This behaviour is, she added, “disqualifying.” This is understatement: Historical penalties for coup plotting have been harsher than exclusion from a governing caucus.

Qui veut noyer son chien l’accuse de la rage, we say in Quebec. When you want to drown your dog you say it has rabies.

This SNC-Lavalin business has been bewildering — honestly bewildering, in ways that are surely easy to understand — for many Canadians with good hearts since it began. It is an odd scandal by many standards. No money changed hands illegally, or at least not after the Qaddafis were executed. None of the assorted Liberal staffers and high officials who came at Jody Wilson-Raybould was seeking personal advancement, except insofar as many of them wanted to be on the winning side in an election and, she asserts, kept telling her so. They kept asking whether she’d seek outside advice on a decision that was the public prosecutor’s to make and the AG’s to review. When they were done asking, the prosecutor’s decision held. That would have been the end of that, if she hadn’t been shuffled. Then it became a duel of assertions and interpretations.

It’s easy to understand why all of this would seem minor and technical. An interesting theological debating point, but surely not worth more than a month of headlines and anguished commentary. So it didn’t get real, for many people, until Conservatives took the lead from Liberals in the polls — and Jane Philpott, whom Trudeau had been busy promoting in cabinet, announced that she too doesn’t like whatever she says she knows.

This puts the stakes high indeed. Everything Trudeau advocates is endangered, not by his own increasingly conspicuous limitations as a public administrator, but by the shorter route of a possible Conservative election victory this autumn. So it is all Liberal hands on deck. All of this is easy to understand.

I felt something like this was coming when I wrote, near the bottom of a column I wrote last November that was published in December, that an election is “the crudest possible instrument” for fixing serious shortcomings in public administration. It’s simply not true that if you don’t like something a government does you must replace it. But nor should re-electing the Liberals mean endorsing Justin Trudeau’s increasingly obvious flaws. The issues raised by the SNC-Lavalin controversy shouldn’t be settled by an election. Some misdeeds are worth dealing with as themselves, when they come up. And then let the election settle the election.

What is at stake in this affair is whether you can get the rules changed in mid-stream if you have the right friends or can hire them. Whether the decisions of competent professionals — beginning with an experienced prosecutor and defence lawyer, Kathleen Roussel — should be trumped by appeals to a preferred electoral outcome. This sort of system-rigging has been at the heart of, for instance, Poland’s confrontation with the European Union over judicial “reforms” that systematically benefit associates of the current regime. Reforms that are immensely popular among people who agree with the ruling party that they tilt the balance back toward fairness in a confrontation against political opponents they judge to be moral failures. Because it’s not only in Canada that you can win many arguments by saying, “Of course this helps our side, but that’s okay because our side is right.”

There’s a neat symmetry here. Jody Wilson-Raybould claimed she was approached, again and again, by people who said things had to work out a certain way because it was an election year. The emerging Liberal argument this month has been, not that this claim was untrue, but that of course it is true and should be. Wilson-Raybould and Philpott have sinned against a higher virtue so sure of itself that it cannot be troubled with the fine print. This sin is deemed disqualifying. They will soon be disqualified by their fellow Liberals, for the (synonymous) good of the party and the nation. And if you’ve sent your CV to Ottawa, have no fear. It probably won’t get leaked until it needs to be.

When Donald Trump was elected in 2016, many of us Canadians wagged our fingers smugly at our southern neighbour. “What were they thinking?” we said to one another in line at Tim Hortons. We spent the next year or so glued to CNN, more captivated by American politics than what’s happening here.

We might have wanted to pay more attention.

The tide in the Great White North appears to be shifting right — but not in the way we’re used to. This isn’t a typical liberal-conservative tug-o-war, the ebb and flow we’ve seen throughout election cycles. This new movement is one that has already swept through Hungary, Poland, the U.S., it’s fuelled Brexit in the U.K. and has seen the rise of the far-right party Alternative for Germany, who have been compared to the Nazi regime. And it’s tilted so far to the right that it threatens to upend our democracy and the very liberties we’ve fought for.

While conservatives have historically called for less government regulation, lower taxes and a stronger military, today’s Canadian right-wing politics has rebranded itself to include more visible intolerance. Bigotry isn’t just bubbling under the surface these days, it’s out in the open and proudly displayed for when the guests come over.

This ugly, newfound boldness threatens to dominate the next federal election, impacting not only the world’s view of us a fair, diverse and welcoming country, but also the lives of all marginalized Canadians. That keeps me up at night.

As a gay mother with a trans child in the Ontario school system, and as a human rights advocate who spends a lot of time on social media, I’m on the receiving end of a lot of messages from people who think it’s “about time” politicians start standing up to “special interest groups.” We’ve been coddled for too long, they say, and we don’t deserve special treatment. They mock, namecall and outright threaten those of us who fight for the rights of marginalized people to be preserved. They’ve always done this, of course, but their voices, now embolded by the very politicians and public figures they support, are growing in number and getting angrier. I’ve had to file two police reports after my life was threatened — and those are only the incidents I reported.



This swing to the populist right is both in our face and insidious. Donald Trump might be loud and brash, but his win was unexpected by most. We surveyed the damage from up north, thinking it couldn’t possibly happen here. Surely, Canadians know better. We didn’t.

Modern populism has grown quietly, from the pages of right-wing websites to the birth of new neo-fascist groups such as the Proud Boys, now designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Support for the populism movement gained traction through one protest, one meeting, and one tweet at a time. Now it’s loud and it’s everywhere. It unseated Premier Kathleen Wynne and her Ontario government, with Premier Doug Ford and the Conservatives promising little more than a buck-a-beer and the end of teaching gender identity in schools.

And then, in October 2018, Premier Ford met privately with university professor Jordan Peterson. While the premier openly discussed other meetings that had taken place around that time, the public only learned of this one after the CBC obtained his itinerary through a freedom of information request.

Wildly popular in some right-wing circles, Peterson’s views have been slammed as retrograde, problematic and dangerous. He became well-known after taking a stand against using trans people’s chosen pronouns, claiming being forced to do so is an attack on free speech. He argued vehemently against the federal Liberal government’s now-passed trans rights bill, speaking in front of the senate committee overseeing the bill, and warned his followers about the dangers of “compelled speech.” Peterson has also proposed “enforced monogamy” as a way to reduce male violence and believes “crazy women” can’t be controlled by men because men can’t resort to physical violence against them.

Despite, or, perhaps, because of these views, Peterson, who teaches at the University of Toronto, earns tens of thousands of dollars monthly from his Patreon account, a site where fans can pledge financial support to creators of all stripes. These donations are given to him by admirers, many of them Canadians.

Ford, meanwhile, campaigned heavily on the removal of Ontario’s most current incarnation of the sex-ed curriculum, and followed through — a move that has earned much criticism and more than one lawsuit. However, it was also, in part, what earned his party a majority government. A slew of Ontarians has proudly come out in support of Ford’s policies, including the removal of mandatory student funding for certain college and university services, such as pride centres.

A week before meeting with Premier Ford, Peterson had spoken out in a tweet against the Ontario Human Rights Commission, claiming it to be the most “dangerous” organization in Canada, and calling for the Ford government to abolish it. Peterson has previously said he doesn’t agree with the OHRC’s support of gender identity and gender expression. The OHRC had just joined the legal fight against the Ontario provincial government’s removal of the sex-ed curriculum, which covered LGBTQ+ issues, consent and cyber-bullying.

The Ontario Human Rights Commission does exactly what the name implies: using the Ontario Human Rights Code as its guide, it strives to protect all Ontarians from discrimination and harassment. Those who are fiscally-minded might also appreciate how the OHRC first tries to resolve issues between parties out of court, taking the less-expensive mediation approach. It is not the country’s most dangerous organization, but its dismantling could certainly be very dangerous.

The timing of this secret meeting should ring alarm bells for liberals and conservatives alike. Protecting human rights is, after all, supposed to be a closely-held Canadian value.

Trump’s 2016 victory was a dog whistle for bigotry that reached the ears of Canadians. Doug Ford has proven Ontario will welcome similar politics, while Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada, a federal right-wing party formed in 2018, has over 30,000 members and a social media presence that speaks out against “political correctness” and “diversity nonsense.”

Taking a page from the Yellow Vest movement in France, the Facebook group “Yellow Vests Canada” has more than 100,000 members. What began as a place to organize protests around the country quickly became a spot where anti-Liberal sentiments and memes are circulated around the clock, several going so far as to call for the Prime Minister’s death. Immigration is regularly condemned, and Islamophobia is dismissed as a made-up word.

While some of the most offensive posts have been removed over recent weeks, the views are still crystal clear. This group isn’t just anti-tax and pro-oil, it’s filled to the brim with intolerance. This message is consistent throughout provincial groups as well, such as BC Proud, Alberta Proud and Ontario Proud. With a combined total of hundreds of thousands of members in these groups, cries of fake news and the danger of refugees abound.

These sentiments don’t just live online.

Statistics Canada reported hate crimes had reached historically high levels in 2017, rising 47 per cent over the previous year, with Ontario and Quebec leading the pack on reported incidents. Black, Jewish and Muslim people were targeted most. Quebec saw a 50 per cent increase in hate crimes overall, and crimes against Muslims tripled between 2016 and 2017. In January of 2017, a shooter killed six men and injured several others in a Quebec City Mosque. Meanwhile, Ontario saw a 207 per cent increase in hate crimes against Muslims, and an 84 per cent increase against Black people. Crimes against LGBTQ+ people have also climbed. Swastikas have been spray painted on synagogues and other buildings across the country. Intolerance is growing.

Populism has many sources. Perhaps there are people who are tired of looking inward and are now lashing outward. Maybe, for some, it’s simpler to blame immigrants when they can’t find work than the companies who cut minimum wage jobs and still pay their executives millions in bonuses. Maybe it’s easier to find a scapegoat, to call someone like me a child abuser for supporting my transgender teen, than it is to grow and broaden our ideas of what’s normal.

Societal change can be hard and it can make people uncomfortable, but that’s a flimsy excuse for discrimination.

Intolerance has never gone away, it was simply out of fashion for a while. Now it’s back with a fresh new look and a boost from fake news and social media.

We should all care deeply about this frightening political shift and where it could take us.

I know I care, which is why I’m so scared about what’s happening in this country, and what’s yet to come.

The Federal Court stepped in to stop the Canadian government from deporting a Roma woman Monika and her 10-year-old daughter, Alexa, to Hungary. The stay will last until the end of the school year or the end of the judicial proceedings. The judgement came in the wake of protests organised by community groups, including Solidarity Across Borders on March 25, in front of the holocaust museum in Montreal, Canada. The authorities had ordered Monica and her child, who have been in Canada for almost 10 years, to leave the country before March 28. The community groups said that the deportation threatens the safety of Monica and Alexa due to the increasing neo-Nazi violence against Roma population in Hungary and across Europe.

While addressing the gathering, Philippe Desmarais, a member of a community group that supports the family, had said, “The racism that Alexa will suffer in Hungary as a Roma child is very well documented. That’s why her mother and all her mother’s family left Hungary. Alexa and her mother Monika have been living in Canada for 10 years. Monika herself was only 18 when she came here. They do not have anyone in Hungary. There is no possible justification for treating this child in this way. It is against all forms of humanity. Ministers Hussen and Goodale must step in now.”

Earlier, the Canada Border Services Agency had refused a request to even allow Alexa to finish her school year in Canada. In 2013, Monika’s claim for refugee status was denied, following the “Protecting Canada’s Immigration System Act”, or Bill C-31. The new bill, passed in 2012, gave high discretionary powers to the ministry in charge to decide on the acceptability of refugee groups. Following this, the then immigration minister, Jason Kenney, from the Conservative Party singled out Roma asylum-seekers, alleging that the Roma community has been “abusing” the refugee system to come to Canada. The bill has been severely criticized by various human rights organizations.

Hungary was added to a list of “Safe Countries” in the refugee bill C-31 in December 2012, which has made refugee claims for the Roma people much harder.

Monica reached Canada in 2009, after she fled from Hungary fearing the persecution of the itinerant community called Romas by neo-Nazis in Europe. The situation has changed since, but the underlying discrimination against Romas in the country has not materially altered.

THE CANADIAN PRESS

OTTAWA-Jody Wilson-Raybould recommended in 2017 that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau nominate a conservative Manitoba judge to be chief justice of the Supreme Court, even though he wasn’t a sitting member of the top court and had been a vocal critic of its activism on Charter of Rights issues, The Canadian Press has learned.

Well-placed sources say the former justice minister’s choice for chief justice was a moment of “significant disagreement’’ with Trudeau, who has touted the Liberals as “the party of the charter’’ and whose late father, Pierre Trudeau, spearheaded the drive to enshrine the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in the Constitution in 1982.

The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal discussions about a Supreme Court appointment, which are typically considered highly confidential.

For her part, Wilson-Raybould said Monday “there was no conflict between the PM and myself.’’

In an email, she characterized the matter as part of the normal process of appointing a Supreme Court justice, which involves “typically CONFIDENTIAL conversations and communications, back and forths between the PM and the AG (attorney general) on potential candidates for appointment.’’

She said she’s “not at liberty to comment’’ on the “veracity’’ of what the sources said occurred, adding, “Commentary/reporting in this regard with respect to a SCC appointment(s) could compromise the integrity of the appointments process and potentially sitting justices.’’

The issue suggests Trudeau may have had reasons unrelated to the SNC-Lavalin affair for moving Wilson-Raybould out of the prestigious Justice portfolio earlier this year, a cabinet shuffle that touched off a full-blown political crisis for the governing Liberals.

Wilson-Raybould has said she believes she was moved to Veterans Affairs as punishment for refusing to intervene to stop a criminal prosecution of the Montreal engineering giant on bribery charges related to contracts in Libya.

Trudeau has denied the SNC matter had anything to do with the decision.

She resigned a month later amid allegations she was improperly pressured by the Prime Minister’s Office to interfere in the SNC-Lavalin case, triggering a furor that has engulfed the Trudeau government ever since.

The issue, the sources say, arose after Beverley McLachlin announced in June 2017 her decision to retire that December after 28 years on the high court,

including 17 as chief justice.

Her retirement meant the government would have to choose a new chief justice

and find another bilingual judge from western or northern Canada to sit on the nine-member bench.

Trudeau created an independent, non-partisan advisory board, headed by former Conservative prime minister Kim Campbell, to identify qualified candidates to fill the western/northern vacancy and submit a short list of three to five names for consideration.

According to the sources, one of the names on the eventual list was Glenn Joyal, who had been appointed in 2011 by former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper as chief justice of Manitoba’s Court of Queen’s Bench.

Wilson-Raybould then sent Trudeau a 60-plus-page memo arguing that Joyal should not only be added to the top court but should be named chief justice as well.

Only once before in Canadian history, in 1906, when Sir Wilfrid Laurier appointed his justice minister to the top judicial job, has a prime minister chosen a chief justice who was not already sitting on the Supreme Court.

Wilson-Raybould’s pick puzzled Trudeau but he became disturbed after doing some research into Joyal’s views on the charter, the sources said.

Joyal had criticized the judiciary for broadly interpreting charter rights and expanding them to apply to things not explicitly mentioned in the charter or, in his view, intended by provincial premiers when they agreed to enshrine a charter in the Constitution.

The Supreme Court’s liberal interpretation has led to things like legalization of same-sex marriage, the right of women to choose to have an abortion and the

legalization of medical assistance in dying, among other things ? – developments Trudeau has celebrated.

In a January 2017 speech to the Canadian Constitution Foundation’s Law and

Freedom Conference, Joyal echoed conservative arguments that the top court has

usurped the supremacy of elected legislatures to determine social policy.

The charter, Joyal argued, was the result of a compromise between Pierre

Trudeau and premiers, most of whom had originally opposed inclusion of a

charter in the Constitution. The compromise was intended to maintain a balance

between the judiciary and the legislative branch of government, with

provisions allowing governments to limit or override rights altogether in some

circumstances.

Since then, judicial interpretation of the charter has ignored the intentions

of the drafters and “led without question to a level of judicial potency that

was not anticipated back in 1982,’’ Joyal said in the speech, a video of which

is available on the foundation’s website. That, in turn, has resulted in a

“less potent and less influential legislative branch that seldom has the

final word.’’

“With the ‘constitutionalizing’ of more and more political and social issues

into fundamental rights, the Canadian judiciary has all but removed those

issues, in a fairly permanent way, from the realm of future civic engagement

and future political debate,’’ he said.

Joyal was particularly critical of the Supreme Court’s interpretation of

section 7 of the charter ?_ the section which guarantees everyone the right to

life, liberty and security of the person and under which the top court struck

down Canada’s abortion law and the prohibition on medically assisted death.

The court’s liberal interpretation of that section “has become, particularly

in recent years, the single most fertile source for the discovery of new

rights and the de facto constitutionalization of political and social

issues,’’ he said.

Trudeau rejected Wilson-Raybould’s advice. He ended up appointing Sheila

Martin, a judge on the appeal courts of Alberta, Northwest Territories and

Nunavut, to fill the vacant western Canadian seat on the bench. Sitting

Supreme Court Justice Richard Wagner was elevated to the role of chief

justice.

Wilson-Raybould’s advocacy of Joyal for the top judicial job may not come as a

total surprise to some Liberals, who’ve privately noted what they consider her

conservative, restrictive approach to charter rights in a number of bills,

including those dealing with assisted dying, impaired driving and genetic

discrimination.

Jane Philpott, as health minister at the time, was jointly responsible with

Wilson-Raybould for the assisted dying legislation.

She quit the cabinet earlier this month in solidarity with Wilson-Raybould,

saying she no longer had confidence in the government’s handling of the SNC-

Lavalin affair.

Canadians watch Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election comfortable in the belief that such foreign interference couldn’t happen here.

Except it did happen here.

And while the Russians adamantly deny interference in American political affairs, the perpetrators of interference in the 2015 Canadian federal election not only devised and executed a plan aimed at helping to elect the party friendly to their cause, they publicly trumpeted their success in achieving just that. And then they got a huge bonus when one of their most fervent comrades was appointed to the most powerful non-elected position in the country.

This story has all the elements of a fiction novel. But it’s not fiction.

Piece by meticulously researched piece, independent researcher Vivian Krause spent almost 10 years unveiling the information. Every detail has been corroborated by sources, including American and Canadian tax records, together with documents and statements from the perpetrators themselves.

The story begins in 2008, when a group of radical American anti-fossil-fuel environmental organizations created Tar Sands Campaign Strategy 2.1 designed “to landlock the Canadian oilsands by delaying or blocking the expansion or development of key pipelines.”

A list of key strategic targets included: “educating and organizing First Nations to challenge construction of pipelines across their traditional territories” and bringing “multiple actions in Canadian federal and provincial courts.” A “raising the negatives” section includes recruiting celebrity spokespersons such as Leonardo DiCaprio to “lend their brand to opponents of tar sands and generating a high negative media profile for tar sands oil.”

Executing such a massive intrusion into Canadian affairs would take years and a large amount of money. Ironically, much of that anti-oil money came from the legacy of the man who founded the U.S. oil industry, John D. Rockefeller. Joining the Rockefeller Foundation were the two legacy foundations of Hewlett-Packard co-founders William Hewlett and David Packard.

These foundations, together with other American anti-fossil-fuel charities, poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the U.S.-based Tides Foundation, a murky organization that serves as a legal money launderer, receiving donations from other foundations and redistributing the funds without revealing sources.

Since American and Canadian tax laws require charities to document receipt and disbursement of funds, Krause was able to gather irrefutable evidence that tens of millions of dollars were transferred from Tides U.S. to its Tides Canada subsidiary. Moreover, the resourceful Krause obtained 70 covering letters showing recipients and use of the funds.

The largest portion the funds were directed at raising fears of oil spills among First Nations, including seven payments to help build “indigenous solidarity resistance to pipeline routes,” maintain “opposition to oil tankers” and to “provide legal support for actions constraining tar sands development.”

Funding also went to the Great Bear Initiative to build support for designating the so-called Spirit Bear habitat a nature reserve. Those initiatives resulted in the successful court appeal by First Nations suspending approval by the former government of Stephen Harper of Enbridge’s Northern Gateway Pipeline.

Then came Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s lamentable decision to disallow oil pipelines through the Great Bear Rainforest, along with a north-coast tanker ban, driving the final nails into the coffin of Northern Gateway.

Other payments include: the Pembina Institute to “advance … the narrative that oil sands expansion is problematic;” Greenpeace Canada “for events to show opposition to pipelines and tar sands expansion;” the Living Oceans Society “to build opposition to the Kinder Morgan pipeline” and Forest Ethics “to conduct education and outreach opposing the Kinder Morgan and Northern Gateway pipelines.”

The American anti-oilsands funding didn’t stop at encouraging opposition to oil pipelines. The Victoria-based Dogwood Initiative, one of the most politically active organizations in the country, received millions of dollars from Tides Canada to run get-the-vote out campaigns in the 2017 B.C. provincial election, including deployment of thousands of campaign workers in Green Party Leader Andrew Weaver’s riding. Without his election, the anti-Trans Mountain NDP/Green coalition wouldn’t have gained power.

At the federal level, money was funnelled directly to campaign activists working to help the Liberals win the 2015 election. Vancouver based non-profit society Leadnow, directly and through the B.C.-based Sisu Institute, received more than $1 million from Tides Canada with the express objective of defeating the pro-oil industry Harper Conservatives. The society claims its campaigners helped defeat Conservative candidates in 25 ridings.

Given that no new export pipelines have been built in the 10 years since their anti-oilsands campaign began, one must conclude that the American organizations have been spectacularly successful. But all that funding directed at First Nations and other anti-pipeline activist campaigns wouldn’t have been nearly so effective without the election of an ideologically anti-fossil-fuel government in Ottawa.

Until recently, the anti-tar sands website contained the following statement by campaign quarterback Michael Marx: “The controversy from the campaign contributed to political victories at the provincial and national level in 2015 and led to bold climate commitments by Canadian leaders.” Realizing the implications of Marx’s statement, it was removed following a revealing expose aired in the Jan. 20 edition of CBC’s The Weekly hosted by Wendy Mesley. It’s very much worth watching.

Election of the anti-fossil fuel Trudeau government would have been ample cause for a victory celebration. But the campaigners received a bonus beyond their wildest dreams when one of their most dedicated eco-warriors was appointed principal secretary to the prime minister, the most powerful post in the prime minister’s office. From 2008 to 2012, Gerald Butts was president and CEO of World Wildlife Fund Canada (WWF), an important Tides campaign partner.

Butts used his position in the PMO to bring other former campaigners with him. Mario Reynolds, Environment Minister Catherine McKenna’s chief of staff, is past executive director of the Pembina Institute, recipient of substantial Tides funding. Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi’s chief of staff is also a former WWF Canada official and Sarah Goodman, policy adviser to the prime minister, is a former VP of Tides Canada.

With these people at the epicentre of power, it’s no wonder the oil industry, and the hundreds of thousands of people it employed, has plummeted into political and policy purgatory.

Now Butts, the mastermind behind that economic, social and national unity disaster, has resigned. But there’s more disturbing news. I was startled to learn that Butts received two separate payments from WWF Canada totalling $361,642 during his first two years at the PMO.

In a May 26, 2016 tweet to a question from Krause, Butts responds: “It was my contract severance.”

Over my entire career leading one of Canada’s largest companies and serving as a director of four others, I have never heard of severance paid when someone decided to quit their job. But then, given that he was receiving those payments from WWF Canada while at the PMO, one might conclude that he never really changed jobs. He just combined the old and new ones together.

That, fellow Canadians, is the story that never could have been told without the determination of a real Canadian patriot who dedicated 10 years searching for the truth.

Conservative whites “who dislike diversity ...","“How are the Gulf Islands being changed by global migration patterns?”

That was the title for a talk I was to give on the Gulf Islands, after a library committee asked me to hop on the ferry and meet some of those whose homes are surrounded by the Salish Sea.

Gulf Island organizers of the talk tacked up small posters about it at their community centres, their (often-organic) grocery stores and (vegetarian) cafes.

But there was a misunderstanding. Many locals assumed, since the notices said there was to be a presentation about “global migration patterns,” I was going to talk about … birds.

It turns out bird migration may be more germane to nature-loving, kayak-paddling Gulf Islanders than the trans-national migration of humans, a phenomenon that is a key issue in Metro Vancouver but far less noticeable on the islands.

Unlike Metro Vancouver, where the population is almost half foreign-born, the demographic reality is vividly different just a short B.C. Ferries ride away from the big, bustling city.

The number of foreign-born residents who have made a home in the past two decades on the Southern Gulf Islands is just two per cent. And, unlike Metro Vancouver where the 2016 census shows whites comprise about 49 per cent of residents, the proportion of people of European origin on the Southern Gulf Islands is a notable 97 per cent.

You don’t have to be a demographer to recognize something happens when you join passengers on a ferry to the Southern Gulf Islands, Sunshine Coast, Northern Gulf Islands, or, to a slightly lesser extent, Vancouver Island. The ferry’s population suddenly turns quite European in origin.

It’s part of a long-term trend, according to Statistics Canada. More than 85 per cent of immigrants to B.C., most of whom are Asians or other people of colour, move to Metro Vancouver.

At the same time, roughly 9,000 whites and Aboriginals each year depart Metro Vancouver for different parts of B.C., especially towns on the southwest coast.

Let’s take the Southern Gulf Islands as an illustration. The region of rocky beaches and forest (comprising Saltspring, Galiano, Mayne, Pender and Saturna) provides a graphic example of the urban-rural split in regards to ethno-cultural enclaves.

While large sections of Richmond are more than two-thirds ethnic Chinese, and the core of north Surrey is more than two-thirds South Asian, more than nine of 10 of the 4,660 permanent residents of the Southern Gulf Islands are of English, Scottish or Irish descent.

The total visible minority population of the Southern Gulf Islands is only 143 people. The biggest minority cohort is Japanese, followed by Chinese and Latin Americans. And most of them settled several decades ago, if not earlier. Strikingly, the census shows no South Asians make a home on the Southern Gulf Islands.

The Indigenous proportion of the Southern Gulf Islands, meanwhile, is about five per cent, almost as high as the B.C. average. However, none of those speak an Aboriginal language. That is unlike the 195 who have German, Dutch or Danish as a second language.

The strong European roots of the Southern Gulf Islands — where the vast majority of immigrants came, before 1980, from Britain or the United States — has cultural and even political implications.

Voters on the Southern Gulf Islands have recently, for instance, sent a Green party candidate to both Ottawa and Victoria. That unique achievement reflects a Mainstreet poll that suggests B.C. whites are far more inclined to vote for the Green party than people of colour.

The shift to ethnic enclaves is likely to continue across B.C. Similar to human movements in Britain, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and elsewhere, a segment of whites are leaving behind highly diverse neighbourhoods of Metro Vancouver and Toronto for nearby predominantly white regions.

Political scientist Eric Kaufmann, who was raised in Vancouver to mixed-race parents, has created a chart showing how the proportion of whites jumped by roughly 20 per cent in a recent period in municipalities such as Squamish, North Vancouver and Port Moody.

Saanich, West Vancouver and Abbotsford are somewhat similar, Kaufmann found, retaining populations in which four of five are white.

Why are such trends occurring in the increasingly ethnically diverse West?

Demographers have long realized that many members of ethno-cultural groups tend to flock together for the sense of familiarity and the economic and social support.

In his new book, Whiteshift: Populism, Immigration and the Future of White Majorities, Kaufmann cites studies showing whites tend to move out of urban neighbourhoods that are changing as a result of in-migration.

And, surprisingly, the studies show white liberals leave ethnically diverse neighbourhoods for more Caucasian ones at a slightly higher rate than white conservatives (partly because liberals are more inclined in general to move).

Conservative whites “who dislike diversity don’t retreat from it any more than pro-diversity whites do,” writes Kaufmann, who is at the University of London, Birkbeck.

“What people say and do seems almost totally disconnected.”

Such trends make up the demographic experiment that is Metro Vancouver, which, along with Toronto, ranks as the most ethnically super-diverse region of Canada, if not the world. Meanwhile, the broad geography of Canada remains predominantly white.

For a moment, I was tempted to suggest the headline for this article about the Southern Gulf Islands could be: “Journey into the heart of whiteness.”

That would have played on the title of Joseph Conrad’s famous book, The Heart of Darkness, which was about a harrowing journey into the Congo, which Francis Ford Coppola turned into Vietnam in Apocalypse Now.

But such a headline would likely feed more half-jokes about whites. And that’s a North American cultural trend that Reihan Salam took apart in a brilliant essay in The Atlantic, titled The Utility of White Bashing.

Salam explains how anti-white rhetoric can be a way to get ahead socially and “often smacks of intra-white status jockeying.”

As with members of other ethnic enclaves in urban Canada, it is easiest to leave the white Southern Gulf Islanders to their pursuits, be they alternative energy, gardening, amateur music bands, Green party politics, orca-watching, or birding.

As people of any origin know, delight can be found in grabbing a pair of binoculars and focusing on the annual “global migration patterns” of cormorants, oystercatchers and hummingbirds.

At Toronto’s “A Cure for the Munchies,” the four-course menu is infused with cannabis.

The April 26 eight-seat culinary experience by Munchy Brothers and presented by communal dining service U-Feast sold out in less than 10 minutes, but tickets for a second and third night are already on sale for $110 per seat.

The eight guests signed up for the event next month will taste the “Mary Mo” cocktail, a mojito accented with a syrup infused with 2.5 mg of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the chemical compound that gives users that “high” sensation. They’ll be treated to the “Pipe Dreams” dessert, a Mexican churro pastry with a toasted marshmallow s'mores dip, each with 5 mg of THC from ganja-infused salt, sugar and chocolate chips. The other menu items all feature hints of cannabis, whether actually infused with the psychoactive drug or not, said Munchy Brothers head chef and creative director Pat Newton.

“All of the dishes are themed and presented as something that’s related to cannabis culture,” he told CTVNews.ca. “I've designed this menu to be playful and reflect traditional cannabis customs and archetypes.”

Like the “Bloodshot Eyes” roasted beet and crispy goat cheese salad. The dish is paired with a blood orange citrus vinaigrette drizzled onto the salad from Visine bottles, which some marijuana smokers use to hide red eyes that often come with getting high. The “Smoke and Mirrors” appetizer is a take on enjoying a “toke and a coffee” in the morning: the tomato and parmesan cappuccino is served with a smoked gouda and chive grilled cheese, served on a rolling tray (used to roll joints) complete with an ashtray, cigar shavings and freshly ground cannabis crumbs.

None of the dishes feature a strong marijuana taste or smell, because Newton’s Munchy Brothers crafted a proprietary process that removes the typically unsavory taste and scent from its products.

While cannabis edibles aren’t legal in Canada until October, this small event is private and offered to U-Feast members only. It will take place at a private condo in Yorkville’s Four Seasons Hotel and Residences, and features no retail sales of edibles. The menu items are made on the spot using cannabis-infused ingredients created by Newton’s Munchy Brothers, which are not available for sale.

“They’re paying for the service, for the hospitality,” he said. “This is like I’m inviting friends over for dinner and I’m offering an experience.”

Both Newton and U-Feast stressed that the cannabis will be consumed safely. Diners will consume up to 15 mg, which the organizers consider to be a conservative amount. “We’re careful not to have people walk out of there stoned,” said U-Feast CEO Terry Mocherniak, who said he’s planning a “cooking with cannabis 101” event. Only the cocktail at the start of the meal and the dessert at the end of the meal will feature prominent doses of THC, said Newton.

The dinner party night is meant to be a playful primer on cooking with cannabis. “The dining experience is designed to provide an uplifting experience and introduce people to the world of edibles,” he said.",Cannabis dinner party serving up 'kush-infused' mojitos and churros,CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/lifestyle/cannabis-dinner-party-serving-up-kush-infused-mojitos-and-churros-1.4352362

Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre told ...","OTTAWA—In a tense phone conversation with Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick that Jody Wilson-Raybould secretly recorded, the former attorney general repeatedly warned him that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his officials were engaging in political interference with the SNC-Lavalin prosecution. The 17-minute call on Dec. 19 begins cordially, but ends with Wernick warning Wilson-Raybould he was concerned about how the prime minister would react to her refusal to intervene in the trial and negotiate a remediation agreement with the Quebec company.

Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould provided texts and emails to the House of Commons justice committee as a followup to her testimony there on Feb. 27, when she described a “sustained” campaign by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and members of the Prime Minister’s Office to “politically interfere” in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. ( LARS HAGBERG / AFP/GETTY IMAGES FILE PHOTO )

In the call, Wilson-Raybould issued what she called the “strongest warning” to Wernick about the actions of Trudeau and others. “It is entirely inappropriate and it is political interference,” she said.

It directly contradicts Trudeau’s and his top officials’ public assertions that Wilson-Raybould never advised him of any concerns until after she was moved out of her job as justice minister in January. Wilson-Raybould previously testified she was under pressure by Trudeau and senior officials to direct that SNC-Lavalin be given a deferred prosecution agreement under a brand new law, which would allow the Quebec firm to avoid a criminal conviction and with it, a 10-year ban on bidding for federal contracts.

Article Continued Below

In new material released Friday, Wilson-Raybould contradicts Wernick’s public statement that the matter was not discussed at cabinet, reminding him she warned the entire cabinet when the change was being contemplated that any decision to use a deferred prosecution agreement would be exceptional, and would need to be left up to the prosecutor in trial cases, including SNC-Lavalin’s. “I made it very clear at the cabinet table and other places that these tools are at the discretion of the prosecutor — and everybody agreed to that and there was no guarantee that there would be a DPA in this or any other case. So we are treading on dangerous ground here,” she said. “I cannot act in a partisan way and I cannot be politically motivated. All of this screams of that.” But Wernick maintains through the call that Trudeau is not pressing Wilson-Raybould to do anything outside legal bounds. “His view is that (he) is not asking you to do anything inappropriate or interfere. He is asking you to use all the tools that you lawfully have at your disposal,” Wernick tells her at one point. “The Prime Minister was not briefed by the Clerk on his conversation with Jody Wilson-Raybould, and we were unaware of the full contents of this recording before today,” the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement late Friday. “As the Prime Minister said in his statement, he should have spoken directly with the former Justice Minister & Attorney General about this matter — and he wishes that she had come to him. As has been made clear through the various testimonies, and as the Prime Minister said, there was clearly an erosion of trust over the past few months between PMO, the Clerk of the Privy Council, and the former Justice Minister & Attorney General.” The statement continues, “All the facts are on the table now, and everyone involved has shared their perspective, including the Prime Minister. We are focused on moving forward as a team on the issues that matter to Canadians and governing in the best interests of the country.” The transcript and audio of the call were part of a package that included texts and emails that revealed other new information about Wilson-Raybould’s decision on Feb. 11 to resign from cabinet, three weeks after she was shuffled into veterans affairs. Wilson-Raybould denies testimony by Trudeau’s top aide Gerald Butts that she called minister of justice and attorney-general her “dream job.” She says he was the one who described it that way. Notified that she was being shuffled out of the justice portfolio, Wilson-Raybould says she told Trudeau and Butts “numerous times” she believed she was being moved “because of a decision I would not take in the SNC-Lavalin DPA matter, which they denied.”

She took Trudeau at his word but made a decision then that she would “immediately resign” if David Lametti, who replaced her as attorney general, decided to issue a directive in the SNC-Lavalin matter “as this would confirm my suspicions as to the reason for the shuffle of me in particular,” she said. A spokesman for Lametti told the Star Friday that he has not issued a directive in the SNC-Lavalin prosecution since his appointment. Wilson-Raybould said it was her meetings with Trudeau in Vancouver on the weekend after the story first broke that “led to my resignation from cabinet.” She says Trudeau publicly held up her presence in cabinet as evidence of her confidence in his government and its handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair. “I resigned the next day and I trust my resignation also speaks for itself,” she wrote in her brief. But she pointedly does not go into detail about any aspects of their private discussions over three face-to-face meetings the prime minister had with her on Feb. 10-11 that led to her quitting. Wernick’s lawyer Frank Addario told the Star the taped conversation was a “covert ops” move, with her hanging onto it for a “convenient moment.” He dismissed Wilson-Raybould’s claims about Wernick, saying he was “asking for information that only she could give.” “The clerk said this is a legitimate tool and why are we not exploring it here and he asked repeatedly for an explanation to pass on to the prime minister and she refused to give it,” Addario said. “She didn’t shut the call down. She described her wrong understanding of the law, which is that she can’t even call the (director of public prosecutions) to ask questions without putting it into the Canada Gazette. That’s not what the statute says, so he was right in thinking they were talking past each other.” Wilson-Raybould acknowledged that taping the call with Wernick without informing him was an “extraordinary and otherwise inappropriate” move but says she wanted an “exact record” of the discussion because she suspected it was likely to be an “inappropriate conversation.” During the call — which Wilson-Raybould previously described as the culmination of the pressure campaign — Wernick tells Wilson-Raybould she is part of a team, and the prime minister still believes she can use “tools” at her disposal, including asking former Supreme Court of Canada chief justice Beverley McLachlin for advice. “You are not just the attorney general, you are the minister of justice in a cabinet,” Wernick says to her. “I think the way (Trudeau) sees it and the advice he is getting is that you still have things you can do that are not interference and are still very much lawful.” Wilson-Raybould replies, “It is not they are not lawful … the perception and what will happen is that it will be deemed political interference from day one when people were talking about why we are entering into a DPA or putting in a DPA regime in place … Everybody knows that it was because of SNC. Whether that is true or not, that is what people will think.” The texts and emails that Wilson-Raybould gave to the justice committee confirmed much of the testimony she earlier offered about the SNC-Lavalin affair. Her letter stresses that she took to heart departmental legal advice that it would be unprecedented for an attorney general to direct the prosecution of a specific case absent new facts and evidence. Wilson-Raybould said none were offered in the SNC-Lavalin matter. She flatly dismissed the prime minister’s explanation since the controversy broke that Wilson-Raybould “experienced” events leading to her resignation differently or that it was the result of an “erosion of trust.” “The real issues engaged by this matter — the issues that will inform what type of Canada we want to live in and pass on to the next generations — are not, ultimately, about how things are ‘experienced,’ caucus dynamics, political ambitions, poll numbers, ‘erosion of trust’ or the role of social media,” she wrote in her 44-page brief.

By the end of the Dec. 19 phone call, Wernick is clearly concerned about having to go back to Trudeau without having made progress on the issue, telling Wilson-Raybould she was at “loggerheads” with the prime minister who is “pretty firm,” and that he’s worried about a “collision.” It also speaks to Wilson-Raybould’s anxiety at the time about the possible consequences for not budging. “I am waiting for … the other shoe to drop, so I am not under any illusion how the prime minister has and gets things that he wants. I am just struck doing the best job that I can,” Wilson-Raybould said. Later, she texted her chief of staff: “Ok the shite is going to hit the fan.” “Uh oh,” replies Jessica Prince. In her accompanying brief, Wilson-Raybould underscored that “prosecutorial independence” remains the core issue — “a principle that at times appears to have been obscured by layers of commentary, hyperbole and spin. “Any attempts to normalize such efforts is very dangerous to the institutions of our democracy,” she said. It wasn’t immediately clear what the committee will do with the new information. Liberal MPs on the committee had already voted to shut down further hearings into the controversy, including an opposition effort to have Wilson-Raybould testify for a second time. Liberal MP Randy Boissonault said the package confirms what “we already know,” that no law was broken. Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre told the Star the recording “proves Jody Wilson-Raybould was telling the truth and Justin Trudeau was not. He claimed she never raised any concerns about political interference when she did so at least half a dozen times. He stated blatant falsehoods on that point and many others,” he said. The Conservatives have already asked the RCMP to investigate, as did five former Conservative and Progressive Conservative attorneys-general. The RCMP has not yet opened a formal investigation, but says it is aware of the matter and monitoring events. NDP MP Tracey Ramsay, who is a vice-chair of the justice committee, said the revelations in the audio recording underscore her party’s demand for a public inquiry in light of the Liberals’ refusal to allow committee hearings to proceed. She said the audio of the telephone call presents “clear and compelling and well-documented evidence” of efforts to politically interfere in the criminal prosecution and her determination to rebuff it. “There is no one who would listen to that call and believe she wasn’t pressured,” Ramsay told the Star. “Trudeau has acknowledged that he asked Wilson-Raybould to “revisit” the SNC-Lavalin prosecution decision but has insisted that no ethical or legal lines were crossed. “This is something that I was clear on, and then I asked her — even though I heard that she had made a decision, she indicated to me that she had made a decision — I asked her if she could revisit that decision, if she was open to considering to looking at it once again, and she said that she would,” Trudeau told a news conference earlier this month. Wernick has acknowledged that Wilson-Raybould was approached about the file but maintains that there was no undue influence. In his own committee testimony, he said discussions with the former attorney general were legal and appropriate.

1/ YIELD CURVEBALLS

Which is it - growth or gloom? With 10-year U.S. bond yields below 3-month T-bill rates for the first time in more than a decade, recession fears are swirling. After all, an inverted yield curve, when longer-dated yields drop below shorter maturities, have proved to be fairly reliable predictors of U.S. recessions in the past. As a result some investors are busy putting cash behind bets the Fed is gearing up for rate cuts.

But there are many who scoff - they point to a world economy chugging along at a decent clip, dovish central banks and company earnings that are still growing, albeit more slowly. So while Treasury yields are down 30 basis points this quarter, world stocks are up more than 10 percent. Recession skeptics may also note that U.S. equities are not far off record highs and credit spreads have retraced most of their December losses.

Also, while past recession discussions have focused on inversions of the 2-year/10-year U.S. curve, that hasn’t reacted so far. Fed policymakers too, such as voting member John Williams, say they are not worried about recession this year or the next. Others such as James Bullard seem to be endorsing the “this time is different” argument, hinting that the curve’s predictive power has weakened.

But policymakers around the world have already taken heed. The ECB has hinted at further rate cut delays and at tiering interest rates to help banks; other central banks, from New Zealand to Canada, are hinting at rate cuts ahead.

2/THE END OF THE ROAD?

No. No. No. No. Parliament’s cold response to Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal so far means the manner of Britain’s exit from the European Union - originally scheduled for March 29 - is unknown.

Brussels has let Britain delay its departure while May battled to find a way forward but there is little enthusiasm in parliament or the population even for the stripped-down version of May’s twice-defeated deal. But lawmakers have also given the thumbs-down to a series of other amendments, including revoking Brexit, delaying it further or holding another referendum.

Dismayed investors have been avoiding the pound but the resulting shortage in trading volumes just exacerbates price swings. The question now is whether the most hardline Conservative euroskeptics and Northern Ireland’s DUP, the party propping up May’s government, can ever be convinced to back an exit deal before the new April 12 deadline.

If the withdrawal agreement does somehow scrape through, sterling would likely surge above $1.35. For the time being though, the bleak, if unlikely, alternative scenario - a chaotic no-deal departure - persists.

Options markets aren’t optimistic. The price investors are willing to pay for one-month sterling protection - insurance against sterling falls - is at the highest since the 2016 referendum vote.

3/WORKIN’ FOR A LIVIN’

U.S. factory job growth was its weakest in February since the summer of 2017 but still managed to extend the streak of monthly gains to 19, the longest in nearly a quarter century. If, as expected, Friday’s March payrolls report makes it 20 in a row – economists polled by Reuters predict a 10,000 increase - it would mark the longest uninterrupted run of manufacturing employment expansion in a generation, matching the run from January 1983 through August 1984.

But while comparable in length, the current manufacturing renaissance pales in terms of total jobs created. Back then, U.S. factories added 1.34 million workers, more than three times the 417,000 new jobs since the current streak began in August 2017.

For early clues on the jobs data, cast an eye on Monday’s ISM Manufacturing Index. Its employment component is closely correlated with the Labor Department’s manufacturing payrolls series. ISM’s February reading on factory employment, at 52.3, was the weakest in more than two years. Should it drop below 50, the level separating expansion from contraction in the ISM series, it could signal an end to manufacturing employment’s long run. The last time ISM had a sub-50 print was September 2016. That month, U.S. factories cut 3,000 jobs.

4/DEAL WITH IT

A month has passed since the United States and China missed an initial deadline to agree a trade deal. The first face-to-face meetings between the two sides since that deadline were apparently “constructive” and “productive”; now Chinese Vice Premier Liu He is to travel to Washington for further talks.

In the meantime though, tariffs on Chinese goods worth $250 billion are in play and that is hurting - China as well as its Asian neighbors who are linked to it through complex supply chains. March Purchasing Managers Indexes are expected to show a further deterioration in sentiment across the region and another source of pressure is the worry of a recession in the United States.

The one thing preventing panic is the hope Beijing will provide enough stimulus to offset slowing trade. Central bankers around Asia have started hinting at interest rate cuts, relieved at the end of the Fed’s policy-tightening campaign. But the upcoming activity data might show how soon they need to act.

5/NO THANKSGIVING FOR THIS TURKEY

Last year’s lira crisis tipped Turkey into a painful recession, ended its credit-fueled economic boom and complicated President Tayyip Erdogan’s task of selling his economic success story to voters. They are headed to the ballot box on Sunday for the first time since last year’s currency meltdown.

Polls suggest Erdogan could lose Ankara, the city from which he has ruled Turkey with an increasingly iron grip since 2003. His AK Party could face a tough race in Istanbul, where Erdogan was once mayor. But policymakers’ efforts shore up the currency before the election have run into trouble and moves to curb offshore lira supply has pushed investors into selling Turkish stocks and bonds.

The question now is how quickly policymakers will normalize their approach to markets. And even if they do, will pressure on the lira ease up and can they win back the trust of investors, some of whom will have taken losses from the recent episode? For an economy that’s already reeling how much damage have these unorthodox measures inflicted? And finally, will the stress percolate to European banks active in Turkey? BBVA, Unicredit, ING, HSBC and BNP Paribas all have varying degrees of exposure.

by Jill Lawless, The Associated Press

LONDON – Britain has just a few weeks to break its Brexit impasse, with the fate of the country’s departure from the European Union and that of Prime Minister Theresa May both hanging in the balance.

Here’s a look at what might happen next:

___

DEAL OR NO DEAL

With British politicians deadlocked, EU leaders last week granted Britain a two-stage “flextension” to Brexit, which had been due to take place on March 29. Under the new plan, if U.K. lawmakers approve the divorce deal agreed upon between Britain and the bloc, the country will leave the EU on May 22.

If they defeat it, Britain has until April 12 to tell the EU what it plans to do next: leave without a deal, risking economic chaos, or seek a long delay to Brexit and chart a course toward a softer exit or even remaining in the bloc.

___

PARLIAMENTARY BATTLE

The battle now shifts back to the British Parliament, which is split down the middle between supporters and opponents of Brexit.

Both sides voted in large numbers, twice, to reject May’s Brexit deal. But May wants to try again. She hopes to persuade reluctant pro-Brexit lawmakers that backing her deal is their only hope of leaving soon and in an orderly fashion, and to convince pro-EU legislators that they must choose between her deal or a chaotic no-deal Brexit.

But May conceded Monday that “as things stand, there is still not sufficient support” for a new vote on the deal, though she hoped to change that before the end of the week.

___

OTHER OPTIONS

There is little evidence yet that lawmakers’ opinion has shifted strongly in favour of May’s deal.

Anti-EU supporters of “hard Brexit” still believe that rejecting it can lead to a no-deal departure from the bloc as soon as April 12.

A larger group in Parliament, from a range of parties, favours a compromise Brexit in which the U.K. keeps close economic ties with the bloc.

These pro-EU lawmakers had a victory late Monday when the House of Commons agreed 329-302 to take temporary control of the parliamentary agenda, usually the government’s prerogative, to schedule a series of votes on alternative Brexit options. The goal of the “indicative votes” is to see if there is majority support for any of the alternatives.

Proposals could include seeking closer ties with the bloc than May’s deal envisages, or putting the Brexit deal to a public vote.

___

THE END OF MAY?

British politicians are divided over Brexit, but they agree that the process is in a mess _ and many blame May, who has refused to consider alternatives to her deal and failed to win changes to the agreement from the EU.

Many Conservatives are now calling for May to step down. Some pro-Brexit Tories who have so far opposed her deal say they would support it if she promised to hand over the next stage of negotiations – when Britain and the EU will hammer out their future relations – to a new leader.

For now, May is standing firm. Under Conservative rules, May cannot face a formal leadership challenge from within her own party until December because she survived one three months ago.

___

BYE-BYE BREXIT?

Opposition politicians think the only way forward is an early election that could rearrange Parliament and break the political deadlock. May has ruled that out, but could come to see it as her only option.

And anti-Brexit campaigners haven’t abandoned the idea of a new Brexit referendum on remaining in the EU. There’s currently no majority for that in Parliament, but pro-referendum campaigners feel opinion is shifting in their favour. Hundreds of thousands of people marched through London on Saturday to demand a new Brexit vote.

The “nuclear option” of simply cancelling Brexit is also gaining support. An online petition urging the government to revoke the decision to leave the EU has amassed more than 5 million signatures.","What Next?

MACKAY: I didn't get a computer for like, three or four years after. And I think it took like half a year to get a phone. That was 1997.

WELLS: But Ayesha Nasir, the producer of The Message, will post some of your work on our site and a link to your website which I was going through. There's a ton of material on there for readers. Archives and —

MACKAY: I'm very proud of my website.

WELLS: It's a great website. I wish I had something that showed some of my past work you know, so yeah, that's terrific. But to start, today's cartoon — by the way you create five editorial cartoons per week at The Spec, is that right?

MACKAY: Right.

WELLS: And your work is nationally syndicated so it appears online and in newspapers throughout Canada and sometimes in the US. The cartoon today, just to take a random one because it's in the paper today, it features Doug Ford.

Editorial cartoon for Wednesday, March 6, 2019. | Graeme MacKay, The Hamilton Spectator

We have Ford. In the background of the cartoon, there's a big carnival happening. Fireworks in the sky and a carnival tent is labelled SNC-LAV-SCAM. Big party happening in the background and in the foreground we have Doug Ford looking very much like a mob boss standing over someone bearing something in the dirt led by car headlights — which symbolize what?

MACKAY: Well there's, obviously, some interference happening on both the provincial and federal level. It's an edgy cartoon and I could have gotten into trouble with that. I had to like go to my editor Howard Elliot, just to make sure that we wouldn't get sued because it's —

WELLS: It's pretty suggestive.

MACKAY: Yeah, it's very suggestive. You're saying what, the premier is killing people off? I guess in a metaphorical way, he did. Or his deputy, one of his deputies, actually fired the deputy commissioner of the OPP.

WELLS: Just this week, right?

MACKAY: Yeah. But, you know, it's just interesting because we've been obsessed by the SNC-Lavalin story for weeks now. And there's other things that are happening. We as cartoonists just have to be careful not to get too obsessed with the media and keep our eye on other, you know, nasty things that might be happening and I think what's happening in Ontario right now is ... it's fodder for cartoons for sure.

WELLS: I've heard and seen some criticism of the coverage of LAV-SCAM, that the media is all in and everyone is now trying to outdo the other, that is, not to say it's not a huge story, which it is. But it's a good opportunity, for you to kind of shine the light somewhere else like you're doing here.

MACKAY: Well, you gotta wonder like, are people really focused in on the LAV-SCAM thing and are they more focused on what's happening with Ford? I mean, I don't know. Until polls come out, we don't know. Maybe for the vast majority of people outside the bubbles that really follow these political things nobody really cares. But I guess time will tell.

WELLS: Would you anticipate when you draw Doug Ford in this sort of manner, do you ever sort of expect to get a an email or call from someone who's a fan and not a fan of yours? Perhaps who is angry about the depiction.

MACKAY: I expect with my job that I'm not gonna have 100% happiness. I think with a good cartoon you're going to get as many people oppose as people who like it. So yeah, on various social media platforms, I get an earful from people who are totally upset with my cartoon. We get the odd letters to the Editor, a lot of them I don't even see. They just cross Howard's desk and he protects me from seeing some of these angry emails and letters and whatnot. But yeah, I think if you're not getting feedback, you're not doing your job properly as a cartoonist.

WELLS: Do you have thick skin as far as that goes? I mean, your job is to stir the pot. I think if I got a letter taking a shot at my story — I'm probably more thin skinned — I might feel defensive at first. I guess it depends on the nature of —

MACKAY: I think I get more defensive when people obviously don't understand and they show they don't understand satire. They're not seeing the bigger picture that sometimes you need to use Certain metaphors and situations that cast affliction on certain people in order to skewer the person who's the power. I think in some countries like in France and Britain, they get that. But here, it's almost like it's a continuous kind of thing where you got ""Well, no, this is how it works here."" And, ""This is what satire is all about."" But I can understand that even satire has to adapt to the changing norms and everything that happens with society.

WELLS: And satire is not polite.

MACKAY: It's not polite and it's not fair sometimes, either.

WELLS: That's right. One of your favourite cartoonists and friends in the fraternity of cartoonists, I suppose, is Michael deAdder. He apologized recently. He did one of the LAV-SCAM cartoons where he depicted Jody Wilson-Raybould tied up with her mouth taped, in a boxing ring, with Trudeau poised to take her on in the ring. So her hands are tied down her back, her mouth is covered up.

MACKAY: I did actually the almost exact same cartoon too.

WELLS: Did you?

MACKAY: Yeah and we were lumped into this whole sort of thing with hate and misogyny and that sort of thing. I posted my cartoon online and deAdder saw it and then he messaged me and said I'm in the middle of tweeting that same cartoon but just giving you the heads-up that this is going in my paper tomorrow. And he's on the Atlantic Coast so he didn't have much of a timeline.

WELLS: Right, he's in Halifax.

MACKAY: Seven o'clock in the evening. So we go ahead and then everything hits the fan the next day it was posted.

WELLS: I saw on Twitter, I mean I just saw a bit of it, but he apologized and then he sort of apologized for the apology. But people started giving a hard time for apologizing.

MACKAY: I think the big difference there is that he's a freelancer so he doesn't answer to an editor. My editor is Howard Elliot and he cleared it. He looked at it and he didn't raise any worry it about or anything. There's been subsequent apologies since then and they all come from freelancers who don't have those filters that thank goodness I have here at The Spectator because I've never apologized for a cartoon.

WELLS: You haven't? I was going to ask you about that.

MACKAY: Not here. I have come close but no I haven't.

Editorial Cartoon for Friday, February 15, 2019 | Graeme MacKay, The Hamilton Spectator -

WELLS: With that one, people are missing the whole boxing analogy. Trudeau was famous at least for people following his career for boxing publicly.

MACKAY: Well, the Liberal Party and his supporters have made a big deal. He punched out Patrick Brazeau and it was, you know, ""Look what he did here!"" and all of you can look at that like well yeah, he was an Indigenous guy too that he punched out. But, you know, it was taken as a positive thing and it was an important thing because it was before he became prime minister. And a lot of people will say hell, he's just a weakling who only cares about his hair and his looks and selfies and that sort of thing. So let's go and prove that he's a capable guy. And I've used that in other cartoons. His punching acumen when dealing with Donald Trump and that sort of thing.

WELLS: Right, right. The first time I covered him ever in Hamilton was when he came here. And he did a big thing at the gym downtown where he put on a big workout. He was quite happy to to sweat for the cameras.

MACKAY: I'm kind of amazed that we as cartoonists haven't really capitalized on this whole thing because you could you can see the good in that. But you can also see the ugly side of being a boxer as well, and I think both Mike and I did that job as was expected in a satirist.

WELLS: How often would you say an editor like Howard or Paul Berton editor in chief comes to you with an idea that they would like to see done, or an issue say that they like to see done by you in the paper? And how often is it just you percentagewise?

MACKAY: They never come to me. I can tell you they never instruct me or say ""Oh, you gotta like lay off."" Although in the early days they would tell me to lay off way back when I started out. I came on and it was a different approach that I had towards my job. I was scathing towards the mayor who was Bob Morrow and I did some nasty cartoons about him and my boss who actually happened to be Howard. Howard has been my boss for a long time and I remember he told me so you gotta back off on the mayor because he's starting to like badger us. I think that says something. There's something about ... it's easier to go after a politician who's in Ottawa or London or Washington but when it comes to City Hall here these are people that you got to deal with.

WELLS: We have reporters.

MACKAY: And reporters have to deal with them as well. If you keep it up they're going to stop answering the phones when a reporter calls.

WELLS: Right. So then each day, the cartoon ... that is you picking the topic and give your spin on it.

MACKAY: Yeah as I say it's like you or Andrew or Jeff Mahoney. I'm given the liberty of a columnist. However it hasn't always been that way. I mean we've had different editors as you know and they have different definitions on what my role is. I can fight against it but they're the ones paying me.

WELLS: Let's roll back a little bit to your road here. So you grew up in Dundas and attended junior art classes at the Dundas Valley School of Art. I was reading from a piece that the spec ran when you were first hired that's on your website. You were a news geek as a kid and used to doodle in class and draw your teachers and classmates and in grade four through the whole class and ran off photocopies for all of them on demand.

MACKAY: Yeah!

WELLS: Does it make you popular or not popular?

MACKAY: Oh sure, sure. I still had bullies going after me and stuff like that. But if you're a pretty good cartoonist or an artist, you often are like a hit, if you can use that art against the authority of a teacher.

WELLS: What cartoons or comics did you enjoy reading most when you were growing up?

MACKAY: You know, I didn't read a heck of a lot of comic books. I was definitely into MAD Magazine and Cracked. I loved MAD Magazine. And I think that's probably because it was parody. It was like an early form. I didn't know who the president United States was when I'm nine or 10 years old but I knew about being bombarded by all these products on TV. Actually I was thinking also of Wacky Packs. Remember Wacky Packs? They're these candy things and you get gum and then inside would be all these stickers that were parodies of products. Instead of Captain Crunch it was a sticker showing a box with Captain Crud. I think that was the germ of my fascination with just making fun of, you know, on a pop culture thing that extended to politics which came very soon after that I guess.

WELLS: In MAD magazine, as a kid, I would enjoy the parodies of movies. In very highly detail, they would go through the plot of the movie and just ridicule notions of it.

MACKAY: Don Martin and Al Jaffee and Sergio ... wonderful, wonderful cartoonists.

WELLS: In the introduction to your book, which was published in 2017, which is titled ""You might be from Hamilton if ..."", The Spectator's Scott Radley wrote the introduction to the book. He mentioned MAD Magazine and he also said that a lot of kids growing up probably wanted to be a cartoonist and I was going to tell you that I can attest to that. Back in grade five or six I gave my speech, when we all had to give speeches back in the day, you to stand in front of class give a speech. I gave mine on how my career aspiration was to be a cartoonist and I was a huge Peanuts fan. Charles M. Shulz, the whole thing. I had sketch books but I couldn't draw and so set me back a little bit. When did you know that you wanted to draw, and for a living, and be a newspaper editorial cartoonist specifically?

MACKAY: Well I've always drawn. I guess I'm the nerd who instead of going out and playing football or hockey or whatever I stayed in and drew. But I guess, like I said, it was parody I was fascinated with. I was a television junkie too let's be honest. With MAD Magazine, I was also into SCTV and Saturday Night Live — a lot of these great comedy shows that would make fun of the politics of the day. So you know you had Saturday Night Live making fun of the president of the day, which they do so fine even to this day. And so, you know, that made me wonder: what are they talking about here? So, I guess I came of age to find the fascination of politics when Ronald Reagan was president. That was the time when Pierre Trudeau was the prime minister and I know I would always hear the family discussions at the dinner table. On Sunday night, my grandparents would come over and they would freak out over the latest thing that Pierre Trudeau was doing to the country. And so that started an interest in reading the newspapers and by that time I was delivering the Hamilton Spectator and I could open the paper and I'd see the wonderful works of Blaine, the cartoonist here for so long. And so that naturally went to well, what are they drawing in the Toronto Star? What are they drawing in the Globe? And so I just became aware of a lot of the cartoonists at that time period in the early 80s and it's a lifetime fascination starting from there.

WELLS: It's interesting. SCTV was, I loved that it was just so clever energy in not just politics with shows like that on SCTV but the powerful, the famous to be skewered and made fun of whether it was Bob Hope or whoever. I'd love to see that on Netflix. They got to bring SCTV on Netflix.

MACKAY: That would be wonderful, wouldn't it?

WELLS: Political cartoons have been around a long time, if you're Googling anyways. It suggests that the first one ever might have been in 1754 by Ben Franklin. And just to give the audience the visual: it's a snake that's been cut into several sections to show disunity among the new colonies that were not yet the United States. And the caption is, join or die. And we were just talking before the show briefly, but how you actually did a cartoon years ago, that was a take on Franklin's cartoon.

MACKAY: Yeah, it was to apply to the amalgamation of Hamilton. So you know, they were amalgamating all the colonies back at that time, and the threats were out there. Well, that was sort of the same thing that was happening back in around 1999 and 2000, when the province, was compelling us to amalgamate. I did that cartoon and I showed it to the editor and he didn't know what I was talking about so much I guess. Typical journalist doesn't know the history of satire.

WELLS: Back to the drawing board.

MACKAY: Exactly.

WELLS: I think that one and your work and the best editorial cartoons show how carefully chosen words of a little bit of information convey so much. Just randomly going through your website ... maybe because this one appeared on my birthday ... but the one that is lamenting the end of summer. It says ""RIP summer"" and it has you know these ...

MACKAY: They're Grim Reapers.

WELLS: Grim Reapers carrying this pumpkin man who's heralding the pumpkin spice is back. I just think it's awesome. Pumpkin spice of course is a great flair but it does signal that something is coming to an end.

MACKAY: I'm just around so many people that say Oh, have you had this beer? It's pumpkin spice. It's like no I don't want pumpkin spice. All the coffee shops were bringing their coffee so that's a perfect cultural thing that gets away from the politics. Like I said, I know that there are people who are who are shutting out the politics and they're sick of it and everything and so it's important for us to do some of the cultural references and sort of jab at it, which means we have to put up with every year like pumpkin spice and whatever.

WELLS: I love that stuff. Of course at Christmas time all the different flavours. I'm just like what is that? You know all the different flavours. I don't even know what they are.

MACKAY: The other thing on coffee that drives me crazy is the Roll Up The Rim thing. It's like a sport for me every year to come up with another, you know, let's mock the Roll Up The Rim campaign because it's just ... I walk to work and I see the results of Roll Up The Rim. All these dirty cups all over the place.

WELLS: I've never done it.

MACKAY: Have you not?

WELLS: I prefer my lattes and stuff from elsewhere. Whatever that makes me I don't know. But you know, you gotta hand it to them. They certainly tapped into something.

MACKAY: I do. But it's, you know, take some responsibility because these cups are all over the place. And I know there's been an outcry and it's been getting louder every year. You know, this is the disposable ... like this is the crap that you're adding to the landscape through this. It's just horrible.

WELLS: Is one of your challenges determining how much information to provide in a cartoon? Some of your work, some of your cartoons, have layers and layers of background information, little bits and minutiae within the cartoon. And others have a very simple — what appears to be simple — message although, as I say, with the one about pumpkin spice, simple yet there's a lot to it. That's kind of under the surface. Is that something you think about consciously, or you just kind of go with it?

MACKAY: It depends on how I feel. I guess it's kind of nice to be able to put those little Easter eggs in and just give a little extra fun for the viewer. I mean, I'm a big fan of the intricate cartoons. I know there's a wonderful thing about simplicity of cartoons, but I think from time to time was nice to do these elaborate things.

WELLS: Where people can kind of dig into it and get what they can out of it. Of course, then some people aren't getting half of what you're trying to convey sometimes.

MACKAY: Also if the gag is kind of weak then it's you know, I spice it up. I pumpkin spice it up with more details.

WELLS: I said you were an award-winning cartoonist and you're a two-time recipient of a United Nation citation. The Ranan Lurie Political Cartoon.

MACKAY: Ranan Lurie. He's a famous cartoonist from — I don't know where he's from — Egypt, I think. And he's obviously very rich. He throws his money around and rewards people.

WELLS: Which is fabulous. And then last year you were nominated for a City of Hamilton Arts Award.

MACKAY: Yeah, I was nominated. I didn't win.

WELLS: So what you do is absolutely art. And it's punditry and commentary. Do you see yourself more as an artist or commentator?

MACKAY: I would love to do more art. And a lot of us cartoonists do. I would like to do more art, I'd like to do oil paintings. I look at our colleague here, Lee Munn who does some outstanding artwork. Landscapes and things like that. Boy, that would be a dream of mine to go back to the basics of what I learned at the DVSA and take a sketch book out there and draw stuff. Because that's what I did. I used to do that. I used to go out to museums and draw vases and statue heads and things like that. It's a wonderful, therapeutic thing to do.

WELLS: Just to quickly go back to the politics. I meant to ask you earlier: I'm sure there are followers of your work, or people who dip in on your work on occasion, who think they can pinpoint ... There are people who think they can pinpoint The Spectator's political leanings. Even if we had one, which I don't think that the paper does. I don't think it has a particular leaning but I'm sure there's some who think they can label you along the spectrum. And they'd probably be wrong no matter what they say.

MACKAY: Yeah. Good luck. Cause I don't even know where I am. That's right. One thing that drives me crazy is partisanship. It drives me nuts because I will put something on Twitter and I can easily predict who's going to be weighing and then saying such and such. But you know, there's your example right there. You've got a Doug Ford cartoon there and I'm making fun of a guy. He happens to be a Progressive Conservative. But the day before, I'm making fun of Justin Trudeau, he happens to be a federal Liberal. And then I'm making fun of Trump and I'm making fun of all kinds of political parties. Again, it isn't about partisanship to be a cartoonist. Put that all away. It's all about jabbing the powers. It just so happens, we are in a really good situation now. We had a Conservative in Queen's Park in a Liberal in Ottawa.

WELLS: It's kind of an ideal situation for you.

MACKAY: Yeah, it is. But I think in the past, I might have come here with a bit of a partisan leaning towards the centre right. But I can't ... I'm not there at all. I think over time and being around smart people like we have The Spectator, you know, you've learned something. And I certainly have being here.

WELLS: I've talked about how this is such a rich time for cartoonists, in Canada with Justin Trudeau's reign and the dawn of the age of Trump. Looking back to other periods in your career to this point, is this the most interesting time or have they all been interesting?

MACKAY: We were having some great scandal times right now. But in 22 years you can think back, I mean, there's the gas plant scandal, the Gomery scandal, money in bags that Mulroney was passing to Karlheinz Schreiber. Look at the scandal happening in Washington right now. So I think what happens is you get a series of scandals adding up and that's what lends itself to the eventual defeat of a government. I don't know if this SNC-Lavalin thing is going to topple the government. I doubt it will. I think in a life of government there's a series. I mean we had a Liberal government in Ontario that was very plagued with scandals and it lasted for how many terms. And now we got a new government that's starting up its own scandals so scandals are just part of life, right?

WELLS: It's the fuel for the fire for a cartoonist. Graeme, I'm fascinated by the work you do. As I've already pointed out I envious because you're doing what I wanted to do when I was a kid. It's great what you bring to the Spectator adding colour and perspective and wit to our pages and you're one of the best in the business. And that's in Canada and the US. So I want to say thanks for coming on the show.

MACKAY: Well, thanks. It's a pleasure. Thanks, Jon and Ayesha.

WELLS: Thanks to the audience. And again, you can see Graeme MacKay's archives and other information on the link that we'll put on our podcast webpage. And my thanks to Ayesha Nasir, as always, and we'll talk to you later on The Message.

By Shannon Jones

30 March 2019

Autoworkers are reacting with shock and anger to the announcement Thursday afternoon by Fiat Chrysler that it will lay off the third shift at its Windsor Assembly Plant in Canada. The cuts, to take place September 30, will eliminate about 1,500 jobs. The layoffs are permanent.

The Windsor plant, which builds the Chrysler Pacifica minivan and Dodge caravan, has operated on a three-shift schedule since 1993. The plant is the largest employer in Windsor, which has been devastated by the shutting down of auto production in the city, once called the automotive capital of Canada.

There are about 6,000 workers currently employed at the Windsor plant, which underwent retooling in 2015 to build the Pacifica. The plant can build up to 1,500 vehicles per day.

The job cuts are the latest shock in a wave of global downsizing in the auto industry. This week Ford announced the closure of its three factories in Russia, eliminating some 3,700 jobs. That follows its announcement of 5,000 Ford job cuts in Germany and the announcement by Goodyear-Dunlop of 1,100 job cuts in Germany.

The General Motors Oshawa, Ontario plant is set to close later this year as part of plans by GM to close five North American facilities and axe 15,000 jobs. FCA announced in February that it would lay off 1,300 workers at its Belvidere, Illinois assembly plant this spring.

On April 1, Ford will lay off 1,000 workers at its Flat Rock Assembly Plant south of Detroit.

Unifor officials claim to have been blindsided by the Chrysler layoff announcement. In a press conference Thursday, Windsor Unifor Local 444 President Dave Cassidy downplayed the layoffs, calling the cuts “strictly a business decision based on the Pacifica.” He rejected any comparison to the impending shutdown of the Oshawa GM plant.

Meanwhile, right-wing Ontario Progressive Conservative Premier Doug Ford issued a demagogic statement claiming his administration “stood behind” Fiat Chrysler workers. He went on to boast that his administration was dedicated to boosting corporate profits. “Our government is lowering taxes, lowering electricity rates and slashing red tape. There has never been a better time for auto manufacturers to invest in the province of Ontario,” Ford declared.

The New Democratic Party also issued similar hollow statements of solidarity with Windsor autoworkers, while Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau’s Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development, Navdeep Bains, expressed his “disappointment” with FCA management.

Unifor is above all concerned with blocking an independent mobilization by workers against the devastating job cuts. Unifor officials moved in quickly to suppress a sitdown protest by Oshawa workers over the impending closure in January.

In place of a united struggle across national borders to defend jobs, Unifor has promoted a filthy anti-Mexican boycott aimed at pitting US and Canadian workers against their brothers to the south, who staged a historic walkout against maquiladora plants in Matamoros, Mexico earlier this year.

On March 19, Unifor President Jerry Dias suspended the union’s publicity campaign against the closure of the Oshawa plant after GM agreed to continue talks on the Oshawa shutdown. After initial bluster, Dias has now predictably accepted the closure of the Oshawa plant, seeking at most the maintenance of a skeleton crew along with more early retirement buyouts.

A worker at Windsor Assembly, who wished to remain anonymous due to concerns over possible retaliation, spoke to the WSWS Autoworker Newsletter about the layoff announcement.

“They [Unifor] knew about it. They had to know. The writing was on the wall. Orders are very low. We have a two-week layoff coming up starting next week.

“There has been too much going on in the plant. I find it ironic that talks with FCA in the US are coming up. I can see them being asked to take cuts. Unifor may try to save the third shift off our backs.”

The worker said that some 2,500 workers at the plant would not be eligible for supplemental unemployment benefits (SUB) that replace a portion of lost wages in the event of layoff.

“If they didn’t work us to death with overtime, we would be ok. We were working overtime until last summer, then it abruptly stopped.”

There are hundreds of temporary part time workers (TPTs) at Windsor Assembly. They earn about $15 an hour less than senior workers and have no recall rights and are not eligible for SUB. Under terms of the FCA-Unifor contract, TPT workers are only supposed to work Friday, Saturday and Monday. However, Unifor has permitted management to use TPT workers six days a week.

The Windsor plant has already been temporarily shutdown twice this year to “align production with demand.” The FCA Brampton plant also faces a temporary shutdown.

Asked about Premier Ford’s claim to oppose the layoffs, the Windsor Assembly worker replied, “PC, NDP, Liberal, they are all the same.”

Sales of the Pacifica, which retails for around $60,000, have been lagging as consumers opt for less pricey vehicles. A February report showed that sales of the Pacifica were down 60 percent.

Fiat Chrysler reported $4.1 billion in profits in 2018, up 3 percent, due to record global sales of its Jeep and Ram vehicles. Sales were up more than 15 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018.

In moving forward with the plant closures, Fiat Chrysler is answering the call of wealthy investors, who are demanding a greater rate of profit be extracted off the sweat and toil of workers.

Unifor will use the threat of impending layoffs to attempt to browbeat Chrysler workers into accepting further concessions. Just as it is trying to separate the fight of Oshawa and Windsor autoworkers, Unifor is seeking to stoke up anger against workers in the US and Mexico in order to divide and weaken the fight of autoworkers.

The experience of the past 40 years has demonstrated that the program of concessions endlessly promoted by the unions has never saved a single job. No credence either can be given to the professions of support by the big business politicians.

Only the independent political and industrial mobilization of the working class can defend jobs. Workers must advance a program based on the defense of workers’ needs, not the profit interests of the corporations, including the abolition of tiers, the hiring of all TPT workers as full time and the recall of laid off workers.

The Steering Committee of the Coalition of Rank-and-File Committees and the WSWS Autoworker Newsletter organized a February 9 demonstration at GM headquarters in Detroit against plant shutdowns. It called for the building of rank-and-file factory committees independent of the UAW and Unifor and the unity of US, Canadian and Mexican workers in a common struggle to defend jobs.

We urge Windsor Assembly workers to contact the WSWS Autoworker Newsletter to discuss the waging of such a fight.

CTV Edmonton





New Democratic Party leader Rachel Notley hit the campaign trail on Friday. But while she wanted to discuss policy, Notley was forced to field questions about sexual misconduct within her own caucus.

Notley was campaigning in Sherwood Park when the subject of the harassment was raised.

In November, it was revealed that two party MLAs had been accused of sexual misconduct since 2015. The nature of the incidents is unclear, but a party spokeswoman said the alleged behavior took place outside of the workplace.

“We engaged in an appropriate response,” said Notley. “We hired independent investigators, who properly investigated these claims, made recommendations, and we followed those recommendations.”

Notley strongly denies there were any more incidents than the two that were reviewed by separate firms in Edmonton and Toronto.

“There's two that we're aware of and all the stuff was percolating on social media, there's absolutely no evidence of what was being discussed there,” said Notley.

The resurfacing of misconduct within the NDP caucus has UCP House Leader Jason Nixon calling on the premier to be more transparent.

“I think it's incumbent on the premier to be honest with Albertans about what has taken place with her caucus and her candidates,” said Nixon.

The party says the identities of the accused MLA's are not being released to protect the identity of the complainants.

Notley says the two accusers were both satisfied with the third-party review and its outcome; however, CTV News has not been able to independently verify that statement.

Late last year Robyn Luff left the NDP caucus due to what she says was a culture of bullying.

""It's certainly a new phenomenon and it seems to ...","Not long ago, if a U.S. presidential hopeful from either party was mounting a serious bid for the Oval Office, the candidate would seek a spot on the main stage at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) policy conference, the largest U.S. gathering of the pro-Israel lobby.

This year, it seems, not so much.

While the 2019 speakers list was stacked with officials from President Donald Trump's administration and Republican Party grandees, most major Democratic presidential candidates for 2020 were missing from the conference altogether.

The three-day event, which ended Tuesday, included speeches from Vice-President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and House minority leader Kevin McCarthy.

So I am troubled that leading Democrats seem to have some difficulty plainly calling out anti-semitism within their own ranks. And I am troubled that many of the declared Democrat presidential candidates seem to be avoiding <a href=""https://twitter.com/AIPAC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@AIPAC</a> this year. —@senatemajldr

Nine of the biggest names in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination skipped the conference this year, and not one Democratic candidate was on the speakers list.

Jewish Americans have long aligned themselves with liberal causes. About 75 per cent of Jews voted Democratic in the 2018 midterms. But some delegates at this year's conference noted with dismay recent comments by freshman Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar that they felt trafficked in stereotypes about Jewish political influence and money.

Recent polling suggests there is more willingness among younger progressive voters to criticize Israel.

Some AIPAC attendees who spoke with CBC News wondered whether the party has shifted too far to the left. Here's what some of them said.

Michael Goldberg, 49, Democrat from New York:

""It used to be that Democrats and Republicans had to fight to get a spot on the stage,"" Goldberg said.

Noting the lack of 2020 candidates on the speakers' list, he asked, ""Who's here that's running for the presidency for the Democrats?""

The attorney and father of three admitted that he feels ""a bit politically lost.""

He supported Barack Obama during his two terms in office. He and his wife have been ""lifelong Democrats,"" and are still registered with the party. But they voted for Trump in 2016 and may do so again in 2020, unless a Democrat they consider ""more centrist"" decides to run.

The ‘Jexodus’ movement encourages Jewish people to leave the Democrat Party. Total disrespect! Republicans are waiting with open arms. Remember Jerusalem (U.S. Embassy) and the horrible Iran Nuclear Deal! <a href=""https://twitter.com/OANN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@OANN</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/foxandfriends?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@foxandfriends</a> —@realDonaldTrump

Asked about talk of an ""Exodus"" or ""Jexodus"" — a movement begun by conservatives to woo Jewish-Americans away from the Democrats to the Republicans — Goldberg gave a knowing nod.

""It's me and my wife. That's what happened,"" he said. ""The Democrats were friends of the Jewish people. They were friends of Israel. But it's a different party now.""

Vicki Fishman, 47, Independent from Washington, D.C.:

Vicki Fishman is an Independent who lives in Washington. (Matt Kwong/CBC)

""The American Jewish community stands for social justice, and the Democratic Party has positioned itself as being the party of social justice,"" Fishman said.

She's aware the eventual Democratic nominee often addresses AIPAC in an election year, as has been the case in the past three presidential election cycles, and that the upcoming election is still 19 months away.

""This is an off-year,"" she said.

Indeed, AIPAC's policy is to invite presidential candidates to speak only in election years. Even so, Hillary Clinton addressed AIPAC in 2016 as well as the off-year in 2015. Obama spoke there before the 2008 election, as well as in 2011 and again in the lead-up to his re-election in 2012. In 2007, a non-election year, both Clinton and Obama competed for Jewish voters, holding big events at AIPAC.

Rep. Ilhan Omar's tweets have ""complicated"" the public discourse for the Democratic Party, Fishman said. But she considers it to be a distraction.

""We're living in a polarized country right now, and that's just adding to the general polarization, and maybe that's taking up within the party.""

Katie Draisen, 20, Democrat from Boston:

""There are so many conservative politicians here. It's really concerning to me as someone who is pro-Israel, Jewish-American because it feels to me like Jewish-Americans are being used by Republicans to gain voters,"" said Draisen, a self-described liberal Democrat.

""Knowing that Mitch McConnell is here, that makes me want to throw up.""

Draisen, a student at Boston University, supports Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren's bid for the Democratic nomination, though she declined to attend the conference.

Trump's closeness with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has aroused skepticism among her Gen Z progressive friends ""who see Israel and pro-Israel Americans as villains,"" Draisen said.

Netanyahu was listed as a speaker, but skipped AIPAC after a Gaza rocket attack. Netanyahu sent in a video address from Israel on Tuesday. A few months earlier, he reportedly told an aide, ""We don't need AIPAC anymore,"" reasoning he had enough support from American evangelicals and Trump.

Dismayed as she was that major Democratic 2020 hopefuls didn't attend, Draisen also said she saw political risk for them had they showed up at AIPAC. Doing so, she said, would be ""a big turnoff to most liberal Democrats.""

""It's unfortunate because I think most people don't understand the importance of supporting Israel, supporting a two-state solution, and learning.""

Marcia Jacobs, 86, Republican from Los Angeles:

Marcia Jacobs says she likes many of U.S. President Donald Trump's policies. (Matt Kwong/CBC)

Trump wasn't Jacobs's first choice to be president, but she has come to see the commander-in-chief as a staunch ally of Israel. Among the actions that convinced her was the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, as well as its recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel by moving the embassy there.

""He supports it so strongly, and [Democrats] are so anti-Trump that they're letting it affect any other issue,"" she said.

Jacobs was appalled by reports that the liberal non-profit MoveOn.org had urged Democratic candidates not to attend AIPAC.

""That's absolutely horrific,"" she said.

She also praised Trump for his tweet last week reversing more than 50 years of U.S. foreign policy on the Golan Heights by recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the strategically important strip of rocky highlands located where the borders meet between northern Israel, southern Lebanon and Syria.

Manny Srulowitz, 18, Independent from Long Island, N.Y.:

Manny Srulowitz says he's noticed a new wave of Democrats who are critical of Israel. (Matt Kwong/CBC)

Srulowitz, a moderate, said he was receiving emails last week from a pro-Israel organization informing him about the latest Democrats to pull out of AIPAC. He comes from a Republican household that voted for Trump in 2016.

""I wouldn't have enough knowledge to give you a confident answer about why the Democrats are all leaving,"" he said, ""but it's very evident the Democrats are not here.""

The high school senior from Long Island will be 20 years old in 2020, but doesn't see a Democratic candidate yet who would capture his vote.

""I have noticed there is a new wave of young and critical Democrats, usually the younger ones,"" he said of what he sees as declining support for Israel among people of his generation. ""I am not one of them. I am a big fan of the state of Israel.""

Ira and Susan Kapinow, 78 and 76, Independents from Potomac, Md.:

Susan and Ira Kapinow say they can't see themselves voting for Trump in 2020, but they don't like some of the things they see going on in the Democratic Party. (Matt Kwong/CBC)

As ""middle-of-the-roaders"" who try to avoid extremes in their politics, this is a fraught time for Ira and Susan Kapinow, married retirees and strong supporters of Israel.

Susan was troubled by support among at least two Democratic newcomers in Congress for the so-called BDS movement — a campaign calling for a boycott, divestment and sanctions against Israel.

""I find it offensive. Israel is a strong ally and a strong friend,"" Susan said.

The Kapinows can't see themselves happily voting for Trump in 2020. But when they look at the growing divide over Israel within the Democratic Party, they have concerns about how the progressive candidates are breaking with what they viewed as conventional pro-Israel policy.

""It's certainly a new phenomenon and it seems to be generational,"" Ira said. ""The older Democrats were more supportive of Israel, the more traditional way. The younger Democrats are moving more and more to the left on Israel. Way too far left.""

Stewart Eisenberg, 64, Democrat from Philadelphia:

Stewart Eisenberg says he wasn't concerned about the lack of big-name Democratic presidential hopefuls at the conference this year. (Matt Kwong/CBC)

A liberal Democrat who voted for Clinton in 2016, Eisenberg has attended AIPAC's annual policy conference more than 20 times.

""You would like to see some presidential candidates from both sides, but we don't have the presidential candidate from the Republican side, either,"" he said.

He wasn't concerned about the lack of big-name Democratic presidential hopefuls this year, noting that top Democrats in Congress such as Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gave speeches, as well as House majority leader Steny Hoyer.

Eisenberg balked at the idea of a ""Jexodus.""

""I think it's overblown,"" he said. ""You have certain people on the right and certain people on the left that have different views about Israel. Both parties have taken a turn to the radical side on both extremes, but in the general majority of the party on both sides, there has always been bipartisan support for Israel.

Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota are among the White House hopefuls who will attend the Heartland Forum in Storm Lake, Iowa. They’re likely to tout proposals they released this week aimed at helping rural communities.

The attention on agricultural communities and issues is the result of a recognition that Democrats need to do more to win over rural voters, especially in places like Iowa. This state has long been a presidential battleground that swung between Democrats and Republicans. But Iowa has trended more solidly Republican over the past two election cycles, a troubling warning sign for Democrats seeking to oust President Donald Trump. “There needs to be a better connection made between politicians and rural Americans,” said Aaron Heley Lehman, the president of Iowa Farmers’ Union, which is hosting Saturday’s forum and busing in members from neighbouring states to hear the candidate pitches. In the early days of the 2020 Democratic primary, many candidates are focusing on building that connection.

Warren rolled out an extensive agriculture policy this week that would help family farmers by breaking up big agriculture monopolies. Klobuchar announced a $1 trillion infrastructure policy that she spoke about while surveying flooding damage in Iowa this weekend. And former Rep. John Delaney rolled out his own policy aimed at revitalizing rural America, which includes a focus on farming and rural infrastructure. Several contenders, including former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, have campaigned in parts of rural Iowa that haven’t seen much Democratic activity in years. Former Rep. John Delaney is the only Democratic candidate so far to visit all 99 of Iowa’s counties. That’s a key part of what Democrats need to do to win back rural America, according to Iowa state Rep. Mary Gaskill — simply show up. “There are a lot of people who are hesitant to come out as a Democrat, because they all feel neglected, or abused or shunned by their neighbour,” she said. Gaskill is the only Democratic lawmaker in her area, and represents a red county that went for Trump by more than 20 points in 2016 — but one that Barack Obama won by nearly 12 points in 2012. Now, at least two candidates — Sens. Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand — have campaigned there, a development Gaskill welcomes.

“We might see our neighbours there, that we didn’t know they were Democrats,” she said. O’Rourke won’t attend Saturday’s forum. But his first Iowa swing as a presidential candidate included stops in small towns that swung from Democrats to Republicans in 2016.

He didn’t change much of his message — during the swing O’Rourke still talked about the need for gun control, legal marijuana and a compassionate immigration program. But his top strategist in the state, Norm Sterzenbach, said the key was to bring those policies to people that hadn’t heard directly from Democrats before. “Maybe those ideas you like, maybe you don’t, but you’ll never know if we’re not in there communicating,” he said. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand recently visited the same swath of eastern Iowa, pitching herself to voters as a candidate who could defeat Trump because she’s won in red areas of New York. She, too, didn’t shy away from embracing progressive policies like gun control, universal health care and the Green New Deal, and she touted her work on the repeal of Don’t Ask Don’t Tell, the policy prohibiting gays from serving openly in the military, everywhere she went. Neither Gillibrand nor O’Rourke won everyone over. Tom Courtney, the Des Moines County Democratic Party chairman, hosted an event for both candidates and said he wasn’t impressed by their message. “O’Rourke didn’t, and (Gillibrand) didn’t make a good case for rural Iowa either — nobody’s doing that yet. She was talking a lot of issues that liberals always talk about,” he said, like leadership on the global stage, the president’s morals or abortion rights. “Trump got elected by telling people he was gonna fix their lives. I’m not hearing that here.” The rural forum will offer candidates the opportunity to discuss policies that will have a more direct impact on rural voters and farmers — and explain how some of their more sweeping proposals, like the Green New Deal, would help at the local level. Lehman said he believes there’s space in the conversation with farmers to address things like climate change and immigration, but candidates have to start bringing that message directly to them. “We’re encouraged that candidates are spending time and energy to think about what good rural policy is — we hope that the thing we’re doing on Saturday is the beginning of the conversation we’ll have all during the caucus season,” he said.",Democratic presidential hopefuls taking pitch to rural Iowa,Toronto Star,https://www.thestar.com/news/world/us/2019/03/30/democratic-presidential-hopefuls-taking-pitch-to-rural-iowa.html

Yes, the United Conservative Party will appear on ballots for the first time, since it didn't exist the last time Albertans went to the polls in a general election.

But most Albertans are well aware of the UCP — especially after the first week of the campaign, which was dominated by Jason Kenney's party and its main rival, Rachel Notley's New Democratic Party.

In total, there are now 13 political parties registered with Elections Alberta.

The dormant Progressive Conservative and Wildrose parties are still on the list, but won't field any candidates. That's due to the merger of the two parties under the UCP banner in 2017.

New choices include the Alberta Independence Party, added to the list of registered political parties just this week, and the Alberta Advantage Party.

3 ways to get on the list

Drew Westwater, deputy returning officer with Elections Alberta, said after the election was called on Tuesday, the Alberta Independence Party was able to endorse candidates in at least half of the 87 electoral divisions.

According to the Election Finances and Contributions Disclosures Act, there are three ways to qualify a party for registration:

hold at least three seats in the legislative assembly;

endorse candidates in at least half of the electoral divisions in Alberta;

collect 7,868 signatures on a petition to illustrate support. (The number represents 0.3 per cent of electors eligible to vote in the last general election.)

""I know this is a new one for Alberta,"" Westwater said of the Alberta Independence Party.

""It's the first time someone has done that and qualified under this provision of the act.

""Now we have a new party for electors to choose from in the upcoming election.""

Westwater said that by qualifying as a registered political party, the party's candidates can officially appear on the ballot under their party name. Without the party being registered, those candidates would have to list as ""independent.""

New parties try to get attention

Another new party appearing for the first time this election is the four-month-old Alberta Advantage Party.

Leader Marilyn Burns knows she faces a big challenge in getting noticed, but said the consequences of not being on the ballot are bigger.

The leader of the new Alberta Advantage Party, Marilyn Burns, says it's a challenge to get noticed, but important that Albertans have a choice in the election. (Alberta Advantage Party)

Supporters combed Alberta to gather 8,600 signatures on a petition to form the Alberta Advantage Party, said Burns.

The process of canvassing voters directly, said Burns, has given her a good indication of how people are feeling going into the election.

""What we've heard loud and clear, and continue to hear, is a visceral hatred for the NDP that is not going to change no matter what Jason Kenney does,"" she said.

That sentiment is balanced by ""the strong dislike and distrust of Jason Kenney,"" Burns added.

Choice and consequences

The upstart Freedom Conservative Party was created in 2018 by former UCP MLA Derek Fildebrandt.

Fildebrandt anticipates more about 30 FCP candidates will run in the election. He said his biggest challenge is to get people to think of options when they go to the polls.

""The media tend to give the impression you've only got two choices in politics.You've got the red team and you've got the blue team,"" Fildebrandt said in an interview with Radio-Canada.

""You've got Diet Coke and you've got Coke Zero, and there's a lot more to it than that.""

Little room for small parties

Mount Royal University political scientist Duane Bratt said this election is significant because it has put Alberta into the position of a two-party race for perhaps the first time in recent history.

""We've gone into new terrain here,"" Bratt said.

""I think there is room in the centre in this very polarized environment, but not in this election.""

He said it will take at least one election cycle to open up the field again.

MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — The Alabama Democratic Party moved forward with filling a committee vacancy Friday over the objections of national party officials.

The state executive board added a Hispanic at-large member of the larger executive committee, despite a warning from the Democratic National Committee to wait.

The DNC last month ordered the state party to improve diversity outreach efforts and hold new elections for state party chair and vice-chair. DNC officials sent a March 22 letter to Alabama Chairwoman Nancy Worley saying they should not elect at-large minority members until they have an affirmative action plan to recruit Hispanics, Asians, LGBTQ persons and others.

""If the state party chooses to proceed, they will be violation of the DNC's order and the election of the chair and vice-chair could be invalidated,"" the letter stated.

Worley told the Associated Press that she received the DNC letter Thursday and scanned it while preparing for the meeting. She said she responded with an email saying she believed the party had complied with outreach requirements. Worley said they were filling a position that had been open for more than a year.

The Alabama executive board voted 10-5 Friday to proceed with filling one Hispanic at-large seat.

Worley said she believed there might a difference in the interpretation of the February findings of the DNC.

The Montgomery Advertiser reported that Joe Reed, the party's vice-chair for minority affairs, urged the board to proceed.

""They don't have the authority to approve it."" Reed said. ""Our bylaws tell us what we do,"" Reed said

Some members opposed the decision.

Julia Siergiey Juarez, who said she voted against proceeding and livestreamed the meeting on social media, said she was frustrated but not surprised by the action.

""Our party faces an uphill battle at the best of times, so being held back by a lack of vision and demonstrated incompetence in basic functions of a party are hamstringing us before we can even get on the field. Holding on to the remnants of power so jealously that you sink the ship you swear to be protecting is counterintuitive,"" she said.

The state board then approved an affirmative action plan.

The Democratic National Committee announced Thursday that the first debate among the candidates for its 2020 presidential nomination will take place in Miami.

The party used the term “debate,” but it’s actually two events on two successive nights, June 26 and June 27.

There are so many candidates that the debates are being split, with random selection process to decide who appears on what night.

The Democrats already have 16 candidates — including Miramar Mayor Wayne Messam, who announced his candidacy Thursday — and more are sure to join the field.

To qualify for the debates, candidates will have to either meet thresholds of 1 percent in national polling or in early primary states or receive contributions from 65,000 different donors, with at least 200 of them in each of at least 20 states.

When candidates head to a region for a debate, many hold events before and after.

In 2016, Bernie Sanders held his only Florida rally before the state’s presidential primary because he was headed to South Florida for a debate. He was in the region to debate Hillary Clinton at Miami-Dade College’s Kendall campus, so he held a rally for supporters the day before.

The first debates among the 2020 Democratic candidates will be broadcast on NBC and MSNBC and translated into Spanish on the Telemundo network.

“Miami is the perfect place to introduce our extraordinary presidential candidates to the country,” Florida Democratic Party Chairwoman Terrie Rizzo said in a statement. “People are hungry for new leadership in the White House, and after the first debate, they’re going to be fired up and ready to organize for Democrats.”

Tom Perez, the Democratic national chairman, called Miami “a vibrant and dynamic city that reflects the values and diversity of the Democratic Party.”

Inset Randall Garrison, Kaori Toigai

New Democrats give Lemphers the green light More than 100 New Democrats gathered Thursday evening to choose Justin Lemphers to carry the party into this fall’s federal election. By Palak Mangat on March 29, 2019

More than 100 New Democrats gathered Thursday evening to choose Justin Lemphers to carry the party into this fall’s federal election.

Lemphers will challenge Liberal incumbent Larry Bagnell and Conservative Jonas Smith for the role of sole Yukon MP. No one has publicly announced an intention to represent the Green Party.

Running on a motto of “nothing for us without us,” the newly-confirmed candidate was beaming last night, saying the first thing he would do is pay his dues.

“I’m going to thank everyone again because these people put in time and energy into being here and they all deserve recognition,” he told reporters.

Lemphers is the president of the Yukon Federation of Labour, and has been involved in work with the Yukon Employees’ Union over the years.

He listed climate change, environmental protection, electoral reform, income inequality and a host of other issues around inclusion as key issues facing the territory and country.

His challenger, Kaori Torigai, didn’t disagree – even directly referencing governments across Canada in her speech before results of the nomination vote were known.

“Until now, I was only a participant in politics by voting,” Torigai told the crowd gathered at the Whitehorse United Church.

She didn’t mince her words about current leaders. She called out U.S. President Donald Trump and Ontario Premier Doug Ford as selected leaders who “gave a voice to hate, to divisiveness, segregation, cutting social programs.

“There are others in our country and in our own territory that have similar views –­ this is when I started to realize I had to participate.”

She wasn’t alone in that. Lemphers told the Star in January he can see at times the difficulty for racially visible Yukoners to gain access to services, for instance.

As for what qualifies him to run for office, the 43-year-old father of three sons was humble in his response Thursday.

“The people in the room this evening – thanks to them, they made that decision, so here I am,” he smiled.

The issue with perhaps more urgency – or at least one that is brought up most frequently – is climate change and the effects of it, he added.

“There are so many great ideas out there.

“When we look at protecting the environment, it’s about not just recycling but reusing,” he said.

A short-term solution being explored is eliminating the use of single-use materials, Lemphers added.

“If we’re just using something once and it’s going into a landfill and a recycling pile, then we’re still consuming – so talking to people about what it means to be a consumer and how we might be able to hold that back.”

Lemphers will hope to carry the NDP into October’s decision day.

If he wins, he would become the territory’s NDP’s first representative in Ottawa since Louise Hardy (1997-2000).

Hardy was ousted by Bagnell in the 2000 election, which saw him serve until 2011 before Conservative Ryan Leef defeated him. Bagnell was again elected in 2015.

The Tories have already put forth their choice after Smith was acclaimed their candidate last fall. Bagnell officially confirmed his intention in December 2018.

While it may have been months since his two oppoents announced, Lemphers isn’t afraid of being behind the eight ball, with October sitting just six months away.

“I think the NDP has a message and a connection with people, and those that are interested and those that are unfamiliar with it will want to hear that message,” he said.

Though one doesn’t need to go far to see Smith’s ads at bus stops or in papers, the NDP candidate doesn’t feel he’s lagging behind after being tied up in the nomination process for the last two months.

“I think people want to have conversations, and I’m happy to have those conversations,” he said.

“There’s an awesome opportunity to engage with Yukoners, and I’m looking forward to doing that outreach.”

That dialogue will begin immediately as Lemphers turns his attention to pitching to Yukoners why he’s their best bet for their voice in Ottawa for the next term.

On hand at last night’s meeting was Randall Garrison, an NDP MP from B.C. who served as a guest speaker, and doubles as the party’s critic for national defence and LGBTQ2S+ issues.

Lemphers shouted out both his family, including father Florian and partner Brigitte Parker, and a host of other NDP supporters.

Dan Bader, the president of the NDP Electoral District Association for the territory, pointed out this was the only contested nomination in the Yukon – a hopeful sign that the party may be gaining ground here.

“Yukoners are really connecting with the NDP’s message that with love and courage, we can build a better Canada,” Bader said in an ode to the federal social democratic party’s leader, Jagmeet Singh.

“Both candidates ran a great campaign, and we were really pleased to see so many new members out at the meeting,” Bader added.

May told her Conservative lawmakers she would step down if her Brexit deal was finally passed by parliament at the third attempt, in a last-ditch bid to win over many of her party’s eurosceptic rebels.

But some were unmoved and the Northern Irish party crucial to getting the agreement through said it would reject the deal again.

Britain was supposed to leave the bloc on Friday but Brussels agreed last week to put back the divorce date until April 12 to give it a chance to resolve a three-year crisis that has split the country down the middle.

READ MORE: Bye-bye Brexit? Here’s what might happen next as deadline looms

However, it still remains uncertain how, when or even whether the United Kingdom, the world’s fifth-biggest economy, will leave the EU. The possibilities that it will leave with no deal to soften the shock to its economy, or delay the departure date to hold a general election, have increased as other options fade.

While May’s deal continued to stumble, an attempt by parliament to take control of the process by holding a series of indicative votes on other options produced no immediate way through the impasse.

None of the proposals, many of which involved closer alignment with the EU than May envisages, won the support of a majority of lawmakers.

“In a spectacular display of indecision, the House of Commons has voted against remaining in the EU and every version of leaving the EU,” tweeted James Cleverly, the Conservative Party’s deputy chairman.

Nevertheless, some proposals fared better than May’s deal had done two weeks ago, and parliament was due to hold more indicative votes on Monday after refining the options most likely to secure a majority.

Many Conservative eurosceptics had made clear they would only consider supporting May’s deal if she gave a firm commitment to resign, hoping a new leader would be more sympathetic to their views when negotiating the terms of Britain’s future relationship with the EU.

“I have heard very clearly the mood of the parliamentary party,” May told a meeting of Conservative lawmakers (MPs).

“I know there is a desire for a new approach – and new leadership – in the second phase of the Brexit negotiations – and I won’t stand in the way of that.”

But within hours of May’s offer, the Democratic Unionist Party, which props up her minority government, said it would vote against the deal if May brought it back a third time.

“We’re in a situation where we cannot sign up to the Withdrawal Agreement,” DUP leader Arlene Foster said.

The government gave itself the option of bringing May’s deal back to parliament on Friday, although speaker John Bercow repeated his warning that he would not allow a third vote unless the motion had changed substantially since its last defeat.

May, who voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, had already promised to step down before the next election, due in 2022.

Her deal, defeated in parliament by 149 votes on March 12 and by 230 votes on Jan. 15, means Britain would leave the EU single market and customs union as well as EU political bodies.

But it requires some EU rules to apply unless ways can be found in the future to ensure no border posts need to be rebuilt between British-ruled Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.

Many Conservative rebels and the DUP object to this “Irish backstop,” saying it risks binding Britain to the EU for years.

To succeed, May needs at least 75 lawmakers to come over to her side.

After the ERG met, a spokesman said: “There is no way enough votes are coming out of that room to put the (Withdrawal Agreement) through.”

While May was addressing her lawmakers, MPs in the main chamber debated eight other Brexit options, ranging from leaving abruptly with no deal to revoking the divorce altogether.

While there was no majority support for any, the option calling for a referendum on any departure deal, and another suggesting a UK-wide customs union with the EU, won more votes than May’s deal did two weeks ago.

Oliver Letwin, a Conservative former cabinet minister who led parliament’s unusual power grab, said it had been expected that none would immediately win a majority, and lawmakers would have another chance on Monday.

If May’s deal were to pass, her office said there would be a contest to replace her after May 22, when Britain would leave the EU.

She would also become the fourth Conservative prime minister in a row to have fallen foul of divisions over Europe within her centuries-old party, following David Cameron, John Major and Margaret Thatcher.

Most voters think the Brexit negotiation has been handled badly and there may now be a slight majority for staying in the EU, recent polls suggest. Many Conservative MPs say May herself has caused the chaos by not negotiating harder with the EU.

“It was inevitable and I just feel she’s made the right decision. She has actually read the mood of the party, which was a surprise,” said Conservative lawmaker Pauline Latham.

In some ways the contest between Toni Preckwinkle and Lori Lightfoot reflects a movement happening nationally in the Democratic Party as typically younger, fresh faces with less political experience challenge the more established “old guard.” But Tuesday’s election also is uniquely Chicago, occurring when the city’s financial problems, gun violence and allegations of public corruption have left many voters fed up and looking for change.

Preckwinkle served on the Chicago City Council for 19 years and later became president of the Cook County Board. The 72-year-old former teacher also is chairwoman of the Cook County Democratic Party, which wields tremendous political power by, among other things, “slating” or endorsing candidates for offices ranging from governor to county assessor and judges. Lightfoot, 56, is a former federal prosecutor who never has held public office and is now considered the front-runner. She decided to run even before Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the former White House chief of staff, announced he wouldn’t seek a third term, saying she wanted to do something to help low-income and working-class people she believes have been “left behind and ignored” by Chicago’s political ruling class. “I stand as a Democrat,” Lightfoot told voters at recent candidate forum, “but a different kind of Democrat.”

Either candidate would make history as the first black, female mayor in racially divided Chicago and would become the eighth black woman to currently serve as mayor of a major U.S. city. Lightfoot also would be Chicago’s first openly gay mayor. The city has only elected one black mayor, Harold Washington Jr., who was elected in 1983 and died months into his second term. His predecessor, Jane Byrne, is the only woman to serve in the job. Whether it’s Lightfoot or Preckwinkle, the next mayor will step into a climate in which city leaders have taken some hits. Emanuel’s administration was rocked by claims of a coverup after a white Chicago police officer fatally shot black teenager Laquan McDonald in 2014. The city, responding to a judge’s order, released dashcam video of the shooting more than a year after it happened. Then earlier this year, longtime Chicago Alderman Ed Burke was charged with attempted extortion for allegedly trying to shake down a fast-food chain that wanted to build in his ward. He is one of several aldermen facing criminal charges or federal investigation.

“When we keep putting the same politicians in office, nothing changes. ... They get elected, and they forget about us,” said voter Marcia Lewis, who lives on the city’s South Side and says she’s backing Lightfoot. “I’m ready for someone new to come in.” More than a dozen candidates jumped in the race to replace Emanuel, including Bill Daley, the brother and son of previous longtime Chicago mayors.

Lightfoot finished as the top vote-getter, followed by Preckwinkle, in a February election though neither had overwhelming support among blacks, who make up about a third of the population in the segregated city. Lightfoot’s base was predominantly white wards along Lake Michigan on Chicago’s North Side, while Preckwinkle’s support was strongest in predominantly black wards on the West and South sides. Because neither candidate received a majority of votes cast, the two will meet in a runoff election. In another sign voters are looking for change, several aldermen — including some of Emanuel’s closest allies — are also facing runoffs. Preckwinkle is campaigning as an “independent Democrat,” noting that when she first ran for alderman more than three decades ago she lost her first two elections and then barely beat “the machine” to win a seat on the City Council on her third try. She says her 25 years of public service experience make her uniquely qualified to lead the nation’s third-largest city and to tackle its deep financial problems, which include some of the worst-funded pension systems of any major U.S. city. By 2023 Chicago must come up with almost $1 billion in new revenue to make its annual pension payments. As the top leader in Cook County, the second-largest county in the U.S., Preckwinkle closed a nearly $500 million budget gap, expanded access to health care and reduced the population of an overcrowded jail, in part by reducing the number of nonviolent offenders being held because they couldn’t post cash bail. “This is not an entry-level job,” she said. “It’s easy to talk about change. It’s hard to actually do it. And that’s been my experience — being a change-maker, a change agent, transforming institutions and communities.” Preckwinkle picked up an endorsement from Chance the Rapper, whose father is Preckwinkle’s campaign manager. The Grammy-winning music artist from Chicago said Preckwinkle was the most qualified of the two candidates. He noted her work to reduce the jail population and provide health care to more than 350,000 people, saying “actions speak louder than words.” Voter Rhonda McFarland, who lives in the ward Preckwinkle represented on the City Council and is supporting her for mayor, also cited her proven track record. She said the race comes down to “what we will do” versus “We know what (Preckwinkle) has done.” Lightfoot also has faced criticism from some activists who say she has sided too often with police when leading police oversight boards in Chicago. Lightfoot said her showing in the February election helped people see it might be possible to topple the city’s political “machine.” “For those people who hungered for change, for the first time they got a glimpse of what that might look like, and that it was actually attainable,” she said. “That’s why I think this campaign has gained so much momentum over these last few weeks because of that prospect for real, meaningful transformative government.” She said she will bring transparency and accountability to City Hall and restore people’s faith in government. “The machine’s been in decline for a while, but it still has a grip on certain things,” Lightfoot said. “This is our opportunity to send it to its grave, once and for all.” ___ Associated Press video journalist Teresa Crawford contributed to this report. ___ Follow Sara Burnett on Twitter at https://twitter.com@sara_burnett",New face and longtime politician vying for Chicago mayor,Toronto Star,https://www.thestar.com/news/world/us/2019/03/29/new-face-and-longtime-politician-vying-for-chicago-mayor.html

The Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, has described the election of Ahmadu Fintiri as governor of Adamawa State as the dawn of a glorious new era for the state.

Atiku, in a statement yesterday by his media aide, Mr. Paul Ibe, congratulated the Governor-elect for his resounding success at the polls in spite of the various antics of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to frustrate the wishes of the people in the state.

The former Vice President stressed that he was particularly delighted that the PDP came victorious in the governorship election in his home state, and that the decision of the vast majority of Nigerians to vote for the PDP signified that the party is truly a party of the people.

Atiku said, “My home state of Adamawa has chosen the Peoples Democratic Party to lead them. I am truly proud of this and let me assure you that you have chosen a leader with the zeal and determination to put Adamawa on the best path.

“You have chosen a leader who appreciates Adamawa’s diversity and who will run an inclusive government for the betterment of all,” Atiku said.

“Our people have stood with Governor-elect Fintiri in the course of this election with an abiding commitment never to allow the power that be to rob them of their votes.

By Timothy Gardner

WASHINGTON, March 26 (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republicans on Tuesday defeated the ""Green New Deal"" resolution that called for tackling climate change by moving the United States off fossil fuels, while Democrats said the vote was a political stunt on an issue that will not die.

The vote was 57 against the resolution in the 100-member chamber, with 43 Democrats voting ""present,"" avoiding an up-or-down vote. Republicans won over Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema and one independent senator, Angus King, who usually votes with that party.

The Green New Deal, introduced last month by Democrats, marked an initial attempt to define legislation to create government-led investments in clean energy like wind and solar power, infrastructure and social programs.

Democrats have said the plan, which is backed by most of the party's presidential candidates, was designed to spur debate during the 2020 campaign on the intricate problem of how to tackle climate change while boosting the economy, not to force the party to take sides in a quick vote.

But Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell forced a vote before the plan had the chance for a national debate or hearings in Congress.

In a move that likely previews their wider strategy ahead of next year's presidential election, Republicans used the plan to try to sow discord among Democrats, painting their rivals as shifting to socialism and embracing extreme policies.

McConnell wrote on Twitter that Americans would see which senators are against the deal and which ""are so fully committed to radical left-wing ideology that they can't even vote 'no' on self-inflicted economic ruin that would take a sledgehammer to America’s middle class.""

Asked before the vote whether he believes climate change is happening and if humans are contributing to it, McConnell said: “I do. The question is how do you address it."" He said the way to fight climate change was by encouraging private companies to innovate.

The non-binding Green New Deal resolution sought to speed a transition of the U.S. economy away from burning oil, gas and coal and emitting greenhouse gases from cars and industry blamed for climate change. Its name referenced Democratic President Franklin Roosevelt's Depression-era New Deal that used massive government-led investments to lift the economy.

Democratic Senator Edward Markey, who unveiled the plan with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, told reporters that McConnell and other Republicans ""fail to understand ... that the Green New Deal is not just a resolution, it is a revolution.""





TO FIGURE IN 2020 CAMPAIGN

Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein was criticized by Green New Deal supporters after she was filmed last month telling children she opposed the resolution because it was too expensive. But she sided with the majority of Democratic senators in voting ""present,"" to show unity in the party.

Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat running for president in a crowded field, told reporters that most Republican lawmakers were treating climate change like a ""political stunt.""

Gillibrand said most Republican lawmakers were lockstep in support of President Donald Trump's policies of rolling back environmental regulations and withdrawing from the 2015 Paris international climate agreement and ""have refused to put forward any real plan to address climate change in any meaningful way.""

Senator Lamar Alexander, a Republican, has offered a response to climate change that proposes to engage innovation by doubling research funding in 10 technologies including advanced nuclear, batteries and capturing carbon for burial underground, a plan critics say does not act fast enough.

Former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper became the first 2020 Democratic candidate to oppose the plan, writing in the Washington Post that it would give the government too much power in investment decisions. To spur innovations needed to curb climate change, ""government must not shun the private sector,"" Hickenlooper said in the piece.

As scientists say climate change is causing billions of dollars worth of damage by making floods, storms and droughts more intense, debate is expected to amplify ahead of 2020.

Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters the Green New Deal was discussed with Trump at a party lunch on Tuesday. Graham said Trump told Republican senators: ""Make sure you don't kill it too much because I want to run against it.""

In 2008, Nancy Pelosi was House Speaker when Democratic lawmakers denied President George W. Bush’s request for a vote within 90 days on a trade pact with Colombia. The rejection delayed approval of deals the Bush administration negotiated with South Korea and Panama, though all three were later ratified.

Once again Speaker, Pelosi will play a pivotal role for Trump’s renegotiated accord with Mexico and Canada, renamed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which isn’t one of her legislative priorities. It’s a change of pace from the frenetic year of negotiations that led to the deal being signed by leaders from all three countries in November.

“If the House doesn’t want to move on this, it doesn’t have to move. So it’s really up to her,” said Edward Alden, a trade expert at the Council on Foreign Relations.

Left-Tilting Tent

Pelosi is expected to only move the deal through the House if she can find a critical mass of her caucus supporting it and if she extracts concessions unrelated to trade from the White House in return, senior congressional aides say.

Asked to comment, Pelosi’s office referred to remarks she made this month in which the speaker said she and other Democrats are still weighing USMCA’s provisions on the environment, labor, pharmaceuticals and enforcement before deciding whether to support it.

With 60 new Democratic members who still have to familiarize themselves with their districts’ priorities and the content of the trade deal, the biggest challenge is educating lawmakers, the aides said. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is expected to meet with freshman members in the coming weeks to make his case.

Lighthizer has been wooing Democrats to support the updated version of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Sympathetic groups could include the New Democrat Coalition, which includes 100 lawmakers who back pro-growth policies.

He may face a tougher challenge on the party’s left flank. Outspoken rookie lawmakers such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who identifies as a democratic socialist and backs a sweeping spending plan to reduce carbon emissions called the “Green New Deal,” have driven the Democratic agenda since the November election.

“That’s the most amorphous piece of this: When is the caucus happy enough that she feels confident moving this? Hard to say,’’ said the National Foreign Trade Council’s Vanessa Sciarra, referring to Pelosi.

Kevin Brady, the top Republican on House Ways and Means Committee, said on Tuesday there may be a House vote on the pact “this summer” once Democrats’ concerns are addressed.

Labor, Drugs

Some Democrats are calling for changes to sections of USMCA dealing with labor standards and drug patents.

The pact commits Mexico to reform its labor laws to allow workers to engage in collective bargaining. But senior Democrats have said the commitments are lacking teeth without adequate enforcement provisions.

America’s biggest federation of labor unions, the AFL-CIO, has said it won’t support USMCA in its current form, and would oppose it if the business community forced a “premature” vote. “What we hear on the Hill is the same thing we’re saying: It’s not ready to be voted on,” AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said on Bloomberg TV Friday.

Democrats also aren’t enthusiastic about a drug patent provision that would force Mexico and Canada to extend protection for biologic drugs, warning it could raise prices for consumers.

Steel, Aluminum

Mexico and Canada have warned they may not ratify USMCA unless the U.S. lifts tariffs on steel and aluminum. The duties are also unpopular with lawmakers from Trump’s own Republican Party.

Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Senate finance committee, said the agreement wouldn’t be considered as long as the duties remain in place.

The administration is considering replacing the tariffs with quotas, which are equally, if not more, unpopular with many lawmakers as well as Mexico and Canada.

The Trump administration can make tweaks to the agreement to mollify concerns. But major revisions would require reopening talks with Mexico and Canada, a scenario Lighthizer has ruled out.

If we truly wants to practise democracy, we ...","Lanre Isaa-Onilu, APC National Publicity Secretary (middle), addressing journalists in Abuja on Sunday.

The All Progressives Congress (APC) says those who defected from the party in the past one year ""lack values"" and should be consigned to the ""dustbin of history"".

Lance Issa-Onilu, the APC spokesman, stated this when he spoke to newsmen on Abuja on why the party settled for Ahmed Lawan as its choice for Senate President.

According to Issa-Onilu, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had no say in the matter as APC has the necessary numbers in the National Assembly to make the top positions.

He also stated that what happened in the 8th Assembly would not repeat itself, stating that those who left the party committed an ""aberration"".

His words: ""Before you arrive on an individual, we must have considered what zone he comes from. So, the party, in its own judgement, believes that we will not only zone, but go as far as to decide who from that zone is fit and proper as the Senate President.

“You should know that from every zone, we have ranking members in the National Assembly who are eminently qualified to be Senate President. But there is only one vacancy to be filled because we don’t have two Senate presidents. In this case, considering other factors, the party took a decision.

“When I say the party, not just the NWC, because there was wide consultation across the country; the party leaders, governors, the President and so, it is not just Adams Oshiomhole or the NWC. That is the position of the ruling party. So, the idea of taking the thing to the zones is an option which we have also considered before arriving at a particular individual from the North-East, only after we have zoned that position to the North-East.”

Speaking on the comments by Adams Oshiomhole, the APC National Chairman, that the party would not share positions with the PDP, he said: ""It was not a threat. That is democracy. I have listened to PDP react to this and in their usual style, they exhibited crass ignorance. What we practise in Nigeria is the presidential system of government and in a presidential system of government, it is winner takes all. Once you win, you take whatever you want. There is no room for power sharing.

“We don’t need it because we don’t need them to run this government. We have enough members to run this government. In any case, when we were campaigning, we never told Nigerians that we were going to share power with any other party. We told them to entrust power on us fully because in the last four years, we have made good use of power and we will make better use of it in the next four years.

“Nigerians graciously assented to that. It will be a betrayal of that trust to go ahead and start sharing power with a party, particularly the PDP that has been rejected by Nigerians.

“We are smarting from the experience of the last four years, precisely what happened in 2015 when some traitors within the APC fold sold our birthright to an opposition party and some people now considered that as the normal thing. That action was not democratic. It was treachery and we thank God that Nigerians punished the people that were involved.

“They have been rejected with many of them now on compulsory retirement from politics. That is the verdict of the people of this country for compromising basic democratic principles, which say that when you have majority, you have the trust of the people to form a government without conceding anything to the people they have rejected. If they had wanted PDP, they would have voted for them.

“We pattern our presidential system along side that of the United States of America. When last did you see to the floor to elect Senate President. In their own case, the Speaker? Any party that has the majority automatically has the Speaker.

“What we had in the last one year when those traitors defected back to where they belong was an aberration and not democratic. It is an expression of lack of value and a commitment to personal aggrandisement and not a commitment to national interest. We should not think that it has now become the new normal. If we truly wants to practise democracy, we should consign such to the dustbin of history and never allow such to happen.

“The problem we have had with party politics in this country is the fact that no ideology drives any political party. But APC is daring to be different. What that means is that we are progressives and the worldview of progressives includes the ideology that speaks to those values that are very important to the common people.

“That is why most of the policies of this government has been pro-poor policies. All the social investment programmes were patterned along the world view of progressives.”

While urging members to support the party's decisions, he said Senator Ali Ndume, who has also expressed interest in the Senate President position had the fundamental right to do so.

“He is only expressing his fundamental rights. But those rights were taken care on that very day you subscribed to be a member of a particular political party, in this case, the APC. That day, he signed up to abide by the position of the APC. We take what happened in the last 24 hours as how badly the news hit him.

“He is a human being and we are also conscious of the fact that Senator Ali Ndume is a respected member of APC, a leader in this party and he knows the right thing to do and on both sides, the right thing will be done. That also includes other members who have the same issues, but at the end of the day, party supremacy will have to take precedence. The party will also to conscious not to be found wanting and not to be seen to be breaking its own rules.

“What happened in the National Assembly when APC members kept the national budget for seven months is a betrayal of the party on which platform they were elected and also a betrayal of the trust of the people of this country and Nigerians have passed a verdict on them.”","Those Who Defected From Our Party In 2018 Lack Values, Says APC",Sahara Reporters,http://saharareporters.com/2019/03/28/those-who-defected-our-party-2018-lack-values-says-apc

By John Braddock and Tom Peters

29 March 2019

Just six days after the March 15 Christchurch mosque shootings in which a fascist killed 50 people, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern last week announced a ban on military style, semi-automatic guns and assault rifles.

Ardern declared: “On 15 March our history changed forever. Now, our laws will too. We are announcing action today on behalf of all New Zealanders to strengthen our gun laws and make our country a safer place.” Changes to the law in the aftermath of the 1990 Aramoana massacre, when a local resident shot and killed 13 people, did not go far enough, Ardern said.

The Labour Party-led government’s legislation, which has full cross-party support, will be introduced under urgency procedures when parliament sits next week. Under an Order in Council, the ban on trading and use of such weapons came into force immediately.

The population remains shocked by the horrific events that unfolded in Christchurch. On March 22, people observed an official call for two minutes’ silence. Some 20,000 gathered in Christchurch and 15,000 in Dunedin to attend vigils in memory of the victims. The widespread anger over the shooting, and sympathy for its victims, is being channelled toward gun control for definite political purposes.

International media coverage seized on the initiative, as well as moves to restrict freedom of expression on social media platforms, to praise Ardern’s “inspirational leadership.” A glowing March 21 editorial in the New York Times, entitled “America Deserves a Leader as Good as Jacinda Ardern,” proclaimed that “the world should learn from the way Jacinda Ardern… has responded to the horror.”

Democratic Party members who are falsely presented as “lefts” also applauded her. Presidential aspirant Bernie Sanders posted on Twitter: “This is what real action to stop gun violence looks like. We must follow New Zealand’s lead, take on the NRA [National Rifle Association] and ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons in the United States.”

This campaign seeks to cover up the responsibility of the political establishment and the state in New Zealand, as well as in US, Europe and Australia, for fanning the growth of the far-right by stirring up anti-immigrant xenophobia and racism.

To present “gun control” as a solution to the type of far-right extremist violence unleashed in Christchurch is a fraud on many levels. As Brenton Tarrant’s manifesto makes clear, he planned his attack over a two-year period in a highly-disciplined and determined manner and was not wedded to using guns. Little has been said about the fact that two explosive devices were discovered on a car following Tarrant’s arrest.

Moreover, Tarrant had a long history of connections with known far-right groups and made his plans known online before the massacre, raising disturbing questions about why police and intelligence agencies did not prevent the attack.

Alongside the gun control measures, New Zealand’s chief censor banned Tarrant’s manifesto. This is an anti-democratic move aimed at preventing ordinary people from seeing the striking similarity of Tarrant’s racist and anti-Muslim rhetoric and that of the establishment political parties, most obviously NZ First, which is a coalition partner in the Labour-led government, alongside the Greens.

The focus on guns goes hand-in-hand with censorship. It aims to obscure the fact that successive Labour and National-led governments have overseen a social crisis since the 1980s and a quarter century of criminal US-led wars that has helped create the conditions for the re-emergence of fascism as an international phenomenon.

As Tarrant’s manifesto boasts, there is widespread sympathy for fascism in governments, the military, police and intelligence agencies. Yet the mass shooting is being exploited to bolster the powers and resources of the state apparatus.

The ruling elite views gun control as one way to expand police powers and prepare to suppress the growing struggles against deteriorating living standards and the drive to war. The law change coincides with a push to arm police with guns. New Zealand is one of a handful of countries where front-line officers do not routinely carry firearms, but in recent years this has begun to change. Killings by armed police have become more common.

Officially, Tarrant is the sole suspect in the Christchurch attack. Yet despite him being in custody, the country remains on a “high” threat alert, meaning a “terrorist attack is assessed as very likely.” It is the first time New Zealand has had a high threat level, and it has been used to deploy police on the streets with semi-automatic weapons.

Under the new restrictions, weapons similar to those used in the terrorist attack will be outlawed. Related parts capable of converting guns into semi-automatics (MSSAs) also will be banned, along with high-capacity magazines. A buyback scheme will allow gun owners to return weapons. After a “reasonable time” those who continue to possess the guns could be prosecuted. Current gun law penalties are up to $4,000 and/or three years in prison, but the new law would increase these.

On Monday, Police Minister Stuart Nash told TVNZ the immediate bans would be followed with laws to tighten vetting procedures, licensing and storage of weapons. Yet questions remain unanswered about why the police granted the Christchurch shooter a gun license, despite his many public statements on social media in support of fascists, and threats to kill “Marxists and globalists.”

Ardern claimed Tarrant had exploited “loopholes” in the law. Police, however, said he obtained his license after being vetted. In late 2017, police interviewed him and also spoke to two referees who reportedly vouched for his character. Police have not revealed what they discussed with Tarrant, nor the identity of his referees. A former police firearms control officer, Joe Green, told the media that the referees were a father and son whom the far-right extremist had met in an online forum.

All the parliamentary parties—government and opposition—have vowed to prevent a repeat of the atrocity, but for decades they have created the reactionary political climate that enable the rise of fascist groups. All of them have supported the bogus “war on terror,” including the US-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, which have fuelled anti-Muslim xenophobia. The entire political establishment has backed immigration restrictions, suggesting that immigrants and refugees are to blame for the social crisis created by the austerity measures of successive governments.

Workers should oppose the strengthening of the state apparatus, which will inevitably be used against the struggles of the working class, as will the gangs of fascist thugs. The only way to end the threat of fascism is to abolish its root cause—the bankrupt and decaying capitalist system.

As he had done in previous elections, District 25 New Democratic Party candidate Herb Dickieson had volunteers out bright and early Tuesday morning putting up the first of his election signage.

Liberal Premier Wade MacLauchlan dropped the writ Tuesday night in Charlottetown, triggering a four-week provincial election campaign.

Then, shortly after 8 a.m. on Wednesday, Dickieson discovered his signage was just a little premature.

“I have people out covering them up,” he told the Journal Pioneer Wednesday morning.

But he wasn’t planning on leaving them covered for long.

On a coffee break, Dickieson was collecting the last of the signatures he needed before reporting to the District 25 returning officer to complete his necessary documents to become a “registered” candidate with Elections P.E.I.

New rules require that candidates be registered with Elections P.E.I. before advertising – including signage – can be initiated. Such registration forms were only available to candidates the morning after the writ and once the returning offices open.

“We want to be in compliance with the Elections P.E.I. rule,” said Dickieson. “We have people out there now correcting that to make sure we’re in full compliance.”

Elections P.E.I. CEO Tim Garrity sent an email to political parties on Tuesday, advising them of the new rule.

DIckieson, who served one term as the District 25 MLA from 1996 to 2000 and ran in other election campaigns, said he was just doing what he had done in previous election campaigns and was not aware of the rule change.

He was not the only candidate in his district to have signs up early.

On a 7:30 to 8:20 a.m. round trip along Highway 2 between Bloomfield and Richmond Wednesday, the Journal Pioneer counted five election signs: one at Coleman Corner promoting Dickieson and four between Portage and Victoria West promoting Liberal incumbent Robert Henderson. Henderson could not be reached for comment on the timing of his signage.

There were similar reports from across the province.

Dickieson subsequently confirmed that his paperwork was filed, and the tarps were being taken off of his signs.

“I’m legal now,” he said.

Garrity confirmed that Elections P.E.I. staff had received several complaints about signage being in contravention with the Elections Expenses Act. He said investigations have been launched.

“The investigation is ongoing at this point, so I can’t comment too much on it right now. We’re involving our legal representatives and we’re investigating any and all complaints that come in around the election signs, using that Section 17 of the Elections Expenses Act.”

According to Garrity no signs advertising parties or candidates should have been out prior to at least 9 a.m.

He said the offices opened, at the earliest, at 9 a.m. on Wednesday.

Candidates first have to register with Elections P.E.I. before they can advertise, he said.

“They have to register with us, and that includes getting their nomination forms filled out and paying their deposit with the returning officers and getting their forms officially signed off by the returning officers as registered candidates.”

Markey and Ocasio-Cortez held a news conference to unveil their Green New Deal resolution.

(CNN) - House Republicans are hoping to force a vote on the Green New Deal to put House Democrats on the record as to whether they support the sweeping and controversial proposal, though it's not clear the effort will gain traction as Democrats are expected to dismiss it as a political stunt.

House GOP Whip Steve Scalise said at a news conference Wednesday where House Republicans announced their plan that it's important to ""contrast"" the kind of energy policy that their party supports with ""what Nancy Pelosi and her radical leftists are trying to do.""

The concept of a Green New Deal has been championed by progressive party rising stars like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and embraced by Democratic 2020 contenders. But the Green New Deal, which calls for a national mobilization of resources to tackle global warming, hasn't been universally embraced by congressional Democrats, though the party is broadly united in calling for action to fight climate change.

Pushing for a vote gives House Republicans an opportunity to put a spotlight on a proposal that they believe divides Democrats.

Republican Rep. Jody Hice of Georgia plans to file a discharge petition in an attempt to bring the Green New Deal resolution to the House floor for a vote. A discharge petition is a procedural tool that can be used to force a floor vote, but only if a majority of House members sign on in support.

Discharge petitions rarely succeed because of how high threshold is to clear. Even if every House Republican signs on in support, roughly 20 House Democrats would still need to sign on in order to force the vote.

""The American people need to know where their representatives stand on this radical proposal, the Green New Deal,"" Hice said. ""Make no mistake about it, regardless of what supporters say, it is a radical proposal that will dramatically take American society further to the left. And I want a vote on it.""

The Georgia Republican added that he hopes there will be enough support from Democrats to force a vote.

""The message to my socialist, Democrat colleagues is very simple: we're looking for at least 20 of them ... we want them to join with Republicans for the sake of a recorded vote on the Green New Deal,"" he said.

That appears improbable, however, especially if House Democrats put up a show of unity like most Senate Democrats did when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell brought the Green New Deal up for a vote in the Senate on Tuesday.

The overwhelming majority of Senate Democrats voted ""present,"" in protest over the vote, which they argued was only intended as a political attack on the nascent proposal.

Hice said on Wednesday that he will file the discharge petition sometime after Easter.

The congressman tentatively plans to file the motion on the House floor in late April, a GOP aide familiar with the discussions told CNN. Once that happens, the congressman will be able to start gathering signatures for the petition, according to the aide. The aide added that Hice is currently ""actively working to garner support among his colleagues,"" for the petition.

CNN has reached out to Ocasio-Cortez's office to request comment.

The freshman Democrat on Tuesday criticized McConnell's decision to bring the Green New Deal to a vote in the Senate and tweeted that she ""encouraged"" Senate Democrats to vote ""present.""

Republicans have been quick to seize on the fact that Senate Democrats did not vote to advance the measure, casting it as a sign that Democrats are unwilling to stand behind the proposal. Senate Republicans were united in voting ""no"" out of objection to the far-reaching plan, which McConnell has labeled ""a socialist makeover of the entire US economy.""

In response to a tweet from Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming asking, ""Why did Senate Democrats just duck a vote,"" Ocasio-Cortez wrote, ""Because I encouraged them to vote present, along w/ others. McConnell tried to rush the #GreenNewDeal straight to the floor without a hearing.""

Ocasio-Cortez added, ""The real question we should be asking: Why does the Senate GOP refuse to hold any major hearings on climate change?""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly said that she welcomes the enthusiasm behind the Green New Deal, but she has described it as one of many proposals that will be looked at by committees.

At the start of the new Congress, Pelosi set up a Select Committee on the Climate Crisis that's expected to come up with recommendations for new legislation. In one sign of the efforts Democrats are making to push for climate action, Pelosi along with other House Democrats, unveiled a bill Wednesday that aims to push the United States to uphold the Paris climate agreement.",House Republicans will attempt to force vote on Green New Deal,channel4000.com,http://www.channel4000.com/nation/politics/house-republicans-will-attempt-to-force-vote-on-green-new-deal/1063251618

LONDON — British lawmakers on Friday rejected the government's Brexit deal for a third time, leaving the U.K. facing the stark prospect of a chaotic departure from the European Union in just two weeks, with political leaders in turmoil and the country ill-prepared for the shock.

It's either that, or a long delay to the country's exit from the EU. The alternatives are dwindling.

The House of Commons voted 344-286 against the withdrawal agreement struck between Prime Minister Theresa May and the EU, rebuffing her plea to ""put aside self and party"" and deliver the Brexit that Britons voted for.

Amid business warnings that a no-deal Brexit could mean crippling tariffs, border gridlock and shortages of goods, a visibly frustrated May said the vote had ""grave"" implications.

""The legal default now is that the United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union on 12 April — in just 14 days' time,"" she said. ""This is not enough time to agree, legislate for and ratify a deal, and yet the House has been clear it will not permit leaving without a deal. And so we will have to agree an alternative way forward.""

Had the deal been passed, Britain would have left the EU on May 22.

The bloc said the rejection of the divorce terms made a no-deal Brexit ""a likely scenario"" and called an emergency summit of EU leaders for April 10 to decide what to do next.

An EU Commission official said the 27 remaining EU nations were ""fully prepared for a no-deal scenario at midnight 12th of April.""

Almost three years after Britain voted in June 2016 to leave the EU, and two years after it set its departure date for March 29, 2019, British politicians remain deadlocked over Brexit. Like the country as a whole, they are split between those who want a clean break, those who want to retain close ties with the bloc, and those who want to overturn the decision to leave.

Last week, to prevent Britain from crashing out, the EU granted an extension to May 22 if the divorce deal was approved by Friday — or to April 12 if it was rejected.

Friday's 58-vote margin of defeat for the deal was narrower than previous votes in January and March, but it still left the government's blueprint for exiting the bloc in tatters.

May's deal was voted down even after the prime minister sacrificed her job in exchange for Brexit, promising to quit if lawmakers approved the agreement. With the deal's rejection, she will face pressure to step aside and let a new Conservative Party leader take over negotiations with the EU.

The government had also warned pro-Brexit politicians that rejecting May's deal could see Britain's departure from the EU delayed indefinitely.

May's arguments moved some previously resistant Brexit-backers to support the deal. Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson — a likely contender to replace May as Conservative leader — tweeted that rejecting it risked ""being forced to accept an even worse version of Brexit or losing Brexit altogether.""

But May's key allies, the Democratic Unionist Party in Northern Ireland, refused to back the agreement because it treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the U.K.

Parliament voted on the legally binding, 585-page withdrawal agreement that May struck with the EU late last year, setting out the terms of Britain's departure — but not on a shorter declaration on future ties that was also part of the accord between the two sides.

Removing the political declaration altered the deal enough to overcome a parliamentary ban against asking lawmakers the same question over and over again.

By Subrat Patnaik

MEERUT, India (Reuters) - Prime Minister Narendra Modi officially launched his party's general election campaign on Thursday with a rally in India's most populous state, promising development with national security in seeking votes for another term.

A coalition led by Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is widely expected to retain power in a staggered election beginning on April 11, especially given recent tension with old rival Pakistan.

""This country has seen governments that only made slogans, but for the first time, they are seeing a decisive government that knows how to demonstrate its resolve,"" Modi told the rally in the city of Meerut in Uttar Pradesh state, which has the most members of parliament of all states.

""Our vision is of a new India that will be in tune with its glorious past,"" he said to roars of approval from the crowd who waved BJP flags and chanted for another term for Modi.

The rally was held in a field flanking a main road, surrounded by farm land. Vendors sold BJP mugs, T-shirts and clocks.

The general election, the world's biggest democratic exercise with about 900 million eligible voters, will be held in phases ending on May 19. Votes will be counted on May 23.

Tension with neighboring Pakistan soared last month after a suicide bomb attack in the Indian part of the disputed Kashmir region killed 40 Indian paramilitary police. The bombing was claimed by a Pakistan-based militant group.

India retaliated with an air raid against a suspected militant camp in northern Pakistan.

In December, the main opposition Congress party defeated the BJP in three major rural states as a lack of jobs and weak farm prices dented Modi's popularity.

But pollsters say Modi's chances have improved significantly thanks to his tough stance on Pakistan

At the rally, Modi repeatedly spoke about the Indian bombing of the suspected militant camp. He also referred to a test on Wednesday in which India shot down one of its own satellites in space, which he said made India a space power.

Modi also promised economic growth and a prosperous society for all.

Modi's main challenger is the opposition Congress party, which was for decades India's dominant political party.

One Modi supporter derided a recent Congress offer to hand out 6,000 rupees ($87) a month to the poorest families if it was voted back into power.

""I know how the economy works,"" said chartered accountant Anupam Sharma. ""GDP would be decimated.""

Modi was due to address another rally in Jammu, the winter capital of Jammu and Kashmir state, later on Thursday.

The President has vowed to make the Republican Party the ""party of health care.""

But the disagreements that embroiled the GOP just two years ago and dashed its seven-year promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, still threaten that goal.

Just a day after Trump descended on Capitol Hill with a grandiose appeal to dive back into the contentious health care fight, aides and members who lived a year-long stall out were scratching their heads, grappling with what another run at health care would even look like in the era of a Democratic-controlled House and what it could cost them in the next election.

""I almost can't imagine a more tactically unwise move than the President's announcement last night that he intends to make the Republican Party, the party of health care,"" said Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware.

The pledge from Trump came just a day after his Justice Department said it agreed with the ruling of a federal judge in Texas that invalidated the Obama-era health care law, a decision that caught Republicans off guard.

""I'm very disappointed and vehemently opposed to the administration seeking to invalidate the entire Affordable Care Act,"" Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins told reporters. ""If the administration is opposed to the ACA, and clearly there are provisions of the law that do need to be fixed, the answer is for the administration to work ... with Congress and present a plan to replace and fix the law. Not to, through the courts, seek to invalidate it altogether.""

Asked if he supported the administration's decision to seek to invalidate Obamacare, Sen. Roy Blunt, a Republican from Missouri and a member of party leadership in the chamber, told reporters ""all I'm going to say about that for a while is that I'm eager to see what the administration proposes.""

Or as one Senate aide put it: ""We are waiting with eagerness the White House chief of staff's proposal on health care reform that brings to Republicans the consensus that has otherwise eluded us for over a decade.""

On Wednesday, the party seemed to be all over the map when it came to what the next steps in a health care negotiation would be. Some, argued that the administration has wide latitude to act on its own and has already moved ahead with association health plans. They also say congressional action likely wasn't necessary.

""We are going to do association health plans administratively, and I think that is going to be a game changer, I really do,"" said Sen. Roger Wicker, a Republican from Mississippi.

Others found more promise in reopening the health care negotiations even in an era of divided government.

""This is sort of like a new lease of life,"" said South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham following Trump's lunch. ""Listen Obamacare has failed and it's not going to work ... we have done enough to go after Obamacare, but not enough to replace it.""

Graham added ""if we don't have a proposal on health care then that is a mistake going into 2020.""

Republicans say they could pivot to a health care system that relies heavily on block grants to the states, but the party tried that in 2017 with members deeply divided about how to develop a fair formula to dish out the money to each state. Republicans also say they all agree that people with pre-existing conditions should be protected under a GOP law, but disagreements also raged on in 2017 about how stringent government regulations should be on companies to ensure they actually covered people with pre-existing conditions.

Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican up for re-election in North Carolina in 2020, said he welcomed a renewed health care debate and wanted to ensure that the White House helped lead the way.

""We need a solution to a problem,"" he said. ""Court decisions, other things could create a lot of uncertainty, and we are trying to head it off. I am glad to see the President is pointing it out. I look forward to seeing what kind of an outline we can run with.""

Republicans agree Trump's presentation Tuesday had been compelling even if it had been short on details. Congress, they agreed had an obligation to act.

""The rising cost of health insurance is a huge problem for the American people,"" said Sen. John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana. ""And I think that's why God made Congress, is to do something about these problems and we haven't done a damn thing.""",Trump's 'party of health care' promise bewilders Republican senators,channel4000.com,http://www.channel4000.com/nation/politics/trumps-party-of-health-care-promise-bewilders-republican-senators/1063336643
171,Politics,2019-03-30T05:11:00.0000000Z,a deal struck by Netanyahu that could bring a far-right party into the Knesset; and AIPAC’s supposed refusal to condemn white nationalists in President Donald Trump’s orbit. But the conference won’t be a showcase for Democratic contenders for a ...,"WASHINGTON (JTA) — The Democratic candidates are steering clear of AIPAC’s big policy conference, but celebrations by the pro-Israel lobby’s critics on the left may be premature.



This week MoveOn, the progressive advocacy group, asked candidates not to attend the conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, and has been keeping a list of the no-shows: Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; Washington Gov. Jay Inslee; South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; former Housing Secretary Julian Castro; former Maryland Rep. John Delaney; and former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke. (Howard Schultz, the Starbucks mogul considering an independent run, also is not attending.)

However, only Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who said in 2016 that he “would very much have enjoyed speaking at the AIPAC conference,” explained why he wasn’t going this year in language that closely hews to MoveOn’s arguments for snubbing the event.“He’s concerned about the platform AIPAC is providing for leaders who have expressed bigotry and oppose a two-state solution,” his policy director, Josh Orton, told The Huffington Post.MoveOn’s reasons included AIPAC’s opposition to the Iran deal; its inclusion of speakers who the group says peddle Islamophobic rhetoric; alleged war crimes condoned by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu; a deal struck by Netanyahu that could bring a far-right party into the Knesset; and AIPAC’s supposed refusal to condemn white nationalists in President Donald Trump’s orbit.But the conference won’t be a showcase for Democratic contenders for a perhaps more prosaic reason: AIPAC hasn’t rolled out the welcome mat.The truth is, AIPAC does not welcome candidates as speakers in non-election years. An AIPAC official confirmed the policy to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, but would not explain it. A best guess is that when there are more than a dozen candidates in play, it’s too unwieldy. By the time March of an election year rolls around, it’s down to three or four, which makes the logistics easier.So why aren’t the other Democrats attending, if only just to schmooze? JTA asked a number of them, and is awaiting their responses, but one plausible reason is that they are campaigning. Until 2007, AIPAC allowed candidates to hold salons on the convention campus — no fundraising allowed, but an opportunity to meet and greet folks who might want to give once they get away from the convention. In 2007, the buzz at Obama’s salon was, well, buzzier than at Hillary Clinton’s, a harbinger of what was to be.AIPAC has ceased the practice, which means just stopping by the convention is wasted time for an eager campaigner. (AIPAC since 2015 has stopped its roll call, when executives and lay leaders would read out the names of the politicians in attendance.)So MoveOn’s “victory” list appears a little disingenuous. Harris, for example, teased her presidential candidacy at AIPAC two years ago and again last year — there are no definitive signs she is turning on the lobby. Delaney’s campaign told The Hill that he wanted to attend — he was “very disappointed” — but had a scheduling conflict.“We have attended every year since he has been in Congress and we very much look forward to being back next year,” his campaign said.But its complaints about AIPAC focus attention about fault lines on the left over Israel.It’s notable that some things Sanders and MoveOn object to about the lobby have changed since 2016, when Sanders was eager to speak to AIPAC — but much has not.MoveOn’s No. 1 reason — that AIPAC took the lead in opposing the Iran nuclear deal — happened in 2015, when the Obama administration negotiated the deal. So did the Israeli elections, when Netanyahu incurred the Obama administration’s wrath for referring to Arab voters in what seemed to be racist terms. Israel’s last war was with Hamas in the Gaza Strip in 2014, and before that in 2012. Netanyahu, moreover, is considered among his citizens to be among the Israeli prime ministers who have shown the greatest restraint in wartime.AIPAC has had speakers from Israel’s right who do not want a two-state solution, and in 2016 — the year Sanders thought it was a good idea to speak to the conference — The Nation singled out a number of speakers perceived as Islamophobic. By contrast, this year AIPAC distanced itself from a speaker who attacked Muslim lawmakers, and the speaker withdrew.In 2016, AIPAC did not condemn white nationalists associated with Trump (it did reprimand Trump for dissing Barack Obama), and it is true that unlike other groups, the lobby has not singled out administration figures like Steve Bannon or Stephen Miller. But AIPAC rarely speaks out on any issue that does not directly concern Israel — although it was, uncharacteristically, among the groups that expressed dismay in 2017 after Trump equivocated following the deadly neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville, Virginia.AIPAC — again, unlike other Jewish groups — did not directly condemn Netanyahu for his deal with the far-right Jewish Power party, but (again unusually for AIPAC) it did condemn the party itself.AIPAC is trying hard to cultivate Democrats, the party that still garners the loyalty of most American Jews, and explicitly backs the two-state solution, while Netanyahu and Trump have both retreated from it, and a number of the conference’s sidebar sessions are about how to get there. Its legislative agenda this year is devoid of the items that only Republicans are advancing, including proposals to recognize Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights. The Iran deal damaged the relationship between AIPAC and Democrats, but not beyond repair.So what really has changed for Sanders? He was critical of the lobby in 2016, using its friendship with Hillary Clinton to attack her in a debate, but was also eager to engage.Perhaps the lobby is collateral damage from the broken relationship between Netanyahu and Democrats. It was bad enough that the Israeli leader dissed Obama in 2015 by speaking out against the president’s Iran policy in Congress, but his intimacy with Trump appears to be too much to bear for the party — certainly, the liberal wing that Sanders represents.There’s no question that Sanders’ surprisingly strong candidacy in 2016 made it easier for candidates this year to criticize Israel. This week, O’Rourke and Buttigieg took aim at Israeli policies, and Warren has done so as well. Sanders now posts campaign videos that speak of “apartheid-like” conditions in areas controlled by Israel. Harris, Sanders and Warren defended Rep. Ilhan Omar, the Minnesota Democrat accused of criticizing Israel and AIPAC in terms seen as anti-Semitic, while the party’s congressional leadership was preparing to condemn her.The same three senators, along with Gillibrand and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., another presidential candidate, voted last month against an AIPAC-backed bill that would have protected states with laws targeting the boycott Israel movement. Each senator said the anti-boycott measure infringed on speech freedoms and that they opposed the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement targeting Israel. It remains to be seen whether Booker, Gillibrand, Warren and Harris are comfortable with MoveOn’s boycott of AIPAC.Keep an eye on next year’s policy conference, when candidates will not be able to brush off AIPAC without explaining why — and might be less inclined to do so as they begin to pivot from pleasing the Democratic base and reaching out to independent voters. That’s a reality MoveOn appears to recognize — it has said that attending the conference will not be a litmus test in how it otherwise treats candidates.A version of this post first appeared in The Tell , Ron Kampeas’ weekly newsletter on Jewish news from Washington.

Julian declined to say whether the New ...","The federal New Democrats' fiscal plan for the fall election will be shaped by estimates of how much money Ottawa loses out on each year to international tax-avoidance schemes, the party's finance critic says.

New Westminster-Burnaby MP Peter Julian said the party intends to focus on Canada's so-called ""tax gap"" to show it can finance big campaign commitments — in areas such as affordable housing and universal pharmacare — by cracking down on corporate tax avoidance, loopholes and offshore havens.

article continues below

The tax gap, which one estimate said could be above $40 billion annually, is the difference between the amount of tax revenue that should have been collected in a year and what was actually brought in.Julian said to reinforce its fiscal plan, the NDP is counting on the findings of an upcoming report from the independent parliamentary budget officer on the size of the tax gap.

""The whole issue of corporate taxation will be a stronger part of what we offer to Canadians, bolstered by the PBO report,"" Julian said in an interview.

""You will hear us repeating what was found in the PBO report. Whether that number is $10 billion or $15 billion or $20 billion or higher... And we will be talking about the fair tax system as a foundation for making the kind of investments that will make a difference in people's lives.""

Details about the NDP's fiscal approach follow last week's release of the final federal budget before October's election.

The budget from the governing Liberals fed political debate on whether or not federal governments should strive to return the books to balance as soon as possible.

The document showed the Liberals are in no hurry. Their budget, which emphasized a need to continue making investments, projected annual deficits of almost $20 billion in each of the next two years and contained no timeline to balance the books.

A few days after the budget's release, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer told a conference that a Tory government would bring books back to balance, but he didn't say when.

The NDP has been less vocal about its pre-election fiscal vision thus far.

In the 2015 election, the NDP vowed to make major investments and still balance the budget by raising corporate taxes and cutting off tax havens.

Following the party's poor results at the ballot box, former leader Tom Mulcair later laid part of the blame on the fiscal commitment, which he said overshadowed the NDP's ""social democratic economic vision.""

Julian declined to say whether the New Democrats will promise balanced books again in 2019 because NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh will roll out of the party's plans over the coming months.

The NDP will renew its focus on corporate tax fairness — and he expects this time to be different.

""I think what we needed in 2015 is what we'll have in 2019 — which is the PBO report on the tax gap,"" Julian said. ""In a sense, we're coming with far more evidence to support what we're saying about having to put in place a fair tax system.""

Other political parties have shown interest that the forthcoming tax gap report could be a source of new fiscal space for election promises, said Yves Giroux, the parliamentary budget officer.

But Giroux warned any federal government would need to make considerable efforts before they can turn the tax gap estimate into a source of revenue.

""We have to be somewhat prudent because even if we come up with an estimate that's high — and I'm not saying it's the case — it's only the beginning,"" Giroux said in an interview.

He said after identifying how much money is escaping the public treasury, the Canada Revenue Agency ""has to have the willingness to get that money.""","NDP to focus on 'tax gap' in election, says New West MP",New West Record,https://www.newwestrecord.ca/news/ndp-to-focus-on-tax-gap-in-election-says-new-west-mp-1.23771964

While ODM held its internal elections in August 2015, Jubilee, the ruling party, has had no democratically elected office bearers since its formation in the lead-up to the 2017 polls.

Jubilee, headed by President Uhuru Kenyatta, and Raila Odinga’s ODM, are expected to invest heavily in the internal polls to buttress their bastions as springboards for the presidential contest, now 41 months away.

The polls are all important because they are part of a democratic process through which parties recruit new members, raid opponents’ turfs and strengthen grassroots support.

Internal polls also gauge the parties’ individual strengths to project any formidable performance in upcoming presidential contests because it is by such process that various candidates for elective seats are picked.

GRASSROOTS

Grassroots leaders are the bedrock of presidential nominations as they make up the crucial party decision-making organs, including the National Delegates Convention, which elects the presidential flag-bearers.

The Star has established that the two parties are laying the ground for the crucial elections, which are likely litmus tests for the outfits’ unity and grip on their bastions.

Mismanagement may sink them into uncharted political waters that would negatively impact their 2022 chances.

Previously, such elections have triggered vicious fallouts, violence and even resulted in the formation of fringe parties.

Jubilee secretary general and Cabinet Secretary without portfolio Raphael Tuju told the Star that the ruling party plans to conduct its inaugural grassroots elections early next year.

Tuju insists the party is intact and will go on with its poll preparations. “Unless there is something like a legal order for an extension, we plan to do our elections before March 2020 to ensure that the same does not interfere with competitive politics in 2022,” Tuju said.

He said if elections are left too close to the 2022 polls, they would impact negatively on the party’s performance.

The elections will come at a time when the governing party is staring at an implosion triggered by widening cracks over government policies, including Uhuru's onslaught against corruption.","Jubilee, ODM gear up for do-or-die party polls",The Star,https://www.the-star.co.ke/siasa/2019-03-30-jubilee-odm-gear-up-for-do-or-die-party-polls/

Ocasio-Cortez has no such qualms. When asked whether ...","Twenty-nine-year-old ex-bartender and freshman U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez received thunderous environmentalist and media acclaim when she introduced her Green New Deal resolution in the House and Ed Markey submitted it in the Senate.

It was quickly endorsed or cosponsored by scores of other house and senate Democrats, including many who want to run against President Donald Trump in 2020.

But within days, the deal was subjected to rigorous analysis (and ridicule) by energy experts, Trump, Republicans, conservative pundits and even some Democrats. Their disdain is well-founded.

Asserting yet again that “manmade climate change” poses an “ existential threat ” to people and planet – with only a dozen years before total disaster strikes – the Green New Deal demands that the United States convert to 100 per cent “renewable” energy within 10 years. It also proclaims an equally urgent need to abandon free enterprise capitalism in favour of 100 per cent socialist economic and “social justice” policies.

In the energy arena, the deal requires that fossil fuels, nuclear power and even waste-to-energy and large-scale hydroelectric facilities be eliminated from the US energy mix. Coal, oil and natural gas leasing and development on federally controlled western lands would be banned, as would exports of those fuels.

Internal combustion cars, trucks, buses, trains and boats would be replaced with electric versions or eradicated. Airplanes would be replaced by high-speed rail. And every house and building in America would be gutted, rebuilt or retrofitted with “state of the art efficiency” technologies. That’s for starters.

The original draft resolution (since replaced on Ocasio-Cortez’s website) even called for getting rid of “farting cows” – to prevent methane from increasing above its current minuscule 0.0017 per cent of the atmosphere. So bugs not beef in our diets – and no more cheese, milk, yogurt or ice cream.

In the social justice and fairness arena, the deal provides that every American would get government-guaranteed jobs, with “family-sustaining” wages and pensions; free college or trade school; “healthy organic” food; “safe, affordable, adequate” and energy-efficient homes; and support for ethnic and economic “communities” that “historically” were harmed “first and most” by “dirty energy.”

Saturday Night Live could not have crafted a better parody of energy, economic and scientific reality.

But Ocasio-Cortez is determined to have her deal brought up for a vote in the House, where Speaker Nancy Pelosi worries about the spectacle that would ensue. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is equally determined to have a vote. Markey is outraged; he claims Republicans just want to sow discord within the Democratic party, portray Democrats as favouring extremist policies and sabotage the plan.

Meanwhile, Sen. Bob Menendez threatened to call police on a reporter who was “harassing” him merely by asking for his views about the Green New Deal.

Ocasio-Cortez has no such qualms. When asked whether implementing her deal would require “massive government intervention,” she replied : “It does. Yeah. I have no problem saying that.” Moreover, she added, we shouldn’t point fingers and say China, India or Russia aren’t doing anything like this. We shouldn’t “hold ourselves to a lower bar.” We should “choose to lead” the world in this transition.

Lead the world in economic suicide, environmental degradation, plummeting living standards, shorter life spans and societal upheaval would be a more accurate description of her proposal.

But at least Democrats and environmentalists have now made clear what they’ll do to America’s energy, economy, jobs, transportation, infrastructure and society if they regain control of the House, Senate, White House, deep state and courts.

What they’re not doing, discussing or even thinking about is how they intend to achieve their energy-climate-socialist nirvana, how many trillions of dollars it would cost, how many millions of good jobs would be eliminated before their promised job-creation programs theoretically kick in and exactly how they plan to deal with the enormous human and environmental impacts.

Ocasio-Cortez says don’t worry about the price tag. Just tax the rich more and borrow trillions more. Whether the cost is $1 trillion per year or $40 trillion to $100 trillion in total , that’s an ignorant, cavalier response. Either way, she must provide the numbers, calculations and wherewithal – transparently and with full debate.

And on environmental matters, Ocasio-Cortez and her cosponsors have no clue what they are talking about.

America has over a century of coal, oil and natural gas that should be used. It has vast quantities of limestone, copper, iron, and rare earth and other strategic metals that would be essential for the wind turbines, solar panels, biofuel operations, massive backup battery arrays, and thousands of kilometres of new electricity transmission lines that the Green New Deal envisions. Is there a snowball’s chance in hell that they would open highly mineralized western and Alaskan lands for exploration and mining?

Their intransigence on those resources means giving up bonuses, rents, royalties, taxes and millions of high-paying jobs. Billions of dollars in revenues to government will be replaced by billions of dollars in subsidies from government. America won’t even be able to manufacture energy systems because it won’t have either the reliable, affordable fuels to operate factories nor the necessary raw materials.

Meanwhile, the rest of the world will continue to use fossil fuels, emit greenhouse gases, surge ahead economically – and sell us trillions of dollars of Green New Deal energy systems. Those that come from China might even have grid-hacker-friendly portals built right into their motherboards.

Shuttering nuclear and hydro power plants – and converting transportation and shipping systems from gasoline and diesel – would mean the U.S. will need twice as much electricity as it generates today. Closing waste-to-energy facilities would add to those demands – and to landfill requirements.

Contrary to claims by green deal advocates, electricity rates would likely skyrocket.

The deal will also kill people, by making it hard for poor families and pensioners to afford adequate heat in winter. And just imagine countless stranded electric cars, trucks and buses clogging highways, especially during snow storms, as their batteries go dead … and hundreds of people die of exposure.

Given all that, there should be no thunderous applause. And no Green New Deal.

Wearing a giant paper receipt around his neck that covers the front of his body, Pond was introduced as “Skip the Slip” at a press conference on Jan. 8 when Ting rolled out Assembly Bill 161.

The bill still needs to clear two other committees — the Select Committee on Privacy and the Assembly Appropriations Committee — before it can be presented on the Assembly floor and then moved to the Senate and perhaps to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk for a signature.

For now, “Skip the Slip,” er, Pond will likely keep making appearances wearing the giant paper receipt, said Nannette Miranda, communication director for Assemblyman Ting.

Pond was not available for an interview — perhaps he was tied up — but Miranda said “Skip the Slip” and the giant prop was an idea of hers and that of legislative aide Jessica Duong . She said she came up with it after feeling overshadowed one too many times by those super long CVS paper receipts.

“I’m 5 feet and a half and sometimes it’s taller than me,” Miranda said in a phone interview.

Miranda said she was looking for ways to draw attention to the bill when she came up with the idea.

“I’m a former reporter. And it’s very difficult to get coverage on your bill when all of your bills need to meet deadlines,” she said. “Sometimes it’s hard to get attention to this bill and to get people to engage.”

She said she then asked the Democratic Party’s office to create a mock-up of the costume, and soon after Pond stepped up to be the volunteer to wear in public the giant paper receipt around his neck. Instead of item sales, the giant receipt lists facts about AB 161, she said.

“It’s been very effective and it’s a way to communicate for this bill, even if it just sparks a conversation,” she said.

Conversations about the excessive length of paper receipts — we’re still looking at you CVS — have proliferated across the internet for some time now. Some people even use Twitter to show off their CVS receipts with the hashtag #CVSreceipts.

A Twitter account named @Slip_Skip, whose bio reads “I’m covered in BPA, make me digital,” has posted regularly about its public appearances and has retweeted Ting’s tweets about his bill and others’ tweets spotting the #ReceiptMan. Ting’s office said it did not create the Twitter account and does not know who runs it.

“The legend lives on ... #ReceiptMan,” tweeted Samantha Gallegos, communications director for Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, D-San Diego.

But reaction was swift and fierce from state lawmakers, regulators, other cannabis growers and patients. On social media and in other public venues, Curio’s critics said the lawsuit would derail a yearlong effort to increase diversity in an industry that largely cut out minorities from winning licenses.

“It’s simply not true this lawsuit was intended to challenge the effort to improve diversity in our industry,” said Curio founder and CEO Michael Bronfein, a prominent national and state Democratic Party supporter, in a statement Friday. “In fact, Curio has always supported this effort and will continue to do so.”

Bronfein said he decided to withdraw a lawsuit whose merits he still supports but that has thrust him and his company into a swirl of accusations that he and Curio do not support diversity.

“I raised my children here and built my life here, and nothing hurts me more than being at the heart of a conversation that divides our community,” he wrote. “I have seen the concerns from our customers on social media about racial insensitivity. I have seen comments and accusations that in no way reflect the values of this company and are not an accurate depiction of the hardworking people of all races and ethnicities I work with every day.”

University of Baltimore President Kurt Schmoke said Bronfein “was upset because some people called him a racist.”

“Nothing could be further from the truth,” Schmoke said. “Whatever issues one may have business-wise, you can debate that. But in terms of his character — he’s an outstanding citizen and absolutely not a racist.”

Curio’s lawsuit does not address diversity. Instead, it states that investors spent millions of dollars on the operation based on regulations that promised a “strictly limited number” of licenses. To award more licenses would jeopardize the investments of Curio and 13 other companies that have grower licenses.

The company, which also holds licenses to process cannabis products and to sell them, even acknowledged that the commission can award new licenses. But the lawsuit stated that the commission did not follow regulations that state that any such awards must be based on a market analysis that has not been conducted.

Commission Chairman Brian Lopez, who was named as a defendant in Curio’s lawsuit, said the law hashed out last year states that a demand study cannot be conducted until 2024 when the industry has “had time to mature.”

Lopez and Del. Cheryl Glenn, a Baltimore Democrat who has been involved for years in developing regulations for the industry, said that the state published a disparity study that examined the market and showed that minorities are disadvantaged.

Minority firms lost out in the first round of bidding for 15 medical marijuana growing licenses. Based on the disparity study’s findings, the General Assembly passed compromise legislation in 2018 to expand the marijuana growing operations to try to give minorities an ownership role.

Glenn said Curio and Bronfein have been “standing alone” with this lawsuit and that the rest of the industry “demands diversity.”

“No one wants in 2019 to have a trillion dollar industry be controlled by all white men,” Glenn said. “We have had widespread support.”

The Maryland Wholesale Medical Cannabis Trade Association, which represents growers and processors, rejected the lawsuit Monday and said “the current application process should continue.” One grower, the group said, “does not reflect the desire of the majority of companies in the industry” to support more diversity.

Glenn said Bronfein’s opposition to last year’s legislative compromise shocked her.

“I said, ‘Are you kidding me?’” Glenn said. “We don’t have any diversity in this industry and you want us to wait while you create a monopoly.”

Bronfein said in his statement that he supports efforts to improve diversity.

“At Curio, diversity is not just a goal we mindlessly put on paper, it’s not just about affirmative action or corporate social responsibility,” he wrote. “It’s who we are. It’s the values we live by. It’s our culture — from management to our store floor.”

He wrote that 36 percent of Curio’s employees are female and 38 percent are African American.

“But over the last several days I have heard from my team that they are hearing from friends and family that they work for a company that doesn’t want to see economic benefits extended to all corners of our diverse state,” he wrote. “My commitment to diversity is not a business decision but a personal commitment rooted in the belief that it’s simply the right thing to do.”

He said he and his wife established a scholarship at the University of Baltimore that awards between two and four scholarships for African American students majoring in accounting.

William Jews, a prominent African American businessman and former chief executive of CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield in Maryland, also issued a statement saying that Bronfein has long been an advocate for diversity.","Amid backlash, Baltimore County cannabis firm drops lawsuit trying to halt Maryland from awarding new licenses",The Baltimore Sun,https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-cannabis-lawsuit-dropped-20190329-story.html

Posted: Mar. 30, 2019 8:00 am

WASHINGTON (AP)  President Donald Trump's decision to revive the fight over the Affordable Care Act has stirred a political and policy debate among Republicans on how best to approach the divisive issue heading into the 2020 election.

Failing to repeal and replace the ACA, otherwise known as Obamacare, is one of the biggest shortcomings of the president's first term. It left Republicans with a broken campaign promise, dismal approval ratings and a narrative they haven't been able to shake  that they don't support protecting those with pre-existing medical conditions from high-cost care. In some races, it cost Republican seats last fall, flipping House control to Democrats.

For Trump, the reset he wants is clear. ""The Republican Party will soon be known as the party of health care,"" he said on Capitol Hill . ""You watch!""

But among Republican senators, there's reluctance to embrace Trump's new priority. Usually tight-lipped Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who was given little advance notice of the president's new push, spoke volumes when asked about it.

""I look forward to seeing what the president is proposing,"" McConnell told Politico.

And in the House, it's a mixed bag. Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy initially panned Trump's move, questioning the timing that collided with Trump's bounce from the end of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election. But the GOP leader does see value in kick-starting a health care debate, said a person granted anonymity to discuss the situation. House Republicans continue to be asked about it back home and a new GOP health care bill could improve their standing with voters, the person said.

What's unclear is whether a Trump-Care bill will emerge from the White House or Capitol Hill to replace the Affordable Care Act or if the president's push for a policy outcome fades to little more than a topic for the campaign trail.

Trump discussed health care at length during a rally in Michigan Thursday and again during an appearance in Florida Friday.

""We are going to have a plan that's so much better than Obamacare,"" the president promised after touring an aging dike in South Florida.

For Trump, returning to health care shows his commitment to a 2016 campaign pledge and his desire to frame the 2020 debate on his terms.

Stung by the Democratic gains in November and sparked by another ACA legal challenge that could make its way to the Supreme Court, the president dug into the issue this past week, deciding to fight. He feels that it is an important battle to take on, said two people familiar with White House thinking who were not authorized to speak publicly.

The president has been actively engaged in conversations about health care, dialing up lawmakers in the House and Senate, and the White House is expected to lay out further details on his goals in the coming days.

""We are working very hard on that,"" said Trump as he was heading out to the Michigan rally, singling out Republican senators John Barrasso, Rick Scott and Bill Cassidy among those involved.

""They are going to work together to come up with something that's really spectacular,"" the president said.

But in truth, there is no grand Republican plan on Capitol Hill to replace Obamacare.

The day after Trump dropped the new priority during a private Senate GOP lunch, a top ally, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., convened an evening meeting of senators to discuss options, according to those familiar with the talks.

Graham had helped spark the idea with Trump during a golf outing at Mar-a-Lago. The group he assembled back on Capitol Hill included two former governors well versed in health care policy  Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, whose Romney-care in Massachusetts was a precursor to Obamacare, and Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, a former health care executive.

But McConnell has made it clear he would rather see Republicans spend their time attacking the Democratic plans to expand existing health care programs, namely the Medicare for All plans embraced by some of the Democrats running to unseat Trump. He sees it as their best option for reversing public opinion heading toward 2020 when he, too, faces re-election. McConnell derides the high cost of a government-run system as ""Medicare for None.""

The thinking among McConnell and other leading Republicans is that it's best to avoid another messy legislative battle. Republicans are loath to repeat the undertaking that consumed much of 2017. At that time, Republicans could never agree on a new health care plan and the months-long exercise ended in failure when John McCain joined others in rejecting one last-ditch effort, dooming the years-long campaign to repeal and replace Obamacare.

They would rather simply wait out the White House with an expectation that no actual legislation emerges, according to those familiar with the GOP thinking.

House Republicans, though, face a different calculus. They lost dozens of seats last fall in part because Democrats successfully attacked them over the GOP proposals to replace Obamacare. Americans have warmed to the 2010 health care law and, in particular, its provision that prevents insurers from charging more to patients pre-existing conditions.

McCarthy wants the majority back, the person said. Even though he questioned Trump's sudden shift to health care, it has promise. The day after Trump announced his health care push, the GOP leader convened the top House Republicans from various committees to dig into the issue.

""I'll make this promise to you  and it's a conversation I had with the president  the Republicans will make sure pre-existing conditions are protected,"" McCarthy told reporters. ""The president and I have talked numerous times. We talked quite often. But this is one of the conversations we have, greatly, that we support protecting pre-existing conditions.""

But Republicans lost their chance to revise Obamacare when they controlled both chambers in Congress. Now, any bill will need Democratic backing to clear the House with Speaker Nancy Pelosi's majority.

At most, lawmakers envision a modest package of health care bills that could lower prescription drug prices and other reforms that have wide bipartisan support.

That may or may not be enough for Trump.

And if not, he can continue advocating for more on the campaign trail.

At the rally in Michigan, he vowed, ""It's going to be far better than Obamacare.""

Temer's Brazil Democratic Movement party long held sway over key appointments in Brazil's largely state-run energy sector, including nuclear power plants. Work on Angra 3, the third nuclear ...","By Brad Brooks

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian former President Michel Temer was hit with more graft charges on Friday, just a day after being charged in a separate corruption case, according to federal prosecutors.

Temer, who left the presidency at the end of 2018, was arrested last week as part of an investigation into kickbacks on a nuclear plant's construction contract involving the Brazilian subsidiary of Swedish consulting firm AF Poyry, along with engineering firms Engevix and Argeplan.

Temer has since been released and denies wrongdoing. AF Poyry has said it would not comment on an ongoing investigation. Engevix and Argeplan did not reply to requests for comment.

Federal prosecutors charged Temer and his former energy minister Wellington Moreira Franco of taking part in a bribery scheme related to the Angra nuclear power plant complex on the Rio de Janeiro coast and other state firms. Moreira Franco has also said he is innocent.

Last week, prosecutors said the graft at Angra was one aspect of a ""criminal organization"" that Temer had run during his four decades in public life, which received or arranged upward of 1.8 billion reais ($462.53 million) in bribes.

Temer, 78, served for two years as Sao Paulo state's prosecutor general starting in 1983. In 1985 he was elected to Congress, where he served until becoming former president Dilma Rousseff's vice president in 2011. He took over as president after Rousseff was impeached in 2016.

Temer's Brazil Democratic Movement party long held sway over key appointments in Brazil's largely state-run energy sector, including nuclear power plants.

Work on Angra 3, the third nuclear power plant planned in the Angra complex, has advanced haltingly since 1984 and has long been on the radar of graft investigators. The complex is run by Eletronuclear, a unit of state power holding company Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA, known as Eletrobras.

Temer is the second former president to be arrested in Brazil's unprecedented anti-corruption push since 2014. Former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is in jail serving over 12 years for a corruption conviction.

On Thursday, Temer was charged with corruption on allegations of using a middleman to procure a suitcase full of cash from controlling shareholders of the world's largest meatpacker, JBS SA.

In 2017, security cameras captured video of a former Temer adviser, Rodrigo da Rocha Loures, running out of a Sao Paulo restaurant carrying a bag with 500,000 reais in cash.

Plea-bargain testimony by two executives of JBS holding company J&F Investimentos SA implicated Temer and others in a bribery scheme and led prosecutors to accuse Rocha Loures of being a middleman for Temer, which the former president denied. Rocha Loures, who also denied the charges, is awaiting trial.

She also offers that she thinks all sides should be working across party lines to fix what she calls “fissures and weaknesses” in Canadian ...,"OTTAWA – Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould was cautioned about a potential “collision” with the prime minister over the SNC-Lavalin file by outgoing Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, a newly-released audio recording reveals. This caution came a month before she was shuffled out of her role, and nearly two months before the scandal began unfolding publicly.

According to an audio recording of a conversation that the pair had, submitted to the House Justice Committee by Wilson-Raybould, Wernick said he was worried what might happen if Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould remained at “loggerheads” about whether or not to offer a deferred prosecution agreement to the Quebec engineering firm.

In the audio, Wilson-Raybould can be heard issuing repeated and stern warnings that senior officials pressuring her over the SNC-Lavalin case would “look like nothing but political interference” if the Quebec construction and engineering company were granted deferred prosecution. By the time of her recorded conversation with Wernick, Wilson-Raybould says she had already endured months of intense lobbying from such officials.

She said in the audio that she was absolutely confident in her decision -- to back the Director of Public Prosecutions’ decision not to grant the agreement and to continue pursuing the criminal charges -- and in response, Wernick said he was “worried about a collision then because he is pretty firm about this. I just saw him a few hours ago and this is really important to him.”

In a statement late Friday, Trudeau’s office said that he was “not briefed by the Clerk on his conversation with Jody Wilson-Raybould,” and that the PMO was “unaware of the full contents of this recording before today.”

The PMO statement reiterates that Trudeau wishes she would have gone to him directly about the matter, reinforcing his message that there “was clearly an erosion of trust over the past few months” between all key actors in this affair.

“I don't get the covert ops program or holding on to the tape for a convenient moment,” Wernick’s lawyer Frank Addario said in a statement, according to The Canadian Press. According to his lawyer, Wernick was not aware the call had been recorded until it was released on Friday.

“She was the chief legal officer for the country. She didn't give her tape to the RCMP. She didn't give it to the PM or the Ethics Commissioner. She didn't even give it to the committee when she first testified. Most peculiar,” CP quotes him as saying.

The 17-minute audio file was provided to all members of the House Justice Committee on Friday, as part of the new and supplementary evidence related to the SNC-Lavalin scandal that she handed over days ago.

The 43-pages of additional material also includes a 21-page written statement, as well as screen shots of text messages and copies of emails that she referenced during her initial testimony, adding more fodder to the continuously developing controversy that’s dominated political headlines for the last two months.

The secret recording is of a Dec. 19 phone call with Wernick that both parties have previously testified to. In the recording Wilson-Raybould can be heard saying that she was trying to protect Trudeau by issuing these cautions about prosecutorial independence.

She said the way the case was being handled “screams of” political interference and that while she agrees jobs are important, the issue is how it would look if federal prosecutors dropped the criminal charges of fraud and corruption, in exchange for a remediation agreement.

Throughout the scandal -- which touched off on Feb. 7 when The Globe and Mail reported that Wilson-Raybould faced pressure to interfere in a criminal case against SNC-Lavalin -- the federal Liberals have cited the 9,000 jobs at stake as their main motivator for any actions in this case.

Should SNC-Lavalin be found guilty, they could face a 10-year ban on applying for federal contracts, leading to the company having to move out of Canada.

“I feel that I am giving him my best advice. And if he doesn’t accept that advice then it’s his prerogative to do what he wants. But I’m trying to protect the prime minister from political interference, perceived or otherwise,” she said.

Wernick -- who was not made aware during the recording that he was being taped -- can also be heard saying that he “respects” where Wilson-Raybould was coming from, but that Trudeau’s view was that “he’s not asking you to do anything inappropriate or to interfere. He’s asking you to use all the tools that you lawfully have at your disposal, Wernick said.

“You’re not just being attorney general, you’re the minister of justice and a cabinet [minister] – and, you have context within which you exercise your roles and your responsibilities. Like, I’m not seeing anything inappropriate here,” Wernick can be heard saying.

Chair of the committee, Anthony Housefather, has said that ""no redactions have been made"" to Wilson-Raybould’s submission by the committee, though there are portions of the submission that appear to have been redacted by Wilson-Raybould before it was submitted.

Wilson-Raybould, who is still a member of the Liberal caucus, provided this evidence to further bolster the testimony she gave to the committee on Feb. 27, and to respond to contradicting stories that others have offered since her appearance.

RECORDING OF CALL WITH WERNICK

During her initial testimony on this phone call, Wilson-Raybould said she was alone and took the call from home. She said that Wernick wanted to communicate where Trudeau was at regarding the file, and spoke about the company potentially moving its headquarters.

She quoted him saying “I think he is going to find a way to get it done, one way or another....So he is in that kind of mood, and I wanted you to be aware of it.”

When asked about this call during his follow up testimony, Wernick said that it was not his recollection of that call. “I did not wear a wire, record the conversation or take extemporaneous notes,” Wernick said.

“I never raised partisan considerations at any time. I reminded her repeatedly that she was the final decision-maker. I did not attempt to influence her decision. I was giving her relevant context about public interest considerations for a decision that was hers to take. I never suggested consequences for her,” Wernick testified.

The audio call largely confirmed Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, but also backed up Wernick’s assertion that he did not make any direct partisan considerations, like Quebec votes, which Wilson-Raybould has alleged she was consistently reminded of while the file was on her desk. Though he did cite a “rising anxiety” following job losses in Oshawa and tough times in Calgary.

In the recording you can hear her taking a deep breath before the conversation begins.

“I actually feel really uncomfortable having this conversation because it’s wrong,” Wilson-Raybould says on the tape.

“Does he understand the gravity of what this potentially could mean? This is not just about saving jobs. This is about interfering with one of our fundamental institutions. This is like, breaching a constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence,” Wilson-Raybould asks Wernick about Trudeau.

“Well I don’t think he sees it as that,” Wernick said, offering that it was a case of people talking past eachother.

“Well then nobody’s explaining that to him, Michael,” she replied.

The conversation ended with Wilson-Raybould saying that she was “waiting for the other shoe to drop,” and that ""I am not under any illusion how the prime minister has and gets things that he wants. I am just stuck doing the best job that I can.""

After she got off the call, the new evidence shows that she texted her then-chief of staff Jessica Prince that “the s**** is going to hit the fan.”

In her written submission Wilson-Raybould said she recorded the conversation because she “I had reason to believe that it was likely to be an inappropriate conversation.” She said she had never done this before, and has not done so since, recognizing that her recording of this conversation would otherwise be inappropriate

Law societies in Canada prohibit lawyers from knowingly recording conversations with clients without their knowledge, including the Law Society of Ontario, which Wilson-Raybould belongs to. In a statement the Society told CTV News that it “does not comment on possible breaches of the Rules of Professional Conduct.""

“I did this simply to ensure that my notes were accurate and given the ongoing pressure and attempts to interfere in this case, the nature of conversations that had occurred… and my strong suspicion that this matter would continue to escalate in even more inappropriate ways,” she wrote.

Her unprecedented decision to then make the recording public as part of her submission was done, she says, to allow Canadians to decide for themselves whether Wernick’s comments amount to the “veiled threats” that she alleges, and which he denies.

Wernick will soon be retiring from his job as Canada’s top public servant, a decision he says is because there ""is no path for me to have a relationship of mutual trust and respect with the leaders of the Opposition parties,"" after both the Conservatives and New Democrats have called for his resignation given his role in the still unfolding controversy.

COPIES OF TEXTS, EMAILS

In her initial hours-long committee appearance she offered an in-depth account of approximately 20 exchanges --10 phone calls and 10 meetings -- specifically on the SNC-Lavalin case. She also worked through a chronology of communications, ranging from in-person meetings and phone calls, to text messages and emails, from 11 senior staffers from the Prime Minister's Office, Privy Council Office and the finance minister's office.

Throughout her testimony, she cautioned there were limitations in her ability to speak broadly about the case because of the specifics of the waiver of solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had issued.

What she has handed over to the committee stays within the lines of what is permitted in the waiver, which includes any relevant information related to the case against SNC-Lavalin over her years-long tenure as attorney general.

Contained within the new documents are transcripts as well as screen shots of conversations she or Prince had. These include email exchanges with members of Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s office who the documents describe as being involved in the “mucking around” on the case.

In one it details a phone call Prince had with Morneau’s deputy chief of staff Justin To, in which he allegedly said that Wilson-Raybould had “a philosophical problem” with the entire promise of a deferred prosecution agreement, which remains a yet-to-be-used tool that this government passed through an omnibus budget bill last year.

“She hated it the whole time and wouldn't even use it if we could,"" To is quoted as saying to Prince, who said that was incorrect.

It also includes the conversation between Wilson-Raybould and Prince about a meeting Prince was asked to have with Trudeau’s chief of staff Katie Telford and then-principal adviser Gerald Butts.

In the instance of the meeting between Trudeau’s top two staffers and Prince, the text messages back up Wilson-Raybould’s telling of the interactions, and contradicts Butts saying during his March 6 committee appearance that “there was no urgency to attend that meeting.”

The meeting request was labeled “URGENT” the documents show.

Though the texts do not offer any evidence to dispute Butts’ saying that the recounting of the exchange with Prince was taken out of context and that he had a ""very different recollection of that meeting.""

MORE DETAILS ON RESIGNATION

Wilson-Raybould’s submission also shed new light on the series of events that led to her ultimately resigning from her role as veterans’ affairs minister, which she was shuffled into in January.

She had previously told the committee that she believed she was shuffled out of her job because of her refusal to change her mind about the case, but in the new statement Wilson-Raybould said she took Trudeau at his word when he insisted that wasn’t the case.

Though, at the time she says she made the decision to resign if her replacement decided to issue a directive to interfere in the SNC-Lavalin matter, “as this would confirm my suspicions as to the reason for the shuffle of me in particular.”

A deferred prosecution agreement has not been pursued by current Justice Minister and Attorney General David Lametti, though the government has made signals that they aren’t ruling it out.

She also confirmed that she was offered the Indigenous services job, as Butts had testified. She said she was shocked they’d offer it to her since she says she made it clear from the moment the Liberals started assembling a transition team, that she’d never be able to fill that role.

Wilson-Raybould also said that she had a series of meetings with Trudeau in Vancouver after the initial story broke, and in the days before she ended up resigning from cabinet on Feb. 12.

“The prime minister stated publicly when issues about the propriety of the government’s conduct in relation to the SNC matter arose that my ongoing presence in Cabinet spoke for itself. I resigned the next day and I trust my resignation also speaks for itself,” Wilson-Raybould says in her statement.

OPPOSITION RESPONSE

In the opening remarks of the new documents, Wilson-Raybould says her view is that the real issues at the heart of the SNC-Lavalin scandal are not about “how things are ‘experienced’” or considerations like caucus dynamics, political ambitions, or poll numbers. Rather she says it is about prosecutorial independence, the rule of law, and Canada’s democratic institutions.

She also offers that she thinks all sides should be working across party lines to fix what she calls “fissures and weaknesses” in Canadian institutions, and that she looks forward to a future where “we truly do politics differently,” seeming to lean on a phrase Trudeau regularly touted during the 2015 campaign.

The opposition wanted to invite Wilson-Raybould back to testify again -- something she was open to -- but Liberal MPs on the House Justice Committee shut down the study, saying that they’d heard all they needed to.

Wilson-Raybould also offered that while she has nothing further to add to the formal process, if she was asked or compelled to participate in a future investigation or parliamentary process, she would.

In a statement reacting to the new information, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called it “concrete evidence that proves Justin Trudeau led a campaign to politically interfere in SNC-Lavalin’s criminal prosecution.” He called the entire affair “corruption on top of corruption on top of corruption.”

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said the evidence was “so compelling and well-documented” that an independent public inquiry is needed.

“The PMO has tried to spin this as a miscommunication or personal disagreement… The former Attorney General repeatedly made clear to the Prime Minister and those around him that their inappropriate actions would be seen as political interference – and they ignored her,” Singh said in a statement.

Since her testimony, Trudeau has faced calls to resign, the House of Commons agenda has been largely usurped by opposition-prompted procedural moves, and several other high-profile officials have resigned amid insistence that nothing improper occurred.

The PMO’s statement claims that “all facts are on the table now,” and that the Liberal government is focused on “moving forward as a team on the issues that matter to Canadians and governing in the best interests of the country.”

All eyes are set to be on Parliament Hill when MPs return on Monday, particularly when Liberal MPs convene for their weekly caucus meeting on Wednesday. There, it is likely that the developments that have occurred on this file over the last few days will come up, as some of her colleagues are expected to get up and call for her removal.

Our new cellphone…. to deny all of this means we’re either blind or we’re deceiving ourselves.” The ZACP should, therefore, have no problems ...","Editor’s note: The opinions in this article are the author’s, as published by our content partner, and do not represent the views of MSN or Microsoft.

The Capitalist Party of South Africa have tied their colours to an almost paleo-conservative ideological trend embodied mainly by the tea-party movement in the USA, by Donald Trump, Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, Viktor Orban of Hungary, and more extreme right-wing movements in Europe – to whom freedom has a very unique meaning.

Last week saw the launch of the Capitalist Party of South Africa (ZACP). Say that acronym fast and you may be forgiven for sounding as if you’re referring to the South African Communist Party. The Capitalist Party also registered with the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), and would like to go to Parliament.

The launch of the ZACP is at once audacious and courageous (at least for its nomenclature), honest (for its unflinching ideological statement), curious (for its historical naiveté), irrelevant (everyone in Parliament does capitalism in some way or another – even the Economic Freedom Fighters), and a little amusing. Let us deal with the part that’s amusing first.

Anyone who has followed electoral politics, especially in the United States, may have heard persistent iterations of statements like “I am not a politician” which is usually followed by assinities like “I’m going to Washington to drain the swamp”. This is usually associated with more conservative or right-wing politicians and their followers. The claim draws on the idea that candidates who are “not politicians” have better “business sense” and would, therefore, deliver better outcomes. One Trump loyalist summed this up in the following way.

“What appeals to me about …. Donald Trump, is the fact that he’s not part of the political system. He’s a businessman, like myself… I think it’s high time that we have someone in the White House that can understand the way the business world operates and make it part of the governmental part of our country to make it operate. We can operate our government like a business.”

This anti-establishment tendency (which has echoes on ersatz leftist parties like the EFF and the Black First Land First movement) defines populist rightist politicians like Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, Trump and Italy’s Matteo Salvini, who are “sent to Parliament to drain the swamp.”

We have the position, then, where leaders of the ZACP, notably the businessman Kanthan Pillay, are proud of the fact that they are not politicians, that they have no political baggage, but expect people to vote for them so that they can become politicians. Hard to figure that one out. It is amusing, though.

We’re capitalists and we’re proud of it

Extending the “we are not capitalist” (ergo we know better) meme, Pillay pointed out last week that “politicians have turned capitalism into a swearword. They make us guilty for working hard to improve our lives. And this guilt allows them to steal money from hard-working families and use the money for corruption.”

There are way too many EFF-isms (especially the logical fallacies and emotive appeals on behalf of “hard-working families”) in that expression. But, there is a skosh of truth in Pillay’s sentiment. Capitalism does tend to be something of a swearword for its association with greed, for its reproduction of inequality and for the way it has (historically) exploited labour, communities, biospheres, eco-systems and the environment, in general.

Capitalist innovation has, of course, given us great technological achievements. But let’s play with a counterfactual here. We cannot say, with absolute certainty, that we would not have had smartphones or satellite navigation systems in a non-capitalist society. Consider if only for amusement (but in all seriousness) the Soviet Union’s pioneering achievements in rocket and space exploration. (See the books, In the Shadow of the Moon: A Challenging Journey to Tranquility. Into That Silent Sea, Trailblazers of the Space Era, 1961-1965 by Francis French and Colin Burgess). I make this point only to demonstrate that capitalism cannot make a totalising claim about progress – technological or otherwise. This is not an endorsement of Soviet Communism.

Capitalism Resuscitation, not the other CPR

The ZACP’s creation, and its apparent CPR (capitalism resuscitation, that is) comes at an interesting time in history. There are increasingly fewer scholars and thinkers around the world – those of note, anyway – who believe that capitalism, as we know it, has any future. You do not have to be a Marxist determinist to believe that capitalism is doomed. The only thing that remains uncertain is whether what will follow will be a Mary Shelley beast, a post-capitalist technology utopia, or a more dystopian world…. In the meantime, a great deal of work is going into preparing for whatever may come.

“Capitalism as we know it is over…. We’re transitioning rapidly to a radically different global economy, due to our increasingly unsustainable exploitation of the planet’s environmental resources and the shift to less efficient energy sources,” Nafeez Ahmed explained in a report on how scientists at the United Nations are “preparing for the end of capitalism”.

That the ZACP wants to apply CPR to the dying monster is cute, though, and a little amusing. If only because everyone but the ZACP is preparing for a post-capitalism world.

We’re all capitalists, now

That sub-heading is misleading. It’s a reference, in part, to a statement, “we are all capitalists now”, by Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of the central bank, to the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee in 2006. (If you have a subscription, see the report by Guy de Jonquières, “Comrades, set the renminbi free” published in the Financial Timeson 15 May 2006). It is also an acknowledgement that everything in our lives in shaped by or dominated by capitalism. The following is an extract of a column published in Business Day on 26 September 2018.

“Voluntarily or involuntarily, we are all complicit in sustaining capitalism. The clothes we wear. The food we eat. Our houses. Our children’s education. The books we read. The highlighter we use to mark those vital passages. The lipstick we wear. The stent in our artery. The bank where we save our money. The medication we buy to loosen that phlegm. The burial policy. The life insurance. The retirement annuity. The satellite TV that is piped into our homes. The microfibre that holds together the shirt of our favourite football team. The cigarettes we smoke. The ATM. Our social media platforms. Our new cellphone…. to deny all of this means we’re either blind or we’re deceiving ourselves.”

The ZACP should, therefore, have no problems in Parliament – should they get any seats in the legislature. There is, of course, the performance anti-capitalism that the EFF will, no doubt, provide. This, too, would be amusing if the EFF and BLF were not so very dangerous.

The Fallacies of Freedom

The ZACP have tied their colours to a paleo-conservative ideological trend embodied mainly by the tea-party movement, by Trump and Bolsonaro, and by the more extreme right-wing movement in Europe – to whom freedom has a very unique meaning. See, for instance, the American Freedom Defence Initiative led by Pamela Geller, recipient of the Guardian of Freedom award by Federation of Republican Women in the USA.

The ZACP glibly tosses into its gruel the phrase liberté, égalité, fraternité (French for liberty, equality and fraternity). The first point that can be made here is that liberty can come into confrontation with equality – especially in a country with extreme levels of inequality that are not “natural” outcomes. Liberty really means you can be as free as you wish, and free to be better or worse off than the next person, without any sense of compunction. Then there is the problem with knowing very little about big things…. Liberté, égalité, fraternité is the national motto of France, a fairly democratic republic with high levels of prosperity, democracy and trust (though imperfect), but it is also the motto of Haiti.

If you will indulge the diversion, dear reader, the following passage sums up just how desperate life in Haiti is, and how the best of mottos and slogans mean very little in the face of natural or human disasters.

“Haiti has had slavery, revolution, debt, deforestation, corruption, exploitation and violence… Now it has poverty, illiteracy, overcrowding, no infrastructure, environmental disaster and large areas without the rule of law.”

I guess the point that needs to be raised is that you cannot wish freedom into existence. And then there is the ZACP’s economic policy, or what is apparent. It rests on things like “free markets” and free trade, limited government and deregulation. Here one wants to remain distant, but intellectually honest (without pretending to be “objective”). The ZACP, like the Free Market Foundation and other liberals, “classic” or otherwise, would help their case if they provided evidence of where or when over the past, say, 120 years there has been a place or time when markets and trade were absolutely free. The last time I recall the only country that had near complete free markets and no government intervention was Somalia.

In sum, then, the Capitalists Party is coming. Everyone in Parliament should probably pretend to be busy, because non-politicians want to become politicians and bring fully costed practical solutions to South Africa’s myriad problems.

Ever since the news broke on March 15 of two consecutive mass shootings at the Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre in Christchurch, New Zealand, corporate media has been determined to establish that suspect Brenton Tarrant acted alone in the terrorist attacks that took the lives of 50 innocent Muslim worshippers and wounded 50 others.

While mainstream media has been predictably eager to parade the tragedy as another chapter in the wave of rising Islamophobia and right-wing extremism globally, they have put equal effort into conscientiously avoiding any evidence that contradicts the ‘lone wolf’ theory they decided on in the initial hours following the first mass shooting in New Zealand since 1997.

Whenever terrorism is committed by Arabs or Muslims, the fourth estate is usually anxious to speculate whether or not the suspect is connected to a larger radical syndicate. However, the same scrutiny is seldom applied to white nationalists like Tarrant.

In fact, they are even hesitant to label it ‘terrorism’ at all, with everyone from The Daily Telegraph to the fanatical Zionist Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News settling for the choice words ‘mass shooting.’ While Tarrant denies being part of any group in his public declaration, he does hint that he is part of a broader extremist network:

I am not a direct member of any organization or group, though I have donated to many nationalist groups and have interacted with many more. No group ordered my attack, I make the decision myself. Though I did contact the reborn Knights Templar for a blessing in support of the attack, which was given.”

As many have noted, the “Knights Templar” is the name of an anti-Muslim militant group that another infamous right-wing terrorist, Anders Behring Breivik, claimed to belong to. During the 2011 Norway attacks, Breivik targeted a government building in the city of Oslo and a youth camp of the ruling Labour party on the island of Utøya in a sequential car bombing and mass shooting that killed a total of 77 people.

However, the media and prosecutors in Breivik’s trial were insistent that the group was fictional and the only possibility was that he was an ‘army of one’ while suffering from a psychiatric disorder, another trait that is apparently only applicable to white-skinned terrorists. There was no serious inquiry into whether he was part of a larger nexus, even though he had direct contact with groups like the English Defense League (EDL), the British far right Islamophobic group led by neo-fascist agitator Tommy Robinson.

Breivik was portrayed as a fundamentalist Christian but was curiously a member of the Norwegian Order of Freemasons, an organization with a history of ties to the espionage world and susceptible to infiltration because of its inherent secrecy. The original Knights Templar, or “Templars,” were a Christian army founded in the 10th century who initially shielded pilgrims voyaging to the Holy Land and later fought against Muslims during the Crusades while the name is drawn from the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.

What has been downplayed by the yellow press is the specific brand of Islamophobic extremism that was the basis of Tarrant’s attacks. His ideology is revealed in a 73-page manifesto, entitled “The Great Replacement” in reference to the ‘white genocide’ theory held by white nationalist identitarians, which he dispatched less than ten minutes prior to the ambush in emails to several media outlets and Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s office.

While the corporate press is correct that Tarrant and Breivik clearly follow the practices of the anti-Islam xenophobic movement on the rise in Europe, North America and now Oceania, the key element they have deliberately avoided mentioning is a strong collective affinity for the state of Israel.

The coverage of Christchurch has repeated the same pattern displayed following the 2011 Norway attacks where the distinguishing characteristic of the extremism both culprits adhere to is of a staunchly pro-Zionist variety which has been decidedly overlooked. In the eight years between the two attacks, the pro-Israel European right has only augmented in size.

In his manifesto, Brenton Tarrant even boasted the unverified claim to have had “brief contact with Knight Justiciar Breivik” while taking “true inspiration” from him. His Norwegian idol had his own 1,500 page manifesto where Israel was approvingly name-dropped nearly 400 times while he declared:

So let us fight together with Israel, with our Zionist brothers against all anti-Zionists, against all cultural Marxists/multiculturalists.”

The combination of far right nationalism and support for Israel may seem like an unlikely combination, but it is an ideology shared by most of the Islamophobic and anti-immigrant political parties throughout Europe that have performed impressively well in European Parliament elections. These include Hungary’s Fidesz, the Italian League and Five Star Movement, the Flemish Flaams Belang, Poland’s Law and Justice, Belgian People’s Party, the Progress Party of Norway (of which Breivik was a member), True Finns Party, France’s National Rally, Alternative for Deutschland, and many others.

It is likely that Tarrant, like Breivik, is not anti-semitic and actually views Jews as ‘allies’ in a civilizational crusade against Islam. Just as Israel has helped orchestrate the US wars in the Middle East against its enemies that has contributed to the mass influx of refugees seeking asylum in the West, it has fostered the Islamophobic backlash to it by supporting the growing far right movement that is ascendant.

Following the tragedy in Christchurch, it was revealed that 28-year old Tarrant had traveled extensively throughout Europe, the Middle East and Asia, including to Afghanistan, Pakistan and even North Korea. The year prior, he also visited Israel for nine days, just as his fellow Christian Zionist Breivik had done several times prior to 2011. Tarrant’s journey in Europe included a stop in Ukraine, a hotbed of neo-Nazi activity and as it happens during the massacre he donned the SS wolf’s hook symbol used by the right wing paramilitary group Azov Battalion to which Israel has provided weapons support in its fight against pro-Russian separatists.

The blend of such considerable travel activity while stockpiling a cache of semi-automatic firearms with a digital footprint espousing his extremist views online makes the likelihood that Tarrant managed to remain under the radar of the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service (SIS) difficult to believe. It is especially doubtful they would be unable to detect him considering he was reportedly interviewed by New Zealand police prior to obtaining his firearms license in 2017.

Judging by the Facebook live-streamed video of the massacre shot by the suspect himself wearing a GoPro head-mounted camera that resembled a first-person shooter video game shows he was no amateur and possibly professionally trained as a militant. Given his extensive travel and the apparent expertise used to carry out the attacks, there are many legitimate questions about how his ventures were sponsored and whether he had accomplices.

Police found undetonated car bombs in addition to his arsenal and believe he was planning on carrying out a third attack with them. What was he doing in his travels? Was he really able to finance everything alone using crypto-currency investments as purported by the media? He could very well have been a patsy in a larger plot or received support from abroad. For instance, from a certain national intelligence service whose notorious motto is “for by cunning stratagems, you wage war.”

Mossad covert operations have been exposed several times over the years violating New Zealand’s sovereignty and international law which caused a series of diplomatic rows between the two countries. Most recently was in 2011 following a 6.2 magnitude earthquake in Christchurch which caused significant damage to the city and killed 185 people, coincidentally the very same week as the attacks in Norway by Anders Breivik.

Incredibly, a stone structure of a building collapsed onto a van during the earthquake which killed a man inside who turned out to be an Israeli national. His death accidentally unearthed a ring of Mossad agents after the man was discovered with multiple fake passports and USB flash drives which contained confidential data believed to have been illegally downloaded from the New Zealand police’s national computer system.

The other agents in the Israeli sleeper cell were able to flee the country less than a day after his body was discovered, probably to avoid the fallout that occurred after an earlier incident in the country just a few years prior. In 2004, two Israeli men who turned out to be Mossad agents were arrested trying to obtain fraudulent passports and travel documentation that included stealing the identity of a quadriplegic. The two men were subsequently jailed for six months for engaging in criminal enterprise.

Mossad seemed to have developed a habit of revealing themselves in light of the infamous arrest of five of its agents in Secaucus, New Jersey on the morning of September 11th, 2001 by the FBI who were tipped off that a group of men were observed suspiciously dancing and celebrating while watching the WTC towers ablaze and collapsing across the Hudson River.

The “dancing Israelis” were found with $5,000 in cash which raised suspicions while their vehicle was traced to a shady moving company called Urban Moving Systems that was suspected to be a front for an intelligence operation after their headquarters was abandoned and its owner, Dominick Suter, immediately fled to Israel following their apprehension. During their two month detention, the CIA intervened and halted the probe while the agents were subsequently deported in a deal with the Israeli government for overstaying their visas but not before it was confirmed that at least two of the men were intelligence officers and no ordinary moving company employees.

The world was briefly reminded of this mysterious case when Donald Trump as a presidential candidate in 2016 made the wild exaggeration that on 9/11 he had personally observed “thousands of Muslims” celebrating the destruction of the Twin Towers across the river in New Jersey. It is likely that Trump mixed up two different reports from 9/11, one of Reuters footage widely circulated by major networks of a small group of Arabs in East Jerusalem celebrating the attacks and the reports about the Israelis arrested in New Jersey who were initially believed to have been of “Middle Eastern appearance” and descent.

One wonders if Trump would accurately recall his other observations that morning now that he is in the service of his Saudi and Israeli masters. Needless to say, this widely suppressed story which should have been front page news led many to rightly suspect there was prior knowledge and even direct involvement among Israeli intelligence in the 9/11 attacks, along with a trove of other evidence.

The New Jersey cell were also in possession of foreign passports. Mossad has typically used fake passports, including that of Australians and Kiwis, regularly for its clandestine operations and carrying out assassinations like the 2010 targeted killing of Hamas official Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in Dubai which one of the spies apprehended in New Zealand, Zev Barkan, was involved in. After the arrest of the two spooks in New Zealand in 2004, the government imposed diplomatic sanctions against Israel and temporarily severed high-level contacts between the two countries in what became a significant diplomatic rift. WikiLeaks diplomatic cables revealed that the U.S. was not at all pleased.

Relations had returned to normal between the countries until December 2016 when along with Malaysia, Senegal, Venezuela and others, New Zealand co-sponsored the controversial United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 which condemned Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territories during the last months of the Obama administration. The same motion briefly became mired in the Trump-Russia investigation when former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn pled guilty to lying to the FBI about lobbying activities related to the resolution during the transition between administrations on behalf of Israel.

The Trump White House has since proven to be the most fanatically Zionist presidency since the foundation of the Jewish state in 1948. Over the years, New Zealand has shown a willingness to stand up to Jerusalem and its brazen disregard for international law that other nations could learn from. Despite being a small nation, it has played an important role in pro-Palestinian activism and the prospect of Palestinian statehood just as it did in protesting South African Apartheid in the 1980s.

In 2018, when New Zealand-born popular musician Lorde canceled a concert in Tel Aviv in solidarity with the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, she became the target of vicious Zionist smear campaign which saw right-wing Trumpist Rabbi Schmuley Boteach take out a full-page ad in The Washington Post denouncing her as a bigot while a $13,000 lawsuit was filed by the Mossad-linked Shurat HaDin lawfare NGO. Meanwhile, unlike Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Jacinda Ardern has been critical of the Trump administration’s move of the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, stating it undermines the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.

New Zealand’s relatively even-handed foreign policy has likely rattled the Zionists and their far right Islamophobic counterparts in the West and it is possible that it is viewed as a threat to the interests of Israel and the U.S. The feasibly manufactured terrorist attack against New Zealand has greatly disrupted the small country, a state which in 2018 had its lowest homicide rate in 40 years and averages well below 100 murders per year, making this attack an extremely rare occurrence for the peaceful country.

In light of the attacks on the mosques in Christchurch, it could now end up acquiring the police state model of the U.S. and Israel as part of the global ‘War on Terror.’ The country immediately issued a ban on semiautomatic weapons following the tragedy in a disturbing rollback of civil liberties while engaging in an unprecedented censorship effort to criminalize sharing and possession of Tarrant’s manifesto and video. Prior to Breivik’s perpetration of the attacks in Norway, there had been significant political tensions between Oslo and Jerusalem in the months leading up to the violence due to Norway’s intent to recognize a Palestinian state and the circumstances in relations between New Zealand and Israel prior to Christchurch is eerily reminiscent.

Israel has a storied history of being a state sponsor of international terrorism as well as the use of ‘false flag’ operations to achieve its political objectives, most notably in the 1954 Lavon Affair, codenamed Operation Susannah, where the Aman branch of its military intelligence services recruited Egyptian nationals to commit bombings to be blamed on the Muslim Brotherhood in order to maintain desired British military presence in Egypt.

It continues such cloak-and-dagger tactics to this day with the use of terror proxies such as the Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK) and Mojahedin-e-Khalq (MEK) to undermine Iran, as well as the arming and funding of al-Qaeda affiliated Syrian jihadist groups against the Assad government. If it is willing to co-sponsor radical Islamists with its ally Saudi Arabia to attack their mutual regional enemies, now that the ruling Likud Party has made strange bedfellows with far right Islamophobes in the West it is within the realm of possibility it would continue to do the same especially when the victims are Arab or Muslim.

Regardless of whether or not there turns out to be any Mossad fingerprints discovered on the Christchurch shootings, if the world is serious about confronting the emerging far right internationally it must be willing to accurately diagnose the phenomenon. One of its most distinctive attributes is its Christian Zionism and a shared belief that the Bible gives Israel evidential right to Palestinian land and that Jews are inherently non-indigenous to Europe.

The ever-expanding colonization of the West Bank and Gaza has solidified Israel’s nationalist foundations, especially now that Arabic has been removed as a second official language and the passing of the 2018 Nationality Law defining Israel as an ethno-nationalist state with Arabs officially second-class citizens. If Israel did not directly participate in the 9/11 attacks by infiltrating the al-Qaeda cell in Hamburg, Germany and directing the airplane hijackings as many legitimately suspect, it has certainly facilitated the U.S. wars in the Middle East against its regional enemies and now it is nurturing the Islamophobic far right in the West hostile to the flood of displaced refugees fleeing them.

Israeli policy has principally benefited from all this but one can only expect the hasbaric retaliation of ‘anti-Semitism’ smears like those against UK Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and U.S. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar of Minnesota for pointing this out. In the meantime, the Russiagate hoax has deflected attention away from Jerusalem toward Moscow in regards to foreign cultivation of the growing far right nationalist movement in the West. One hopes the recent bust of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report will put some of the distraction to rest and shift the speculation toward Israel where it belongs.

Finally, the political confusion of zealots like Tarrant needs to be addressed as entirely predictable instead of as unintended consequences of the War on Terror and the financial crisis. Recently, 2020 Democratic U.S. Presidential candidate Andrew Yang became the subject of establishment-led smears simply for acknowledging verifiable facts about declining birth-rates of white Americans where he was vilified as adjoining with the views of those like Tarrant. Yet these statistics designated by race that Yang recognized are expressions of the results of class conflict while genuine anger is being misdirected toward immigrants instead of capital and its never-ending changes in labor demands.

This is the cycle which must be broken if this holy war between the West and Islam stirred up by Zionists or what the orientialist Samuel Huntington called the ‘clash of civilizations’ is to end. If not, we cannot only expect the U.S. empire to continue its downward slide and its fear of a multipolar world to culminate in an internecine that will turn the whole world into a tragedy like Christchurch.

That was true as far as the crisis that has been dominating Canadian politics is concerned.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s treatment of an Indigenous protester served to highlight the decades-long plight of Grassy Narrows, an issue of far greater importance than the SNC-Lavalin affair, Chantal Hébert writes. ( JOHN WOODS / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

Over the six weeks of the SNC-Lavalin saga, I have been curious as to its root cause and saddened by the deterioration of the relationship between the prime minister and two of the talented women he recruited in the last election. I have also been somewhat bewildered by the fact that those who seem to have arrived at the unshakable conclusion that Justin Trudeau is guilty of mortal sins against the justice system have often been the most vociferous in arguing that Canadians do not yet have all the facts they need to make up their minds. But this week, for the first time, I did feel real anger and, notwithstanding my answer on the CBC, this column is partly written in anger.

I was a junior radio news editor in the Toronto newsroom of Radio-Canada when I first heard about the mercury poisoning of the Indigenous communities of Grassy Narrows and White Dog. The story surfaced in the early 1970s, a time when Canada was still relatively innocent about damages to the environment. Ontario’s ministry of the environment was only a few years old, and the federal government would not have a stand-alone department until the end of that decade. The notion that entire communities could be contaminated with a deadly poison because of air they breathed, the water they drank or, in this case, the fish they depended on for food, was foreign to many of us. The Japanese though already had a name for what ailed the two Northwestern Ontario communities. They called it Minamata disease from the name of the bay whose mercury-contaminated waters had devastated the health of the communities that fished them. When Japanese experts first visited Grassy Narrows and Whitedog and found evidence that a similar health crisis was underway, then-Ontario Natural Resources minister Leo Bernier dismissed them as “Japanese troubadours.”

More than 40 years have elapsed since the July morning when I edited reports about the mercury contamination of the English-Wabigoon river system. I am confounded by the notion that the issue is as alive today as it was then, and by what that says about how this country fails its Indigenous peoples. Canada has had more than half-a-dozen prime ministers since the situation came to light under Pierre Trudeau’s government, and more than 20 ministers of the environment and Indian Affairs.

Over the same period, Ontario has been governed by parties of three political stripes, including some who professed deep commitments to the environment and/or to the welfare of the First Nations. And still those Indigenous communities struggle with the consequences of mercury poisoning and have to fight for every inch of government help they get. For years, they were told the river would eventually clean itself. It did not. It was only two years ago that a medical centre was promised to the community. The CBC and the Star, to name just two media organizations, have devoted journalistic resources to document and keep this story in the public eye for decades. And so, when the prime minister — with the general approval of the well-heeled party donors he was rewarding with his presence on Wednesday night — sarcastically dismissed an Indigenous rights activist who had paid her way into his fundraising venue to call his attention to the enduring plight of the people of Grassy Narrows, his performance was beyond words. Trudeau did not even have the excuse — used by leader of the opposition Andrew Scheer to explain why he let patently false assertions connecting Hillary Clinton to a child sex ring stand at a recent town hall — of not having heard the protest or known what it was about. The demonstrator unfurled a banner in his face. Trudeau’s behaviour was out of character. He has since apologized publicly. Read more: Trudeau apologizes for sarcastically dismissing Grassy Narrows demonstrators at Liberal fundraiser in Toronto His put-down could be construed as a symptom of the impact the SNC-Lavalin affair is having on his performance. There is no doubt the prime minister has increasingly looked anchorless over the course of the ongoing crisis. Trudeau coupled his apology with a commitment to turn more of his attention to the Grassy Narrows predicament. Maybe he will. But he is hardly the first to make promises. Would it make a difference if we expended as much energy on keeping his feet to that fire as we have on pursing every SNC-Lavalin angle? I don’t know. But I am somewhat thankful to the prime minister for having reminded me that some matters are more worth being profoundly angry about than others.

© Stephen MacGillivray Prime Minister Justin Trudeau talks to media in St. Stephen, N.B., Thursday. He apologized Thursday for a remark made Wednesday night.

Not since Laureen Harper told an Indigenous rights protester at a cat video festival in 2014, “Tonight we’re here for homeless cats” has a member of the Canadian political establishment screwed up so badly in the face of an ordinary person wanting to be heard.

In case you don’t know what I’m talking about because you’re too absorbed in the Prime Minister’s other scandal (hint: it starts with an S and ends with an N), let me explain: Justin Trudeau was speaking at an event at a luxury Toronto hotel Wednesday night when a protester holding a large banner interrupted him.

“People in Grassy Narrows are suffering from mercury poisoning,” she called out, referencing the fact that people in Grassy Narrows — an Ontario First Nation — are indeed suffering from mercury poisoning because in the 1960s a paper company began polluting the river there. Many maintain, this protester included, that the government response to the crisis has been abysmally slow and insufficient. “You committed to addressing this crisis,” the protester said. But before she could continue, security approached her and escorted her away. And as they did the PM spoke.

“Thank you for your donation tonight,” he said. “I really appreciate it.”

It was in every way, the public speaking equivalent of kicking somebody when they’re already down.

And yet, laughter and applause followed — not from the protesters who presumably don’t think there’s anything funny about government inability to address a poisoning crisis, but from audience members who paid handsomely to be there, and whose experience with mercury poisoning is most likely limited to reading in a magazine that you can get it if you eat too much sushi.

Today they are eating their applause for a PM who is in apology mode.

Grassy Narrows chief questions delay on promised mercury testing

The backlash to Trudeau’s sarcastic response was swift from every source: from activists, from conservative voices on social media (who surprise, surprise, suddenly seem to have a vested interest in environmental protections), and from regular people of all stripes.

On Thursday, the PM apologized before the press. In his own words:

“As I think you all know from time to time I’m in situations where people are expressing concerns or protesting a particular thing and I always try to be respectful and always try to engage with them in a positive way. That’s how I believe a democracy should function and I didn’t do that last night. Last night I lacked respect towards them and I apologize for that.”

Trudeau said he’d reimburse the protesters for the donation they made that granted them access to the fundraiser and he announced plans to revisit the Grassy Narrows crisis with his staff.

It seems like the least he can do but hopefully it produces some positive change (in this lifetime) for the protesters who told him off.

None of this, however, is positive for Justin Trudeau, a man heading into an election, whose approval rating, according to a new Ipsos poll conducted for Global News, has dipped below U.S. president Donald Trump’s. After this week’s events I won’t be surprised if we see another dip.

Laureen Harper’s response (“That’s a great cause but that’s another night ... tonight we’re here for homeless cats”) to a protester who wanted to know why she appeared to care more about felines than she did about missing and murdered Indigenous women was inappropriate. But it wasn’t smug.

On Wednesday night Trudeau was smug. To be precise, he was as smug as they come.

And it’s hard to recover from smug. In fact, much like a cat, once “smug” is out of the bag — you can’t stuff it back in. Once people see it on your face and hear it in your voice, they have a hard time seeing and hearing anything else when they look at you. And unlike SNC-Lavalin — a scandal that is complicated — “Smug PM” is very simple.

This could be Justin Trudeau’s Mitt Romney moment.

In 2012 in advance of the US presidential election, American magazine Mother Jones released surreptitiously recorded footage of Romney talking about Democratic voters in disparaging terms.

As Andrew Scheer stares at his opposite across the parliamentary aisle, the Conservative Party leader must scarcely but regularly believe his great and good fortune.

Sheer — really just days ago, according to national pollsters — was approaching the starting gate for the run-up to the Oct. 21 federal vote with an attraction to voters similar to that of an unadorned paper bag under a Christmas tree.

Scheer played Clydesdale to Justin Trudeau's butterfly. With little flash in a world of cyber soundbites, Scheer was dealing with yesterday's story while Trudeau was writing the next day's headlines.

Then a series of letters charged into Trudeau's life, and almost poetically in triplicate: JWR, SNC, PMO.

SNC and JWR became Twitter favourites sans-hashtag, because that wasn't necessary. SNC and JWR have chased Trudeau and his PMO into a series of ever-changing and unsustainable defensive positions since the day Trudeau first announced publicly the original Globe and Mail article on SNC, PMO and JWR was ""false.""



But it wasn't then and isn't now.

Speak the words ""justice committee"" to Canadians anywhere in this land. The default response? An eye-roll.



Drop ""9,000 jobs"" into an engaging conversation and on autopilot the talk switches to Trudeau, SNC, PMO and JWR.

Spice up the chatter? Add Butts and Wernick, or Philpott and Caesar-Chavannes.

Trudeau is navigating with a damaged rudder. Challenged by protesters Wednesday evening at a Liberal fundraiser in Toronto who sought to draw the prime minister's attention to mercury poisoning in First Nations communities, Trudeau's silver spoon clanked to the floor. ""Thank you for your donation,"" he said.

An apology followed the next morning.

An IPSOS poll for Global News reveals Trudeau now has a lower approval rating than Donald Trump. Scheer and the Conservative Party of Canada, meanwhile, own a significant and steady lead.

Patrick Brazeau on March 31, 2012, Trudeau defied all the critics who said that this then shaggy-haired, backbench MP wasn’t tough enough to be a political contender.

Seven years ago this weekend, Justin Trudeau walked into a boxing ring and changed a lot of people’s minds about him.

The fact that Wilson-Raybould and some of the protesters are Indigenous — like Brazeau — puts a nearly literary circle around this seventh anniversary of the famous boxing match.

This comes in the same week, let’s remember, when Trudeau also sarcastically dismissed Grassy Narrows protesters at one of his fundraisers with a flippant “thank you for your donation.”

That’s hardly Trudeau’s image problem today, to say the least. The latest barrage of evidence from Jody Wilson-Raybould , backing up her claims to have suffered “undue pressure” from Trudeau and his advisers, reveals a PM who seemed all too willing to go a few rounds with a strong-willed justice minister — and win.

It’s almost too neat a coincidence for fiction, let alone non-fiction. The very relationship that Trudeau has said is the most important one to him and his government keeps transforming him into a tough guy in the public eye — in good and not-so-good ways.

The Prime Minister does not actually appear in the ring with Wilson-Raybould in all the documents and phone records she released as further evidence to the Commons justice committee on Friday afternoon.

Seven years ago, he needed that edge. Today, a little more than six months away from an election, Trudeau does not.

Trudeau flexes his muscle instead mainly through the clerk of the privy council, Michael Wernick, whose voice on the phone recording speaks volumes about the tone of conversations around SNC-Lavalin.

“Alright…um… well I am going to have to report back to him before he leaves,” Wernick tells Wilson-Raybould in the Dec. 19 phone conversation. “He is in a pretty firm frame of mind about this so…I am a bit worried.”

Actually, the recording reveals that if anyone was feeling pressure in this whole affair, it might well have been Wernick himself, caught between two very strong personalities, each determined that they were in the right about whether to give SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution agreement.

Wernick recently announced his early retirement, another knockout casualty of SNC-Lavalin.

Wilson-Raybould’s new evidence serves to underline her contention, made in explosive testimony last month, that the Prime Minister was far from casually interested in the future of SNC-Lavalin. As it’s described in some detail, Trudeau and his team just kept punching home the point, from September, all the way to February.

Without saying explicitly the contents of the conversations they held before she quit cabinet in mid-February, Wilson-Raybould hints that Trudeau remained set on the path to grant that DPA, with or without her, and having already shuffled her out of the way to veterans affairs.

The former justice minister says she had decided to resign at the time of that shuffle “if the new Attorney General decided to issue a direction in the SNC-Lavalin matter as that would confirm my suspicions as to the reason for the shuffle of me in particular.” When the story broke out into the open in early February, Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould talked multiple times, she says, “and I trust my resignation speaks for itself.”

This story isn’t over yet and no one is entirely sure how it ends, for Trudeau, Wilson-Raybould or the Liberal party to which they both still belong. It is not even clear at the moment who is administering the knockout blows. Wilson-Raybould is out of cabinet, but Trudeau is back on his heels too, apparently unable to end this match.

It’s worth remembering the coda to the Brazeau boxing match, which came the day after the event. As part of this boxing match for charity, Trudeau and Brazeau had agreed beforehand that the victor would get to cut the loser’s hair.

When it came time for Trudeau to publicly shear the ponytailed Brazeau in the Commons foyer, he opted to make a minor clip with the scissors, barely visible. Trudeau would confide later that there was no way this son of Pierre Trudeau was going to be photographed cutting the hair of one of Canada’s Indigenous people.

Again, that anniversary brings us full circle to today, with Trudeau’s toughness on display, but also his hesitancy to land a blow after the knockout. He has yet to reply to Wilson-Raybould’s allegations or evidence with anything except careful, minimal words and gestures.

Trudeau may need to do more and say more in the coming days. Seven years ago, he was fighting to prove he was a contender. Now he has to settle this fight to prove he’s still in contention.

Ontario residents describe the ravages of mercury exposure

The backlash to Trudeau's sarcastic response was swift from every source: from activists, from conservative voices on social media (who surprise, surprise, suddenly seem to have a vested interest in environmental protections), and from regular people of all stripes.

On Thursday, the PM apologized before the press. In his own words:

""As I think you all know from time to time I'm in situations where people are expressing concerns or protesting a particular thing and I always try to be respectful and always try to engage with them in a positive way. That's how I believe a democracy should function and I didn't do that last night. Last night I lacked respect towards them and I apologize for that.""

Trudeau said he'd reimburse the protesters for the donation they made that granted them access to the fundraiser and he announced plans to revisit the Grassy Narrows crisis with his staff.

It seems like the least he can do but hopefully it produces some positive change (in this lifetime) for the protesters who told him off.

None of this, however, is positive for Justin Trudeau, a man heading into an election, whose approval rating, according to a new Ipsos poll conducted for Global News, has dipped below U.S. president Donald Trump's. After this week's events I won't be surprised if we see another dip.

Laureen Harper's response (""That's a great cause but that's another night ... tonight we're here for homeless cats"") to a protester who wanted to know why she appeared to care more about felines than she did about missing and murdered Indigenous women was inappropriate. But it wasn't smug.

On Wednesday night Trudeau was smug. To be precise, he was as smug as they come.

And it's hard to recover from smug. In fact, much like a cat, once ""smug"" is out of the bag — you can't stuff it back in. Once people see it on your face and hear it in your voice, they have a hard time seeing and hearing anything else when they look at you. And unlike SNC-Lavalin — a scandal that is complicated — ""Smug PM"" is very simple.

This could be Justin Trudeau's Mitt Romney moment.

In 2012 in advance of the US presidential election, American magazine Mother Jones released surreptitiously recorded footage of Romney talking about Democratic voters in disparaging terms.

Romney says in the recording: ""There are 47 per cent who are with him [Obama], who are dependent upon government…My job is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.""

Romney never recovered from this incident, not only because it obliterated his nice guy disguise, but because his opponents ensured that everywhere you looked, there it was: that recording, online, on TV, and in your head.

From now until October, prepare to watch Justin Trudeau being smug again and again and again. Christmas has come early for Andrew Scheer. Meanwhile, the people of Grassy Narrows wait.

Grassy Narrows First Nation held a protest and demonstration in Toronto on Wednesday evening during a Liberal Party fundraiser to press the Trudeau government on its promise to fund a specialized mercury treatment facility in the northwestern Ontario community that's about 100 kilometres northeast of Kenora.

During the event, the protester appeared to be escorted out of the room while Trudeau thanked her for her ""donation.""

""From time to time, I'm in situations where people are expressing concerns or protesting a particular thing, and I always try to be respectful and always try to engage with them in a positive way,"" Trudeau told reporters in Halifax on Thursday morning.

""I didn't do that last night — last night I lacked respect towards them and I apologize.""

Grassy Narrows also is pushing for federal help for remediation of the polluted English-Wabigoon River system and better compensation for people affected by the toxic element.

In a video posted to the Council of Canadians' verified Facebook page Wednesday evening, a woman is shown standing in front of the stage where Trudeau is standing; she appears to unfurl a banner that references the prime minister and compensation for the ""mercury crisis."" She is heard saying ""people in Grassy Narrows are suffering from mercury poisoning, you committed to addressing this crisis,"" while appearing to be removed from the room.

Trudeau, still on the stage, is heard saying, while facing the direction in which the woman was taken out of the room, ""Thank you for being here, thank you very much for your donation tonight, I really appreciate it,"" which draws cheers and applause from the crowd.

The Grassy Narrows protest in Toronto was at the Omni King Edward Hotel, where Trudeau was scheduled to appear at a Laurier Club donor ""appreciation event.""

Former Indigenous services minister Jane Philpott pledged in late 2017 that Ottawa would fund the development and construction of a treatment facility for people exposed to mercury-related illnesses in Grassy Narrows. A number of studies have linked the comparatively poor health of people in the community to the dumping of mercury-contaminated effluent by Reed Paper, former owners of the mill in Dryden, into the river where members of the First Nation have traditionally fished.

The dumping also affected Wabaseemoong, another First Nation, about 100 kilometres northwest of Kenora.

""The situation in Grassy Narrows is one that we have been following for quite awhile,"" Trudeau said Thursday. He said representatives from his office will be in touch with the office of Indigenous Services Minister Seamus O'Regan.

Grassy Narrows submitted a feasibility study for the treatment centre in late 2018, said the community's environmental health co-ordinator, Judy Da Silva. But the community is now waiting for Ottawa to commit to funding a detailed work plan — the next step in the project, she said.

""We're really worried this promise won't be fulfilled,"" Da Silva said, with the 2019 federal election drawing closer. ""The crunch is coming ... and we need something concrete in place ... for the mercury home to be a reality.

""As we speak, our people are having to suffer in the Kenora hospital, or in Thunder Bay or in Winnipeg, and the numbers are growing,"" Da Silva said.

Judy Da Silva was in Toronto to help protest what the community is calling a lack of action by the federal government on the Grassy Narrows mercury treatment centre. (CBC)

""We're hoping that ... [Ottawa] will put something in place that will fulfil that promise for a mercury home and for mercury justice for our people.""

Da Silva said Grassy Narrows has also yet to secure a visit from Trudeau, despite chief and council requesting he come to the community.

William Olscamp, a spokesperson for Indigenous Services Canada, said in an email to CBC News that the department has reviewed the mercury treatment centre's feasibility study ""and is actively engaged with the community, the province and other technical experts to continue to effectively map out the required services against the technical requirements of the building.

""Once the requirements have been finalized, the next steps can get underway.""

The elevated levels of mercury in the river that runs adjacent to Grassy Narrows also closed a once-thriving fishery in the 1970s, decimating the local economy. Community leaders have called on senior levels of government for better compensation, saying the existing Mercury Disability Board, established in the 1980s and under provincial jurisdiction, has only resulted in about six per cent of Grassy Narrows members getting any compensation.

While the province has committed to indexing payouts to inflation, there's been little talk about changing the eligibility criteria.

Grassy Narrows highlighted by Amnesty International

The situation in Grassy Narrows was highlighted by Amnesty International on World Water Day in March as one example in Canada of ""environmental racism.""

""There are communities, particularly communities of colour and Indigenous peoples, who daily have to live with threats to their health and well-being from environmental contamination that would be unthinkable for so many other wealthier communities,"" said Craig Benjamin, Amnesty International Canada's Indigenous rights campaigner.

""Really, there's no clearer example of this than Grassy Narrows.""

Amnesty International has been working with the community for close to 20 years, he said, adding specialized health care should have been on the table years ago.

""This isn't something that should be delayed.""

Olscamp said in his email that Indigenous Services Canada ""continues to work collaboratively with the communities of Grassy Narrows First Nation, Wabaseemoong Independent Nations and provincial partners to address the specific health needs in these communities and reform the Mercury Disability Board.

""The timelines for completion of the treatment facility will depend on the project requirements and the final design agreed upon by the federal and provincial project participants and the Grassy Narrows community,"" he added.

Grassy Narrows is about 100 kilometres northeast of Kenora, Ont. (CBC)

""It is too early at this point to provide a definitive date for the project completion.""

Benjamin acknowledged the commitments made by both the federal and provincial governments as being much-needed positive steps that need to be adhered to.

""We also have the fact that there have been these long struggles for justice that, at this point, we finally see them bearing fruit,"" he said.

Mr. Turtle said the Prime Minister’s dismissive remarks to protesters, Ottawa’s treatment of former minister Jody Wilson-Raybould and a general sense of inaction on Indigenous issues are producing widespread disappointment with the Liberal government.

“Looking at the whole picture … I would say that the Prime Minister has lost confidence with a majority of the native people,” he said in an interview with The Globe and Mail Friday.

Mr. Turtle said the Prime Minister’s reaction to the protesters this week “felt like an insult” and he urged Mr. Trudeau to do more than apologize.

“We acknowledge the apology, but that’s about it. I guess I would say actions speak louder than words. I’ve been asking him to come to Grassy Narrows to visit our community and he’s always brushed it aside, so I guess if he started showing some action, then I would be more impressed,"" he said.

Mr. Turtle raised the issue of Ms. Wilson-Raybould, the former attorney-general who resigned from cabinet in February, and has accused the Prime Minister’s Office of applying inappropriate pressure in relation to a criminal prosecution. Ms. Wilson-Raybould, a former regional chief of the Assembly of First Nations, also expressed frustration last fall with her government’s lack of progress on Indigenous files.

“It’s just the way he handled it,"" Mr. Turtle said. “In terms of reconciliation, [Mr. Trudeau] should have done his best to accommodate her.”

Francis Kavanaugh, Grand Chief of Grand Council Treaty #3, which includes Grassy Narrows and 27 other First Nations, said Mr. Trudeau hasn’t lived up to the expectations set by the Liberals in 2015.

“I’m just very, very disappointed. I had high hopes when he first became the Prime Minister. He ran on a platform of reconciliation – he was going to fix this, he was going to fix that – and I’m just starting to think that he’s a liar,” he said Friday in a phone interview.

Health problems facing residents of Grassy Narrows and neighbouring Wabaseemoong in northwestern Ontario were the focus of a protest that disrupted a speech Mr. Trudeau was delivering Wednesday evening in Toronto at a Liberal Party fundraising event.

Story continues below advertisement

When two protesters in the room shouted out that the people of Grassy Narrows are suffering from mercury poisoning and that his government had promised to do something, Mr. Trudeau dismissed them.

“I really appreciate the donation to the Liberal Party of Canada,” Mr. Trudeau replied as the first of the two protesters was escorted away. The audience of donors who contributed $1,500 to the party cheered.

Video of Mr. Trudeau’s response spread quickly online, prompting widespread condemnation from First Nations leaders and others.

Mr. Trudeau apologized Thursday morning in Halifax, saying he had showed “a lack of respect.”

Members of both communities have long experienced health problems linked to toxins released into the river system in the 1960s by a paper mill in Dryden, Ont. The contamination affected the local fish population − a regular source of food and commerce. The waters remain contaminated decades later.

Grassy Narrows and Wabaseemoong are waiting on the federal and Ontario governments to deliver on two key promises that were both made in 2017: a provincial pledge to clean up the contamination and a federal promise to build a new health facility to treat patients affected by mercury.

Story continues below advertisement

The Ontario Liberal government’s 2017 announcement promised to place $85-million in a trust fund to pay for cleaning up the mercury contamination in the region. A spokesperson for the current Progressive Conservative government said officials continue to work with the communities on how to spend the money set aside for remediation. However, no firm project plans have been announced.

From the federal government, then-Indigenous services minister Jane Philpott promised in November, 2017, that a specialized health facility would be built in the area to serve people affected by mercury poisoning.

The federal government is assuming responsibility for building a facility, but is looking for provincial help in areas such as health-care staffing.

Indigenous Services Canada received a draft feasibility study for the treatment centre on Nov. 28, 2018, which covered issues such as location, design and estimated operational costs.

Federal Indigenous Services Minister Seamus O’Regan said in a statement that the department continues to work with the communities and the province on plans.

“I would be pleased to meet with Chief Turtle to determine how we can continue moving this critical work forward,"" he said. ""It is imperative that we all work together – the federal government, the province, and community – to ensure that the people of Grassy Narrows get the supports they need.”","Trudeau 'has lost confidence with a majority of the native people, Grassy Narrows chief says",The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-trudeau-has-lost-confidence-with-a-majority-of-the-native-people/

Rudy Turtle said he's again calling on Trudeau to visit his community, located about 100 kilometres northeast of Kenora in northwestern Ontario, to see first-hand the effects that decades of exposure to mercury are having on the people. Elevated levels of the toxic element have remained in the English-Wabigoon River system since Reed Paper, former owners of the mill in Dryden, dumped 9,000 kilograms of mercury into the water in the 1960s and early 1970s.

""We've invited him to the community and he's always brushed it aside,"" Turtle said of letters leadership has sent to the Prime Minister. ""I would like to see him come to Grassy and meet the people of Grassy Narrows, not just the chief and council, but the people themselves.""

""Just to get a handle on what mercury's doing to our people.""

The community is frustrated, Turtle said, by how long the process is taking to break ground on a promised specialized mercury treatment facility so residents don't have to travel hundreds of kilometres to hospitals in Kenora, Winnipeg or Thunder Bay.

Grassy Narrows had hoped to start construction in the spring, but leaders and advocates are saying that money from Ottawa isn't flowing to proceed to the project's next step. Indigenous Services Canada said it is ""actively engaged"" with the community, the province and other ""technical experts"" to establish what services the facility will be responsible for and how they will fit into the building design.

The community's frustration was magnified by Trudeau's comments Wednesday at a Liberal Party fundraising event in Toronto where a protester unfurled a banner in front of the Prime Minister while he was taking the stage while saying that ""people in Grassy Narrows are suffering from mercury poisoning, you committed to addressing this crisis.""

She was physically removed from the room while Trudeau said ""thank you very much for your donation tonight, I really appreciate it."" The prime minister apologized Thursday morning, saying his comments ""lacked respect.""

Turtle said the community is ""acknowledging"" that apology ""but we're not too impressed, let's put it that way.""

The incident was captured on video by Mark Calzavara, a regional organizer with the Council of Canadians. He said that he and the woman in the video did donate in order to be able to enter the room.

Trudeau said on Thursday that their money would be refunded.

Grassy Narrows First Nation is located about 100 kilometres northeast of Kenora, Ont. (Canadian Press) ""There's a lot of concern that this commitment will not be fulfilled before the election,"" Calzavara said about why they wanted to draw attention to the issue, adding that ""if there is a change in government, that the incoming government may not honour the commitment at all.""

That's why Turtle said he wants to see money for the treatment facility locked into a trust, similar to what the Ontario government did in 2017 with $85 million committed to go toward remediation of the English-Wabigoon River system.

""It's about holding Mister Trudeau ... and the Liberal Party to account, they committed to building the mercury treatment centre,"" Calzavara said.

Those sentiments were echoed by Ogichidaa Francis Kavanaugh, the grand chief of Grand Council Treaty 3, of which Grassy Narrows is a member.

""Nothing has been done and our people continue to suffer. We want to see action now,"" Kavanaugh was quoted as saying in an emailed statement.

""It's nothing more than a delay tactic on [the government's] part,"" Turtle said of the time it's taking.

That much was made clear after Jody Wilson-Raybould’s documents were made public Friday afternoon.

The most damning piece of evidence she provided was the audio recording of a 17-minute telephone conversation with Michael Wernick, the Clerk of the Privy Council until his recent resignation.

The two were speaking about the SNC-Lavalin file, with Wernick repeatedly pressuring Wilson-Raybould about what it would take to get the criminal charges dropped against the firm and have them instead receive a Deferred Prosecution Agreement.

There is much that is troubling in this phone call, but the worst parts are the sections where Wernick makes it clear that his firmness on the issue comes directly from Trudeau. It’s Trudeau who is insisting this happen. It’s Trudeau who is the one who wants a deal made, whatever it takes.

“So he is quite determined,” Wernick says at one point. “Quite firm but he wants to know why the DPA route which Parliament provided for isn’t being used. And I think he is gonna find way to get it done one way or another.”

If that’s truly how Trudeau felt, the plot has just thickened.

The problem has become even more serious. And if Trudeau had actually said that at one point or another, then there would be a very good case for obstruction of justice.

The head of the public prosecution service had already ruled that she would go ahead with charges against SNC-Lavalin and that they would not be offered a DPA.

As Wilson-Raybould says to Wernick and writes later in the documents she submitted, what is at issue here is prosecutorial independence. No politician, not even the prime minister, can tell the head prosecutor to drop charges against a company for any reason.

That is not how a free society works. If that was happened here, then we’d be a banana republic. A joke country where justice is served according to the personal whims of the leader.

When this story first broke, Trudeau tried to tell us that nothing happened, that the story was “false”.

Trudeau offered a swift apology for his lack of respect, but his comments at a high-end Liberal fundraising event on Wednesday drew widespread condemnation.

“Trudeau’s apology rings hollow while our people are suffering without the care and support that we need,” said Rudy Turtle, the chief of the Grassy Narrows First Nation, the northern Ontario community suffering the impact from mercury poisoning.

Perry Bellegarde, chief of the Assembly of First Nations, said the prime minister’s comments were “completely unacceptable and offensive,” and called on Trudeau to visit the affected communities in order to “see the impacts of the mercury contamination firsthand.”

Last night I lacked respect towards them and I apologize for that

Trudeau apologized after a video surfaced of him making a snide remark to protester Lana Goldberg after she unfurled a banner in front of the prime minister as he addressed a $1,500-a-ticket fundraiser in Toronto.

“Prime Minister Trudeau, people at Grassy Narrows are suffering from mercury poisoning,” she said.

As she was dragged out, the prime minister said, “Thank you very much for your donation tonight. I really appreciate it,” drawing applause and laughter from the audience.

On Thursday, Trudeau apologized for his comments to the protester and to the broader First Nations community.

“From time to time I’m in situations where people are expressing concerns or protesting a particular thing, and I always try to be respectful and I always try to engage with them in a positive way,” Trudeau told reporters in Halifax.

“Last night I lacked respect towards them and I apologize for that.”

Any funds that the protesters contributed in order to gain access to the event would be refunded, he added.

“They wanted to express their concerns about an issue and I do take that seriously and I apologize to them.”

“I’ve never seen him give that kind of cynical or shut-down response,” said Mark Calzavara, a member of the advocacy group Council of Canadians, who captured the comments on his phone. Calzavara was also raising awareness about the First Nations community.

Opposition members of parliament blasted Trudeau’s comments as being flippant, saying it contradicted the Liberal government’s carefully crafted brand of reconciliatory and progressive politics.

“What a smug, mean, aloof ass,” NDP MP Charlie Angus said on Twitter.

Conservative MP Michelle Rempel called Trudeau “smug” and “arrogant.”

NDP leader Jagmeet Singh tweeted, “Instead of showing respect for people fighting for clean water & funding, Trudeau sides with his rich donors to get a laugh.”

Grassy Narrows has been suffering from mercury poisoning in its local water supply for decades, after an upstream pulp and paper mill dumped thousands of pounds of effluent into the English-Wabigoon river system through the 60s and early 70s.

Meanwhile, a medical treatment centre in the community promised by Ottawa lags behind schedule.

In November, Federal Indigenous Services Minister Jane Philpott announced that Ottawa would provide $170,000 to fund a feasibility study for a long-term treatment centre in Grassy Narrows. Ottawa also promised a treatment centre in the Wabaseemoong, or Whitedog, First Nation that has had similar mercury poisonings.

The facility in Grassy Narrows, designed to hold around 20 beds, was meant to begin construction in the fall of 2018, but has not yet broken ground. One person familiar with the matter said that in discussions with the community in December, Philpott said she expected the project to get underway around June of this year, already months behind its initial start date.

Members of the Grassy Narrows and Whitedog First Nations have been found to have uncommonly high levels of mercury in their blood stream, largely from eating fish from the English-Wabigoon river system. Mercury is often carried in fish, particularly white fish species like walleye, and it “bioaccumulates” — meaning it is often passed down from one generation to the next through childbirth, and is nearly impossible to rid from the body.

Sufferers of mercury poisoning have been known to have learning disabilities, blurred vision and difficulty balancing, among other ailments.

I’ve never seen him give that kind of cynical or shut-down response

The estimated cost of the Grassy Narrows treatment centre is $17 million, but due to the inter-generational existence of mercury the community is calling on Ottawa to provide maintenance and services to the facility over a 30-year period, for a total of roughly $88 million.

Chief Turtle said the community, about 100 kilometres north of Kenora, Ont., needed to have the money put into a trust to ensure that future governments did not suddenly take away the promised funding.

“I acknowledge Trudeau’s apology, but more importantly he needs to deliver on his government’s promise to build a Home and Treatment Center so our mercury survivors can be cared for with dignity,” Turtle said.

Japanese researchers have been studying patients in Grassy Narrows for decades, and have found residents of the community displaying symptoms of Minamata disease, named after a small Japanese town where 900 people died as a result of eating fish tainted with mercury.

In December, a report found that mercury poisoning of the local river system was causing a number of health issues for youth in the community, particularly pregnant women, including anemia and attention deficit disorder.",Opposition lashes out at ‘arrogant’ Trudeau after he thanks First Nations protesters for donations,O Canada,https://o.canada.com/news/smug-arrogant-opposition-lashes-out-against-trudeau-after-he-thanks-first-nations-protestors-for-their-liberal-party-donations/wcm/4105e35b-6d6c-4277-9d8d-768902105882

“Trudeau’s apology rings hollow while our people are suffering without the care and support that we need,” Grassy Narrows Chief Rudy Turtle said in a written response to the National Post.

Trudeau apologized to Grassy Narrows after a video surfaced of the prime minister telling protestor Lana Goldberg “thank you very much for your donation” in response to her interruption of a high-end Liberal Party fundraiser Wednesday, where she was raising awareness about the First Nations community.

Grassy Narrows has been suffering from mercury poisoning in its local water supply for decades, after an upstream pulp and paper mill dumped thousands of pounds of effluent into the English-Wabigoon river system through the ’60s and early ’70s. Goldberg was representing an advocacy group called Free Grassy Narrows, which aims to help the community secure a long-term care facility for patients of mercury poisonings.

Opposition members of parliament blasted Trudeau’s comments as being flippant and smug, saying it contradicted the Liberal government’s carefully crafted brand of reconciliatory and progressive politics. Other observers were simply surprised by his handling of the protest.

“I’ve never seen him give that kind of cynical or shut-down response,” said Mark Calzavara, a member of the advocacy group Council of Canadians, who captured the comments on his phone. Calzavara was also raising awareness about the First Nations community.

Trudeau was speaking at a so-called Laurier Club event, which are Liberal Party fundraisers attended solely by major donors who give $1,500 or more.

On Thursday, Trudeau apologized for his comments to the protester and to the broader First Nations community.

“From time to time I’m in situations where people are expressing concerns or protesting a particular thing, and I always try to be respectful and I always try to engage with them in a positive way,” Trudeau told reporters in Halifax.

The rejection by Chief Turtle comes after a medical treatment centre in the community promised by Ottawa lags behind schedule.

In November 2017, then-Indigenous Services Minister Jane Philpott announced that Ottawa would provide $170,000 to fund a feasibility study for a long-term treatment centre in Grassy Narrows, as well as provide further funding to “design, build and operate” the facility. It also promised a treatment centre in the Wabaseemoong, or Whitedog, First Nation that has had similar mercury poisonings.

Perry Bellegarde, chief of the Assembly of First Nations, said the prime minister’s comments were “completely unacceptable and offensive,” and called on Trudeau to visit the affected communities in order to “see the impacts of the mercury contamination firsthand.”

Opposition members of parliament also lashed out against Trudeau for his remarks.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations that officials inappropriately leaned on former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to ensure construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc escaped a trial by paying a fine instead.

The crisis may well threaten Trudeau’s reelection chances in a vote this October. Polls show his center-left Liberals, who as recently as January looked certain to win, could lose to the official opposition Conservatives.

Wilson-Raybould made public around 40 pages of documents revealing more details of what she said were attempts by officials to force her change her mind even after she insisted they desist.

Wilson-Raybould, who was demoted to veterans affairs minister in January and resigned the following month, first made the allegations in almost four hours of testimony to the House of Commons justice committee last month.

Trudeau says officials were trying to make Wilson-Raybould understand that thousands of jobs would be at risk if SNC-Lavalin were found guilty of bribing Libyan officials. Trudeau insists he and his team did nothing wrong.

The affair has so far cost Trudeau two high-profile female cabinet ministers, his closest personal aide and the head of the federal bureaucracy, Michael Wernick.

Wilson-Raybould included a recording of a phone call with Wernick last December in which he told her he was worried about “a collision” between her and Trudeau “because he is pretty firm about this.”

Wilson-Raybould, who stressed she thought the call was inappropriate, told Wernick she was waiting “for the other shoe to drop” because she was under no illusion about how Trudeau “gets things that he wants.”

Opposition legislators said the documents reinforced their demand for a public inquiry into the matter, something Trudeau says is not necessary.

“She is actually trying to speak truth to power, trying to say, ‘You can’t do this,’ ... and it keeps happening,” New Democratic Party parliamentarian Nathan Cullen told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.

Trudeau’s office was not immediately available for comment.

The phone call between Wilson-Raybould and ...,"“It is entirely inappropriate and it is political interference,” Jody Wilson-Raybould told now departing Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick.

It was a little more than 3 minutes into her phone call with Wernick that Wilson-Raybould uttered these words as she listened to the Clerk make the case for SNC-Lavalin to get a deferred prosecution agreement on their bribery and corruption charges.

That one line, and many others throughout the 17-minute call, show the PM and his top staffers lied when they said Wilson-Raybould had never raised the idea that she was being inappropriately pressured to give SNC-Lavalin the sweetheart deal they wanted.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has repeatedly said Wilson-Raybould never told him or anyone in his office to stop or that they were acting appropriately.

The phone call between Wilson-Raybould and Wernick were released as part of the package of documents, emails and texts the committee asked Wilson-Raybould to submit.

Wernick, in both appearances before the Commons justice committee, said there was no improper pressure placed on her.

Yet she clearly told him as she most certainly told others, despite what Gerry Butts told the committee.

“The PMO’s interactions with the Attorney General’s office were only called into question by the Attorney General at the time of the cabinet shuffle,” Butts said on March 6.

Is there anything Trudeau or anyone on his team has said on this matter that is actually true?

Time and again, from the beginning of this story becoming public, they have told lies, fabricated stories and run smear campaigns out of the PMO trying to discredit Wilson-Raybould.

She has produced evidence time and again — now including screenshots of texts, copies of emails and a recording of a phone call — to back up her claims.

Trudeau has produced stories that change or crumble under scrutiny.

Consider the veiled threat Wernick uttered near the beginning of the call.

“He is quite determined, quite firm,” Wernick said of Trudeau’s desire to get a DPA for SNC. “I think he’s gonna find a way to get it done one way or another.”

In other words, the PM gets what the PM wants.

The Liberals and supporters of the PM are pointing out that Wilson-Raybould recorded her phone call with Wernick without him knowing.

While Wilson-Raybould calls this act “inappropriate” in her submission there is nothing illegal about it. In Canada, if one person on the call consents to it being recorded then the recording is legal.

In her written submission, Wilson-Raybould describes staffers throughout Trudeau’s office, the Clerk’s and Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s office as putting pressure on her or her staff despite repeated requests that it stop.

“This is a constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence,” Wilson-Raybould says when explaining to Wernick why she won’t simply interfere or “take over the prosecution” as he had suggested.

As Wernick pressed her on the issue of saving jobs, Wilson-Raybould said she too wants to save jobs but must protect the independence of prosecutors and even the PM.

“This goes far beyond saving jobs, this is about the integrity of the prime minister,” Wilson-Raybould said.

Several times she raised that issue, the integrity of the PM, or protecting him from making a bad decision, but Wernick pressed on.

Now the PM’s reputation, like that of Wernick’s, has taken a beating over this file.

For weeks now polls have shown Canadians believe Wilson-Raybould over Trudeau by a margin of two to one or greater.

This latest release of documents will only hurt him and bolster her case.

He should have let her speak.

Once again, the Justin Trudeau government is taking a wait-and-see approach to an economic crisis on the prairies.

China began banning canola from being imported by certain Canadian companies in early March. It started with Richardson International Ltd., based out of Winnipeg, and then on Tuesday they added Viterra, out of Saskatchewan, to the ban list. They cite unspecified harmful organisms of which no evidence has been brought forward they even exist. Trade with China accounts for 40 per cent of the industry’s business in Canada and roughly $2.7 billon. According to the Canola Council of Canada, canola is a $2 billion crop in Alberta with an economic spinoff of $7.1 billion, providing 72,500 jobs.

We have seen many times the mere whisper of what a health concern in the ag sector can do to its vitality, it wipes it out and takes years to recover.

One would expect the federal government to jump up to protect this industry. As it revolves around international trade, it is their job.

The prime minister’s biggest statement as of Wednesday, however, came at a stop in Winnipeg, and it was only mentioned because he was pressed on it by questions from reporters.

“We’re very much looking at the possibility of sending a high-level delegation to China,” he said, before adding the required boilerplate that we produce top-quality canola.

You’re looking at sending a delegation to China? Why aren’t they already there? How about a little protection for the 45,000 producers who are out there risking their livelihood to meet the demand created by trade missions with China.

If this was Bombardier those negotiations would already be underway and bailouts would be in the process of being arranged. This has been reality many times in recent years, because, as finance minister Bill Morneau said in 2016, the aerospace sector is “critically important” to Trudeau’s vision of Canada’s future.

Despite the incompetence of those running it.

It’s also a Quebec-based company.

It has been three weeks and hardly a peep about the canola industry from the prime minister.

Of course, there have been complicating factors.

Most notably the extradition process of Chinese tech giant Huawei’s chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou to the U.S., which has forced a wedge into the formerly peaceful relations between Ottawa and Beijing. It is also a leading theory as to what has sparked the canola ban.

There has also been a certain scandal that has rocked Parliament and forced several of Trudeau’s top aides and cabinet ministers to resign, all in the name of protecting another Quebec-based business, SNC-Lavalin. All the PMO has been accused to have done is subvert the rule of law to help a company in Trudeau’s backyard that is facing corruption and bribery charges. I suppose we should excuse him on canola, he has been distracted. And on vacation in Florida.

One might even argue that this would be the perfect opportunity for the prime minister to show he cares about those provinces between B.C. and Ontario. He could run to the front lines, call out the Chinese government on their actions on a daily or even weekly basis, have scientific proof in hand that Canadian canola is safe, and be ready with financial packages to aid farmers who could lose everything.

It would even potentially earn himself some respect back out on the prairies with an election due this fall.

Instead, he is willing to let others like Saskatchewan premier Scott Moe do the heavy lifting and actually start the engagement process between the provinces and the federal government.

What cannot be lost in this is the impact to the local ag sector. When one looks in our own backyard, Parkland County is currently looking at expanding its prime agriculture zoned land by as much as 40 per cent to help diversify the local economy in the face of the coal phase out. Not all of those new acres, of course, would be land devoted to canola, but it is a major cash crop that already has a foothold in the region.

With the announcement of the first ban, the price per bushel of canola dropped by 30 cents. That’s tens of thousands of dollars for a farmer. That can easily be the point of making it or breaking it.

These families and producers are not political pawns. They are Canadians who desperately need the support of their government, regardless of the province they live in.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - A former cabinet member at the heart of a crisis that could cost Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau his job on Friday released documents to back up her case that she had been pressured to help a large corporation avoid a corruption trial.

OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who typically takes a more deferential, let's-talk approach when protesters get in his face, found himself delivering a rare and rapid apology Thursday for his sarcastic retort to an Indigenous heckler who interrupted his remarks during a high-end fundraising event.

Trudeau said he's sorry for how he responded to the previous night's protester, who unfurled a banner at the foot of the stage during a $1,500-a-ticket fundraiser in Toronto in an effort to draw attention to the impact of mercury poisoning in the northern Ontario community of Grassy Narrows First Nation.

""Thank you for your donation,"" Trudeau told the woman as she was escorted out by security. ""I really appreciate your donation to the Liberal Party of Canada.""

Others in the audience cheered the prime minister's dismissive remark, which was captured by cellphone cameras and quickly circulated on social media Wednesday night.

Less than 24 hours later, Trudeau sounded considerably more contrite.

""As I think you all know, from time to time I'm in situations where people are expressing concerns or protesting a particular thing, and I always try to be respectful and always try to engage with them in a positive way,"" he said following an announcement in Halifax.

""That's how I believe democracy should function, and I didn't do that last night. Last night I lacked respect towards them and I apologize for that.""

Any funds that the protesters contributed in order to gain access to the event will be refunded, he added.

""They wanted to express their concerns about an issue and I do take that seriously and I apologize to them.""

Afterward, Trudeau bypassed his motorcade and walked directly into the midst of a fresh group of protesters gathered outside the venue in Halifax, acknowledging their complaints and thanking them for sharing their concerns.

Indigenous people in Grassy Narrows, about 90 kilometres north of Kenora, Ont., have been contending for decades with chemical-waste mercury dumped into the English-Wabigoon river system throughout the 1960s and 1970s, poisoning fish and locals who rely on the river as a source of water and food.

The community hopes to build a world-class mercury treatment facility to help deal with the fallout from the poisoning, which causes often irreparable damage, including impaired vision, muscle weakness, speech, hearing and cognitive problems and numbness or stinging pain in the extremities and mouth.

Grassy Narrows staff met with former Indigenous Services Minister Jane Philpott in December to discuss progress on the facility, shortly after giving the government a feasibility study for the project. At that time Philpott said the government was actively working to get it built.

Trudeau should go to Grassy Narrows to apologize to the people there directly and in person, suggested Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde.

""This incident highlights the need for action now,"" said Bellegarde. ""There have been numerous commitments from different governments for action yet the people of Grassy Narrows First Nation and Wabaseemoong are still waiting while they face serious dangers to their health. It's time for action.""

Grassy Narrows Chief Rudy Turtle acknowledged the prime minister's apology but said Trudeau had to be reminded of the ""urgency"" of the situation.

""People are dying from mercury contamination and nothing is being done. Enough is enough,"" Turtle said in a statement Thursday evening.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh called Trudeau's comments to the protester offensive and ""callous.""

Trudeau said he plans to follow up with Seamus O'Regan, who replaced Philpott on the Indigenous Services file in January, to ""make sure we are looking at exactly everything we can do to continue to work hard in resolving this situation.""

""It is something that is of real concern and a real piece of the path of reconciliation that we must walk on.""

A spokeswoman for Trudeau said the government is actively working on the file at the ministerial and official level, but would not say whether Trudeau would plan to meet with members of the community or travel there.

Charles Bird, managing principal at the Toronto office of Earnscliffe Strategy Group and a former federal Liberal cabinet aide, said he wasn't at the Toronto event but having organized many similar appearances for provincial and federal politicians, he knows such intrusions can be very chaotic.

As such, Bird said he doesn't believe it's a sign Trudeau is feeling the heat from the political crisis engulfing the Liberal government over allegations he tried to interfere in the case of Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

""His style is very much that when he's under pressure, he tends to be calmer.""

Even so, Trudeau has been known to flash his temper. In 2016, during a raucous vote in the House of Commons, he was accused of elbowing an NDP MP in the chest while trying to expedite the proceedings.

OTTAWA -- The federal government is defending its refusal to disclose the contents of a 60-page memo the country's top bureaucrat sent to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about Vice-Admiral Mark Norman.

In a statement Friday, the Department of Justice said the memo sent by Michael Wernick, clerk of the Privy Council, to Trudeau last October was completely blacked out by government lawyers.

Norman's lawyer Marie Henein revealed the memo's existence during a pre-trial hearing Thursday, saying the government had withheld its contents because of solicitor-client privilege.

After both Henein and Justice Heather Perkins-McVey noted that Wernick was not a lawyer, the judge agreed to set aside two days in April for Henein to challenge the privilege claim.

In its statement, the Justice Department said the memo was handled the same way as the other documents requested by Norman's legal team and blacked out by government lawyers.

""These redactions were applied by legal counsel,"" the Justice Department said, adding that ""such redactions are consistent with the normal process applied to all documents.

""The final say on these redactions and relevance of the documents rests with the court.""

Friday's statement is the latest from the Justice Department about the Norman case, some of which Henein flagged to the court earlier this month as being ""inaccurate.""

Suspended as the military's second-in-command in January 2017, Norman was charged last year with breach of trust for allegedly leaking government secrets to pressure the newly minted Trudeau government to approve a $700-million shipbuilding contract.

That contract, negotiated by the Harper Conservatives and finalized by Trudeau's Liberals in November 2015, involved leasing a converted civilian ship from Davie Shipbuilding in Quebec as a temporary naval supply vessel.

Norman has denied any wrongdoing and his politically charged trial is scheduled to start in August and run through much of the fall federal election.

Norman's legal team has been fighting since October for access to thousands of internal government documents they say will prove the suspended military officer's innocence and show that the government interfered in his case.

The Asian nation halted certain canola shipments from Canada this month in the aftermath of last year’s arrest of a top Huawei Technologies Co. executive in Vancouver on an American extradition request. Officials in Beijing are now, in the same breath, defending the canola move and invoking Canadian “previous mistakes,” in an apparent nod to the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the tech giant’s chief financial officer and daughter of its founder.

Trudeau doesn’t have a clear solution. His government can’t legally intervene in Meng’s case at this point, even after President Donald Trump hinted she could be a bargaining chip in U.S.-China trade talks. The prime minister was already grappling with China’s continued detention of two Canadians on national security grounds and a looming decision on banning Huawei from his country’s next-generation wireless networks. Now he’s getting an earful from farmers whose crops are being turned away.

“This is part of the usual playbook that is used by China,” Guy Saint-Jacques, a former Canadian ambassador to China, said Wednesday on BNN Bloomberg television. Australian coal exporters are facing similar pressure tactics from Beijing, which struck a canola deal with Trudeau’s government three year ago that was supposed to run through 2020.

“Nothing has changed in the meantime -- except we have entered into this big bilateral crisis following the arrest of Ms. Meng,” Saint-Jacques said.

Billions in Trade

The northern nation shipped C$4.4 billion ($3.3 billion) of the crop to China last year, according to the Canola Council of Canada. Beijing has confirmed the suspension of exports from Glencore Plc-owned Viterra Inc. and Winnipeg-based Richardson International Ltd. Trudeau is considering sending a Canadian delegation for talks on the rejected orders.

China says the move is due to quarantine rules but hasn’t yet offered evidence. China says it found pests in shipments that had already been cleared by Canadian inspections.

“The Chinese side has taken these precautionary quarantine measures to ensure safety,” China Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Geng Shuang said Wednesday. “As for China-Canada relations, we hope that the Canadian side could work with us to promote the sound and steady development of bilateral relations. The Canadian side should take some concrete measures to correct its previous mistakes.”

In recent years, Beijing’s displeasure with smaller trading partners including South Korea, the Philippines, and now Canada have all been accompanied by economic pressure through import restrictions, store inspections and safety warnings to Chinese tour groups.

Trudeau, speaking Tuesday, cited diplomatic tensions as one cause for the canola problem. Jim Everson, president of Canada’s canola council, supports the idea of sending a delegation. “We’re really eager to talk to China about the issues they’ve raised,” Everson told BNN Bloomberg television. Farmers “are increasingly perplexed by what the issues are.”

Detained Canadians

Meng was arrested on Dec. 1. China detained Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, both Canadian citizens, on Dec. 10. The two remain in Chinese custody.

Canada agreed this month to allow Meng’s extradition hearing to proceed, a move that angered China. Meng then launched a civil suit in response. Then on March 4, China’s Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission said Kovrig had violated Chinese law by spying and stealing state secrets while working for the International Crisis Group, and said Spavor was his primary contact.

“It’s unfortunate that we ended up in this mess, thanks to our friends, the Americans. We have to try to use all avenues to try to resume a dialog with China, to try to lower the temperature related to the case of Ms. Meng,” Saint-Jacques said. “And let’s not forget that we have two people in jail in China that are going through some very difficult interrogation problems.”

Trudeau is weighing whether to ban or restrict the use of Huawei equipment in Canada’s 5G networks. He said this week there’s “significant concern” around privacy, though upside to Canadian businesses having cutting-edge technology. He gave no timeline for a decision.

Lawyer Marie Henein revealed the existence of Privy Council ...,"OTTAWA — Vice-Admiral Mark Norman's lawyer says she wants to see a secret 60-page memo the federal government's top bureaucrat penned to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about her client's case.

Lawyer Marie Henein revealed the existence of Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick's memo to Trudeau on Thursday as Norman's breach-of-trust case returned for another day of pre-trial hearings.

The revelation is the latest twist in Henein's months-long fight for thousands of government documents she says are essential to prove his innocence.

Subpoenas were issued last month for emails, BlackBerry messages and other internal communications from Trudeau, Wernick and other top officials about Norman as Henein seeks records to prove political interference in the case.

Henein told the court that she recently received a copy of Wernick's memo to the prime minister dated Oct. 24, 2018 as part of a larger trove of documents but she said the contents were completely blacked out.

""We received in the material that's come to us — in completely redacted form for solicitor-client privilege — a memo from Michael Wernick to the prime minister,"" Henein told Justice Heather Perkins-McVey.

""Mr. Wernick is not a lawyer, I don't believe,"" Perkins-McVey replied, though she quickly added: ""I'm not sure.""

It was at that point that Henein said she planned to present arguments on why the contents of that memo and others obtained from the government should be released.

Among the other memos were two sent to Wernick by the Privy Council Office's top lawyer, Paul Shuttle.

""These are the key documents that I can tell you were immediately concerning to me,"" Henein said.

Perkins-McVey agreed to set a date in mid-April for Henein and lawyers for the government to argue over whether the contents of the memos should be disclosed.

Norman, who previously served as the military's second-in-command, was charged last year with breach of trust for allegedly leaking government secrets to pressure the newly minted Trudeau government to approve a $700-million shipbuilding contract.

That contract, negotiated by the Harper Conservatives and finalized by Trudeau's Liberals in November 2015, involved leasing a converted civilian ship from Davie Shipbuilding in Quebec as a temporary naval supply vessel.

Norman has denied any wrongdoing and his politically charged trial is currently scheduled to start in August and run through much of the fall federal election.

The court also heard from lawyers for Davie and its bitter rival Irving Shipbuilding of Halifax, which offered, unsuccessfully, to provide its own interim supply ship to the navy until permanent replacements could be built.

Their appearance coincided with Perkins-McVey contemplating whether to release to Norman's lawyers documents deemed by government lawyers as commercially sensitive to the two companies.

Davie's lawyer, Sean May, told the court Thursday the company agreed to disclose the technical details about its ship, the MV Asterix, which is currently operating with the navy in the Pacific. However May said the company objected to the release of any financial information.

""Any information which would deal with specific ... commercially sensitive costs and related issues in that vein,"" May said. ""The numbers, essentially.""

Perkins-McVey agreed to that request following approval from Norman's lawyers as well as Irving's request that information dealing with its own bottom line be similarly withheld.

The question now ...","Andrew MacDougall is a London (UK) based columnist, commentator and consultant. He was formerly Director of Communications to Stephen Harper.

When a leader increases their party’s seat count from 36 to 184, as Justin Trudeau did in his majority-winning 2015 election campaign, he’s entitled to some good will. The question now staring Trudeau’s Liberals in the face is: how much?

It’s a question at least some of the herd must be asking after their colleagues on the Ethics Committee shut down yet another potential line of enquiry into the SNC-Lavalin scandal. Or, if not that, the question is being asked in light of the government’s cack-handed (and pathetic) attempt to smear Jody Wilson-Raybould using the Chief Justice of Manitoba as a canvas, a move that finally got the legal community off its arse on the mega-issue dominating the political agenda.

Heaping smear on top of political interference in the criminal justice system isn’t what any Liberal ran on in 2015, and it’s something no Liberal should want to run on later this year. So why are most Liberal MPs still fronting Trudeau’s nonsense?

Come to think of it, do most Liberal MPs even know what happened? Have any of them pressed Team Trudeau for the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? Does the backbench know what Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott (and presumably Cabinet) knows, or are they operating on blind faith?

If it’s the latter I would recommend they take their head out of the sand forthwith, because it’s their asses that are on the line. If Trudeau is caught up in something awful—an impression he grants every time he muzzles a person or an investigative body—they are going to wear it too.

READ MORE: On the elimination of inconvenient Liberals

At root, it’s a question of what our politics is meant to be. Solidarity come hell or (possibly criminal) high water, or a declaration of principles that are to be adhered to even if the King decides they are no longer convenient? All that’s certain is that Liberals of good faith are running out of time to keep the taint from the party brand that, believe it or not, should extend beyond their leader.

Every once in a while, anyway, there is a glimpse of steel. Wilson-Raybould and Philpott have clearly made their stand, and MPs like Nathaniel Erskine-Smith and Wayne Long have encouraged the Prime Minister to allow their colleagues to speak freely. Sadly, they are the exception that proves the rule of caucus solidarity. For every independent mind there is a ‘good soldier’ like Judy Sgro around to tell them to get back in line.

Now, someone like me would delight in all of this, wouldn’t I? But I speak from experience. I’ve put my cack hands to use in the service of scandal, too.

I will bet you the vast majority of Conservative backbench MPs in the last Parliament would rather we had vomited out the Mike Duffy business all at once so they could make their judgments about its propriety in 2013 rather than come election time, when it was before the courts. Sometimes the attempt at a political cover up becomes the crime (as it was with Duffy—with the caucus never losing faith in Harper as their leader), but other times the cover up is there to blanket an actual crime. It would be good for Liberals to know with which they’re dealing. At least you’d think. But politics is a funny business and partisanship is a hell of a drug.

Given that Wilson-Raybould herself has said the approaches made to her over the back end of last year on SNC weren’t—in her view—illegal, one suspects the unrevealed bits of the SNC saga speak more to Trudeau’s character, and not the legality of his actions, or the actions of those in his employ. Given the Liberals are so reliant on Trudeau as the figurehead and his image as their brand, it would explain why Trudeau’s office would fight tooth and nail to keep any contrary evidence out of public view. We’ve had a glimpse of angry Trudeau before, including the recent bust-up with Celina Caesar-Chavannes, and it hasn’t always been pretty.

Either way, the truth will out.

In case the Prime Minister hasn’t figured this out yet, the two former ministers arrayed against him are both smarter and more determined than he is. Given their un-shifting story, they also appear to be on firmer ground. They think Trudeau’s pulled some funny business and they aren’t going to rest until all of the dirty laundry is aired in public. And if the PMO tries to smear them, they will punch right back, and land the heavier blow.

And you know who will be cheering that on? Team Orange and Team Blue, that’s who. Forget that people aren’t really warming to Andrew Scheer; if Trudeau has done something very ugly it won’t take a political genius to beat him. Remember Doug Ford?

If I were a Liberal MP who was still in the dark over the truth I would be asking for some light. Stat. The Liberals not named Trudeau need to ask themselves what they’re in Ottawa to try to accomplish. Are they in it for their platform and their party, or are they in it for the (potentially dis)honourable Member from Papineau?

In other words, are they Liberals, or are they a Trudeau’s men and women?

Let Jody Wilson-Raybould have her (additional) say. Stop muzzling her with cabinet confidence and solicitor-client privilege. Waive it.

Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners Suddenly, New Attention for List of Harper-Era Abuses Traffic surges for Tyee’s 2015 compilation of 70 Tory law and ethics breaches.

“The longer he continues this cover-up,” Bergen said of Trudeau, “the longer he moves heaven and earth to keep himself protected, the worse this gets for him.”

Does it get worse? Or will Canadians tire of the saga and move on, as the Liberals this week bet by moving to shut down the inquiry?

Martyn Brown, who as premier Gordon Campbell’s chief of staff handled scandals buffeting the B.C. government during the 2000s, thinks that this week Trudeau has moved closer to the brink of disaster. The heightened prospect of an RCMP investigation makes Trudeau an anchor sinking the party he once rescued with his leadership.

Now, says Brown, it’s time for Liberal insiders to convince Trudeau to step down.

More bad days for the PM

In one twist this week, Wilson-Raybould promised to dump a pile of more documents on the Justice Committee in order to prove her allegations of undue political interference are correct, even if she isn’t allowed to testify in person.

In another turn, Celina Caesar-Chavannes, who said she’d been bullied by a shouting Trudeau, left the Liberal caucus to sit as an independent MP.

Meanwhile, SNC-Lavalin’s CEO said Trudeau’s team is wrong to imply that his company asked to be spared a criminal trial or else it would move from Montreal with 9,000 Canadian jobs sacrificed.

But the biggest bombshell, in Brown’s view, was dropped by former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott, Trudeau’s other cabinet minister to resign in dismay over LavScam.

What Philpott had to say in her interview with Maclean’s magazine on March 21 proves she’d “gone rogue,” says Brown.

“I’m not accusing anybody of anything illegal or contrary to the Criminal Code,” emphasizes Brown. But Philpott raised enough questions to possibly prod the RCMP to launch an investigation, and that would mean a severe hit to Trudeau’s political fortunes.

On the phone with The Tyee March 21, Brown laid out his reasoning:

Philpott is “now basically saying in this interview with Maclean’s that Jody Wilson-Raybould was bullied, that there is much more to the story. And so she’s flatly contradicting [Trudeau’s] version of events.”

Philpott has given “new legs” to the demand by five previous attorneys general and the Tories for an RCMP investigation. In Maclean’s she makes it clear she could not remain in “solidarity with cabinet,” because she “felt that there was evidence of an attempt to politically interfere with the justice system in its work on the criminal trial that has been described by some as the most important and serious prosecution of corporate corruption in modern Canadian history.”

She also reveals that she raised deep concerns about the DPA file on SNC-Lavalin a full month before the affair became public.

She says this, Brown notes, as we find out the PMO’s claims about harm to the public interest if SNC-Lavalin were to be criminally prosecuted are baloney.

“What we need to know is, in this period, particularly after Jan. 14 when the shuffle took place, was cabinet misled by false threats or false information of the sort we’ve now learned about? That SNC was leaving Montreal, which [we know] now is patently untrue. Or that Canada was going to lose 9,000 jobs, which the present CEO now says was patently untrue. Was cabinet misled by that? Because if so, that would be a reason for the RCMP to investigate.”

The Mounties would be particularly interested in finding out, says Brown, “if false information was used to try to pressure Jody Wilson-Raybould to get her to politically intervene for something that anyone in government knew wasn’t true. Or if the government knew that it wasn’t true that jobs would be lost, that the company would move, as it was trying to suggest to her was the reason in the public interest, then the public interest argument goes out the window.

“That’s the only legal argument the government currently has. Even though by law they’re precluded in the Criminal Code from considering the national economic interest, they’re trying to couch it in this phrase, ‘the public interest,’ to say that because it was in the public interest, that’s why they could talk to her.

“But if the public interest argument is based on a lie, and they knew that, then all that you’re left with is a political motive, an electoral motive that would be self-serving. And that to me would raise questions of obstruction of justice, breach of trust, all sorts of things that the RCMP would suddenly be concerned with.

“I think that’s what’s really changed, the stakes have been elevated by both what the present CEO has said and what Philpott has said.”

Veteran of scandal management

Brown was chief of staff for premier Campbell on Dec. 28, 2003, the day RCMP officers arrived at the B.C. legislature and carted away boxes of evidence for what would become a years-long scandal involving the botched billion-dollar sell-off of the province’s public rail system.

Neither Campbell nor Brown was charged with any wrongdoing. But eight years later, Brown was the first witness called for the resulting trial, which ended with guilty pleas to fraud by two ministerial aides.

If Trudeau gets a knock on his door by the Mounties any time soon, he might want to give Brown a call for a bit of advice.

Then again, the PM likely won’t like what he hears. Brown, who writes a column for the Georgia Straight, declares in his latest that the Liberals’ best chance of winning the fall election is to “lance the boil” that is Trudeau.

As he told The Tyee in an email today, “The fear of losing Trudeau needs to be flipped on its head if left-leaning progressives want to minimize the chances of a Scheer victory this fall. The Liberals can now only hope to regain the moral high ground that is so vital for securing the values they purport to represent by replacing their leader. They can own the ethical hill they are now choosing to die upon by defending the indefensible by selecting a new leader who the heroines Wilson-Raybould and Philpott and Celina Caesar-Chavannes can all rally behind.”

Brown figures, “I am perhaps one of the first to suggest that Trudeau should be dumped by his caucus in their party’s political interest.”

As such, he joins a club that includes The Tyee’s Crawford Kilian who wrote a column published here March 5 headlined: “Trudeau’s Resignation Is the Party’s Only Hope.”

Video from ...,"""I always try to be respectful…I didn't do that last night. Last night I lacked respect towards them and I apologize for that,"" Trudeau said.

The Star has reported extensively on the effects of an industrial mercury dump 50 years ago upstream from Grassy Narrows First Nation, revealing that fish near the community are the most contaminated in the province, that there is mercury-contaminated soil and river sediment at or near the site of the old mill, and the provincial government knew in the 1990s that mercury was visible in soil and never told anyone inGrassy Narrows or nearby Wabaseemoong (Whitedog) Independent Nations.

New research reported in December indicated children in Grassy Narrows whose mothers ate fish at least once a week while pregnant are four times more likely to have a learning disability or nervous system disorder.

People in the community have also developed tremors, slurred speech, impaired hearing and tunnel vision, and lost muscle co-ordination, the Star has reported.

On top of that, the fishing industry in the region has been decimated.

Trudeau's jibe toward demonstrators at the Liberal fundraiser was greeted with criticism. Perry Bellegarde, National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations, posted on Twitter that Trudeau's comments ""unacceptable and offensive"" and said he should apologize directly to those involved.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh told reporters on Parliament Hill Thursday that Trudeau's comment was ""callous."" He called the situation in Grassy Narrows a ""horrible tragedy"" that should be approached with compassion.

""I think we were all deeply offended by Mr. Trudeau's remarks,"" Singh said. ""The fact that Mr. Trudeau didn't respond with compassion maybe speaks to the fact that he doesn't actually care about what people are going through, and that's something that's really hurtful.""

“Mr. Trudeau, people at Grassy Narrows are suffering from mercury poisoning. You committed to addressing this crisis,” a protester could be heard saying as she held up a banner calling on the prime minister to compensate people within the community.

The protester was subsequently ushered away. That’s when Trudeau addressed her directly.

“Thank you for being here, thank you for your donation tonight. I really appreciate it,” he said, to laughs, applause and cheers from the audience.

The prime minister then continued: “As you know, the Liberal Party is filled with different perspectives and different opinions, and we respect them all.”

Another protester, still in the audience, then said off-camera: “If it was your family that’s been waiting for 500 days, if your family was suffering from mercury poisoning, what would you do? If it was your family, would you accept it? Would you accept 500 days for one per cent?”

A Facebook event promoting the protest alleged that Trudeau is “failing to help Grassy Narrows, a key test of his ‘commitment’ to meaningful relationships with First Nations and to a healthy environment.”

The event post said that in November 2017, then-minister of Indigenous services Jane Philpott had “promised to build and operate a Mercury Survivors Home and Care Center in Grassy Narrows.”

However, 500 days have passed since that commitment, and “only one per cent of the cost to build the facility has flowed and the project has stalled.”

The event post went on to say that all but six per cent of Grassy Narrows people have received “no compensation for the intense impacts of the ongoing mercury crisis on their health, culture and livelihood.

“Instead of getting the support they need, they face chronic denial as they live with deep poverty and severe food insecurity.”

Philpott, who has since left the Liberal cabinet, indeed pledged federal funding to the Grassy Narrows First Nation to fund a treatment centre to help people suffering the effects of mercury contamination.

Mercury contamination has been an issue in the area for half a century, after a paper mill located in Dryden, Ont., dumped thousands of kilograms of mercury into the English-Wabigoon river system in the 1960s.

“This is what they need and should have, and we are very happy to support them in it,” Philpott said at the time.

A health survey published by the Grassy Narrows First Nation last year showed that the health of people there was “significantly worse” than other First Nations in Canada.

The community had fewer elders, and this survey suggested that people there were dying prematurely.

Justin Trudeau’s government welcomes BC’s support on carbon tax, but is siding with Alberta’s Rachel Notley in fighting against BC’s right to regulate oil ...","The federal government’s treatment of British Columbia shows the Trudeau Liberals’ “incoherence” on climate change, says an environmental campaigner.

Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners Suddenly, New Attention for List of Harper-Era Abuses Traffic surges for Tyee’s 2015 compilation of 70 Tory law and ethics breaches.

On one hand, Environment Minister Catherine McKenna is calling B.C. an “exemplary climate leader” on Twitter, because the provincial government supports its carbon tax.

At the same time, the Trudeau government is fighting to force the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion through B.C. over the provincial government’s objections and accusing B.C. of hurting the country’s economy.

As a result, B.C. is involved in three court cases concerning environmental issues that involve the federal government.

In two, the province is intervening in support of the federal government to argue in favour of a national carbon tax.

In the third, B.C. is asking if it has the right to control what hazardous materials come across its borders, which could give it the ability to block the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.

The conflicting legal cases show a basic problem with the federal government’s climate change policies, Dogwood BC campaigner Sophie Harrison told The Tyee.

“It speaks to the fundamental incoherence in the federal government’s climate change policies,” she said. “Out of one side of their mouth they are talking about leading on climate, they are talking about making polluters pay for climate damages... and out of the other side of their mouth they pay oil companies to pollute. And they do this with subsidies and tax breaks.”

The federal Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act comes into effect Monday.

The tax will start at $10 per tonne of carbon emissions, gradually rising to $50.

People and industries that already have a carbon tax in place — like B.C. — won’t see any impact.

Saskatchewan and Ontario are fighting the carbon tax and challenging its constitutional legitimacy in court.

Saskatchewan argued in the province’s appeal court in February that dealing with carbon emissions is a provincial responsibility, and the federal government does not have the right to tax provincial Crown corporations SaskPower and SaskEnergy, which would be affected.

Ontario’s similar challenge will be heard in the province’s appeal court in April.

In both cases the federal government is arguing greenhouse gases are a national concern and fall under its jurisdiction, according to court documents.

B.C., which adopted a carbon tax in 2008, has been cited as an international example of how a developed economy can grow while at the same time reducing carbon emissions.

In a court document prepared for the Ontario case, Tim Lesiuk of the B.C. government’s Climate Action Secretariat argued the lack of a national carbon tax has allowed pollution to flow freely from other provinces to harm British Columbians — citing rising sea levels, fiercer fire seasons, melting permafrost and ocean acidification, among other concerns.

The David Suzuki Foundation, represented by Ecojustice, is also intervening in support of Ottawa in the two cases, arguing the federal government has the right to set a federal carbon price because climate change is a national emergency.

B.C. and the federal government agree in the carbon tax cases — action or inaction in one jurisdiction affects other provinces.

But in the Trans Mountain expansion court case, the federal government is opposing B.C.’s argument that it has the right to regulate the flow of potentially harmful substances through the province — in this case in a pipeline.

B.C. is asking the Court of Appeal to rule on whether it has the right to amend the Environmental Management Act to control oil or bitumen shipments in the province and whether the federal government could override that law.

The proposed amendments would require companies transporting hazardous materials through B.C. to gain permits first.

But federal lawyers argued the changes were unconstitutional, because the federal government has jurisdiction over interprovincial infrastructure.

Ecojustice lawyer Kegan Pepper-Smith told media outside the courthouse March 18 the province has the right to act if it sees gaps in federal protection.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has ...,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has apologized for a ""lack of respect"" he showed towards a protester who confronted him about mercury contamination in a First Nation community during a Liberal fundraiser in Toronto.

During a media scrum in Halifax on Thursday morning, Trudeau said he always tries to be respectful and to engage with protesters in a ""positive"" way, but admitted he didn't do that the night before.

""Last night I lacked respect towards them and I apologize for that,"" he said.

On Wednesday night, hecklers at a fundraiser, organized by the Laurier Club that requires a minimum contribution of $1,500 to join, called out Trudeau's handling of mercury poisoning on the Grassy Narrows First Nation. In response, he thanked them for contributing to his party’s coffers.

""Thank you very much for your donation tonight, I really appreciate the donation to the Liberal Party of Canada,"" Trudeau said to cheers from the crowd.

Trudeau said Thursday he plans to refund the protesters’ donations.

""Obviously we will be fully refunding the contributions made by those individuals last night,"" he told reporters. ""They wanted to express their concerns about an issue, and I do take that seriously.""

A Twitter account that appears to be run by the protesters posted a video of the interaction and accused Trudeau of ""failing to help"" Grassy Narrows. The account also reacted to Trudeau's comments, tweeting ""smugger words have never been said.""

Judy Da Silva, the environmental health co-ordinator for the Grassy Narrows First Nation, called the remark ""callous.""

""He could have treated us in a humane way and asked the lady – no I want to hear her, bring her back, I want to hear her question. He could have said that. But instead he just made fun of her,"" Da Silva said in an interview with host Glen McGregor on CTV’s Power Play Thursday.

""I don’t feel that the word reconcile should exist anymore.""

Grassy Narrows suffers decades of mercury poisoning

The issue plastered across the large banner a protestor wielded at Trudeau's fundraiser Wednesday night was the mercury poisoning that continues to ravage Grassy Narrows First Nation.

The community, which sits near Ontario's border with Manitoba, has been struggling with the effects of a chemical plant dumping waste mercury in its local river in the 1960s and 1970s. Mercury poisoning can result in impaired cognitive functions and issues with speech, vision and hearing. It also causes weakness in the muscles as well as numbness and tingling in the mouth and extremities.

With prolonged exposure, the damage can become irreversible.

Grassy Narrows residents have been pushing the government to move forward on its pledge to build a treatment centre in the community for those suffering from mercury poisoning. Then-Indigenous Services Minister Jane Philpott first made the pledge in late 2017, but the community is still waiting for the dedicated treatment centre.

Trudeau told reporters on Thursday that his office will be speaking with Indigenous Services Minister Seamus O’Regan's office to make sure the government is looking at ""everything"" they can do to ""continue to work hard in resolving this situation.""

""The situation in Grassy Narrows is one that we have been following for quite a while. It involves elements of provincial jurisdiction and federal responsibility,"" Trudeau said.

However, Da Silva said Trudeau's remarks on Wednesday evening made her feel less optimistic about the government’s commitment to addressing the mercury poisoning issue.

""With last night's reaction at the Trudeau fundraiser…I felt like things aren’t going to happen,"" Da Silva said, ""he's not fulfilling that commitment to protect our people.""

Trudeau blasted for Grassy Narrows comments

Trudeau came under heavy fire from politicians and advocates alike after his comments and the Liberal fundraiser Wednesday night.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Trudeau’s comments were a ""sad example"" of the ""colonial disregard for Indigenous lives"" that he says contributed to the suffering in Grassy Narrows.

""Instead of showing respect for people fighting for clean water [and] funding, Trudeau sides with his rich donors to get a laugh,"" Singh tweeted.

Conservative Deputy Leader Lisa Raitt also weighed in.

""That snarky comment by the PM to the young female protester is just ignorant. 'Thanks for your donation'. Way to go Bro,"" she tweeted.

Conservative MP Michelle Rempel also called Trudeau ""smug"" and ""arrogant.""

The Assembly of First Nations' National Chief Perry Bellegarde called on Trudeau to apologize directly to those involved. Bellegarde also said Trudeau should visit Grassy Narrows and the neighboring Wabaseemoong, which are still being impacted by mercury poisoning.

""PM's comments are unacceptable and offensive,"" Bellegarde wrote in a tweet. ""Above all, it’s time for action for children and families in these First Nations.""

The recent SNC-Lavalin scandal and a number of earlier missteps have taken its toll.

A new Global News Ipsos poll finds Trudeau’s approval rating (40 per cent) is now below Trump’s (43 per cent), even as the Conservative Party established a double-digit lead over the Liberals.

The Liberal government’s federal budget was uninspiring to a lot of Canadians and did little to change the sagging fortunes of the Liberals.

The Conservatives now enjoy high numbers in Ontario and British Columbia, meanwhile PM Trudeau is falling behind among two key demographics -women and young people.

If an election were held tomorrow, the Conservatives would receive 40 per cent of the vote among decided voters, according to the poll of 1,002 Canadians conducted between March 25 and 27.

The Liberals would receive 30 per cent of the vote — down one point — while the NDP would receive 21 per cent and the Bloc Quebecois five per cent.

In seat-rich Ontario, the Conservatives (40 per cent) have opened up a 12-point lead over the Liberals, who are tied with the NDP at 28 per cent.

The Tories also enjoy a double-digit lead in British Columbia, where the Liberals and NDP are in a scrap for second place.

Alberta looks to be a foregone conclusion, with the Conservatives (63 per cent) light-years ahead of the Liberals (17 per cent) and NDP (15 per cent).

Liberals are only ahead in Quebec, where they have the support of 38 per cent of respondents.

The NDP, with only 12 per cent of the vote support, is poised to lose most if not all of its seats in Quebec.

Trudeau’s 40 per cent rating is also lower than that of former PM Stephen Harper at this stage in 2015, with Harper having a 47 per cent rating in April 2015.

Still there are several months before Canadians go the polls and a lot can happen between now and then. -CINEWS",Trudeau has lower approval rating than Trump,Canindia.com,http://www.canindia.com/trudeau-has-lower-approval-rating-than-trump/

In a statement to Global News, the PMO also said it was “unaware of the full contents of this recording before today.”

WATCH: Secret recording of Jody Wilson-Raybould’s phone call with Michael Wernick on SNC-Lavalin released

The statement emerged amid the release of a recording in which Wilson-Raybould could be heard telling Michael Wernick, the outgoing clerk of the PCO, that she was concerned about the appearance of political interference if she were to override the director of public prosecutions and offer SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA).

In their phone conversation, which took place in December 2018, Wilson-Raybould told Wernick that “this conversation, previous conversations I’ve had with the PM and people around him are entirely inappropriate. It is political interference.”

The recording backs up most of Wilson-Raybould’s testimony before the parliamentary justice committee, in which she alleged that Wernick made “veiled threats” against her with regard to a prosecution deal for the Quebec-based engineering company.

During the conversation, Wernick could be heard telling Wilson-Raybould that the prime minister was in a “mood” about this matter and that, “I think the way he sees it and the advice he’s getting is you still have things you can do that are entirely lawful.”

Wernick also said, “he’s in a pretty firm frame of mind about this so I’m a bit worried.”

“A bit worried about what?” Wilson-Raybould responded.

“It’s not a good idea for the PM and his attorney general to be at loggerheads,” Wernick said. He added that the prime minister “doesn’t have the power to do what he wants, all the tools are in your hands.

Wernick has denied making any threats to her.

In the statement, the PMO said the prime minister “should have spoken directly with the former justice minister and attorney general about this matter — and wishes that she had come to him.”

The PMO went on to say that there was “clearly an erosion of trust over the past few months between PMO, the clerk of the Privy Council, and the former justice minister and attorney general.”

“The prime minister took responsibility for the situation and announced several next steps, including external expert opinions on a number of things as they relate to the set of issues raised over the past few weeks,” the statement said.

The PMO concluded by saying, “all the facts are on the table now, and everyone involved has shared their perspective, including the prime minister. We are focused on moving forward as a team on the issues that matter to Canadians and governing in the best interests of the country.”

The tape came as part of a submission package in which Wilson-Raybould also relayed concern that her successor, now-Justice Minister David Lametti, could offer SNC-Lavalin the deal that she refused to help them secure.

Wilson-Raybould acknowledged that it was wrong to record her conversation with Wernick, but she said she did that because she was worried that the conversation would be inappropriate — and that it could follow the pattern of the exchanges she had with others in parliament.

A recording that Wilson-Raybould had secretly made of a call between herself and the Privy Council Clerk as well as emails, texts and her written statement were tabled to the committee.

In a statement, Scheer said: “These documents and recordings are concrete evidence that proves Justin Trudeau led a campaign to politically interfere in SNC-Lavalin’s criminal prosecution. He personally gave the orders and when the former Attorney General refused to follow them and break the law, she was fired.

“Ms. Wilson-Raybould repeatedly told the Prime Minister and his top officials that their actions were ‘entirely inappropriate’ and amounted to ‘political interference’. Despite her objections, the Clerk of the Privy Council pressured her and made it clear that her job was on the line.

“Justin Trudeau also told Canadians what he knew to be false. He knew that his Attorney General had serious concerns about his plan to get SNC-Lavalin off of serious criminal charges. But he looked Canadians in the eye and told them that no one had raised concerns with him. This is false and he owes Canadians an explanation.

“The entire SNC-Lavalin scandal is corruption on top of corruption on top of corruption.

You had government by PMO’

BY RATTAN MALL

FORMER federal minister Herb Dhaliwal, who served in Jean Chretien’s Cabinet from 1997-2003, told The VOICE this week that among the steps that Justin Trudeau needs to take to get out of the political mess he’s in is to bring some new people into the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).

He told me: “He had a lot of inexperienced young people who were probably very smart but didn’t have the wisdom and the experience and I think he’s got to make changes. He’s already made some changes – he’s actually made my former chief of staff George Young to liaison with the Caucus and I think it’s a sort of the first step to better manage his Caucus.”

Dhaliwal added: “I think they have learned that managing caucus is very important in politics and I think that’s one thing they didn’t really understand. So now they’ve made some changes.”

He said Trudeau has to decentralize power in the PMO because a few people started centralizing power in that office. “One of the things they can do is – as has traditionally been – have a regional minister. They never had a regional minister. So, of course, that gave more power to the people in the Prime Minister’s Office. They need to appoint a regional minister for each part of the country.”

Dhaliwal said: “The other thing I think is that he has to reach to the whole Liberal Party – Liberals from the past, Liberals from the present, Liberals of the future. And I think that’s one thing he’s not done well. He needs to do that because it’s important.”

He pointed out: “Remember they were all talking about Trudeau and the Team? They have to start talking about the Liberal Party. It’s a great political institution and they had forgotten the history of this party. So they need to now re-establish the strength of the larger Liberal Party – people from the past, people from the present and people who are going to come in the future. So that’s important.”

DHALIWAL bluntly noted: “They also have to get back to governing by Cabinet. The PMO people were trying to tell ministers what to do. I never had that problem when I was minister. And you need to have government by Cabinet. You had government by PMO and they need to change that.”

He added: “The other thing is that they used to have the Prime Minister’s Office attend the Liberal Caucus meeting. We never had that. There was a reason for that. Because Prime Minister Chretien wanted everybody to be open, upfront, to speak up and not to be afraid just because there were people from the Prime Minister’s Office. We never had people from the Prime Minister’s Office in the Liberal Caucus meeting – we never had that!”

Dhaliwal said: “So you have to manage Caucus better. It’s like having a board of 170 directors. You have to listen to them. You have to hear them out. You have to give them access to you. … It’s very important to manage them and I think they didn’t realize how important it was. Now they are learning how important it is to manage Caucus.

“The other thing in politics is you have to walk the talk. You can’t talk; you have to walk the talk. We talk about transparency. Let’s be transparent and tell it like it is. So they’ve mishandled this because they weren’t transparent, open from the beginning; they kept changing the story.”

As reported in The VOICE, Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former justice minister, tweeted on February 12 that she had resigned from Cabinet. The MP for Vancouver-Granville, who was Minister of Veterans Affairs and Associate Minister of National Defence, tweeted a link to her resignation letter.

She was under tremendous pressure to give her version regarding a Globe and Mail report that she had been pressured by the Prime Minister’s Office to help Quebec-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin avoid criminal prosecution.

On March 4, Jane Philpott, President of the Treasury Board and Minister of Digital Government, resigned from the Trudeau cabinet, stating that she had “been considering the events that have shaken the federal government in recent weeks,” referring to the SNC-Lavalin scandal.

Philpott tweeted: “It grieves me to resign from a portfolio where I was at work to deliver an important mandate. I must abide by my core values, my ethical responsibilities, constitutional obligations. There can be a cost to acting on one’s principles, but there is a bigger cost to abandoning them.”

DHALIWAL told me that he thinks that if Trudeau makes the changes he is suggesting, “he may be able to survive; otherwise, we’re looking at a minority government and maybe even a change.”

Dhaliwal stressed: “He has to re-establish his leadership and start governing by Cabinet, managing the Caucus better. I mean it’s unheard of that a minister resigns and they don’t even know. That’s a real lack of not understanding your Cabinet colleagues.”

He said: “They were totally surprised by [Philpott’s resignation] and you would think that if she was [resigning], the Prime Minister should have talked to her personally right away and brought her into his office and said ‘well, we need you. You can’t resign … Government needs you.’ … They should have started building a better relationship. I mean that’s part of the people around the Prime Minister – they shouldn’t get to the point where ministers are resigning and they don’t even know [what] they are upset about with the Prime Minister and the government.”

Dhaliwal then pointed to his own example when he was serving in Chretien’s Cabinet.

He related: “I wasn’t going to run the third time in politics. I had mentioned to one of my staff that I wasn’t going to run. You know the Prime Minister knew about it very quickly – within a few days he called me [and said] ‘I want to see you at 24 Sussex [the residence of the Prime Minister].’ When I was there, he said ‘look, I understand you are not interested in running next time.’ I said ‘yeah, I wanna get back to my business.’ He said ‘no, you have to run. I need you. It’s very important for you to run because if you don’t run, I could lose other seats and we need you to form government and you have to run.’ So I said ‘okay. There are a couple of conditions. One is after two years if I want to leave, you will allow me to leave politics.’ He said ‘fine.’ And I said ‘I’d like to have an economic portfolio.’ He said ‘fine, Done!’ And once he shook hands, that was it.”

Dhaliwal said the PMO people should have known that Philpott was so upset that she was going to resign and they should have been trying to resolve the issue.

He added: “So I think if he makes some of those changes he could recover from this. He has to start taking advice from experienced people who’ve been there, done that. And in the past, unfortunately, he hasn’t.”","Trudeau and his circle didn’t know how to manage the Liberal Caucus, says former federal minister Herb Dhaliwal",Voice Online,https://www.voiceonline.com/trudeau-and-his-circle-didnt-know-how-to-manage-the-liberal-caucus-says-former-federal-minister-herb-dhaliwal/

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ...","VANCOUVER — Justin Trudeau delivered a feisty, campaign-style speech in Vancouver-Kingsway Sunday night as he introduced former TV news anchor Tamara Taggart as the riding’s Liberal candidate in the fall federal election.

The prime minister fired off a flurry of verbal jabs at Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer, and also former prime minister Stephen Harper, giving a glimpse of what could be a heated campaign for the October election.

“Investing in people and communities is the way to grow the economy. Stephen Harper and the Conservatives still don’t get it. Andrew Sheer doesn’t get it either,” he said to a gym full of enthusiastic supporters.

“Under Stephen Harper, Canada had the worst growth rate we’d had since the depths of the Great Depression under R. B. Bennett.”

Trudeau then accused Sheer’s Conservatives of hoping to continue Harper’s policies by giving tax breaks to the wealthy while cutting programs for the middle and lower classes.

“They still think the way to create economic growth for everyone is to cut programs and give advantages and benefits to the wealthiest,” he said. “Well, that doesn’t trickle down to anyone and it didn’t work for 10 years.”

Trudeau pitched the upcoming election as an opportunity for all Canadians to step up and start talking about the kind of country they want to leave for their children and grandchildren.

“Do we want to invest in the middle class — shine on the world stage,” he asked, before warning that Canada “is seeing the rise of populism, aggressive, fear-based politics, just like the rest of the world.”

The crowd roared its approval when the prime minister suggested the best way to counter divisive populism is by recruiting “strong, compassionate people who’ve focused their lives on bringing people together and on empowering people.”

He lauded Taggart as one of those people from all walks of Canadian life who have invested in their communities in various ways to grow the economy, respond to the challenges of climate change and put Canada on the world stage.

Taggart admitted feeling a bit overwhelmed and emotional at being on stage, especially seeing her children holding up signs that read, “Team Tamara.”

The Order of British Columbia recipient said she wants to be the people’s voice in Ottawa, adding that her media career made her a good listener.

While Taggart steered clear of talking about the specifics of her campaign platform at the event, she has previously said that she wants to focus on affordable housing, protecting the environment while boosting the economy, and women’s health and safety.

She’s likely to face a tough challenge in Vancouver-Kingsway, which has been held by New Democrat MP Don Davies since 2008.

The release of the former attorney general ...","The recording former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould taped of her Dec. 19 phone call with outgoing Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick, released publicly this afternoon, largely corroborates her account of that exchange.

“The PM wants to be able to say that he has tried everything he can, within a legitimate toolbox, to try to head that off. He’s quite determined, quite firm, but he wants to know why the DPA [deferred prosecution agreement] route, which Parliament provided for, isn’t being used. And I think he’s going to find a way to get it done one way or another. So, he is in that kinda mood and I wanted you to be aware of that,” Mr. Wernick is heard telling Ms. Wilson-Raybould during the first few minutes of their phone call.

The purpose of the call, as Mr. Wernick characterized it, was “to pass on” information on the prime minister’s concerns that SNC-Lavalin could move its headquarters or be sold. “It seems to be real, and not a bluff. There’s another rising anxiety, as you can imagine, about a signature firm and job loss and all that coming after the Oshawa thing,” Mr. Wernick says, referring to recent layoffs at General Motors in Oshawa.

It was included along with a handful of documents the House Justice Committee released today, days ahead of the House’s return from its weeklong hiatus. The Prime Minister’s Office announced Friday that Mr. Wernick’s successor, Ian Shugart, will assume the post on April 19.

In the 17-minute phone call with Mr. Wernick, Ms. Wilson-Raybould is heard raising concerns about intervening in the SNC-Lavalin case, saying that their conversation is inappropriate and amounts to political interference, as well as other conversations she’s had calling on her to consider a DPA.

Mr. Wernick had raised the possibility of asking someone like former chief justice Beverley McLachlin to weigh in on the case, if she felt “uncomfortable” about intervening.

“What I am trying to do is to protect him [the prime minister],” she said in response. “I am just issuing the strongest warning I can possibly issue that decisions that are made by the independent prosecutor are their decisions.”

Her 43-page submission to the committee includes text messages between her and her then-chief of staff, Jessica Prince. In one text exchange, on Dec. 18, Ms. Prince tells Ms. Wilson-Raybould that then-principal secretary Gerald Butts allegedly said, “Jess, there is no solution here that doesn’t involve some interference.” Mr. Butts, who resigned over the issue, claiming responsibility for a “breakdown in trust” between himself and the former AG, has repeatedly denied there was inappropriate interference.

During her four-hour testimony before the Justice Committee on Feb. 27, Ms. Wilson-Raybould (Vancouver Granville, B.C.) said she spoke with Mr. Wernick on Dec. 19, during which he allegedly said that the prime minister is “determined” to find a way to get a deferred prosecution agreement for the embattled company and that he and his AG can’t be at “loggerheads” over this issue. Ms. Wilson-Raybould has expressed concern that she was shuffled out of her role as AG and moved to Veterans Affairs for her refusal to grant the company a DPA.

In responding to Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s account of that call, during his second appearance, Mr. Wernick said he had no “independent recollection” that there was inappropriate interference, saying he did not “wear a wire” during his conversations with the ex-minister.

The publication of the documents and recording will likely re-energize opposition parties’ push for the government to allow the ex-minister to fully air her side of the story and potentially add to calls from some Liberal MPs for her to be expelled from caucus.

The affair has roiled the Trudeau government for more than a month, and has overshadowed the release of its pre-election budget. Ms. Wilson-Raybould said she faced a “consistent and sustained” effort involving political staffers and bureaucrats, including Mr. Butts, and Ben Chin, chief of staff to the finance minister, to cut a deal for SNC-Lavalin, the Quebec engineering giant facing fraud and corruption charges, to protect 9,000 jobs.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Papineau, Que.) has repeatedly denied there was ever any inappropriate pressure, saying that he takes responsibility for the erosion of trust between his Mr. Butts and his former AG.

The release of the former attorney general’s submission to the Justice Committee comes after days of leaks on the judicial appointment process for the Supreme Court, something that’s supposed to be confidential, which Ms. Wilson-Raybould has said need to be investigated and the PMO has denied came from it.

Mr. Trudeau and his ministers have been touring the country for the past few days to sell the budget to key voting blocs, including young Canadians and seniors. Throughout his engagements, Mr. Trudeau has faced questions over whether his office orchestrated the leaks that alleged he questioned Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s judgment over her recommendation for a Supreme Court chief justice. Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s political motivations have also been an object of speculation of late, with some pundits raising questions about her end-game and concerns about the ethics of releasing an audio recording.

Questions have also been mounting over whether Ms. Wilson-Raybould and ex-Treasury Board president Jane Philpott (Markham-Stouffville, Ont.), who resigned over the government’s handling of the affair, will remain in caucus.

Despite her resignation from cabinet, Ms. Wilson-Raybould has repeatedly indicated that she intends to run under the Liberal banner in October’s election. Ms. Philpott, for her part, has said she supports the party’s policies and intends to remain a Liberal. Speaking to reporters in Maple Ridge, B.C., on Monday, Mr. Trudeau appeared to signal that the two would remain in the party, saying, “I look forward to continuing to engage with both Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott as they make their way forward.”

Even before the release of the documents and audio recording, several MPs were clamouring for both ex-ministers to be booted from caucus, according to a CBC report. The publication of the documents and audio file could add to those calls.

Liberals on the Justice Committee twice blocked opposition parties’ push to recall Ms. Wilson-Raybould to respond to the testimonies given by Mr. Wernick and Mr. Butts, which conflicted with her own. In an interview with CBC, Liberal MP Francis Drouin (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Ont.), who was subbing in for his colleagues on the committee, said he had “heard enough,” noting that the option is open for Ms. Wilson-Raybould to submit more information, expanding on her testimony.

Opposition parties earlier this week attempted to use the Ethics Committee as a forum to continue the Justice Committee’s probe, but the motion was voted down. The Justice Committee, meanwhile, is meeting in private next week to discuss committee business and its new focus on a study on online hate.

An audio recording and transcript of the Dec. 19 call with Michael Wernick, the country's top public servant, was released as part of additional written testimony Wilson-Raybould submitted to the House of Commons Justice committee, which last week shut down its examination of her allegation that she was relentlessly, improperly pressured to intervene in the case.

article continues below

The 17-minute recording backs up Wilson-Raybould's version of the words spoken during the conversation, about which she told the committee on Feb. 26 during nearly four hours of oral testimony. But it doesn't resolve the question of whether the Privy Council clerk's words constituted ""veiled threats,"" as she has alleged. Wernick's tone throughout is calm and respectful, while Wilson-Raybould becomes increasingly agitated as she tries to impress on him her belief that intervening in the case would be perceived as political interference in the justice system.

In her written submission, the former minister acknowledges the ""extraordinary and otherwise inappropriate step"" of recording the conversation. But she says she was at home alone in Vancouver at the time and was ""anxious to ensure that I had an exact record of what was discussed as I had reason to believe that it was likely to be an inappropriate conversation.""

""This is something I have never done before this phone call and have not done since.""

Wernick declined to comment directly but his lawyer, Frank Addario, said recording the call was ""inappropriate.""

""A lot of the tape is her making a speech for a different audience, since she could have just told him she did not want to discuss it further. I don't know any lawyer who records conversations with work colleagues or clients. I don't get the covert ops program or holding on to the tape for a convenient moment,"" Addario said in an email.

""She was the chief legal officer for the country. She didn't give her tape to the RCMP. She didn't give it to the PM or the Ethics Commissioner. She didn't even give it to the committee when she first testified. Most peculiar.""

The code of conduct for the Law Society of Ontario, of which Wilson-Raybould is an honorary member, prohibits a lawyer from recording a client without the client's permission. As justice minister and attorney general at the time, Wilson-Raybould was the government's chief lawyer. A spokesman for the law society said Friday that it ""does not comment on possible breaches of the Rules of Professional Conduct.""

The Canadian Bar Association code of conduct prohibits a lawyer from recording anyone without permission.

Wilson-Raybould has said she believes she was moved out of the justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs in a mid-January shuffle as punishment for refusing to succumb to relentless pressure last fall from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his senior staff, Wernick and others to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case. She resigned from cabinet a month later.

In the recording, Wilson-Raybould repeatedly tells Wernick that the director of public prosecutions had decided to pursue a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin for bribery and fraud related to its work in Libya and that she would not use her power to step in to override that decision and insist upon a remediation agreement. Essentially akin to a plea bargain, such an agreement would mean the company would have faced stiff financial penalties while averting a possible criminal convictionbility.

During the call, she acknowledges she has the legal right to intervene but argues it would be unprecedented and viewed as political interference.

""This goes far beyond saving jobs. This is about the integrity of the prime minister and interference. There is no way that anybody would interpret this other than interference, if I was to step in,"" she says.

""I would be a mockery. And that is not the problem. The bigger problem is what it would look like down the road for the government.""

At another point, Wilson-Raybould says she's trying to ""protect the prime minister from political interference"" and if he doesn't accept her advice ""then it is his prerogative to do what he wants."" She tells Wernick several times she feels ""uncomfortable"" just having the conversation with him.

Wernick tells Wilson-Raybould that Trudeau ""wants to be able to say that he has tried everything he can within the legitimate toolbox"" to head off the possibility of SNC-Lavalin leaving the country and putting thousands of Canadians out of work. He says Trudeau is ""quite determined, quite firm"" about this and adds: ""I think he's going to find a way to get it done one way or another. So he is in that kind of mood and I wanted you to be aware of that.

""It is not a good idea for the prime minister and his attorney general to be at loggerheads,"" he says later. ""I am worried about a collision, then, because he is pretty firm about this.""

He tells Wilson-Raybould that Trudeau is ""not asking you to do anything inappropriate or to interfere. He is asking you to use all the tools you lawfully have at your disposal.""

Towards the end of the call, Wilson-Raybould tells Wernick she's ""having thoughts of the Saturday Night Massacre here"" — a reference to former U.S. President Richard Nixon's attorney general resigning rather than follow the president's order to fire the special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal. She also says she's waiting for ""the other shoe to drop.""

""I am not under any illusion how the prime minister has and gets things that he wants.""

Wernick's lawyer said nothing said by the clerk constitutes a veiled threat.

""He was asking for information that only she could give. The clerk said this (remediation agreement) is a legitimate tool and why are we not exploring it here and he asked repeatedly for an explanation to pass on to the prime minister and she refused to give it. She didn't shut the call down,"" said Addario.

Addario said Wernick did not know the call had been recorded until it was released Friday, although he appeared to anticipate it during his second appearance at the justice committee on March 6. In response to questions about his recollections about the conversation, Wernick snapped: ""I did not wear a wire, record the conversation or take extemporaneous notes.""

In a statement late Friday, the Prime Minister's Office said Wernick did not brief Trudeau about his Dec. 19 conversation with Wilson-Raybould and he was unaware of its full contents until the recording was released.

Addario said the day after the conversation, ""everyone went on holidays."" By the time they returned at beginning of January, ""the first burning issue"" was Scott Brison's retirement and the consequent cabinet shuffle.

""The SNC issue never made it back to the top of the discussion list. The clerk never discussed SNC again with the PM or PMO until someone leaked the story to The Globe and Mail in early February.""

The PMO statement reiterated Trudeau's previous admission that ""he should have spoken directly"" with Wilson-Raybould about the matter and that ""he wishes she had come to him"" with her concerns about improper pressure. He again attributed the controversy to an ""erosion of trust"" between her office and his, and tried to close the door on the fiasco, which has engulfed his government for two months, cost him two cabinet ministers, his principal secretary and Wernick, who officially retires on April 19 after concluding he's lost the confidence of opposition parties following his combative testimony at committee.

""All the facts are on the table now and everyone involved has shared their perspective,"" the statement said, adding it's time to ""move forward as a team on the issues that matter to Canadians.""

However, Liberal backbenchers appear to be in a less forgiving mood.

Montreal MP Alexandra Mendes called Wilson-Raybould's secret recording ""horrendous"" and called for her and Jane Philpott — who resigned from cabinet earlier this month saying she had lost confidence in the government's handling of the SNC affair — to be booted out of caucus.

""If they had any sense of decency, they would resign before it would even get there,"" Mendes said in an interview, questioning why anyone would want to stay ""where they're clearly not wanted.""

Liberal MPs have been growing increasingly upset with Wilson-Raybould and Philpott's seeming desire to keep fanning the flames of the controversy and have been quietly discussing among themselves this week — a break week for Parliament — how to deal with the pair. The expectation now is that caucus members will insist on expelling them at their next meeting on Wednesday, or earlier if an emergency meeting is called. Precisely how to go about that is being debated since votes are not normally taken in caucus.

The documents released Friday also include transcripts of text messages and notes on phone calls Wilson-Raybould or her chief of staff, Jessica Prince, had with various senior government staffers.

One of them is a phone call between Prince and Justin To, Finance Minister Bill Morneau's deputy chief of staff, in which he says that there is a sense that Wilson-Raybould ""has a philosophical problem"" with the concept of remediation agreements, a new tool for dealing with cases of corporate corruption that went into effect last September.

""That she hated it the whole time and wouldn't even use it if we could,"" To allegedly told Prince, who told him that wasn't true.

In her submission, Wilson-Raybould also complains that the controversy over her allegations has included ""undeniable elements of misogyny, much of it aimed at myself.""

And while she says, ""I do not believe I have anything further to offer a formal process regarding this specific matter,"" she say she would comply ""if compelled or asked to participate in a judicial, investigative or parliamentary process.""

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Wilson-Raybould's latest revelations are ""so compelling and well documented"" that they prove the need for an independent public inquiry into the whole affair.

Make that swamps.

Yes, the Conservative leader needs to rid the capital of the considerable Liberal murk surrounding SNC, but he also needs to use Trudeau’s troubles as a pretext to rid his movement of its more dubious elements so that disillusioned Liberal voters have more than one new home to pick from should they abandon ship.

And while its axiomatic that you never interrupt an opponent while he’s beating himself up, it’s also true that you should never let a good crisis go to waste. Scheer needs to use Trudeau’s crisis as an opportunity to let Canadians know where he stands on values.

This is not to accept that Scheer currently has a values problem; it’s only an acceptance of the fact Liberals — having no good answer on SNC — will use the perception of a CPC values problem — and any spiky tone — to their advantage every chance they get, as evidenced by the recent kerfuffle over the “United We Roll” protests on Parliament Hill. With each bad news cycle, the Liberals will shift further from “sunny” to “smeary” ways.

To be clear, this was always going to be the Liberal re-election strategy. Sunny ways was just the smokescreen for what promised to be a very negative campaign.

The Liberals are certainly busy smashing the Project Fear button now in the hopes of stalling more defections over SNC, with MPs and online surrogates arguing against a further airing of the SNC drama lest it — and let me see if I can follow their logic here — help ease the path of the Nazis to power in Canada. Yes, some people are that irrational about the baby-faced dad-bodded former Speaker of the House now living in Stornoway.

And if you think the Nazi bit is a stretch, you haven’t been touring the green shamrocked quarters of Twitter, which now piles into every critical mention of Trudeau with a fury like what they must imagine the alt-right are capable of mustering. Forget potential interference in the justice system, this shamrock brigade thinks Trudeau could shoot someone on Sparks Street and still deserve to be prime minister. Because Scheer is a monster. Or something.

Even the wise owls are now beclowning themselves. Former justice minister Anne McLellan has now been drafted in to run interference for Trudeau’s office. Meanwhile, Liberal MP Judy Sgro, herself no stranger to (multiple) scandals, has told Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott to “put up or shut up”. And let’s not forget Sheila Copps, whose tweets on SNC are only a few irregular capitalizations away from MAGA-ville.

Of course, these hysterics hardly ever convince anyone. But that doesn’t mean their tactic is wrong. A more credible voice could land the blow and the Liberals will be asking their surrogates to land it. That’s why Scheer needs to nip it in the bud, no matter how bad SNC gets. Just as Republicans held their nose over Trump because they hated Clinton more, Trudeau is counting on a similar dynamic to see him through on SNC-Lavalin.

An animal backed into a corner also comes out fighting.

Trudeau will absolutely play politics on hot button files such as white nationalism, using tragic events such as the Christchurch mosque shooting as a hook. He will paint opposition to his carbon tax plan as proof of utter indifference to the world and future generations. He will rail against alt-right attitudes toward immigration. What SNC now gives Scheer is a chance to paint it all as Liberal desperation.

To do that, however, Scheer first needs to set out his stall on all of these questions. He’s said things in bits and bobs before and in response to various events over the past year but he now needs to bash it out in one go in a highly visible setting.

On the culture war, Scheer must condemn the Trumpy-types who see a “globalist” or “mooslim” plot everywhere they look. Being uncomfortable with the unfamiliar shouldn’t be disqualifying but Scheer should lead the conversation in steering conservatives toward safer harbours when it comes to Islam. A good start would be to embrace the Muslim community in unequivocal terms when it is targeted.

And on the environment, Scheer should finally announce his long-delayed plan, and buttress it with a clear statement of his belief in the science about climate change.

On both fronts, Scheer needs to leave centrist voters feeling their vote is safe with him. He needs to build immunity against the attacks he knows are coming.

And if that sends a few votes Maxime Bernier’s way, then so be it. It’s a price worth paying for the centre ground.

In his remarks to the Manning Centre networking conference on Saturday, Scheer said he ""unequivocally"" condemns hateful ideologies.

""The criticisms are completely baseless.""

Those criticisms have been plentiful in the past few weeks.

Says he misheard conspiracy question

Scheer has come under fire for speaking at the recent United We Roll rally on Parliament Hill, which had picked up participants who were making racist and anti-immigrant comments. The Prime Minister's Office also condemned Scheer for ""sharing a stage"" with Faith Goldy, a commentator who was let go from her job at Rebel Media after appearing on a podcast affiliated with the neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer.

Scheer was also chastised for not shutting down a question at a recent town hall about a widely debunked conspiracy theory connecting former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to a child sex ring.

In that particular instance, Scheer insisted he hadn't heard the question properly.

Whether racism or disinformation, Scheer says he and the Conservatives oppose such rhetoric.

""People know that the Conservative Party is open and welcoming,"" he said.

""We denounce any elements of society that would promote hate speech.""

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer says he didn't hear a portion of a question about the Clinton Foundation mentioning ""pizzagate."" 1:05

'Cheap political points'

His comments at the Manning Conference were the first time he's fully addressed the accusations against him, though he's taken questions on the matters at news events in the past few weeks.

Scheer was also heavily criticized for tweeting out his condolences to the victims of the New Zealand mosque attacks without mentioning the words 'Muslim' or 'mosque'.

In another statement later that day, Scheer did use both.

On Saturday, he accused the Liberals of targeting his post to ""score cheap political points in a disgusting manner,"" adding that Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale and Gov. Gen. Julie Payette released statements omitting both terms as well.

The Tory leader said it's important to speak out against those who put one group of people over another.

SNC-Lavalin still top of mind for the Tories

Scheer turned to the SNC-Lavalin affair as well, calling on Canadians to put pressure on Trudeau to allow all sides of the story to be heard.

The Liberal majority on the justice committee shut down an investigation into the matter, and now the ethics committee will begin its own.

Former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott are free to speak, the prime minister has said, but so far neither of them have taken that full opportunity.

Scheer said the crux of his issue with the conduct of top government officials is that politicians should not involve themselves in deciding what legal tools are available in prosecutions.

In what was clearly a speech with an eye toward the upcoming election, Scheer told the audience that being an Opposition leader isn't always easy, because you're not as high-profile as the prime minister.

However, now that the SNC-Lavalin affair is casting doubt onto Trudeau's character, it's easier for people to see ""the real Andrew Scheer,"" he said.

Still, Canadians aren’t so much embracing the Conservatives but instead deserting the Liberal party in droves, according to a new Angus Reid Institute poll.

Andrew Scheer and his Conservatives are picking up some votes from disenchanted Justin Trudeau Liberal supporters, according to a new poll. ( Sean Kilpatrick )

That’s a benefit to other parties — including the New Democrats, Green Party and the newly-minted People’s Party of Canada — who are seeing their fortunes rise as the governing party falls out of public favour. “The Liberals are just seeing quicksand. The floor is no longer stable,” said Shachi Kurl, Angus Reid executive director. “Trudeaumania was very, very real but Canadian voters are no longer feeling very manic.” In 2015, “Trudeaumania” convinced first-time voters, youth and non-regular voters to come out and cast a ballot. But it’s unclear whether the party will be able to retain that youth base this time around.

Kurl pointed to Pierre Trudeau’s rise to power in the late 1960s noting he enjoyed “Trudeaumania” before ending his last term as prime minister in 1984 as a polarizing politician. And if an election were held tomorrow, it is unlikely the Liberals would hold onto a majority: Fewer than 60 per cent of 2015 Liberals would vote for the party again. In contrast, the Conservatives are holding 90 per cent of their 2015 base. Levels of Conservative support remain essentially unchanged from last month — where they captured 37 per cent of the decided and leaning vote. Noting the Liberal Party’s relatively low retention of 2015 supporters, Kurl said it’s interesting to see where those voters are going. As the party bleeds votes, one in eight 2015 Liberals say they would support the Conservatives; one in 10 say the same of the NDP. Kurl added a handful have drifted to the Greens, while a significant portion remain undecided. Demographics are a huge driver of partisanship: Men and older Canadians slant Conservative, while women and younger voters stick with the Liberals or other left-of-centre parties.

Meanwhile, nearly half of all Canadians said they “strongly disapprove” of Trudeau in comparison to less than 10 per cent who “strongly approve.” “We’ve seen those stratospheric approval numbers that were in the 60s come down to the 30s over the last three years,” Kurl said. “Trudeau’s personal star is dimming. Not just the campaign, the party, the government, an entire international brand is built around a single person.”

Article Continued Below

That’s where the Liberals are running into “massive” trouble across the country, she added. Now, Canadians have a more favourable view of Scheer (44 per cent) and NDP leader Jagmeet Singh (39 per cent) than Trudeau (36 per cent). And while the Liberals lead by a wide margin in the city of Toronto, they are neck-and-neck with the NDP in the city of Vancouver, and trailing in the rest of B.C. and Ontario. In B.C. — where the NDP and Greens support is strongest — Scheer’s Conservatives hold a wide lead over the Liberals. The survey noted this likely helped to split left-of-centre respondents. Meanwhile, the Conservative party is leading by wide margins in Prairie provinces and by smaller four-point margins in Ontario and Atlantic Canada. Quebec, the one outlier, is seeing a four-way split in support between the Conservatives, Liberals, NDP and Greens. Still, a lot can change during election campaigns. For instance, in 2015, each of the three main parties held the lead in Angus Reid Institute polling between the time the writ dropped and election day. Kurl said there is enough time and space for the Liberals to bounce back and coalesce the left-of-centre vote. And it doesn’t mean that Trudeau should step down, she argued. Instead, it would require a pivot to focus less on the man and instead, more on the party, its policies and mission. “We’ve seen leaders do this in the past,” Kurl said, pointing to Jean Chretien’s 1993 campaign which was fraught with leadership critiques. “So what did the Liberal party do? They effectively built a team. It wasn’t Team Chrétien, it was Team Liberal.” Kurl said Trudeau can do the same thing. But, there isn’t evidence of that — yet. “The vote bleed, where it is going, and just how devastating it is for the Liberals today as people abandon the party based on a visceral reaction to Justin Trudeau says to me that the Liberals maybe need to take the weekend and go have a very deep think about what’s next,” Kurl said. Poll results were based on an online survey conducted from March 11-25 among a randomized sample of 5,807 Canadian adults who are members of the Angus Reid Forum. It carried a margin of error of +/- 2 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.

""Andrew Scheer here.""

If you live in the four provinces where the federal carbon tax is being introduced, you might get a text message from the Conservative Party leader telling you to fill your gas tank this weekend.

The mass-texting campaign against the carbon pricing policy that will take effect April 1 in New Brunswick, Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan will direct voters to the Conservatives’ petition against the carbon tax. And the texts might pop up on your phone even if you’ve never given your phone number to the Conservative Party of Canada.

In addition to pulling phone numbers from its own databases, the party will use software that auto-generates numbers with specific area codes in order to blast out the text messages.

One of those texts might look like this:

""Andrew Scheer here.

Trudeau’s carbon tax will raise gas prices on Monday.

So fill your tank!""

The party is also running radio ads against the carbon tax in Saint John, Ottawa, Toronto and Winnipeg, among other markets.

“This effort will be about informing Canadians about the cost of this Liberal tax on everyday items, including the price of gas, and how for wealthy Liberals like Justin Trudeau, an extra $100 a month on bills might not be a big deal, but it matters a lot to a family trying to make their household budget last to the end of the month,” Conservative Party spokesperson Cory Hann said in an email to CTV News.

Hann said there will also be co-ordinated social media campaigns and door-to-door canvassing efforts in the affected provinces over the weekend.

The Liberal government is requiring provinces to impose a price on carbon emissions, starting at $20 per tonne this year and rising by $10 per tonne annually until it hits $50 in 2022. Since Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and New Brunswick have refused to introduce their own carbon pricing plans, Ottawa is imposing its own tax on them.

The Liberals have said the carbon tax is necessary to combat the effects of climate change, and pointed out that rebates will be available to the residents of the four provinces through the tax system.

Scheer, in conversation with Global News’ Mercedes’ Stephenson, was seemingly referring to comments made by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau several years ago, suggesting that China’s authoritarian political system had contributed to their economic success.

“There’s a level of admiration I actually have for China, because their basic dictatorship is allowing them to actually turn their economy around on a dime and say, ‘We need to go green … we need to start investing in solar,” Trudeau said at a women’s event in 2013.

Trudeau received criticism for his comments at the time and later took to Twitter to offer clarification.

“I pointed out that globally, Canada is up against big countries (China, for one) that can address some major issues quickly,” he wrote on Twitter at the time. “It’s ridiculous for anyone to suggest that I of all people would trade our rights and freedoms for any other system of [government].”

Scheer went on to comment on the recent decision by the Chinese government to stop accepting shipments of Canadian canola oil. Earlier this month, China started blocking canola imports from Canada, citing the detection of “hazardous organisms.” International Trade Minister Jim Carr, however, denied this claim, as Global News previously reported.

The canola dispute comes shortly after comes Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Vancouver on behalf of the U.S.

Tensions between Canada and China have increased since she was arrested, as two Canadians in China were arrested and remain detained on espionage charges. The international community has called for their release.

Scheer blames the emerging trade obstacles on Trudeau’s handling of Chinese relations.

“Farmers in this situation are paying for the mistakes that Justin Trudeau has made,” he said.

Trudeau pledged near the end of 2018 that Canada was looking to broaden trade opportunities with China, potentially leading to an eventual free trade agreement between the two countries.

Scheer, however, suggested during his conversation with Stephenson that a free trade deal may be premature, given the robustness of China’s economy when compared to Canada’s.

The opposition leader also touched on several top-of-mind topics for Canadians.

Scheer also suggested that the SNC-Lavalin scandal currently plaguing the Liberals is only contributing to tensions with China.

“We have a very tense situation with the CFO of Huawei being with the extradition process, and our responsibility as a government, as a Canadian government, has been [that] we don’t interfere in the rule of law, we don’t interfere in criminal court cases, we respect the independence of our judiciary. That was the message to China,” he said.

“A couple weeks later, there’s Justin Trudeau interfering in a criminal court case, putting pressure on the attorney general to get a better outcome for his well-connected friends. That, I believe, is a big part of why this situation with China is further deteriorating,” he continued.

He encouraged Canadians to “put pressure” on Justin Trudeau to cooperate with the ethics’ committee investigation into the SNC-Lavalin affair, which gets underway next week.

“What we know for sure is that there is more to be said,” Scheer told the crowd. “Right now, [Trudeau] is engaged in a cover-up the likes of which we’ve never seen. He’s used a CAD$40 billion budget to distract us from it, making it the most expensive cover up in the history of cover ups.”

Since the story broke in early February, Trudeau and several close advisers have been facing accusations of pressuring the then-attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, to grant a remediation agreement to the embattled engineering firm SNC-Lavalin amid charges of fraud and corruption.

Trudeau countered Wilson-Raybould’s account of their conversations, saying that he and his advisers simply hoped to confer with her about her decision rather than apply pressure. Opposition members, including Scheer, have been consistent in calling for the prime minister to resign.

Both Scheer and Trudeau are ramping up their public appearances as they kick off an election year. Recent polls suggest that amid the SNC-Lavalin affair, Scheer’s Conservatives are beginning to gain headway on the Liberal leader’s largely bruised popularity.

“(Prime Minister Justin Trudeau) thinks today’s budget will distract Canadians from all of this. He is using the budget — a critical element of any government’s agenda — as nothing more than a political prop in an unprecedented cover-up,” Andrew Scheer said Tuesday.

The committee’s decision came on the same day as the federal budget was being tabled. So Scheer wove that into his broader criticism of the government, describing the budget as a “political prop” by a prime minister determined to divert the public’s attention from the scandal engulfing his government.

That raises a question that cuts to the core of this week’s two big national political stories, the budget and the everlasting SNC-Lavalin saga: can the regularly scheduled tabling of a federal budget be described as a political prop?

Spoiler alert: The Canadian Press Baloney Meter is a dispassionate examination of political statements culminating in a ranking of accuracy on a scale of “no baloney” to “full of baloney” (complete methodology below).

Scheer’s remark earns a rating of “a lot of baloney” — the statement is mostly inaccurate but contains elements of truth.

The facts

The SNC-Lavalin controversy slammed like a runaway train into Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s delivery of Tuesday’s budget, the government’s final spending blueprint before a federal election scheduled for this fall.

While the budget lockup was underway several blocks east of Parliament Hill, the Liberal majority on the House of Commons justice committee voted to end its five-week inquiry into the controversy, enraging Conservatives and New Democrats alike.

By the time Morneau reached the Commons to deliver his 4 p.m. budget speech, he faced some serious Conservative roadblocks. The Conservatives forced a vote on a motion to allow MPs on the fisheries committee to travel. Several Tory MPs voted both for and against.

They then stood — one at a time — to apologize for voting twice. But they each also managed to also denounce the Liberals’ earlier decision, which prevented former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould from reappearing before the justice committee. Chants of “Let her speak” filled the chamber, while more points of privilege and points of order ate up the clock.

Morneau’s speech was delayed an hour, and when he finally rose to speak, he was drowned out by opposition MPs. Eventually, the Conservatives walked out of the Commons, with Scheer calling the committee’s decision “an assault on democracy.”

Morneau’s budget aimed billions in new spending at a variety of areas ç from pharmacare to retraining workers to helping first-time homebuyers. It was a deficit-friendly, pre-election platform that contrasted with the Conservative mantra of balanced books. Morneau decided the government would use up a big windfall, and run near-term deficits of almost $20 billion. He offered no timeline for bringing the budget back to balance, and made no apologies.

The budget document credited a stronger economy for an extra $27.8 billion in revenue over the next six years, compared with the numbers in the government’s fall update. The new budget will spend about $22.8 billion of that additional cash, and the government said it has earmarked another $4 billion in spending since the fall update.

Morneau called this “investments to grow our economy for the long term – while we bring the books back towards balance.”

Trudeau, meanwhile, accused the Conservatives of using the SNC-Lavalin affair to avoid talking about their own “failed” approach to the economy. “The Conservatives still don’t want to talk about jobs, about growth, about investing in Canadians because they’re realizing they have no plan,” he said.

What the experts say

Financial experts say that while budgets can certainly be used by governments to make political gains, they are an annual ritual of government that are scheduled to take place on dates that are set weeks in advance.

“The content of the budget is the real issue, and here the claim the budget was used as a prop is weak,” said Brett House, the deputy chief economist at Scotiabank. “Though the revenue windfall was spent, and we would have preferred to see it saved, the amount was not large and wasn’t devoted to a big signature project or program.”

Kevin Page, the former parliamentary budget officer, agrees there is no single big initiative in the budget to draw attention away from other issues such as SNC-Lavalin.

“Budgets are not mandatory but it is a long-standing tradition and a best practice to table a fiscal plan before the start of the fiscal year,” said Page, the president of the Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy at the University of Ottawa.

“This budget does not look like a prop.”

Doug Porter, the chief economist of BMO Financial Group, says there is little doubt the government would like to shift the focus to other matters, including the economy and fiscal policy.

“But, it’s also fair to say that, as the quote suggests, a budget is ‘a critical element of any government’s agenda,”‘ he said.

Porter said the convention has generally become to unveil a new budget in February or March before the start of the new fiscal year on April 1.

“It’s a convention that is followed by all 10 provinces as well.”

The verdict

The government usually releases a budget at this time of year. Though a lot is riding on the pre-election blueprint the Liberals tabled Tuesday, and Trudeau wasted no time in using it to attack the Conservative record, it didn’t feature a showcase signature initiative aimed at changing the political channel.

For those reasons, Scheer’s assertion that the Liberals were using the budget as a political prop contains “a lot of baloney.”

It’s in the pizzagate.”

Scheer gamely answered the question as though he hadn’t just been asked about one of the most notorious (and widely debunked) conspiracies in modern political history. He later claimed to have not heard the question. To be fair to him, the audience began clapping loudly at the man’s suggestion that one of the biggest charities in America was secretly trafficking and sacrificing children. In any event, the question was indicative of the conundrum Scheer now faces, as he attempts to harness the raucous strain of anti-Trudeau animus sweeping across the country: embrace the motivated populist anger of these crowds, along with the unhinged bits seemingly inherent in them, or cede this support to his rightward rival, Maxime Bernier and the People’s Party of Canada. Scheer has chosen a third option, which is to welcome the crowds while denying the ugly bits even exist — even as they pop up in front of Scheer’s very eyes. Consider his February appearance at a rally organized by United We Roll, which has a well-established connection to the country’s yellow vest movement, the proudly anti-immigrant group that sprung up in the wake of a similar movement in France.

Article Continued Below

Scheer’s speech, which focused on Trudeau’s alleged hatred of the oil and gas industry, was a play for truckers and their supporters, United We Roll’s ostensible supporters. Yet an apparent conspiracy-obsessed heckler peppered his three-minute spiel with familiar “He’s attacking your children” rhetoric, while another wondered out loud, in both official languages, what Scheer was going to do about the United Nations. A sign outside Ottawa’s West Block also critiqued the U.N. and said Trudeau should be charged with treason. The relationship between Scheer and these populist crowds is mutually beneficial. He gets a friendly audience, while this audience has the implied stamp of approval from the man who may well be the next prime minister. The conspiratorial types who keep showing are just an unfortunate by-product, it seems. When I asked a Conservative adviser about them, he shrugged his shoulders. “We can’t control who shows up to these events,” he told me, seemingly by rote. Yet it is difficult to understate the danger of Scheer’s gambit. By appearing at events like United We Roll, Scheer gives legitimacy to voices that would otherwise (and deservedly) exist only on the fringes of Canada’s political discourse — and which have become notably loud and brazen over the last several years. It used to be that Trudeau’s critics pilloried the prime minister for his conspicuous liberalism. Now some are calling for his head. “You are working for your globalist partners. I wonder how much they are paying you to betray Canada,” a woman said to Trudeau during Regina town hall last January. “What do we do with traitors in Canada, Mr. Trudeau? We used to hang them, hang them for treason.” Scheer is in a difficult spot. Populist fury against the current government is widespread and politically active. Yet emboldened in part by the example of scorched-earth nationalism espoused by the current American president, it has also become decidedly more visceral and conspiracy-oriented as we march closer to the October election.

By all means, Scheer should criticize Trudeau for being an out-of-touch, tax-and-spend elite. But he should just as conspicuously call out those would-be supporters who believe the 23rd prime minister is but a product of their conspiracy-addled nightmares.

Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer told a crowd at the Manning Centre Conference on Saturday that a Conservative government would balance the federal budget, but wouldn’t say by when.

“Yes, we will balance the budget,” Scheer said to applause at the conservative networking event, during a Q&A with Global News’ Mercedes Stephenson.

Scheer said balancing the budget would be done through “a combination of big ticket items with controlling the rate of growth.”

“There’s been such rapid increases in the rate of growth of government spending that we can get a lot of the way there just by restricting the growth of government spending back to closer to inflation and population growth,” Scheer said.

Scheer said a Conservative government would cut funding of the Canada Infrastructure Bank, which was established under the current Liberal government, as well as to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.

Scheer offered little specifics about when a Conservative government would deliver a balanced budget however, only saying it would be “over a shorter period of time,” if elected in the October general election.

The Trudeau government presented their final budget of this mandate, which projects a $19.7 billion deficit for 2019-20. In 2015, the Liberals ran on a campaign promise of returning to a balanced budget by the upcoming year. They have yet to post a surplus or an annual deficit less than $14 billion since assuming office that year. In this year’s budget, the Liberals are projecting the deficit to fall slightly next year, before declining to $9.8 billion in 2023-24.

But it's part of a new strategy from the Conservative Party of Canada.

People in provinces without a carbon pricing system in place — including Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick — have been getting a text message from Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer.

The party pulled phone numbers from its own database, but also used software that randomly generates phone numbers based on area codes, meaning some people who've never shared their phone number with the party got the texts.

The message is a reminder that the national carbon tax set to take hold on April 1 and that gas prices are going up 4.6 cents on the same day.

A text message sent from Andrew Scheer to many Canadian reminded people about the national carbon tax set to take hold on April 1. (Paul Dornstauder/CBC)

Victor Henriquez, a public relations specialist based in Montreal, says it's a bold move by the conservatives.

""It brings the feeling of proximity to people who already agree with the contemporary party on this position,"" he said.

""Now the problem can be for people who don't agree with them and people who are not happy about the fact that they received a message on their cell phone from someone that is not supposed to have the number.""

Proceed with caution

Henriquez said using text messages to spread political messages began in the U.S. in the early 2000s and it's now making its way into Canada.

""This campaign is a good example of what technology can bring to politics and it will be very interesting to see what kind of effect it has on people to receive a text message from someone you don't know.""

It's important for politicians to get their message directly to voters, said Enriquez, but the party needs to be cautious about the amount of text messages it sends.

""People really react if they receive that kind of message too often,"" he said.

""It's very important for the Conservative Party to use this as a test but to be careful in how they use it [and] how often they use this technology,"" he said. ""If not, it can be a slingshot against them.""

Message doesn't include all information

An emailed statement from the Conservative party says the move is, ""a way to communicate with voters in a new way. This will include radio ads, text messages, ads on social media and door-to-door.""

Federal Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said the text message leaves out important information about the carbon tax.

""It would be useful if the text actually told the whole story and said in addition to the change in the price you're actually going to be getting back more money than it's costing you,"" he told reporters on Thursday.

""That's the part of the equation that that Mr. Scheer has rather conveniently avoided.""

The leaders of Canada’s largest labour organization and a prominent national Muslim group say Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is emboldening far-right extremists by failing to call out Islamophobia following the New Zealand mosque shootings and attending events with people who promote hate speech.

Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) president Hassan Yussuff criticized Mr. Scheer’s response to the shootings at two mosques in Christchurch last week that left 50 people dead and dozens more injured. Mr. Scheer issued a lengthy statement about the terrorism attacks Friday after his initial Twitter message on the shootings were criticized for failing to mention that the victims were Muslims.

“Unfortunately the opposition leader had to be shamed to do a 180-degree turn to actually acknowledge what happened. Had he not been shamed, I’m not sure he would have changed his position,” Mr. Yussuf said Thursday.

Ihsaan Gardee, the executive director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM), said Mr. Scheer’s initial decision to avoid saying that the victims were Muslims and the attacks took place at mosques “felt very deliberate.”

“There is a real danger that this kind of association helps to embolden others to feel like they now have licence to act out on their hatred and on their ideologies,” Mr. Gardee said.

Mr. Yussuf also condemned Mr. Scheer for sharing a stage with “racists and bigots” at a protest led by a convoy of pro-pipeline, anti-carbon-tax demonstrators in February. Former Rebel Media personality Faith Goldy also attended the rally on Parliament Hill, where she told Indigenous counterprotesters to leave Canada if they didn’t like it.

Mr. Yussuf said Mr. Scheer should know better than to attend events with right-wing figures such as Ms. Goldy.

A spokesman for Mr. Scheer said the Tory leader was “very clear and emphatic” in his condemnation of the anti-Muslim hatred that motivated the New Zealand mosque attacks.

“Further, in his speech to the House of Commons earlier this week, he called for action to defend a concept of Canada rooted in shared civic values, respect for the principle of universal human dignity and freedom of religion for all,” said Brock Harrison, Mr. Scheer’s spokesman.

The CLC and the NCCM shared their concerns at a media conference about the rise of Islamophobia in Canadian workplaces, where they released a new report on the matter.

The report cites a steady rise in hate crimes targeting Muslim communities in Canada over the past several years, fuelled by far-right politics at home and abroad. It makes several recommendations aimed at reinforcing the responsibility of employers to educate management and staff about legal obligations around human rights and religious accommodations for Muslims. It also calls on governments to do more to support anti-racism awareness campaigns and develop strategies to combat online hate speech.

“What we’re talking about here is the everyday micro-aggressions that inform this fearful environment that many Canadian Muslims exist in and infiltrates every aspect of their daily life,” said Leila Nasr, NCCM communications co-ordinator.

Andrew Scheer says criticism over his initial failure to mention that Muslims were targeted in the recent mass murder in New Zealand is “completely baseless” and driven by “disgusting” Liberal efforts to score political points from the tragedy.

But in answering a question Saturday about how he deals with that criticism, the federal Conservative leader once again initially made no reference to Muslims.

“I deal with it by pointing out that the criticisms are completely baseless,” Scheer told the Manning Networking Conference, an annual gathering of this country’s conservative thinkers, strategists and politicians.

Story continues below advertisement

“When you look at statements I’ve made condemning hateful ideologies, those who would promote any type of superiority of one race or religion over the others, I condemn that unequivocally.”

Scheer noted that the second statement he issued on the day of the New Zealand shootings “absolutely did include the reference to the faith community that was attacked,” although he did not at first identify that faith community.

On March 15, an avowed white supremacist shot and killed 50 Muslim worshippers at two New Zealand mosques. In a statement posted that day on Twitter, Scheer condemned the attacks as “a despicable act of evil” against “peaceful worshippers,” without specifically mentioning where they occurred or who was targeted.

A few hours later – after the initial statement drew criticism even from top aides of former prime minister Stephen Harper – Scheer issued a second statement, which he referred to Saturday as his “official statement.” It specifically referred to the horrific “terror attack on two New Zealand mosques” and voiced his “profound condemnation of this cowardly and hateful attack on the Muslim community.”

On Saturday, Scheer blamed the Liberals for stirring up the controversy, accusing them of attempting “to score cheap political points in a very disgusting manner.” Moreover, he argued that initial tweets by Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale and Governor General Julie Payette also didn’t specifically mention mosques or Muslims.

Later, as he took questions from members of the audience, Scheer was asked why he’s never said the word “Islamophobia.”

“I don’t believe that’s true,” he responded, noting that all parties supported a motion last week in the House of Commons. That motion, which he didn’t describe, condemned the mosque attacks and affirmed the need to “confront hatred, Islamophobia, and white supremacy, in all their forms.”

“I reject anyone who would speak out based on Islamophobic principles, whether or not that’s somebody who is trying to lump all people of the Muslim faith in together or whether it’s people who are trying to antagonize elements of society to have a more negative reaction to those who practice that faith,” Scheer added.

“To me the important thing is to speak out against those who in any way give oxygen or space to those who are trying to promote one group of people over the other.”

Scheer also used his appearance at the Manning conference to promise that a Conservative government would balance the federal budget — but he didn’t say when.

He said the Liberals have made such increases to government spending that a Conservative government could get most of the way to balance simply by holding annual spending increases to the rate of inflation and population growth. As well, he said billions could be saved by scrapping “some big-ticket items” introduced by the Liberals such as the federal infrastructure bank.

The longer Prime Minister Justin Trudeau goes racking up large annual deficits, the harder it will be return to balance, Scheer suggested. But he said Canadians have “a window” in this fall’s federal election to “limit the damage and get back to balanced budgets over a shorter period of time.”

Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s latest budget forecasts deficits of almost $20 billion in each of the next two years, declining to just under $10 billion in five years. It makes no attempt to forecast when the budget might be balanced.","Despite criticism, Andrew Scheer again declines to say victims of New Zealand massacre were Muslims",The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-despite-criticism-andrew-scheer-again-declines-to-say-victims-of-new/

The president of the Canadian Labour Congress, Hassan Yussuff, told reporters Thursday that Scheer should be held responsible for failing to condemn yellow-vest protesters who showed up in Ottawa in February to demonstrate against pipeline delays while spewing anti-immigrant rhetoric.

That is a fundamental, I think, failing on his part, and I condemn his behaviour,"" Yussuff said at an event outlining efforts by the union movement to combat Islamophobia and the steady rise in hate crimes targeting Muslims.

""I don't think he should be excused for it, because he should know better, and if he doesn't, something is fundamentally wrong with his leadership, in my view,"" Hassan said.

Last week, the Conservative leader was criticized for issuing a statement in response to the massacre in New Zealand without mentioning that the attacks had taken place in mosques, against Muslims gathered for Friday prayers.

The Liberals, Scheer said, had tried to ""score cheap political points in a very disgusting manner"" by politicizing his original statement and the attacks. The Liberals, he noted, did not levy the same criticism against Governor General Julie Payette's comments, which also did not mention the victims were Muslims.

The Tories, he said, are an open, inclusive and welcoming party for people of all faiths and backgrounds.

In a speech in the House of Commons on Monday, the prime minister said events such as the carnage in Christchurch were precisely the right time to talk about politics.

""The best way to support people is to acknowledge that there is a problem and take concrete steps to fix it,"" he said. ""As a global community, we have a choice to make. Will we denounce our leaders who turn a blind eye to those who incite violence?

""Undoubtedly, I feel more secure, among all the countries, in Canada right now,"" she said as Trudeau smiled, his head bowed. She received a standing ovation from the crowd.

The Liberals have sought to differentiate themselves from the Tories vis-à-vis their relationship with Muslim Canadians.

Scheer, in some ways, has helped them. He voted, for example, against a motion two years ago condemning Islamophobia and all forms of systemic racism and religious discrimination. The motion called for a study on Islamophobia, data collection on hate crimes and a government strategy to deal with religious discrimination.

Scheer argued that the motion, by singling out one faith, was not inclusive.

At a press conference this morning, Scheer demanded that the standing committee on access to information, privacy and ethics agree to hold a study of the SNC-Lavalin affair. The standing committee on justice and human rights ended a study of the matter last week, prompting accusations by opposition members of a Liberal coverup.

Conservative members will put forward a motion at tomorrow’s committee meeting, which will ask Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to waive all constraints currently preventing Wilson-Raybould from speaking fully.

In recent days, there has been public debate over whether Wilson-Raybould can speak freely without penalty in the House of Commons under parliamentary privilege or if another waiver from Trudeau is needed.

Scheer said the concern about parliamentary immunity is it doesn’t “absolve” the former ministers from the oaths they had taken, referring to the cabinet pledge to the Privy Council Office to “keep secret all matters committed and revealed to me in this capacity, or that shall be secretly treated of in Council.”

“That is what Justin Trudeau waived for Ms. Wilson-Raybould but only for a narrow period of time,” Scheer said, adding that Wilson-Raybould and Philpott should be allowed to speak about events occurring after the former justice minister resigned from cabinet on Feb. 12.

“Clearly there were events that happened after her time as attorney general.”

Last month, Trudeau waived solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidences about the SNC-Lavalin affair, but the order-in-council only applies to Wilson-Raybould’s time as attorney general and excludes discussions between her and the director of public prosecutions.

Asked about the potential repercussions of Wilson-Raybould speaking in the House, Scheer said there are “clearly consequences to people’s reputations when they’ve taken oaths.”

“We’re saying don’t put them in that position if you’ve really got nothing to hide,” he said.

Scheer added that after a number of Liberal MPs recently said Wilson-Raybould and Philpott should speak their mind in order to settle the affair, there is now “consensus” on both sides of the House that both former ministers should be able to speak freely.

The committee motion will also ask Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board President Jane Philpott to testify before April 5 and to allow the committee to table its findings in Parliament. Philpott resigned from cabinet on March 4 over the Liberal government’s handling of the SNC-Lavalin controversy.

There are nine voting members of the ethics committee, including six Liberals, two Conservatives, and one NDP. The chair, Conservative MP Bob Zimmer, does not have a vote.

The SNC-Lavalin controversy began on Feb. 7 when the Globe and Mail reported allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office inappropriately pressured Wilson-Raybould to reverse a decision made by the director of public prosecutions to move forward with a criminal case involving the Montreal-based engineering giant.

Since then, Trudeau’s principal secretary Gerry Butts, Wilson-Raybould, and Philpott have resigned from their jobs. Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick has also announced his retirement.

At a press conference in Ottawa Monday, Andrew Scheer again called on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to fully waive solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence for Wilson-Raybould ahead of an ethics committee meeting Tuesday on the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Scheer also said Trudeau must waive cabinet confidentiality for Philpott, who told Maclean's magazine last week that there is more to the controversy that must come out.

Watch:

The Tory leader noted how some Liberal MPs have, in recent days, publicly challenged Wilson-Raybould and Philpott to speak freely about the matter in the House of Commons, where parliamentary privilege protects members from facing legal action for their words.

Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould upped the ante in an interview with Global's ""The West Block"" that aired Sunday, saying that if both ex-ministers feel more needs to be said, they should ""put that on the record.""

""This is clearly a coordinated communications attempt over the last few days,"" Scheer told reporters.

There is ""now consensus on both sides of the House that both former ministers should be able to speak freely about their involvement in the SNC-Lavalin affair,"" he said.

If Liberals want to hear more from Wilson-Raybould and Philpott — who resigned as Treasury Board president over the government's handling of the controversy — then the prime minister should ""make it official"" and absolve them of constraints, the Tory leader said.

'When I take oaths, it's serious'

But Scheer, a former House Speaker, poured cold water on the idea that Wilson-Raybould and Philpott can easily stand up in the House and air things out.

While parliamentary privilege protects MPs from ""recourse about what they say,"" Scheer offered, it does not absolve them of the ethical and reputational consequences of breaking oaths without a greenlight from the prime minister.

""When I take oaths, it's serious. It's a matter of conscience for me,"" Scheer said. ""It's not something that I would break. There are clearly consequences to people's reputations when they've taken an oath. We're saying, don't put them in that position.""

Current and former cabinet ministers are part of the Privy Council, a body appointed by the Governor General on the recommendation of the prime minister to ""advise the Queen on issues of importance to the country."" Membership in the exclusive club comes with the title of ""Honourable"" and lasts for life, unless the appointment is withdrawn by the Governor General.

As a condition for joining cabinet, both Wilson-Raybould and Philpott swore they would:

""... be a true and faithful servant to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, as a member of Her Majesty's Privy Council for Canada. I will in all things to be treated, debated and resolved in Privy Council, faithfully, honestly and truly declare my mind and my opinion. I shall keep secret all matters committed and revealed to me in this capacity, or that shall be secretly treated of in Council. Generally, in all things I shall do as a faithful and true servant ought to do for Her Majesty. So help me God.""

Scheer took the same oath when he was sworn into the Privy Council in 2017. The Tory leader thanked Trudeau at the time for the honour.

Trudeau partially waived solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidences for Wilson-Raybould ahead of her explosive testimony to the House justice committee last month.

The waiver allowed the former attorney general to speak about the issues surrounding SNC-Lavalin's criminal prosecution when she served in the role, but not about the events that transpired after she was shuffled to Veterans Affairs on Jan. 14.

Over four hours, Wilson-Raybould told MPs that she faced sustained and inappropriate pressure from Trudeau and other government officials, when she was attorney general, to help SNC-Lavalin avoid a criminal trial on fraud and bribery charges.

Though her words sparked immediate calls from Tories for Trudeau to resign, the prime minister denied Wilson-Raybould's version of events. His former principal secretary later testified that Wilson-Raybould did not raise concerns about inappropriate pressure until she was shuffled from her powerful role.

Speaking about the issue with reporters in Maple Ridge, B.C. Monday, Trudeau said his government issued an ""unprecedented waiver"" which allowed Wilson-Raybould to speak about the specific issue of whether or not she faced undue pressure over SNC-Lavalin when she was attorney general.

Trudeau also said he had a ""cordial conversation"" with Wilson-Raybould last week. The Vancouver-Granville MP has said she will seek re-election as a Liberal MP this fall, as will Philpott in the Ontario riding of Markham-Stouffville.

""I look forward to continuing to engage with both Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott as they make their way forward,"" he said. ""They have both indicated that they look forward to running again as Liberals in the next election and I look forward to continuing to have their strong and thoughtful voices as part of our team.""

Wilson-Raybould promises more 'evidence'

Asked if he agreed with the growing number of Liberal MPs encouraging Wilson-Raybould and Philpott to speak out in the House, Trudeau said those are decisions to be made by the ex-ministers.

""What we have done as a government is grant an unprecedented waiver so that a full airing could happen at the justice committee of everything in regards to the SNC-Lavalin file and the time that is in question, when the former minister of justice was minister of justice,"" he said.

Last week, Liberal MPs on the justice committee ended the group's investigation into the matter. On Friday, Wilson-Raybould wrote to the committee to says she will make a written submission to the group and provide copies of emails and text messages she referenced during her testimony.

""I also have relevant facts and evidence in my possession that further clarify statements I made and elucidate the accuracy and nature of statements by witnesses in testimony that came after my committee appearance,"" Wilson-Raybould wrote.

Note that earlier this month Scheer neglected to include ...,"When asked about his apparent refusal to use the word ""Islamophobia,"" he denied that this is true and referenced a recent motion condemning the mosque attack that passed in the House of Commons.

He said: ""I reject anyone who would speak out based on Islamophobic principles, whether or not that's somebody who's trying to lump all people of the Muslim faith together or whether it's people who are trying to antagonize elements of society to have a more negative reaction to those who practise that faith.""

It's interesting: he rejects them and yet he speaks directly to them and on the same stage as them. February's United We Roll event where Scheer and Goldy spoke respectively wasn't only about pipelines and economic anxiety.

According to the Canadian Anti-Hate Network, a nonprofit that monitors hate groups, the rebranded United We Roll movement (previously Yellow Vest Convoy) is also home to many members who peddle in racist conspiracy theory and hate speech about Muslims, immigrants, government, and media.

None of this is to say that Scheer is responsible for any attack against any group. Crazy hateful people do crazy hateful things all the time absent the influence of politicians.

But when they do these things, it's imperative that our leaders name and embrace the communities they target.

It's imperative that leaders do this immediately — not hours later after everybody else tells them to. And this one should be obvious: it's imperative that they decline to speak at the same events as neo-Nazi sympathizers.

Scheer's defensiveness in the face of wholly legitimate criticism this month is not only inappropriate; it undermines any genuine statement he does make condemning white nationalism.

If he truly wants to prove to Canadians that he isn't courting racist voters, he should do what the Toronto Maple Leafs did earlier this month when defenceman Morgan Reilly was accused of uttering a homophobic slur on the ice.

An NHL investigation cleared Reilly of the charge but Leafs management held a press conference anyway devoted entirely to the problem of homophobia in hockey.

This is how you clear things up. Not by going on the defensive and certainly not by saying one thing and doing another.

Of all the reasons to give Justin Trudeau a pass on the SNC-Lavalin affair, the one the Liberals and their supporters seem most confident of is the existence of Andrew Scheer.

It’s pretty clear, at this point, that Justin Trudeau and his staff put pressure on the top law enforcement officer in the country to try to affect her decision about publicly prosecuting a large engineering company.

The Liberals are trying to suggest that it’s all a big misunderstanding and that the attorney general misinterpreted some everyday talk about this big issue. We’re all friends here, they say. Nothing to see here, they say.

And certain portions of the public have been more than ready to lap up whatever excuse the Liberals come up with because they are terrified of the thought of Andrew Scheer as prime minister.

Of course, Andrew Scheer’s existence is as relevant as my kid’s conjunctivitis to whether Trudeau acted wrongly or rightly.

If he was wrong, he was wrong even if you don’t want to vote for Scheer (or Singh or Bernier).

But what do you do, when everybody is due a thrashing? Holding your nose at the ballot box is a cliché because we accept that sometimes there is no great option.

If we should electorally punish those who do the wrong thing for political reasons, should we not also punish those who choose not to do the right things for political reasons?

One of the reasons people are so uncomfortable with Scheer is because of his and his party’s rhetoric over the past couple years on the topic of immigration, the border and other Trumpy topics.

Among all the many topics they can choose from, the Conservatives have been loudest about issues that, perhaps unsurprisingly, roil up the relatively tiny portion of Canadians who love to bash out angry caps-locked comments on Facebook.

To keep those folks from fleeing to whatever Maxime Bernier is doing, the Conservatives have railed against a tepid condemnation of Islamophobia and given voice to those fearmongering about a similarly bland United Nations migration agreement that will have not a whit of impact on Canadian policy.

There is little in Scheer’s background to suggest he is not a typical middle-of-the-road Canadian Conservative likely to continue with typically unoffensive Conservative immigration policy. He says the right things when pushed, and needs the votes of the huge number of Canadians who prize this country’s reputation for tolerance.

But recently, Scheer seems to have decided that the best political move is to avoid confronting those people who say Muslim immigrants are to be feared, not welcomed.

As a conservative, Scheer has credibility with those who detest Trudeau and are irrationally afraid of Muslims. At a town hall, John McCain famously defended Barack Obama as a good man, even as he strove to defeat him at the ballot box.

Scheer, similarly, has a chance – one that isn’t open to others – to try to de-radicalize a fearful segment of voters, while making it clear that a change in government won’t alter how welcoming Canada is to Muslims. He could forcefully and repeatedly try to reach that segment of the population and convince them that while he thinks policies should be changed, immigration does not pose a safety risk to Canadians.

He has not yet done so, but it’s still not too late.

Making decisions for political reasons is often, and thankfully, the worst political move of all.

Sometimes it’s best to just do the right thing and sleep well at night.

Singh intends to announce the policy proposal Friday during his keynote speech at the Broadbent Institute’s Progress Summit, an annual gathering of progressive thinkers and New Democrats near Parliament Hill.

In an interview with the Star on Thursday, Singh said he wants to increase the proportion of capital gains profits that are taxed by the federal government. This “inclusion rate” is currently set at 50 per cent — meaning only half the profits people make by selling property or securities investments is subject to income tax. The NDP wants to increase that rate to 75 per cent, which Singh said party researchers predict would bring an additional $2.7 billion in tax revenue to the federal government each year. Capital gains are profits made from selling real estate — other than your primary residence — and from the sale of other investments, like stocks or certain businesses, that aren’t held in registered retirement or tax-free savings accounts. “The vast, vast majority of people that use this benefit are the wealthiest, the richest people in Canada,” Singh said, contrasting the capital gains inclusion rate with how most people’s salaries are taxed.

“We want a fairer system.” Capital gains taxes have been around for decades, and the inclusion rate Singh wants to increase has been changed as well — most recently in 2000, when the Liberal government led by Jean Chrétien slashed it from 75 to 50 per cent. Singh would reverse that change.

Article Continued Below

There were several media reports ahead of the 2017 budget that saw business analysts warn that increasing the proportion of capital gains that gets taxed would deter investment and innovation in Canada. Singh dismissed such concerns on Thursday, arguing a 75 per cent rate still gives capital gains better tax treatment than employee income. He added that the change would bring in more money that an NDP government would use to extend public health care to cover prescription medicine, dental and eye care, as well to build affordable housing units and fund a transition to cleaner energy. “There’s got to be some fairness to pay for the things that people need,” he said. “This is one of the ways we can do it.” The proposal to increase the tax on capital gains follows an announcement last fall, when Singh touted a trio of policy changes to crack down on tax dodgers and prevent the wealthy from hiding their money. He said the NDP would make changes to prevent companies from moving money overseas to avoid corporate taxes, and ban special types of company shares — called bearer bonds — that don’t require disclosure of who owns them. Singh also called on the Liberal government to close the so-called stock option “loophole,” which allows corporate executives to avoid income taxes by receiving compensation in company shares instead of through regular paycheques. The Liberals banned the issuance of new bearer bonds in legislation last year, and the Trudeau government announced in the recent federal budget that it intends to cap stock compensation at $200,000 per year so high income earners no longer benefit disproportionately from the option. But Singh said he does not believe the Liberals will follow through on the stock option limit, contending Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has demonstrated he is beholden to business interests through the SNC-Lavalin controversy and by not moving faster to create a government pharmacare program for all Canadians. “The track record of this government now makes it clear that they’re not going to make changes that will help out everyday families,” Singh said. Friday’s policy announcement is part of a series that Singh and the NDP plan to make in the coming weeks. The party has said its entire 2019 election platform will be public before the end of spring.

The federal NDP leader pitched the plan Friday during a keynote speech to the annual Broadbent Institute's Progress Summit, which brings together progressives and New Democrats from across the country.

It is expected to form a key plank in the NDP's election platform this fall alongside other policy proposals the party says will target the rich, pay for more services for Canadians and cool the housing market.

""A fairer tax system means more funding for services that Canadians need like universal pharmacare, child care, affordable housing and post-secondary education,"" Singh said in a statement.

Watch: Singh calls out Quebec's secularism bill

While the government currently taxes 50 per cent of profits made on investments, known as capital gains, the NDP wants to increase that threshold — known as the ""inclusion rate"" — to 75 per cent.

The party estimates the move, which would also apply to the sale of most real estate but not primary residences, tax-free savings accounts or registered retirement plans, would generate nearly $3 billion in additional revenue for the federal treasury.

""When you go to work, you're taxed on almost all of your income,"" Singh said. ""It doesn't make sense that someone making their money from investments is taxed on only half.""

The inclusion rate for capital gains has fluctuated since it was introduced in 1972, when it was 50 per cent. It was raised several times in the intervening years to a high of 75 per cent, before Jean Chretien's government cut it to its current rate in 2000.

A hotly debated topic

The question of raising the inclusion rate on capital gains has been hotly debated for years, with some suggesting it would address inequality and others arguing it would hurt Canadians' savings and make the country less attractive for investors.

New Democrats have also previously talked about closing a stock-option loophole and cracking down on the use of bearer shares and foreign tax havens they say help the rich hide their wealth and avoid paying their fair share of taxes.

The government in its most recent budget moved to address the stock-option loophole by putting a $200,000-limit on the tax-deductible amount on employee stock options.

The stock-option deduction works by taxing only 50 per cent of the earnings an employee receives when they cash in any stock options received as part of their compensation packages, if certain conditions are met.

The new limit appears aimed at tightening the loophole while acknowledging concerns that closing it entirely would make it more difficult for companies to attract talent and discourage start-ups.",Singh: New Democrats Will Tax The Rich To Pay For Pharmacare,HuffPost Canada,https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2019/03/29/jagmeet-singh-pharmacare_a_23702695/

OTTAWA – While the richest use loopholes to evade their taxes, regular people are paying the price. In a keynote speech at Broadbent Institute's Progress Summit, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh made an announcement that unlike Justin Trudeau's Liberal government, the NDP will have the courage to address our unfair tax system that is preventing Canadians from getting the public services they need.

“For far too long, people have been working hard to make ends meet, and they just want things to be a little easier. When you go to work, you’re taxed on almost all of your income. It doesn’t make sense that someone making their money from investments is taxed on only half,” said Singh. “Trudeau’s Liberals have refused to limit the capital gains tax benefit for the wealthiest. This is hurting hard-working Canadians who are forced to pay the price.”

To make our tax system fairer, Jagmeet Singh and the NDP will increase the capital gains inclusion rate from the current 50 to 75%. This plan will bring in almost $3 billion more in government revenue every year to fund the services Canadians need, like childcare, education, and housing. New Democrats are committed to a fairer and more progressive tax system and will get rid of tax loopholes for the wealthiest, by increasing taxes on investment profits and by getting tough on tax evasion.

As it stands, 88% of the capital gains tax benefit goes to the 1%. Under the Liberal tax plan, people earning less than $45,000 get nothing – and that’s the majority of Canadians. Meanwhile, those earning over three times that salary receive much higher tax cuts. This is unfair for people who are trying to build a better future for their families.

“A fairer tax system means more funding for services that Canadians need like universal pharmacare, childcare, affordable housing and post-secondary education,” added Singh. “Everybody wins when we deliver better services that Canadians can rely on.

Singh says his strategy in the House is to push for more affordable housing, an environmentally responsible economy, reconciliation with Indigenous peoples and better healthcare.

He says he'll treat his role as rooted in the Punjabi translation of the word 'leader,' which translates roughly into English as ""the one who serves.""

""We're going to have a tough road ahead of us,"" he said, acknowledging the party only has a few months to convince Canadians that the NDP is a viable option.

""Together we're going to change this country.""

The Canadian Press





OTTAWA -- Nearly 18 months after taking over the leadership of the federal New Democrats, Jagmeet Singh made his long-awaited parliamentary debut Monday as he became the first visible minority to lead a federal political party in the House of Commons.

Escorted into the chamber by his NDP lieutenants, Singh waved to supporters in the public gallery before claiming the seat he won in last month's byelection in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South.

That byelection -- made possible by the departure of former Burnaby MP Kennedy Stewart -- ended a 17-month exile of sorts for Singh, whose lack of a seat in the Commons made doing his job as leader that much more difficult.

Singh used his first question as leader to press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the issue of housing, citing a mother from his riding who bought a home she can no longer afford and whose children are losing hope about their futures.

""The prime minister is telling families like theirs to wait for help,"" Singh said. ""I believe better is possible. Will the government commit to building half a million affordable homes?""

Trudeau did no such thing, instead congratulating the NDP leader, welcoming him to the House and urging his party to support Liberal government efforts to reduce child poverty.

New Democrats are hoping Singh's presence in the House of Commons marks the start of a new era for the party and the end of a long, difficult stretch in the political wilderness that has been marked by fundraising difficulties and morale issues.",NDP's Jagmeet Singh makes history in House of Commons,CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/ndp-s-jagmeet-singh-makes-history-in-house-of-commons-1.4340972

TORONTO -- NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is set to release a memoir, ""Love & Courage,"" in the lead-up to the federal election.

Publisher Simon & Schuster says the book follows Singh, who is Sikh, from childhood as he learns lessons about overcoming adversity and the impact of not belonging.

Rather than a political memoir, it's being billed as a story about ""how strengthening the connection between us all is the way to build a better world.""

The title alludes to Singh's oft-invoked call for ""love and courage,"" which he deployed in a viral response to a heckler at a 2017 NDP leadership campaign event.

After taking the reins of the federal party, Singh earned a seat in the House of Commons in a byelection last month.

His sights are now set on the post of prime minister as Canadians prepare to vote in this fall's federal election.

""This book is the story of my family and my personal experiences growing up -- sometimes difficult ones. I often felt alone, unworthy, ashamed,"" Singh said in a statement.

""I hope this book helps some people feel less alone and know that they deserve love and happiness, no matter what they've gone through.""

The NDP’s standard bearer in the riding will be selected on Saturday.

The byelection already features an interesting cast of characters, including a jilted Conservative who lost a bid for her party’s candidacy and jumped to Maxime Bernier’s Peoples Party of Canada (PPC); a Green candidate who had a falling out with the NDP ahead of the last federal election; and a Liberal Indigenous candidate with as big a profile as Jody Wilson-Raybould when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recruited her for the Liberals in 2015.

Singh, who took a seat in the House of Commons for the first time last week after winning his own byelection in the greater Vancouver riding of Burnaby South last month, will greet the NDP candidate in Nanaimo on Sunday, his office told iPolitics.

A roster of four NDP candidates suggests the New Democrat’s confidence in the riding, despite a late entry into the race and a hike in Green Party support in the past years. Prime Minister Trudeau announced the byelection on March 24.

A day after Trudeau set the byelection date, he surfaced in Nanaimo to circulate and draw attention to a star Liberal candidate, who the party had announced only a week earlier. That candidate, Michelle Corfield, is a prominent and highly successful Indigenous leader who holds a doctorate from Simon Fraser University’s Beedie School of Business.

Corfield is also chair of the Nanaimo Port Authority, chair of the Legislative Council of Ucluelet First Nation and a founding member of a settlement trust at Ucluelet First Nation on the western coast of Vancouver Island. Corfield is an executive resident at the Beedie School’s Indigenous Business and Economic Development Knowledge Exchange.

Despite the credentials of his party’s candidate, or perhaps to ensure Corfield was the one in the limelight during an ongoing confrontation between Trudeau and one of his star 2015 candidates, Vancouver Liberal MP and former justice minister Wilson-Raybould, Trudeau declined to take questions from local news media.

Even with as prominent a candidate as Corfield, the Liberal party faces an uphill battle toward May 6.

Vancouver Island resisted the Liberal wave of 2015, voting in New Democrats in six of the island’s seven federal electoral districts. The seventh, Saanich—Gulf Islands, was won by Green Party Leader Elizabeth May for her second term in the House of Commons.

The contests were close and Angus Reid Institute’s polling analyst Shachi Kurl notes that Vancouver Island has been a tug-of-war between New Democrats and Conservatives over the past years.

“The island has a tendency to swing orange or blue,” Kurl said in a phone interview from her Vancouver office.

Nanaimo News Bulletin reporter Nicholas Pescod says he expects the NDP will continue to hold Nanaimo—Ladysmith. “I suspect the NDP will do well,” he said in a telephone interview from the News Bulletin newsroom.

Kurl noted low-turnout byelections can hinge on local organization, for which the NDP is famous in B.C.

Nanaimo—Ladysmith was left vacant after popular former NDP MP Sheila Malcolmson, announced last fall that she was making the jump to provincial politics. She resigned her Commons seat on Jan. 2 to contest and win a byelection in the provincial electoral district of Nanaimo. That Jan. 30 byelection was crucial for the survival of the province’s NDP coalition government.

For the May 6 federal byelection, the NDP field of four candidates also includes a prominent Indigenous candidate, Bob Chamberlin, who is vice-president of the long-established Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs and chief councillor with the Kwikwasutinuxw Haxwa’mis First Nation at the north end of Vancouver Island.

The other three NDP hopefuls include Lauren Sample, a former constituency assistant to Malcolmson, a past president of Nanaimo Pride, and a women’s rights advocate; Maeve O’Byrne, a founder of the Nanaimo and District Hospital Foundation who coaches volunteers working in refugee camps; and Fred Statham, whose electoral experience includes two attempts at election to Nanaimo city council.

The nominated field for other parties is just as unique.

The Green Party and Conservative candidates launched their nomination bids last fall, after Malcolmson announced she would not seek re-election federally.

Green candidate Paul Manly, who came third against Malcolmson in 2015, was acclaimed as the Green candidate on Feb. 3, after launching his nomination campaign last Oct. 25. According to commenters on a Reddit forum and other media, Manly tried to contest the NDP riding’s general election nomination in 2015, but claimed later his candidacy was rejected because he protested Israel’s treatment of his father, former NDP MP Jim Manley, who was arrested after taking part in an attempt to breach Israel’s 2012 sea blockade of the Gaza Strip.

The nominated Conservative candidate for the byelection, Sun Life office manager John Hirst, won his nomination on Nov. 17 last year. His opponent for the Tory nomination, Jennifer Clarke, was picked up to run for the PPC.

By winning a seat in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South, Jagmeet Singh becomes the first visible minority leader of a federal political party in this country’s history. He did so in the face of withering critiques, notably from former NDP leader Thomas Mulcair, as to his prospects and abilities, as well as a dominant narrative that suggested the Liberal Party of Canada was quickly usurping the NDP as Canada’s leading progressive voice. We are better as a country with Jagmeet Singh in Parliament.

Now the bad news. Though he is now leader of a political party with significant representation in Quebec, Singh soon wouldn’t be allowed to guard prisoners, police the streets, serve as a judge — or even teach schoolchildren in the province. That’s because the provincial government plans on banning religious symbols from the bodies of certain civil servants, teachers included, in the name of secularism.

And were Singh to show up at the National Assembly to protest the forthcoming legislation, he wouldn’t be allowed in. Unlike Canadian Parliament, the National Assembly still considers the kirpan, the ceremonial dagger worn by many practising Sikh men, to be a dangerous weapon. He wouldn’t make it past the X-ray machines.

I bring all of this up not to relive the long and often tiresome debate about the place and space allowed religious minorities in Quebec, but rather to illustrate the uniquely challenging political context Singh now finds himself in the very province that helped launch the NDP’s rebirth eight years ago.

In a few months’ time, Singh will be tasked with campaigning in a province that overwhelmingly supports the above-mentioned legislation. It has the potential to be a jarring spectacle. Policy-wise, the NDP under Singh, an unabashedly progressive counterpoint to Thomas Mulcair’s Liberalesque leadership, is the stuff of dreams to the province’s centre-left electorate. Yet it is tough not to see the party’s sudden and inherent disadvantage: its leader happens to be a brown guy in a turban.

Quebec’s political class is obsessed with identity issues like immigration, which took up an outsized proportion of the oxygen during the last provincial election, according to Influence Communication, a Quebec-based media analysis firm. For this you can at once point to history (francophone Quebecers’ collective and existential worry about the survival of their language and culture) and blame politicians for exploiting this worry for political gain.

This tinder is regularly turned to flame by way of certain columnists — almost all of whom are from the Journal de Montréal — who tend to portray Quebec’s religious minorities as an invading horde bent on undermining Quebec’s proudly secular society.

The end result is a zealous rejection of conspicuous religiosity. Consider how some 61 per cent of Quebecers, far and away the largest percentage of respondents in the country, say the wearing of the turban or other religious symbol by teachers is “unacceptable,” according to a national Léger Marketing poll published last December. Never mind that at least three teachers’ unions have said the government’s proposed ban is patently unworkable. The decade-long politicization of the issue has ensured gut feeling, not cold logic, rules the day.

Singh is about to step into this politically perilous breach, his religion conspicuously displayed. To be fair, he has a lot going for him. He’s good on TV and great on the stage — a necessity in the Trudeau age of campaigning. Most important, his French is excellent. And on the island of Montreal, at least, he has a multicultural beachhead where his appearance is an advantage, or at least less of a disadvantage.

But beyond our fair city? I worry we aren’t yet ready for a leader like Jagmeet Singh. I can only hope I’m proven wrong.

Check out Jagmeet’s first question and what Canadians are saying about this exciting and historic day!

Jagmeet Singh was sworn in to the House of Commons as Burnaby South’s newest MP on Sunday, March 17! Surrounded by family, friends, and our NDP Team, Jagmeet became the first racialized leader of a Canadian political party to be sworn in to the House.

People across the country watched as Jagmeet took his seat in the House and aksed his first question on Monday, March 18. He talked about the people he’s met who are struggling with the skyrocketing cost of housing – worried about how they’ll be able to make rent, pay their mortgage, or whether their kids and grandkids will ever be able to own a home.

He pressed Trudeau on refusing to address the housing crisis – and asked him to commit to half a million new units of affordable housing.

Jagmeet is in the House to fight for us. While Trudeau’s Liberal government keeps siding with their rich friends, Jagmeet and our NDP team are pushing for the solutions everyday people need now.

People across the country supported Jagmeet online, using #JagmeetintheHouse to share their excitement and hopes for the future. Here’s what people had to say:

article continues below

He won a byelection in Burnaby South on Feb. 25 to replace former MP and current mayor of Vancouver Kennedy Stewart.

Singh also made history as the first racialized person to lead a federal party in Parliament.

Singh used his first speaking opportunity during question period to press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on housing.

He repeated a story he told many times during the byelection campaign, saying he met a teacher forced to live in her parents’ basement due to Burnaby’s unaffordable housing market.

Singh asked Trudeau whether the Liberal government would commit to building 500,000 new homes, alluding to the NDP’s proposal to do so over the next 10 years.

Trudeau welcomed Singh to Ottawa and said he hopes New Democrats back the Liberal government’s ongoing efforts to create affordable housing.

Singh also joined many Conservative MPs in calling on Trudeau to allow former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to testify in front of the justice committee for a second time to address the the SNC-Lavalin affair. He also repeated his call for the Liberals to launch a public inquiry into the case.

“For Canadians watching at home, this doesn't look any different than when the Conservatives were in power – special access for powerful corporations, a closed door for everyone else,” he said. “Why is this prime minister so afraid to launch a public inquiry?”

Liberal house leader Bardish Chagger deflected the calls from the opposition parties, saying Wilson-Raybould already had her chance to speak.

Singh also addressed the mosque shooting that killed 50 and injured dozens more in New Zealand last week. An avowed white supremacist has been charged in the massacre.

“That attack reverberated across the world. Though it happened in Christchurch, New Zealand, the pain impacted all of us,” he said. “It hurts here in Canada, where Muslim brothers and sisters – our friends, our close ones, people who work with us – are thinking about their own loved ones when they go to masjid, when they go to prayer, and how much it hurts to know that you're being targeted for being who you are.”

Singh said the attack was borne of white supremacist and Islamophobic hatred.

“Hate knows no bounds. Once hate is allowed to grow, it consumes all in its path. Hate is like a fire – once it's allowed to grow, it spreads, consuming everything,” he said.

Singh joined Trudeau and Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer in condemning Islamophobia and other forms of bigotry, but said Canada must go further by addressing the root causes of such hatred.

When people refer to migrants as “illegal” or “barbaric,” they dehumanize them, he said.

“The purpose is to dehumanize and then, once you dehumanize, it leads to fear and hatred,” he said. “Let's be conscious of the words we use so we never create any ground for hate to grow.”

Singh made the comments after Trudeau and Scheer made their own statements condemning the attack and expressing solidarity with the people of New Zealand and Muslims around the world.

Trudeau addressed the various forms of prejudice and discrimination he said lead to terrorist attacks around the world.

“It's anti-Semitic, Islamophobic, anti-black, anti-Indigenous, misogynistic, homophobic – the list goes on and on,” he said. “This rhetoric is dangerous, hateful and vile; it lives and festers online, spilling out into the real world with deadly consequences.”

Scheer expressed similar sentiments.

He said the attack in New Zealand was reminiscent of the 2017 attack on a Quebec City mosque in which a white nationalist killed six men in their place of worship.

Scheer called for unity among political parties in condemning hateful ideologies.

“I say to my colleagues in all parties, we certainly have our differences on important policy matters that deserve rigorous and spirited debate, but on this – the very compassion and humanity of our Canadian society – there can be no debate,” he said.","Jagmeet Singh presses on housing, calls out dehumanizing language in Parliamentary debut",Burnaby Now,https://www.burnabynow.com/news/jagmeet-singh-presses-on-housing-calls-out-dehumanizing-language-in-parliamentary-debut-1.23667389

He is the first leader of a major political party in Canada’s parliament who is not white, a distinction that Singh acknowledged after question period as something he never could have imagined when he was growing up.

“It’s an incredible honour. I’m humbled. I’m blown away by the immensity of the role I’ve been granted,” said Singh, a former criminal lawyer who was born in Scarborough and is the son of immigrants from India. “If I could have in some way broken down barriers for people, I would have done something good with my life,” he said. Singh’s debut in the Commons is a result of his Feb. 25 byelection victory in Burnaby South, the British Columbia riding he moved to last year in a bid to win his first federal seat. He used the occasion to press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the government’s affordable housing plan, demanded the Liberals increase carbon price charges on heavy polluters, and repeat his party’s call for a public inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin affair.

For Singh, the moment comes at a challenging time for the party he leads. Fundraising has sunk from $18 million in 2015 to around $5 million last year, while the party has taken out a $12 million mortgage on its national headquarters, the Jack Layton Building. Meanwhile, about a quarter of the party’s caucus has resigned their seats or announced they won’t run in the general election this fall, including veterans like B.C. MPs Nathan Cullen and Murray Rankin, Quebec MPs Hélène Laverdière and Romeo Saganash, and Ontario stalwarts David Christopherson and Irene Mathyssen.

Singh himself has received negative attention for communications stumbles, including occasions when he seemed unaware of his own party’s position on issues like the Liberal government gun legislation and the question of whether Canada was right to recognize Venezuela’s opposition leader as the country’s legitimate president. In the months leading up to his byelection run, as Singh toured the country in a series of “JagMeet and Greet” events, many NDP insiders argued he needed a seat in the Commons to change the narrative that had settled in over the first year of his leadership. On Monday, Singh finally appeared in the House, tapping the breast of his suit and waving to his family as he was escorted to take his seat at the head of the NDP benches. His younger brother, Ontario MPP Gurratan Singh, said afterwards that it was “an historic and momentous occasion for all Canadians.” He looked on from the public gallery with Singh’s wife and parents, and wore a yellow turban that matched his brother’s on the Commons floor below. “For people who don’t see themselves represented in politics, today was a milestone,” he said. Singh spent much of question period listening intently. During the opening exchange between Trudeau and Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, he pressed his earpiece against his head and took notes. Later, after he had asked his own questions, Singh got up and left for a few minutes. When he returned, he briefly walked down the wrong aisle and had to double back to get to his seat. He has seven months to learn where it is before he has to win it again. Alex Ballingall is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics. Follow him on Twitter: @aballinga

On March 17, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh was officially sworn in as the MP for Burnaby South. The election of the first racialized federal party leader to Parliament is of great historic significance.

Wanting to do my part, I travelled to BC to campaign for Singh. I wanted to make a positive contribution to the effort in light of the gloomy press coverage (some predicting Singh’s demise) that was hanging over the campaign like a dark cloud.

I was eager to know what people on the ground were thinking and feeling about the by-election. It quickly became apparent that young people engineering Singh’s operation were enthusiastic, dedicated and curious.

There were also some of the more seasoned organizers. One who flew in from Brampton proudly told me that he just got accepted into law school at the University of Ottawa, my alma mater. I asked how it felt. He said it paled in comparison to the idea of Singh winning the riding. People were nervous as they confronted the weight of history.

This was no casual by-election. The media, taking the attitude of “do or die,” reminded us of that every day. This was an election that would either usher in a new era in Canadian politics or turn back the clock for under-represented communities.

So when the polls closed and the results finally poured in, the scene was electric at the Hilton Vancouver Hotel. We did it. The moment to shift the national discourse into an unapologetically progressive direction is here.

There is a real opportunity for an NDP breakthrough in this volatile political climate, but it must articulate a bold and truly transformative agenda on climate change, reconciliation with Indigenous peoples, electoral reform, criminal justice reform, pharmacare and the housing crisis. The plight of working-class people across this country demands aggressive no-nonsense representation.

In Burnaby, Singh was able to appeal to a multiracial working class constituency with a left-populist campaign that focused on the fundamental unfairness of the economy and issues of housing affordability. Throughout his political career, he has demonstrated an ability to appeal to marginalized communities that represent a growing share of the electorate.

Many activists on Singh’s campaign were inspired by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other left-wing women of colour recently elected to congress in the U.S. who are challenging conventional wisdom and calling for a Green New Deal, free tuition, medicare for all and immigration reform.

There are lessons to be learned here from this new group of political leaders south of the border. It’s time for a new generation of progressive activists in this country, ones who boldly stand for social and economic justice and reflect the diversity of modern Canada, to step forward.

This is an issue the NDP leader pursued throughout his recent byelection campaign in Burnaby South and it is close to the heart of many urban voters, in particular in Vancouver and Toronto.

Those two electoral markets are central to New Democrat prospects in next fall’s federal campaign.

Justin Trudeau responded with a boilerplate statement about helping the middle class. He was probably happy to get a brief respite from the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Singh waited more than a year for his opportunity to question Trudeau face-to-face about Canada’s current housing situation.

But he may have to wait a few more months – until the leaders debates of the upcoming election campaign – for a more serious policy conversation with his Liberal rival.

The NDP leader’s belated entry in the Commons comes at a time when the current Parliament is on its last legs - with its most productive days behind it.

Tuesday’s budget – the last of Trudeau’s ongoing term in office – marks the non-official start of the election campaign. Tuesday may also be the last semi-normal day in the Commons for the foreseeable future.

In an effort to keep the SNC-Lavalin affair in the forefront and force the Liberal majority on the justice committee to agree to invite former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould for a second appearance, the Conservatives are gearing up for a procedural trench war with the government.

Even absent opposition obstruction, the SNC-Lavalin affair has already taken a toll on the government’s agenda.

One of the reasons why omnibus budget bills have become such a central part of the federal governance apparatus is because they allow policy initiatives to clear legislative hurdles over a matter of months rather than over a year or more.

But the SNC-Lavalin affair – and the news that a budget bill was used to introduce in the Criminal Code remediation agreements of the kind sought by the engineering giant to eliminate the risk of a criminal conviction – has made the practice of squeezing a host of non-budgetary stuff in bloated finance bills politically toxic.

As a result, some of the measures the government had hoped to showcase in its campaign list of delivered items will now likely end up in the Liberal post-election catalogue.

Trudeau and his team are not the only ones who are having to temper their hopes for a productive parliamentary spring.

So might Singh.

The SNC-Lavalin has solidified the notion that the next election will boil down to a duel for government between the Liberals and the Conservatives.

It is a perception that the NDP’s role as the second opposition party tends to reinforce. Jack Layton in 2011 and Trudeau in the last election both had to wait to be on the campaign trail to level the playing field to their advantage.

Until Monday, Joe Clark had been the last opposition leader to make his entry in the Commons in the dying days of a parliament. The next-to-last leader of the Progressive Conservative party waited almost four years before securing a federal seat in the summer of 2000.

On the day Clark finally took his seat, three Quebec MPs initially elected as Progressive Conservatives crossed the floor to the Liberals.

Jean Chrétien called a general election a little more than a month after that show of strength. It was the last campaign the Tories fought under their banner.

Trudeau did not have as unpleasant a surprise in store for Singh’s first full day as an MP. But the NDP does face an existential threat next fall as the Tories did at the time of Clark’s second coming to the House of Commons almost two decades ago.

Like Clark, who had to fend off the Liberals and the Canadian Alliance, Singh is threatened on two fronts. As the result of a string of provincial breakthroughs, the Green party is poised to enter the federal campaign with the momentum the NDP so lacks.

In last month’s Outremont byelection, Elizabeth May’s candidate finished ahead of the Bloc Québécois and the Conservatives. In the province that currently accounts for the largest number of New Democrat MPs, the most recent Léger Marketing poll pegged the Green party at nine per cent, two points ahead of the NDP.

The stars could be aligning for voters to rediscover May at the expense of her NDP rival next fall.

As if crossing swords with the Liberals across the aisle was not enough, Singh will have to spend the coming months looking over his shoulder.

The NDP says Singh becomes the first racialized party leader to sit in the House of Commons. He won a byelection in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South in February, taking roughly 39 per cent of the vote.

Raising questions about affordable housing, climate change and the SNC-Lavalin affair, Singh became the first racialized leader in Canada to take a seat in the Commons.

""I think about growing up as a kid I would never imagine someone that looked like me running to become prime minister,"" said @TheJagmeetSingh after taking his seat as an MP and becoming the first racialized party leader in Canada's House of Commons.

Singh placed his hand over his heart and was greeted with a warm ovation from all sides as he walked into the Commons before the daily question period.

Singh took his seat, along with two other candidates elected in federal byelections held on Feb. 25, Liberal Rachel Bendayan and Conservative Scot Davidson.

Singh's first words as an elected MP were about last week's terrorist attack in New Zealand.

""I want to begin by expressing our solidarity with the people of New Zealand who are mourning the attack on Muslim brothers and sisters... in Christ Church,"" Singh said.

He then launched into his first question about housing in his new riding of Burnaby-South.

""I met a mom in Burnaby. She bought a home, but cannot afford to live there anymore. Her daughter has a good job, but only gets by because she lives in the basement. Her son does not see a future. Like too many Canadians, he has lost all hope,"" Singh said.

""However, the prime minister is telling families like theirs to wait for help. I believe that better is possible. Will the government commit to building half a million new affordable homes?""

Trudeau responded by congratulating Singh for his entry into the Commons, before touting the government's record on fighting poverty.

""I hope (Singh) and his party will support the work our government has done to lift hundreds of thousands of children across this country out of poverty,"" Trudeau told the Commons. ""We lowered taxes on the middle class and raised them on the wealthiest one per cent and indeed to end boil water advisories in so many communities across the country with more to do. These are the things we will continue to work on and we look forward to his support in creating a better and fairer Canada for everyone.""

Singh asked three other questions in French and English about climate change, and the recent controversy over the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, which has plunged Trudeau's government into a political crisis.

On climate change, Trudeau said that his government was taking action after previous Liberal and Tory governments had not done so.

""We have put a price on pollution. We have proceeded with a historic plan to protect the ocean, to protect the land,"" Trudeau said in French ""We have made record investments in renewable energy, in greener solutions for our businesses and entrepreneurs.""

The prime minister added that the government would continue its efforts, saying that the only way to protect the environment is to create economic growth at the same time, prompting a rebuke from Singh.

""Environmental leaders don't buy pipelines,"" Singh said.

In his last two questions, Singh pressed Trudeau to launch a public inquiry into allegations that the prime minister had pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin so that the Quebec engineering firm could get a plea deal instead of going through a criminal trial on corruption and fraud charges.

Trudeau, who has suggested that jobs would be at risk at SNC-Lavalin if it is forced to undergo a trial, responded by saying the issue was about the economy. The prime minister said that Canadians have created over 950,000 jobs since his government was first elected in 2015.

""We are of course going to make sure that we continue to maintain the trust and confidence that Canadians have in their institutions and why we are happy to answer all the various questions going on,"" Trudeau said. ""We will continue to stand up for jobs.""

Speaking to reporters outside the Commons, Singh said he felt ""humbled"" and ""blown away"" by the role he has been granted.

""I take that responsibility really seriously and I’m going to use every opportunity I get to make sure that Canadians know I’m on their side,"" he said. ""I’m going to fight for housing, for fighting climate change, make sure Canadians have access to medication. I’m going to make sure I use this role with the weight and responsibility that I feel...

""I think about growing up as a kid I would never imagine someone that looked like me running to become prime minister. That would never be in the world of my imagination. Standing in the chamber today asking a question directly to the prime minister, I think a lot of maybe young people out there who didn’t see themselves reflected might believe that if I could run the country maybe I can do anything. If I could have in some way broken down some barriers for people I would have done something good in my life.""

Sporting a bright yellow turban, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh entered the House of Commons for the first time as an MP Monday to loud cheers.

Singh is the first minority leader in the Commons in Canadian history.

The leader of the New Democrats had been left out of the political theatre of question period and he wasn't able to have an office on Parliament Hill.

Singh won his new Burnaby South seat in a February byelection sparked by the departure of former NDP MP Kennedy Stewart, who ran for mayor of Vancouver.

New Democrats are hoping Singh's presence in the House of Commons will help the party turn the page on a difficult period, marked by challenges with morale and fundraising.

Anyone who followed the 2013 B.C. election or the recently Nanaimo byelection will know that polls can be pretty unreliable.

article continues below

So keep this in mind while reading the results of a Nanos Research poll posted today that has the federal NDP – led by new Burnaby South MP Jagmeet Singh getting a pretty big bump in support.

The latest Nanos federal ballot tracking has the Conservatives at 35.5 per cent, followed by the Liberals at 32.6 per cent, the NDP at 19.9 percent, the BQ at 3.2 per cent, the Greens at 7.7 per cent and the People’s Party of Canada (PPC) at 0.5 per cent.

The NDP for the longest time has been mired at 13 to 14 per cent, with the party also struggling to raise money.

So to have a showing at nearly 20 per cent is to be considered positive news. The CBC’s poll tracker – which aggregates all publicly available polling data – has the NDP at 15.9 per cent.

The bad news for Singh is the other number Nanos had.

Nanos tracking has Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as the preferred choice as PM at 30.3 per cent of Canadians followed by Scheer (27.3%), Singh (8.9%), May (7.2%) and Bernier (2.8%). Twenty-two per cent of Canadians were unsure whom they preferred.

So Singh is way down the list and has a lot of work to do. Things could get better now that he is an MP and gets to speak in the House of Commons. He needs to build his profile and fast because October is getting closer and closer.

Singh is getting huge assists from Trudeau with SNC-Lavalin and Scheer with his blunder after the New Zealand massacre.

Let’s see what he can do with these missteps.

For theNanos poll, the data is based on a dual frame (land + cell-lines) random telephone interviews using live agents of 1,000 Canadians using a four week rolling average of 250 respondents each week, 18 years of age and over. The random sample of 1,000 respondents may be weighted by age and gender using the latest census information for Canada. The interviews are compiled into a four week rolling average of 1,000 interviews, where each week the oldest group of 250 interviews is dropped and a new group of 250 interviews is added.

A random telephone survey of 1,000 Canadians is accurate ±3.1 percentage points, plus or minus, 19 times out of 20.","NDP surges in poll, but Jagmeet Singh's own rating stays in single digits",Burnaby Now,https://www.burnabynow.com/opinion/blogs/ndp-surges-in-poll-but-jagmeet-singh-s-own-rating-stays-in-single-digits-1.23668370

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Wilson-Raybould's testimony underscored his party's calls for an independent inquiry to find out the truth of what happened between the former attorney ...,"OTTAWA — Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called on Justin Trudeau to resign Wednesday, saying former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould's troubling testimony about SNC-Lavalin proved the prime minister has lost the moral authority to govern.

Scheer threw down the gauntlet immediately after a three-hour Commons' justice committee meeting in which Wilson-Raybould said she felt pressure from Trudeau and others to head off a criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

""Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this country now that Canadians know what he has done,"" Scheer said. ""And that is why I am calling on Mr. Trudeau to do the right thing and to resign.""

But Trudeau quickly rebuffed Scheer's demand as he touted his government's record defending jobs and ""the independence of our judiciary,"" adding Canadians will decide later this year whether to re-elect the Liberals or hand power to the Conservatives.

The back-and-forth marked the latest escalation in what has already been the most explosive political challenge facing the Trudeau government during its more than three years in power. The Official Opposition very rarely calls on a prime minister to resign.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Wilson-Raybould's testimony underscored his party's calls for an independent inquiry to find out the truth of what happened between the former attorney general and members of Trudeau's inner circle.

During her testimony, Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she withstood four months of relentless pressure to reverse a decision not to make a plea-bargain-type deal with SNC-Lavalin. She said the pressure came from Trudeau and other senior Liberal officials.

Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she believed the pressure, which also included ""veiled threats"" from the country's top civil servant, Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick, was inappropriate. But she added she did not think it was illegal.

Scheer nonetheless demanded Trudeau's resignation and called for the RCMP to launch a criminal investigation into what the Liberal government did to help SNC-Lavalin, which is facing criminal charges related to allegedly corrupt dealings in Libya.

""Jody Wilson-Raybould tells the story of a prime minister who has lost the moral authority to govern,"" Scheer said.

""A prime minister who allows his partisan, political motivations to overrule his duty to uphold the rule of law. A prime minister who doesn't know where the Liberal Party ends and where the government of Canada begins.""

The Conservative leader also called for Wernick to resign and encouraged the Liberal cabinet, which is scheduled to present a federal budget next month, to find a way to govern the country in a non-partisan way without the prime minister.

Scheer did not say what he would do if Trudeau refused to resign, such as calling a non-confidence vote.

For his part, Singh said Wilson-Raybould's testimony painted a picture of a prime minister and other members of government who were willing to disregard the rule of law and were more interested in helping powerful friends than average Canadians.

While the NDP leader said Trudeau and others may eventually have to step down, he said that determination should come after a public inquiry is held to get the bottom of what really happened.

Trudeau, however, indicated during a Liberal party event in Montreal a short time later that he had no intention of resigning. He rejected Wilson-Raybould's version of events, saying he and his staff ""always acted appropriately and professionally.""

He said Canadians will have ""a very clear choice in a few months"" in the October election about who they want to form government.

""There will be a clear choice to be made between the Liberal Party, this government that ... has consistently stood up for Canadian jobs, consistently defended Canadian jobs while defending our institutions and the independence of our judiciary,"" he said.

""And on the other hand there is a choice of the party that is still very much the party of Stephen Harper. That continues to attack, to divide, to play politics with big issues and (thinks) the best way to create economic growth is still to give advantages to the wealthiest.""

It is expected to form a key plank in the NDP’s election platform this fall alongside other policy proposals the party says will target the rich, pay for more services for Canadians and cool the housing market. “A fairer tax system means more funding for services that Canadians need like universal pharmacare, child care, affordable housing and post-secondary education,” Singh said in a statement. While the government currently taxes 50 per cent of profits made on investments, known as capital gains, the NDP wants to increase that threshold — known as the “inclusion rate” — to 75 per cent.

The party estimates the move, which would also apply to the sale of most real estate but not primary residences, tax-free savings accounts or registered retirement plans, would generate nearly $3 billion in additional revenue for the federal treasury. “When you go to work, you’re taxed on almost all of your income,” Singh said. “It doesn’t make sense that someone making their money from investments is taxed on only half.” Read more: NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh targets rich with proposal to raise rate for capital gains tax Opinion | Chantal Hébert: Jagmeet Singh must keep an eye on the strengthening Green party

Canadians feel ‘affordability anxiety’ ahead of federal election, survey finds The inclusion rate for capital gains has fluctuated since it was introduced in 1972, when it was 50 per cent. It was raised several times in the intervening years to a high of 75 per cent, before Jean Chretien’s government cut it to its current rate in 2000.

Article Continued Below

The question of raising the inclusion rate on capital gains has been hotly debated for years, with some suggesting it would address inequality and others arguing it would hurt Canadians’ savings and make the country less attractive for investors. New Democrats have also previously talked about closing a stock-option loophole and cracking down on the use of bearer shares and foreign tax havens they say help the rich hide their wealth and avoid paying their fair share of taxes. The government in its most recent budget moved to address the stock-option loophole by putting a $200,000-limit on the tax-deductible amount on employee stock options. The stock-option deduction works by taxing only 50 per cent of the earnings an employee receives when they cash in any stock options received as part of their compensation packages, if certain conditions are met. The new limit appears aimed at tightening the loophole while acknowledging concerns that closing it entirely would make it more difficult for companies to attract talent and discourage startups.

The NDP caucus brought in Janice Rubin of Rubin Thomlinson in Toronto and Ayla Akgungor of Field Law in Edmonton to investigate the allegations and file a report. The issue has resurfaced on social media during the election campaign, with some asking why the party did not release the names of the accused. “In both cases, the claimants that raised the concerns wanted to maintain their privacy,” Notley said Friday.

“In so doing, we must also then maintain the privacy of those who were the respondents in the case.” She added the party has followed the recommendations of the independent investigators, though she did not elaborate on what the discipline entailed. “We know that both of the complainants were made aware of what those recommendations were and we thought that they were satisfactory,” Notley said. NDP spokesperson Cheryl Oates said in an emailed statement that the reports cannot be released publicly because they would jeopardize the privacy of the complainants, who both requested the reports not be released. “We take all of these matters — whether they involve staff or elected officials — very seriously,” Oates said. “Our policy for investigating these is very similar to that used by the Legislatively Assembly Office — and we followed that policy in both of these matters.” Kevin Maimann is an Edmonton-based reporter covering education and marijuana legalization.

CTVNews.ca Staff, with a report from CTV Regina's Wayne Mantyka





The leader of Saskatchewan’s NDP party is pressing the premier to make his position clear on the yellow vest movement after allegations that some of the group’s supporters are against immigration.

During question period on Thursday, Saskatchewan Opposition Leader Ryan Meili once again brought up the subject of yellow vest protesters attending pro-energy rallies in the province in recent weeks.

The yellow vest movement in Saskatchewan was inspired by the months-long protests in France that began in opposition to planned gas tax hikes and have evolved to target other government policies.

The NDP leader accused Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe of refusing to distance himself from the movement in Canada, despite suggestions that factions of the group have expressed anti-immigrant sentiments at rallies and online.

“The Pipeline News said the other day, the yellow vest moniker is so tainted that now no one wants anything to do with it,” Meili said.

Meili’s NDP party has refused to join several rallies in the province in recent weeks where yellow vest protesters have been present.

Earlier this month, Meili called on Moe to instruct his cabinet ministers to not attend pro-pipeline rallies if yellow vest protesters were in attendance.

The premier, however, said last week that his government condemns anti-immigrant sentiments. He said members of his cabinet who have participated in rallies with yellow vest protesters were there to oppose federal energy policies.

“We should in no way paint all of these individuals with the same brush due to a few comments by a few individuals,” he said at the time.

On Thursday, Moe responded to Meili’s questions about the yellow vest protesters.

“I have had no one else that has talked about me being affiliated with any movement Mr. Speaker outside of defending the economy, the industries, the jobs,” he said.

Another pro-pipeline rally is planned at the Queensbury Convention Centre in Regina next week, but posters for the event explicitly state that yellow vests are prohibited.

Meili said he’s still considering whether he’ll attend.

“We’ll look into whether I can come and say a few words, but certainly I will be looking at the details of the rally and I hope to attend,” he told reporters on Thursday.

The move, which would cover prescription co-payments for seniors with ...","Rachel Notley pledged that a re-elected NDP government would cover the prescription costs for the majority of Alberta seniors.

The move, which would cover prescription co-payments for seniors with incomes less than $75,000 per year, would cost the province about $110 million per year.

“Right now there are seniors in Alberta who are actually forced to choose between filling their prescriptions or filling their fridges,” said Notley at a Sherwood Park news conference Friday. “That’s not right.”

Currently seniors pay 30 per cent of the cost of a prescription up to a maximum of $25. That’s through a Blue Cross insurance plan for Alberta seniors over 65.

Notley said such costs add up, and prescriptions can be a financial barrier.

“I’ve heard many personal stories from seniors over the years who basically did not factor in the costs of prescription co-pay when they were planning for their retirement,” she said, flanked by NDP Sherwood Park candidate Annie McKitrick and NDP Strathcona-Sherwood Park candidate Moira Vane.

One third of seniors have a chronic need for more than five prescriptions at a time, and five per cent need 10 prescriptions or more, she said.

“This is extremely costly for those who are living on fixed incomes.”

It leads seniors to not fill their prescriptions because they can’t afford them, Notley said.

The NDP estimates the change would apply to four out of five seniors and save them an average of $200 a year.

Notley also touted a deal reached under her government in March, which extended the agreement determining how pharmacies are funded until 2022.

Last year, the Alberta government and the Alberta Pharmacists’ Association created a funding framework set to expire March 31, 2020. That deal, projected to save the province $150 million, was extended for two more years. The agreement saves 8,700 seniors more than $100 per year in prescription costs, and seniors with significant prescription costs will save even more, according to the province.

Notley said Friday that the NDP considered universal funding for seniors’ prescriptions, but is moving forward on an “incremental basis.”

“It would be obviously preferable to make it universal, but in a case like this we also have to balance the cost.

“We are hopeful that we’ve struck the right balance.”

It’s the latest health-care promise from Notley, who continues to double down on the message that the NDP will protect Alberta from a two-tier system she believes would be created under the UCP.

She previously announced an NDP government would add 2,000 more long-term-care beds, costing about $170 million. She has also promised $90 million per year to help reduce surgical wait times and to increase emergency care.

UCP Leader Jason Kenney, who has said his party will guarantee public and accessible health care, is pushing for private options, much like the system in B.C. and Quebec.

The party also committed Thursday to fully funding growing student enrolment each year at an estimated cost of $72 million. It would add an estimated 600 new teaching and support staff positions for the 15,000 more students expected to arrive in Alberta schools by the fall.

“Notley’s plan for the next four years invests in education and supports Alberta’s young learners by strengthening and modernizing Alberta’s education system,” a Thursday news release from the NDP said. “Our kids deserve nothing less.”

United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney has said he will “maintain or increase” education funding, but has not provided specifics. His plan puts students’ education at risk, Notley said.

Notley announced the party’s plans sitting with supporters around a kitchen table in Calgary Thursday.

An NDP government would also make permanent and increase the classroom improvement fund (CIF) to $100 million a year from the current $77 million, a party news release said. It should add another 400 teachers and support staff to Alberta classrooms, Notley said. Schools and boards decide what staff to hire with their provincial funding allotments.

The classroom improvement fund was introduced in 2017 as part of a collective agreement with teachers. School boards must spend it on classroom personnel and to help students with complex needs and those learning English.

Notley said Thursday the NDP would next week release more detailed financing information for the party’s platform.

New language programs

In addition to a new K-12 Filipino language curriculum the NDP has already committed to introduce by 2020, the party pledged to introduce new provincial courses in Punjabi, Somali and Cantonese. The government already offers K-12 courses in 26 languages other than English and French. Although some schools may already offer classes in Filipino or Punjabi, school boards must develop and pay for the courses on their own.

The NDP also committed Thursday to continue a $5 million-a-year grant program, which offers up to $250,000 to replace playgrounds at schools in mature neighbourhoods. New and modernized elementary schools will also come with a promise of $250,000 for each playground.

A $16-million school nutrition program for 30,000 students would continue, an NDP spokeswoman said.

Following UCP Leader Jason Kenney’s announcement that he intends to roll back privacy rights and other legal protections for LGBTQ students and staff in Alberta schools, Notley said an NDP government would keep current laws in place.

The law requires all schools to publicly post policies outlining their rights, and requires school principals to “immediately” approve students’ requests to start a gay-straight alliance.

“It’s utterly cruel for us to be thinking of going backwards on this,” Notley said, saying there is no reason to re-litigate the issue.

A group of parents and private religious schools are challenging the law, saying it infringes on their religious freedom.

The NDP is also committing to completing its revamp of the K-12 curriculum in English and French. Kenney said a UCP government would “pause” the review to do further consultation.

Notley said it would be “damaging” to throw out the work done so far to make curriculum current. So far, 100,000 people have given input or worked on the curriculum review.

273,,2019-03-29T23:34:00.0000000Z,"VICTORIA — For two afternoons this week, Green leader Andrew Weaver hammered away at the New Democrats, accusing them of hypocrisy and worse on the LNG file and using their own words against them.","VICTORIA — For two afternoons this week, Green leader Andrew Weaver hammered away at the New Democrats, accusing them of hypocrisy and worse on the LNG file and using their own words against them.

It happened during debate on Bill 10, the enabling legislation for some of the tax breaks and incentives in the NDP government’s deal with the LNG Canada project.

Weaver’s complaint being that the New Democrats were now engaged in the very thing they denounced when the B.C. Liberal government offered tax breaks and incentives to attract LNG investment.

“I have a litany of quotes that I will be reading during the course of the debate,” said Weaver at the outset of his remarks on Tuesday. “I had to ask my staff to pare them down because I’ve got 20 pages of quotes that I look forward to bringing in.”

Moreover, as the Green leader went on to show, in some cases the New Democrats were offering richer breaks and more incentives than the Liberals had done.

“This is a government, now, that literally hurled abuse, rhetoric, catcalled, name-called, all sorts of things for four years,” said Weaver at one point. “Now what they propose to do is take what the B.C. Liberals did to a whole new level.”

Not content with a general attack on his partners in power sharing, Weaver went after individual New Democrats in personal terms.

He quoted Energy Minister Michelle Mungall’s comments against LNG development from her days in Opposition. Then he noted that protesters in her Nelson-Creston riding were preparing to stage a “funeral” to memorialize the passing of her credibility.

“Well deserved, frankly,” said Weaver. “She has no credibility in this file.”

Next on the hit list was Agriculture Minister Lana Popham, who like Mungall was known as an environmental activist before she gained a seat at the cabinet table.

He quoted her on the LNG file circa 2016, when she faulted the Liberals for “not legislating like we’re in the most important races of our lives, the race to slow down the effects of climate change. This is not a joke.”

Now he sees Popham as part of a government engaged in a “despicable” version of “greenwashing.” He disputes the NDP claim that a massive increase in LNG production can be reconciled with targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Weaver to Popham: “Where are you now? Do you have the courage, do you have the moral fortitude to stand up for what you believe in and you said so back in 2016?”

While showing no mercy to ministers Mungall and Popham, when Weaver quoted some earlier words from NDP backbencher Doug Routley, he chose not to identify him in the usual way by naming his riding.

“I’ve become quite good friends with this member,” the Green leader explained. “I recognize that this member is probably struggling with the decision because I truly believe this member’s heart is in the right place. I’ll let you guess who this member is.”

But Weaver didn’t hold back when going after Premier John Horgan.

He quoted the NDP leader from his Opposition days, accusing the Liberals of giving away the store on LNG and covering up the details.

“If anything, we’re becoming less transparent from where we were with the B.C. Liberals,” said Weaver.

As for the alleged sellout, Weaver noted the NDP’s terms on taxes, electricity rates and carbon tax rebates were even more generous than those of the Liberals.

“The sellout on steroids,” said Weaver. “Hats off to LNG Canada negotiators. They really were dealing with a bunch of suckers, I tell you.”

The Green leader believes Horgan and crew missed the boat: “I don’t think the Premier and his party have thought this through. They haven’t reflected upon the comments they made historically and they don’t see how they apply now more than ever.”

Capping his comments was a question he put to everyone on the government side: “How do you sleep at night, knowing that you are putting before us a generational sellout that actually goes against everything you campaigned on in the last election?”

In reply, the New Democrats ignored Weaver, knowing the Greens will vote with them on confidence matters, as they have done twice in the current session.

The Greens, for their part, made two motions Tuesday and another Wednesday to try to derail the LNG legislation. Each was defeated by a massive margin, the Liberals joining the NDP in voting them down.

Much as the Liberals enjoy Weaver bashing away at the New Democrats, they recognize it as a pillow fight, and a one-sided one at that.

Weaver has no difficulty inhabiting two political worlds, the one where the New Democrats are hypocrites and generational sellouts with no credibility, the other where he votes to keep them in power.

His most useful contribution to the debate, other than documenting the NDP’s world class record of hypocrisy on the LNG file, was the airing of a letter alleging a massive giveaway on natural gas royalties in B.C.

Weaver did not name the author, saying only that he resigned earlier this year from the energy ministry.

Nor were the claims checkable within the narrow confines of legislative debate.

But the contents were sufficiently detailed to warrant further attention, if not by a legislature committee, then by the independent auditor general.

“The evidence received by the Justice Committee today from former AG Jody Wilson-Raybould is so compelling and well-documented that we must have an independent public inquiry to get to the truth about the damning evidence of a campaign of political interference by the Prime Minister. Canadians deserve to know the truth before the next general election.

Now, we all know why during the last weeks Trudeau’s Liberals cherry-picked witnesses, used delay tactics and voted down reasonable attempts to get at the truth, they simply made the cynical decision to put their political interests in front of Canadians’ interests. The Liberals’ partisan games at the Justice Committee have blocked Canadians from learning the truth.

The PMO has tried to spin this as a miscommunication or personal disagreement. What we see in this submission is a lawyer acting in her client’s best interests to protect him from his own recklessness. The former Attorney General repeatedly made clear to the Prime Minister and those around him that their inappropriate actions would be seen as political interference – and they ignored her.

We’re seeing a desperate government that looks more and more like Stephen Harper’s every day – the secrecy and partisanship is exactly what Canadians were tired of when they voted for Justin Trudeau, and he’s failed to deliver anything different.

It’s all ...","VICTORIA — When is a person not a “person”? When they are a farmer, applying to remove their own land from the agriculture reserve under the NDP government’s new legislation.

It’s all there in Bill 15, tabled in the legislature earlier this month.

The New Democrats are cancelling the right of individual owners of farmland to apply to the provincial Agricultural Land Commission on their own initiative for exclusions from the reserve.

The change is not all that great in practical terms. Applications for exclusions from farmers and other owners of agricultural land have little chance of succeeding and do so only with full backing from local government.

But the NDP’s chosen language seems calculated to give offence to farmers, by denying them personhood in legal terms.

Here’s the key passage: “A person may apply to the commission to have land excluded from the agricultural land reserve if the person is the owner of the land and is the province, a First Nation government, a local government, or a public body.”

No mention that persons should also include living, breathing individuals.

At the same time the bill repeals a section in the existing Agricultural Land Commission Act that says: “An owner of land may apply to the commission to have their land excluded from the agricultural land reserve.”

So to recap, in future only governments can initiate applications to remove land from the reserve; individual owners of farmland will no longer have that option. Instead they can only proceed through local government from the outset.

Justifying the change in the name of bureaucratic efficiency is Agriculture Minister Lana Popham.

“Let me just back up and just talk about why we’ve chosen to change the process for exclusion applications,” she explained to host Gregor Craigie on CBC’s On the Island this week.

“Currently, a landowner makes out an application, gives it to local government, local government then has to pass it through to the ALC, and they can do that with either negative feedback, positive feedback, or no feedback at all.

“So these applications for exclusion can hit the ALC without any background, which creates a lot of work for the ALC. They have to go back to local government and ask them, ‘Does this work for your long-term planning?’

“So what we’re saying is if a landowner wants to have land removed from the ALR, they need to work with local government and their local government will submit an application on behalf of that landowner.”

Popham, an activist’s activist on agricultural land, also says the change will relieve a “burdensome” weight of applications to the commission, while ending the “swiss-cheesing” of the land reserve itself.

At one point in the legislature this week, she even insisted that “nothing has changed” on the matter of personhood under Bill 15.

Defending Popham on the need for the legislation is Richard Bullock, chair of the commission under the last B.C. Liberal government until he was fired five months before his term was up.

“Dismissed by the previous Liberal government for doing my job,” as Bullock, clearly a believer that revenge is a dish best eaten cold, put it in an opinion piece distributed recently to The Vancouver Sun and other news outlets.

“Some believe there is a ‘right’ to apply to exclude land from the agricultural land reserve,” wrote Bullock in reference to the ending of the option for individual landowners.

On the contrary, says the former chair: “This is not about property rights. It is about reducing speculation on agricultural land.”

During his tenure from 2010 to 2015, Bullock says he “observed that the large majority of the exclusion applications were not from farmers and ranchers but instead from folks looking to make a substantial financial gain from paving over good agricultural land.

“One-off applications are most often financially driven and have little to do with good land use planning,” he continued.

The move to confine exclusions to “a broader joint local government and commission land use planning process makes sense,” argues Bullock. “After almost 50 years of opportunity for individual landowners to make an application to remove land from the ALR, the proposed change to that process is the next logical step.”

Notwithstanding the suggestions from the current minister and the former chair, the commission has not been inundated with applications for exclusions.

Nor, for that matter, do the handful of successful applications lead to the removal of substantial amounts of farmland from the agricultural reserve.

By Popham’s own admission, there were only 39 applications for exclusions from all sources in the past year — scarcely regulatory overload for a commission with an annual budget of $5 million.

Of those applications, only a dozen were granted, leading to a mere 28 hectares of farmland being excluded out of a total agricultural base of 4.6 million. (By comparison, the Site C project entails the flooding of 5,000 hectares of agricultural land.)

On that basis, it is difficult to see why farmers should be denied the option of filing applications on their own, never mind that they would appear to have little chance of succeeding. “Not even the right to ask,” as Liberal MLA Greg Kyllo complained on social media recently.

Even less defensible is Popham’s insistence on legal language that would declare owners of farmland to be unpersons, for all the satisfaction it may give to herself and her fellow activists.

Richard Bullock, who chaired the commission from 2010 to 2015, said the changes would send a strong message to would-be speculators of B.C.’s agricultural land.

“Some believe there is a ‘right’ to apply to exclude land from the Agricultural Land Reserve,” said a statement from Bullock. “After almost 50 years of opportunity for individual landowners to make an application to remove land from the ALR, the proposed change to that process is the next logical step.”

The ALR — intended to protect farmland, with restrictions on non-agricultural uses — includes 4.6 million hectares, almost five per cent of the province.

Earlier this month the government introduced Bill 15, the Agricultural Land Commission Amendment Act, but it has not yet been called for further debate.

“This bill really focuses on the governance of the Agricultural Land Commission and the way applications are processed,” Popham said.

The opposition has criticized how the bill defines “person” so that individual farmers aren’t included among those who can apply to have land removed from the reserve.

On Monday, BC Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson said during question period that farmers who were visiting the legislature were fed up and angry with the government.

“They need to be able to manage their lands to produce food. They’ve found that under this agriculture minister, their property rights are being seriously trampled on,” he said.

Popham responded to Wilkinson that the government is doing a lot to support farming.

“You can’t really farm if you don’t have an Agricultural Land Reserve to do it on,” she said. “We’re making sure that we’re revitalizing that reserve. We’re making it stronger than ever.”

The changes will make it more viable for farmers to make a living, she said.

Wilkinson quoted a farmer named Ben Dhiman who’d participated in a rally in Surrey, saying, “There’s been a constant attack on our way of life... and, most importantly, our rights as property owners.”

Popham said that Wilkinson and other BC Liberals had been misleading people in their constituencies.

“I understand why the Official Opposition is so upset. For 16 years, they considered the Agricultural Land Reserve a bank for development,” she said. “Well, we consider it a reserve for agriculture and food production. I’m sorry if that upsets you.”

In an interview, Popham said that the BC Liberals have used a two-week break in the legislature to “spread misinformation about the bill.”

Landowners have always had to go through a municipality if they wanted their land removed from the ALR, she said, but in some cases municipalities forward those applications to the land commission without commenting on whether or not they support the withdrawal.

The commission then has to go through an onerous process, meeting with owners and local government representatives to see if the proposal fits with official community planning, she said. About 40 of the 600 applications the commission received last year were for the removal of land from the ALR.

The change the government is making will make the process more efficient for the commission and more transparent for landowners and local governments, Popham said.

“If the landowner wants to have an application to exclude land, they would work with local government, and local government would submit an application on their behalf after running through whether or not there’s a community benefit to doing so.”

The landowner can still correspond with the commission to express what they want to happen with their land, she said. Landowners can also still make other kinds of applications to the commission.

“It’s really about protecting the Agricultural Land Reserve,” Popham said, adding that most people who are farming don’t want to get their land out of the reserve, and the bill sends a strong message to people speculating on farmland. “We’ve tightened that up, so it’s not as easy to do.”

In his statement, Bullock said the changes would protect farmland and make it more affordable than it otherwise would be.

“As chair, I observed that the large majority of the exclusion applications were not from farmers and ranchers, but instead from folks looking to make a substantial gain from paving over good agricultural land,” he said.

“Moving to have exclusions of land from the ALR be part of a broader joint local government and commission land use planning exercise makes sense.”

People often forget the commission and local governments have already made a lot of effort to refine the ALR boundary, he said.

“This is not about property rights. It is about reducing speculation on agricultural land. As long as the ‘door is open’ to an individual or company to make an application to remove agricultural land from the ALR, speculation on these lands will continue.”

Bullock’s term as chair of the commission ended early when the BC Liberal government fired him in 2015, saying that the government was changing regulations and it was time for new leadership.

Bullock had been strongly critical of those changes.

During the fall sitting of the legislature, the BC NDP government passed legislation it said would strengthen the land reserve.

It restricted the size of homes that can be built in the ALR, reversed a decision by the former government to split the reserve into two zones with different levels of protection, and increased penalties for breaking the law.","NDP Changes Will Better Protect Agricultural Land Reserve, Says Former Commission Chair",The Tyee,https://thetyee.ca/News/2019/03/28/NDP-Changes-Agricultural-Land-Reserve/

EDMONTON – The United Conservatives say Rachel Notley and the NDP need to show how they are going to pay for big-ticket spending promises they are making during the campaign for the April 16 Alberta election.

Jason Nixon, the UCP’s house leader, says Notley needs to explain which taxes she would increase to keep her promise to balance the budget by 2023.

Notley has promised new money for many projects, including more funding to hire teachers, to reduce surgical waiting lists and to cover drug costs for low- and middle-income seniors.

Nixon says the NDP has a poor track record on financial management, given that the provincial debt is projected to hit $95 billion by 2023.

Notley has said her party will soon be releasing its financial projections, which remain on track for a balanced budget in 2023.

Nixon says the NDP has no credibility since it originally said it intended to balance the books by 2017.

“Albertans will have paid $2 billion in interest on the NDP debt this fiscal year alone, which is more than 19 of 23 government departments,” Nixon told a news conference Friday.

“It is clear that the NDP are not serious about balancing the budget. This will have real consequences for Albertans. Higher debt and more interest (payments) simply means less for public services.”

FREDERICTON -- New Brunswick's NDP has picked a 21-year-old former candidate as its interim leader.

The party says its provincial council chose Mackenzie Thomason, a veteran of the hospitality and customer service sectors, at a meeting last weekend.

The party says his eagerness is ""refreshing.""

Former leader Jennifer McKenzie resigned in February after the party decided to hold a leadership convention to replace her.

Her party failed to win any seats in last fall's provincial election, and she came third in her Saint John riding.

She replaced Dominic Cardy, who is now a Tory member of the legislature and the province's education minister.

""I don't think we appreciate what is actually coming,"" Kate Ervine, a Saint Mary's University professor with expertise in political ecology and carbon markets.

Ervine was at the legislature Tuesday to speak in support of an NDP bill that would create an economic plan focused on green jobs.

The bill would create a 15-person task force representing a variety of sectors and communities to develop a plan to transition the province to a greener economy.

It also calls for a reduction of the province's greenhouse gas emissions to at least 50 per cent below 1990 levels by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The province is currently 30 per cent below 2005 levels.

""The economic era of fossil fuels is rapidly yielding to a new economic era,"" said NDP Leader Gary Burrill.

Financial forecasts for the next 20 years show that $7.8 trillion will be invested in renewable energy in the United States, while a fraction of that will go toward fossil fuels, he said.

NDP Leader Gary Burrill says Nova Scotia needs to have a plan to help the province's businesses operate in a green economy. (CBC)

""Nova Scotia's economic present, our prospects, our future, depend upon our success in making this great transition.""

Part of the aim of the bill is recognizing people working in fossil fuel-related industries will eventually see fewer job prospects and will need support in terms of training and other options as they transition toward jobs more in step with a green economy.

""We can't simply tell people that change is coming and hope that they accept it,"" said Ervine.

Jobs in the technology and green sectors were the fastest growing in the country last year, she said.

""We're tapping into something that actually is happening, and it makes no sense not to do that.""

Ervine pointed to Spain, where the government is working with unions representing coal industry workers to help them transition for a time when the coal mines shut down.

Premier Stephen McNeil said the government continues to work toward further expansion of the green economy in Nova Scotia.

Efficiency Nova Scotia is expecting growth of five per cent in its GDP, he said, adding many of the agency's programs are geared toward supporting small businesses that help people reduce their carbon footprint.

""We believe not only can we do what's right for the environment, but we can also continue to grow the economy,"" said McNeil.

Meanwhile, the Environmental Goals and Sustainability Act, which governs a variety of reduction targets for the province, is due for its regularly scheduled review. Environment Minister Margaret Miller said that work is happening now and will be completed later this year.

Miller said she expects part of that work will look at the issue of green jobs.

The deadline for submitting applications and a $20,000 entrance fee is Friday at 4:30 p.m.

At that time, the party will only confirm the number of applications received.

The next step is a formal vetting process by a green-light committee, which could take more than a week to complete.

Rene Ephestion, leader of the New Brunswick Liberal Multicultural Inclusion Commission, has also expressed his interest in seeking the leadership. He could not be reached for comment.

A leadership convention has been scheduled for June 21-22 in Saint John.

Vickers issued a statement Friday saying he is looking forward to speaking with Liberals “about a new path forward.”

He has drafted a five-point plan that calls for growing the province’s economy and population, improving health care, “transforming” education, ensuring environmental protection and making sure provincial finances are well managed.

His statement also took a shot at the governing Conservative party.

“With this year’s provincial budget, we saw the finance minister raise his hands in despair against the economic and demographic headwinds that New Brunswick faces,” Vickers said.

“We’ve also seen no provincial action on climate change, despite the fact that we’re a year removed from record flooding in key parts of the province.”

Vickers, who also served as Canada’s ambassador to Ireland, has acknowledged spending many years away from the province, but he has also focused on his deep roots in New Brunswick.

He is hoping to replace former premier Brian Gallant, who lost power last fall after the Liberals failed to form a minority government in the weeks following the Sept. 24 provincial election.

The party’s executive director, Keiller Zed, said the leadership race is getting the party revved up.

Still, Canadians aren’t so much embracing the Conservatives but instead deserting the Liberal party in droves, according to a new Angus Reid Institute poll.

Andrew Scheer and his Conservatives are picking up some votes from disenchanted Justin Trudeau Liberal supporters, according to a new poll. ( Sean Kilpatrick )

That’s a benefit to other parties — including the New Democrats, Green Party and the newly-minted People’s Party of Canada — who are seeing their fortunes rise as the governing party falls out of public favour. “The Liberals are just seeing quicksand. The floor is no longer stable,” said Shachi Kurl, Angus Reid executive director. “Trudeaumania was very, very real but Canadian voters are no longer feeling very manic.” In 2015, “Trudeaumania” convinced first-time voters, youth and non-regular voters to come out and cast a ballot. But it’s unclear whether the party will be able to retain that youth base this time around.

Article Continued Below

Kurl pointed to Pierre Trudeau’s rise to power in the late 1960s noting he enjoyed “Trudeaumania” before ending his last term as prime minister in 1984 as a polarizing politician. And if an election were held tomorrow, it is unlikely the Liberals would hold onto a majority: Fewer than 60 per cent of 2015 Liberals would vote for the party again. In contrast, the Conservatives are holding 90 per cent of their 2015 base. Levels of Conservative support remain essentially unchanged from last month — where they captured 37 per cent of the decided and leaning vote. Noting the Liberal Party’s relatively low retention of 2015 supporters, Kurl said it’s interesting to see where those voters are going. As the party bleeds votes, one in eight 2015 Liberals say they would support the Conservatives; one in 10 say the same of the NDP. Kurl added a handful have drifted to the Greens, while a significant portion remain undecided. Demographics are a huge driver of partisanship: Men and older Canadians slant Conservative, while women and younger voters stick with the Liberals or other left-of-centre parties.

Meanwhile, nearly half of all Canadians said they “strongly disapprove” of Trudeau in comparison to less than 10 per cent who “strongly approve.” “We’ve seen those stratospheric approval numbers that were in the 60s come down to the 30s over the last three years,” Kurl said. “Trudeau’s personal star is dimming. Not just the campaign, the party, the government, an entire international brand is built around a single person.”

Article Continued Below

That’s where the Liberals are running into “massive” trouble across the country, she added. Now, Canadians have a more favourable view of Scheer (44 per cent) and NDP leader Jagmeet Singh (39 per cent) than Trudeau (36 per cent). And while the Liberals lead by a wide margin in the city of Toronto, they are neck-and-neck with the NDP in the city of Vancouver, and trailing in the rest of B.C. and Ontario. In B.C. — where the NDP and Greens support is strongest — Scheer’s Conservatives hold a wide lead over the Liberals. The survey noted this likely helped to split left-of-centre respondents. Meanwhile, the Conservative party is leading by wide margins in Prairie provinces and by smaller four-point margins in Ontario and Atlantic Canada. Quebec, the one outlier, is seeing a four-way split in support between the Conservatives, Liberals, NDP and Greens. Still, a lot can change during election campaigns. For instance, in 2015, each of the three main parties held the lead in Angus Reid Institute polling between the time the writ dropped and election day. Kurl said there is enough time and space for the Liberals to bounce back and coalesce the left-of-centre vote. And it doesn’t mean that Trudeau should step down, she argued. Instead, it would require a pivot to focus less on the man and instead, more on the party, its policies and mission. “We’ve seen leaders do this in the past,” Kurl said, pointing to Jean Chretien’s 1993 campaign which was fraught with leadership critiques. “So what did the Liberal party do? They effectively built a team. It wasn’t Team Chrétien, it was Team Liberal.” Kurl said Trudeau can do the same thing. But, there isn’t evidence of that — yet. “The vote bleed, where it is going, and just how devastating it is for the Liberals today as people abandon the party based on a visceral reaction to Justin Trudeau says to me that the Liberals maybe need to take the weekend and go have a very deep think about what’s next,” Kurl said. Poll results were based on an online survey conducted from March 11-25 among a randomized sample of 5,807 Canadian adults who are members of the Angus Reid Forum. It carried a margin of error of +/- 2 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.

It’s a question at least some of the herd must be asking after their colleagues on the Ethics Committee shut down yet another potential line of enquiry into the SNC-Lavalin scandal.,"Andrew MacDougall is a London (UK) based columnist, commentator and consultant. He was formerly Director of Communications to Stephen Harper.

When a leader increases their party’s seat count from 36 to 184, as Justin Trudeau did in his majority-winning 2015 election campaign, he’s entitled to some good will. The question now staring Trudeau’s Liberals in the face is: how much?

It’s a question at least some of the herd must be asking after their colleagues on the Ethics Committee shut down yet another potential line of enquiry into the SNC-Lavalin scandal. Or, if not that, the question is being asked in light of the government’s cack-handed (and pathetic) attempt to smear Jody Wilson-Raybould using the Chief Justice of Manitoba as a canvas, a move that finally got the legal community off its arse on the mega-issue dominating the political agenda.

Heaping smear on top of political interference in the criminal justice system isn’t what any Liberal ran on in 2015, and it’s something no Liberal should want to run on later this year. So why are most Liberal MPs still fronting Trudeau’s nonsense?

Come to think of it, do most Liberal MPs even know what happened? Have any of them pressed Team Trudeau for the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? Does the backbench know what Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott (and presumably Cabinet) knows, or are they operating on blind faith?

If it’s the latter I would recommend they take their head out of the sand forthwith, because it’s their asses that are on the line. If Trudeau is caught up in something awful—an impression he grants every time he muzzles a person or an investigative body—they are going to wear it too.

READ MORE: On the elimination of inconvenient Liberals

At root, it’s a question of what our politics is meant to be. Solidarity come hell or (possibly criminal) high water, or a declaration of principles that are to be adhered to even if the King decides they are no longer convenient? All that’s certain is that Liberals of good faith are running out of time to keep the taint from the party brand that, believe it or not, should extend beyond their leader.

Every once in a while, anyway, there is a glimpse of steel. Wilson-Raybould and Philpott have clearly made their stand, and MPs like Nathaniel Erskine-Smith and Wayne Long have encouraged the Prime Minister to allow their colleagues to speak freely. Sadly, they are the exception that proves the rule of caucus solidarity. For every independent mind there is a ‘good soldier’ like Judy Sgro around to tell them to get back in line.

Now, someone like me would delight in all of this, wouldn’t I? But I speak from experience. I’ve put my cack hands to use in the service of scandal, too.

I will bet you the vast majority of Conservative backbench MPs in the last Parliament would rather we had vomited out the Mike Duffy business all at once so they could make their judgments about its propriety in 2013 rather than come election time, when it was before the courts. Sometimes the attempt at a political cover up becomes the crime (as it was with Duffy—with the caucus never losing faith in Harper as their leader), but other times the cover up is there to blanket an actual crime. It would be good for Liberals to know with which they’re dealing. At least you’d think. But politics is a funny business and partisanship is a hell of a drug.

Given that Wilson-Raybould herself has said the approaches made to her over the back end of last year on SNC weren’t—in her view—illegal, one suspects the unrevealed bits of the SNC saga speak more to Trudeau’s character, and not the legality of his actions, or the actions of those in his employ. Given the Liberals are so reliant on Trudeau as the figurehead and his image as their brand, it would explain why Trudeau’s office would fight tooth and nail to keep any contrary evidence out of public view. We’ve had a glimpse of angry Trudeau before, including the recent bust-up with Celina Caesar-Chavannes, and it hasn’t always been pretty.

Either way, the truth will out.

In case the Prime Minister hasn’t figured this out yet, the two former ministers arrayed against him are both smarter and more determined than he is. Given their un-shifting story, they also appear to be on firmer ground. They think Trudeau’s pulled some funny business and they aren’t going to rest until all of the dirty laundry is aired in public. And if the PMO tries to smear them, they will punch right back, and land the heavier blow.

And you know who will be cheering that on? Team Orange and Team Blue, that’s who. Forget that people aren’t really warming to Andrew Scheer; if Trudeau has done something very ugly it won’t take a political genius to beat him. Remember Doug Ford?

If I were a Liberal MP who was still in the dark over the truth I would be asking for some light. Stat. The Liberals not named Trudeau need to ask themselves what they’re in Ottawa to try to accomplish. Are they in it for their platform and their party, or are they in it for the (potentially dis)honourable Member from Papineau?

In other words, are they Liberals, or are they a Trudeau’s men and women?

If Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott’s motives were pure, they would be following her lead. It makes no sense to claim non-confidence in the government and stay in caucus. Caucus is the legislative branch of government, empowered to act on cabinet’s executive direction. Cabinet and caucus go hand in hand. You can’t have one without the other.

Article Continued Below

A caucus is a place where members speak freely without fear of public broadcast or leaks. Trust is an important part of building political confidence. Opposing view: Should dissident Liberals stay in caucus? Yes Neither former minister trusts Trudeau, and the feeling is mutual. I have received dozens of communications from Liberal caucus members who do not feel comfortable speaking freely in the presence of two members engaged in derailing their leader. In every profession, people work with colleagues whom they may not like. Former Prime Minister Jean Chrétien and his finance minister, Paul Martin, were not exactly bosom buddies. But together they produced results. But not being friends, and working actively to dislodge your leader, are two different things.

The Big Debate

Philpott claims there is more to come. Their ongoing whisper campaign is strengthened by their presence inside the Liberal tent. Once departed, the bleeding would be cauterized very quickly. Canadian Liberal parliamentarians could learn from long-serving American politician Mo Udall. The self-described one-eyed Mormon Democrat from Conservative Iowa once said, “When the Democratic Party forms a firing squad, we form a circle.”

Article Continued Below

The firing squad facing Justin Trudeau is just such a circle. The leaks did not come from the opposition. Nor did they stop with an unprecedented invitation to speak to cabinet and more than four hours of justice committee testimony. When is enough, enough? Both women want this issue in the headlines, but refuse to avail themselves of their right to speak in Parliament, protected by privilege. If they stayed, it wouldn’t be the first time enemies worked together. But participating in caucus involves speaking and listening, something that Wilson-Raybould does not appear to embrace. THE BIG DEBATE: For more opposing view columns from Toronto Star contributors, click here. A former Vancouver riding president said they parted company because of her unbridled resistance to listen to anyone. During her parliamentary committee testimony, Wilson-Raybould produced copious notes from assistants. But she could not name a single colleague with whom she had consulted on the deferred prosecution agreement question. The self-described truth teller did not tell the whole truth about her cabinet move to veterans affairs. The prime minister asked her to lead the dissolution of the Indian Act as minister of Indigenous services, an offer she conveniently omitted from her lengthy testimony. The offer was subsequently compared to having Nelson Mandela administer apartheid. She is no Nelson Mandela. He embraced the challenge to dismantle apartheid. She spurned it. Philpott’s explosive Maclean’s interview also confirmed that Wilson-Raybould did not complain to the prime minister about undue pressure. So what is the end game? Just last week, Wilson-Raybould penned a 684-word letter to constituents. She confirmed that she “currently” plans to run for the Liberals in the next election. This bizarre descriptor was the only Liberal mention made, even though the letter was supposed to explain her decision to stay. Wilson-Raybould went to great lengths to explain how she was so different from other self-serving politicians who came before her, writing “I found myself in a situation I never expected to be in. I was just doing my job, and I did not expect it to become a national focus.” That statement is a blatant lie as personal details leaked to the Globe and Mail could only have come, directly or indirectly, from her. Philpott and Wilson-Raybould refuse to leave the caucus. Instead, from the inside, they co-ordinate a full court assault on the leader. Another Udall aphorism outlines the difference between a cactus and a caucus. “On a cactus, the pricks are on the outside.” This caucus must be pruned. Sheila Copps is the former Liberal heritage minister, environment minister and deputy prime minister of Canada.

He dragged along Bernadette Jordan, the minister of rural economic development, in order to give the Nova Scotian a little positive press instead of having to hear the vitriol being hurled around Ottawa over the Lavscam scandal.

And, it conveniently got Justin Trudeau the hell out of Dodge, too, although he did make a fool of himself the night before when he yelled out, “Thank you for your donation” to a fundraiser crasher in Toronto who was protesting the decades of mercury poisoning at the Grassy Narrows First Nations reserve.

But we have grown to expect such arrogant flippancy from our leader.

The Trudeau Liberals are desperately trying to turn the page on the SNC-Lavalin cockup, of course — the cabinet resignations of marquee players like Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, the abrupt “retirement” of Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, as well as Trudeau’s principal secretary Gerald Butts martyring himself in an attempt to save Trudeau from his sorry self — and move on to discuss, or at least remember, that there was a budget recently tabled.

There were approximately 400 pages in that budget, if memory serves, so it is not something to just toss in the recycling bin with a thud, walk away, and then forget that it ever existed.

There’s supposedly very important stuff in that document, the kind of stuff the Trudeau Liberals would love to ride to victory in October’s election if that pesky two-month-old Lavscam controversy would simply dry up.

But it’s hanging on like a bad rash.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau, the blue-chip Bay St. chap who tabled that budget, and who has been out in the hustings promoting how the Liberals are fighting for the middle class “and those who want to join it,” started the week on Global TV’s The West Block, defending himself to host Mercedes Stephenson from assaults coming from the big shots in business that he “failed to address the fundamental issues” facing Canadian companies.

It was the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, after all, and not some backwater organizational rube, that accused him of not doing enough to help businesses become more globally competitive.

“I don’t agree with them at all,” said Morneau, stating there were measures in the budget that propose to make it a lot easier for Canadian companies to attract and train the employees who will ultimately enhance their bottom lines.

The key word, of course, is “propose.”

If the Trudeau Liberals are not re-elected, well, it all dies on the vine, including the pharmacare measures that will supposedly assist geezers like me as we make our way towards the inevitability of eternal rest.

In between pitching the positives in his budget, Morneau attended a $500-a-plate fundraiser in Edmonton to support the local Liberal riding association, as other highfalutin Liberals fanned out across the country to trumpet the budget.

Like Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor; Employment Minister Patty Hajdu; Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau; Social Development Minister Jean-Yves Duclos; Treasury Board President Joyce Murray; Seniors Minister Filomena Tassi in Nanaimo; and Public Services Minister Carla Qualtrough.

That’s a lot of Liberals trying to turn the page.

But, then again, their political lives depend on it.

CBC News has learned that MPs will discuss expelling the two women when they return to Parliament from their ridings next week.

Some MPs who don't want to be identified say that if the matter of the two MPs' caucus status isn't on Wednesday's caucus agenda, they'll stand up at the meeting and ask their colleagues to vote on ejecting Wilson-Raybould and Philpott.

Liberal MPs from all regions of the country tell CBC News they feel the two former cabinet ministers can't stay.

""I've come to the conclusion that they both have lost any right to be a part of this team,"" Quebec MP Alexandra Mendès wrote in an email. She said serving in a party caucus requires ""loyalty and team spirit.""

Many caucus members who once said they thought Wilson-Raybould and Philpott could remain now say they don't understand how they can continue to identify as members of the Liberal Party given the damage done to the government by the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Trudeau punts on question of caucus status

At an event in Halifax yesterday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was asked if he thinks the two MPs should be permitted to stay.

""As for what Dr. Philpott and Ms. Wilson-Raybould intend to do as next steps, people are going to have to ask them,"" he replied.

CBC sent emails to Wilson-Raybould and Philpott; so far, neither has responded.

Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet Feb. 12, just days after the Globe and Mail reported that she had been inappropriately pressured by PMO and other officials to overturn a decision by the Director of Public Prosecution Service of Canada to proceed with a criminal prosecution against SNC-Lavalin related to bribery charges for contracts in Libya.

The Montreal-based global engineering and construction company had been seeking an agreement that would allow it to avoid criminal proceedings and a possible 10-year ban on bidding for federal contracts in the event of a conviction.

Philpott resigned from cabinet on March 4, saying she had lost ""confidence"" in the government's handling of the SNC-Lavalin file.

Other senior Liberals have suggested that while the caucus is inclined to expel them, they feel the better option would be for Wilson-Raybould and Philpott to leave of their own accord, as did Whitby, Ont. MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes. She quit the Liberal caucus March 20 to sit as an independent.

Some Liberal MPs aren't ready to say one way or the other.

""Both of them have been great colleagues and, you know, we'll see how that evolves. But again, decision's not going to be mine. I'll be, of course, part of the caucus, but we'll just wait and see how things evolve from here,"" said New Brunswick MP Pat Finnigan.

'It would be a mistake to expel them' — MP Wayne Long

""I mean, any member who wants to stay part of the caucus has to say that they support the prime minister and, obviously, they support the Liberal agenda. We all got elected under the Liberal Party of Canada. I mean, I'll leave that question up to Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott, whether or not they want to remain part of the caucus,"" said Ontario MP Francis Drouin.

Some caucus members say they still think the two MPs should be permitted to remain.

""I strongly believe that our caucus is made stronger by the continued presence of Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Dr. Philpott within it, and that it would be a mistake to expel them from caucus,"" New Brunswick MP Wayne Long said in an email.

""I'm proud to be a member of a caucus in which members who share the same set of progressive values are free to express their views, and those of their constituents, on the issues that matter to them, even when they disagree with our leader or the majority of caucus members on those issues.""

A decision on expulsion could come as early as next Wednesday.","Pressure building in Liberal caucus to eject Wilson-Raybould, Philpott",CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/wilson-raybould-philpott-snc-lavalin-trudeau-1.5076998

On Monday evening, hours after Manitoba Chief Justice Glenn D. Joyal got dragged into the mess for no good reason — pending further excavations — she finally hit rock bottom.

Joyal is a highly respected jurist who had been shortlisted by a non-partisan committee for appointment to the Supreme Court. But in Copps’ telling he is “homophonic (sic), anti-abortion (and) anti-Charter” — and former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, for some crazy reason, wanted to make him Chief Justice.

To the extent that’s based on anything, it’s on accounts by anonymous sources to CTV News and Canadian Press alleging Wilson-Raybould and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau very much disagreed on the appointment.

Former AG decries release of CONFIDENTIAL (her caps) discussions re. Trudeau’s refusal to support her recommendation of a homophonic, anti-abortion, anti-Charter Chief Justice. Who released CONFIDENTIAL details of her discussion with the PM 7 weeks ago? — Hon. Sheila Copps (@Sheila_Copps) March 26, 2019

Well, I say “alleging.” It’s not actually controversial: No one disputes the appointment was ultimately the PM’s to make, or that the justice minister was allowed to have her opinions. No, this is just sort of an FYI leak. People thought we should know that Wilson-Raybould supported a Supreme Court candidate whom Trudeau worried (per CTV correspondent Glen McGregor) “wasn’t committed to protecting rights that have flown out of interpretation of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, particularly LGBTQ2 rights and even abortion access.”

“Well-placed sources say the former justice minister’s choice for chief justice was a moment of ‘significant disagreement’ with Trudeau, who has touted the Liberals as ‘the party of the Charter’,” Joan Bryden reported for CP. “Internal discussions about a Supreme Court appointment … are typically considered highly confidential,” Bryden added. But, you know, Anonymous Sources just thought we should know Trudeau had done his research, and had come across a speech Joyal gave to the Canadian Constitution Foundation in 2017.

In that speech, he soberly explains his entirely mainstream concerns that Canadian courts have over the years progressively asserted a policy-making dominance over the legislatures that the Charter’s framers had never intended, and with some deleterious effects to the country’s “political culture.” Perhaps Trudeau might also have come across Joyal’s 1993 Master’s thesis from the University of Manitoba, in which he makes similar arguments and analyzes R v. Morgentaler, among other cases.

“Irrespective of one’s position on the excessively difficult substantive issue, abortion like capital punishment was undeniably one of the two subjects mentioned in the discussion before the Parliamentary committee about which it was assured that such substantive outcomes would be left to Parliament,” he wrote in his thesis. If stakeholders had known what Charter cases would look like in 35 years, in other words, we might not even have the Charter.

Joyal doesn’t ever seem to have articulated a personal position on abortion. I can’t find a word he’s said about same-sex marriage in any context. To imply such a person is unfit for the bench is outrageous. To impute from his analysis of R v. Morgentaler that he’s anti-abortion and homophobic is almost parodic demagoguery. It makes “Why do you hate the troops?” look like something out of Plato’s Republic. As for “anti-Charter”: “Put simply,” Joyal told the CCF, “as a foundational part of Canada’s constitutional architecture, the Charter deserves our respect and demands our compliance.”

Many Canadians seem to truly believe that Margaret Atwood’s Gilead is but one misplaced ballot and one moderately conservative judge away

This is all a brand new low for the Anonymous Sources. But it’s entirely typically Liberal thinking, as well: “Joyal has concerns about judicial overreach. Therefore he is a conservative. Conservatives hate abortion and gay people. Ergo Joyal applied to sit on the Supreme Court in hopes of repealing R v. Morgentaler and the same-sex marriage reference and goodness only knows what else. QED.

“So obvious and appalling is this, furthermore, that we must suspect Jody Wilson-Raybould of holding similar hidden aspirations — or at the very least of woeful incompetence.”

After 10 years of Stephen Harper doing nothing on abortion, and with Andrew Scheer understandably pledging to continue doing nothing, many Canadians seem to truly believe that Margaret Atwood’s Gilead is but one misplaced ballot and one moderately conservative judge away. Three-quarters of Canadians now think it’s “great that … two people of the same sex can get married,” according to a 2017 CROP poll — up from just 41 per cent 20 years earlier. No one is challenging same-sex marriage in court. No prominent Conservative politician has made a peep about it in at least a decade. But the Anonymous Sources want us to believe the Chief Justice of Manitoba poses a mortal threat to marriage equality.

Incidentally, one of the deleterious effects of Canadians becoming so used to “judicial adjudication of political and social issues,” Joyal argued in his CCF speech, is that there is “less room for long-term legislative results and solutions premised upon the tools of negotiation, persuasion, bargaining and compromise.” Whatever the disease, the symptoms are acute. Ideally, the utter shabbiness of the Liberals’ behaviour since the Lavalin story broke might help wake us from this never-ending paranoid fever dream that passes for election-year politics.

OTTAWA – To address the current trade ban of Canadian canola seed by the Chinese government, the House of Commons Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food convened today on Parliament Hill for an emergency meeting called for by NDP Agriculture Critic, Alistair MacGregor.

The Liberal majority on the committee voted down a motion backed by Conservatives and New Democrats that would have seen former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott testify about the controversy.

“The coverup continues,” Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre said after the meeting ended.

Wilson-Raybould told the justice House of Commons justice committee last month that she was pressured by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his senior advisers and senior ad visors to the finance minister, to overrule the decision by the director of public prosecutions not to negotiate a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin rather than proceed to a criminal trial on fraud charges.

She believes she was shuffled out of justice in January because she wouldn’t change her mind.

Trudeau has denied anything improper occurred but has been unable to change the channel from the saga that has badly hurt his public image. He said the whole thing boils down to a breakdown in trust between him, his aides and Wilson-Raybould.

During the almost two-hour-long meeting Tuesday, Conservatives and New Democrats urged their Liberal colleagues to put partisan issues aside and agree to have the ethics committee take on the probe after the Liberals ended the justice committee’s investigation last week.

Liberal MP Nathaniel Ermine-Smith, who voted in favour of an NDP motion in February to hold a public inquiry on the matter, said at the ethics committee Tuesday a new probe may only result in relitigating what has already been said at the unless the two former cabinet ministers were granted wider waivers to testify on the issue.

Trudeau has not indicated any willingness to do that saying the waivers were already unprecedented and allowed for the facts relevant to the matter at hand to be made public.

The justice committee heard from 10 witnesses over five meetings but opposition parties say Wilson-Raybould named 11 people who she felt crossed the line and all of them should be asked to testify. Only two of those people were among the witnesses the justice committee did hear from.

Trudeau faced renewed questions about the controversy during a morning event in Winnipeg where he was trying to promote his government’s budget introduced one week ago. He would not, however, say whether he rejected Wilson-Raybould’s 2017 recommendation for chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada.

Sources told The Canadian Press that Trudeau turned down Wilson-Raybould’s recommendation that Glenn Joyal be elevated from chief justice of Manitoba’s Court of Queen’s Bench to chief justice of the Supreme Court over Joyal’s views on the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Shortly after Trudeau told Wilson-Raybould he did not support her choice, the sources said Joyal withdrew his name from consideration.

In a statement Monday, Joyal said he submitted an application for consideration for the Supreme Court in 2017, only to be forced to withdraw his name for personal reasons related to his wife’s health.

Instead, Trudeau appointed Sheila Martin to the high court and named Richard Wagner as chief justice. Former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper appointed Wagner to the high court.

Trudeau said Tuesday he would not discuss the matter nor would he say whether his office was involved in the leak of what is usually a highly confidential appointments process.

Trudeau said it is the prime minister’s choice of who to nominate for the Supreme Court, as well as for chief justice, and that Canadians can and should continue to have faith in their judicial system.

Speaking at the ethics committee meeting, Kent said the breach of a highly confidential judicial appointment process would warrant a parliamentary investigation on its own.

In a written question in the Commons, B.C. Conservative MP Todd Doherty asked for expenditure details about federal employees who were “sent” to the annual SHOT Show in Las Vegas, Nev.

The annual exhibit, held in the sprawling Sands Expo Centre on the outskirts of the city’s downtown casinos, is limited to representatives from armed forces, police services, tactical police units, the gun industry and related associations. It is not an event open to the general public, and no one under age 16 is allowed in.

The annual event is put on each year by the U.S. National Shooting Sports Foundation — a lobbying arm for the U.S. Firearms Industry Trade Association. The industry generates $13.6 billion annually manufacturing small arms and ammunition in the U.S. and another $3.1 billion at the retail end.

Attendance to the Vegas trade show has grown to more than 62,000 from around the world. The events website totals over 500 suppliers, with more than 1,600 exhibitors.

Under the rules of procedure for government responses to the order paper questions from MPs, all departments had to submit responses to the question under Doherty’s name.

Only three departments or services responded that employees had attended the mammoth Jan. 22 to 25 exhibit — the Department of National Defence and Canadian Armed Forces, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canada Border Services Agency.

The amount spent by all three branches on flights, accommodation, meals and other costs totalled $158,431, with the DND contingent accounting for the lion’s share of the expenses, reporting $130,961 in costs. An RCMP troop of three Mounties who attended submitted expenses totalling $10,992 while expenses for five CBSA agents who also attended came to $16,478.

Doherty did not respond to a request for an interview for this story. His office connected iPolitics with Mathew Clancy, a press secretary for the Conservative shadow cabinet in the House of Commons. Clancy, by email, responded on behalf of Quebec MP Pierre Paul-Hus, the party’s critic for public safety.

“It is unacceptable that Justin Trudeau’s government sent dozens of public servants and spent hundreds of thousands of taxpayers’ dollars to attend a conference in Las Vegas,” Clancy’s email said. “This is yet again another example of Justin Trudeau’s lack of respect for Canadian taxpayer dollars,” Clancy quoted Paul-Hus as saying.

Word that the government agencies assigned personnel to the show spread quickly. Doherty, or a member of the Conservative caucus research bureau on his behalf, tabled the written question about government expenditures for the show on Jan. 29 — the first Commons sitting day after the show ended.

There were at least two other Canadians related to the arms industry who also attended the arms bazaar: Rod Giltaca, founder and head of the fledgling Canadian Coalition for Firearms Rights and a qualified firearms licence instructor, and Alison de Groot, managing director of the Canadian Sporting Arms and Ammunition Association.

The coalition has been strongly opposed to controversial Liberal gun-control legislation, Bill C-71, while the sporting arms group has advocated for firearm businesses and retailers as the bill has made its way through Parliament.

All three government branches responded to Doherty’s request for department rationale for sending personnel to the event.

The RCMP response explained that federal cabinet and Treasury Board had approved ongoing funding for the annual RCMP attendance at the trade show in 2005. The response did not mention it, but a Liberal government was in place at the time.

Two of the Mounties who participated are with the RCMP Specialized Firearms Support Services Unit, which the response described as the “policy centre” for national firearm classification in Canada.

The unit is responsible for development and maintenance of the Firearms Reference Table, a national database accessible only to licensed firearm businesses and firearm officers. The response describes the database as the “most comprehensive, single-source firearms reference in existence” and said it is used by law enforcement and other agencies in 190 countries via Interpol.

The other participant in the Mountie contingent was the senior armourer and technical authority for the RCMP’s National Armoury Program, which approves all firearms and accessories procured by the national police force.

The Canada Border Services Agency said its agents focused on knowledge of trends, innovations and health and safety regulations, as well as shooting range design, development and maintenance. The CBSA is still monitoring and reviewing the use of sidearms by its agents at borders, in a program that began in 2006.

By publication time, the Department of National Defence and Canadian Armed Forces had not yet responded to questions about its contingent, but pointed to the rationale the department explained in its response to Doherty’s question.

“These employees attended the event to improve corporate knowledge of innovation within the industries of small arms, ammunition and accessories for law enforcement and military applications, and to meet with different vendors,” the department’s House of Commons response said.

The department later provided a lengthy explanation of personnel work at the exhibit.

The Department of National Defence and Canadian Armed Forces contingent included staff from the department’s science and technology branch, the assistant deputy minister of materiel branch, the Canadian Army and the Canadian Special Operations Forces Command.

The group included members of a coalition project involving Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States that is developing a new-generation digital night vision goggle. A senior technician from the same branch attended to view new technology involving day and night vision rifle scopes.

Another member came from the Canadian Army Infantry School Sniper cell, while members of a Force Development team responsible for next generation weapons, ammunition and optic systems also attended.

“While no purchases were made directly as a result of attending the SHOT Show, attendance at these types of events helps to ensure that the CAF remains a first-class military, ready to face the challenges of the 21st century by helping to identify and target the requirements of the CAF,” said media liaison officer Daniel Lebouthillier.",Tories blame Liberals for federal spending on Las Vegas arms show,iPolitics,https://ipolitics.ca/2019/03/26/tories-blame-liberals-for-federal-spending-on-las-vegas-arms-show/

Bert Paul, a long-time Liberal, says a non-partisan inquiry that includes testimony under oath is the only way to find out what happened.

""I believe Canadians should know the truth,"" Paul said in an interview with CTV News Vancouver's Mi-Jung Lee this week.

Developing story: New evidence released Friday

Paul served as the chair of the audit committee of the Federal Liberal Agency, the chief agent of the Liberal Party of Canada.

The party has been under the microscope for weeks after allegations surfaced suggesting political influence in a corruption and fraud case against the Montreal-based engineering and construction company.

There are already two investigations into the affair, being conducted by the justice committee and the federal ethics commissioner.

But Paul feels there should be a third, non-partisan review of what exactly occurred.

""It would be done independent of the parliamentary system,"" he said.

""It would have powers associated with the ability to subpoena, so they could request information, they could request documentation. They could also require individuals to come and to give testimony so that Canadians can find out what the facts are.""

The allegations of obstruction of justice are serious, he said, and should be dealt with before the federal election.

When asked how he thought the scandal was being handled by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Paul said most Canadians find it perplexing.

""The question is, what did he know and when did he know it? I think Canadians are frustrated, as am I, because I believe we have not had a full and independent investigation of the issues, and I think we owe it to the Canadian public to do that,"" he said.

New evidence from former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould regarding SNC-Lavalin is set to be made public Friday.

Additional documents include copies of emails and text messages as well as a new written statement, which Wilson-Raybould is providing to supplement testimony she gave one month ago. Read a recap of that testimony on CTVNews.ca.

Paul also spoke out against recent leaks about the appointment of a Supreme Court Justice, calling them an attempt to undermine Wilson-Raybould's credibility.

But the big question is, do people really care about deficits? Do voters reward deficit hawks and punish free-spenders? Polling on the issue is a mixed bag, and the better gauge may be how people actually vote when faced the choice, such as in the recent Quebec election.

The topic, which could be a ballot box issue in the fall, took centre-stage after the Liberal government unveiled a budget that projects more deficits in a year the books were supposed to be balanced. Criticism flowed, along with warnings of potential economic disruption. The trouble is, despite such warnings in recent times, governments of all shades continued to ring in deficits — and win elections. Which leaves open the question of whether people are as concerned about deficits as some might think.

True, there was a time, particularly in the 1990s, when slaying the deficit was a national obsession. With the Ontario and federal governments facing record deficits and on the brink of economic meltdown, most people accepted deep and often painful spending cuts to rein in bulging deficits and soaring debt.

Jean Chretien’s Liberal government led the way, balancing the budget in 1997-98 and leaving a string of surpluses. Conservative Mike Harris also balanced the Ontario budget in 1999 and was rewarded with re-election. That was the golden decade of deficit-busting.

By the 2000s, however, the war on deficits appeared to lose steam.

Harris’s successor, Ernie Eves, recorded a deficit, and Liberal Dalton McGuinty who followed in 2003, ran more deficits than surpluses. Federally, Stephen Harper’s decade-long record was mixed.

Harper balanced the budget on occasion, but recorded several deficits. For both Harper and McGuinty, the 2008 global financial crisis may have been a factor, but importantly by that time, people appeared to have soured on austerity.

The governments of the day understood the changing mood, and the spending trend continued.

Ontario voters soundly rejected Conservative leader Tim Hudak’s plan for big spending cuts to balance the budget in the 2014 election. Liberal Kathleen Wynne, whose platform included significant spending, won.

Perhaps the most telling example of the shift in public mood was last October’s Quebec election. Premier Philippe Couillard inherited a deficit and chose to focus on its elimination in short order, slashing services, including education and health care.

He succeeded but Quebeckers were not amused. Instead of kudos for the man who slew the dragon, they sent him packing. Ironically, the new Coalition Avenir Québec government is splashing out on services with surpluses left behind by Couillard.

Next in line is Ontario Premier Doug Ford, a deficit hawk, whose budget comes down April 11.

Interestingly, the shift in the public mood is happening not just in Canada. Even in the United States, where cutting spending and deficits was religion to Republicans, President Donald Trump has been racking up deficits. The U.S. deficit is set to top $1 trillion this year, and Republicans just shrug their shoulders.

Reneging on his promise to balance the budget this year, and instead splashing billions on services, Trudeau is gambling that program spending will trump deficit reduction in the eyes of Canadians.

Scheer has taken the opposite view and when voters speak in a few months, we’ll know who got it right. Of course, the public mood can change quickly to Trudeau’s disadvantage if the economy tanks. Deficits don’t really matter to New Democrats, who want even more spending. But as the Conservatives digest the Liberal budget and plot election strategy, they may do well to reconsider deficit-slaying as the centrepiece of their campaign. The sand has shifted on the issue and on recent evidence, an arm-to-arm combat on the deficit with Liberals could be risky.

Deficit busters, beware.

Canadian activists want Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government to pass what the activists see as mainly timid reforms in Bill C-71 and then move to more ...,"In the wake of the Christchurch mosque attacks and New Zealand’s rapid legislative response, Canadian gun control advocates are increasing their efforts to get Ottawa to follow suit.

“The government of New Zealand has swiftly and responsibly responded to the atrocities…by almost immediately committing to ban the type of weapons that facilitate such extreme violence,” Natalie Provost told CBC News.

Provost is a survivor of the 1989 gun massacre at École Polytechnique in Montreal in which 14 women were shot and killed.

Provost’s view was echoed by Heidi Rathjen, a coordinator with the gun control group PolySeSouvient, in a CBC interview.

“The huge difference is that New Zealand is acting and Canada is not–and yet we have a government that promised to get handguns and assault weapons off our streets,” Rathjen said.

“The Liberals are so terrified of this. The public is in favour of a ban but they’re terrified of the gun lobby, which is extremely active and threatening in terms of elections and votes.”

New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, moved quickly following the mosque attacks, issuing a cabinet order that bans people in her country from owning semi-automatic firearms and semi-automatic firearms capable of use with a detachable magazine that holds more than five rounds.

She is also moving to a ban on gun accessories like bump stocks that enable a firearm to discharge ammunition faster.

Firearms commonly used by farmers and hunters, such as rifles with small, non-detachable magazines–will be permitted.

Canadian activists want Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government to pass what the activists see as mainly timid reforms in Bill C-71 and then move to more controversial changes, such as a handgun ban.

Possession of fully automatic firearms is prohibited in Canada, any would-be gun owner must submit to a background check and Canadians must register restricted firearms, including handguns, with police.

301,,2019-03-29T00:44:00.0000000Z,According to a Canadian Institute for Health Information ... the “first steps” toward such a program. While the Liberals have struggled in recent years to elect candidates in Saskatchewan ...,"Many questions remain about the federal government’s pitch for national pharmacare, but Canada’s employment minister says the election-year budget item that lays the groundwork is about doing the right thing over the long term.

“If you don’t start somewhere with prevention, you will always be playing catch-up,” Patty Hajdu, who represents Thunder Bay — Superior North and has served in cabinet since 2015, said Monday in an interview with the Saskatoon StarPhoenix.

“As people age, you’re going to see a higher and higher hit to provincial coffers (and) to municipal coffers, who are picking up the cost for people who are living in poverty, who are losing their housing maybe as a choice between affording medication and paying their rent.”

Hajdu, who was in Saskatoon this week to promote what she signalled is likely to be a Liberal Party of Canada plank in the upcoming federal election, acknowledged that it’s too soon to say how much national pharmacare would cost or when it could be available.

She noted, however, that it has been on the government’s agenda since at least last year.

In his last budget, Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced the creation of an advisory council on national pharmacare. That group’s report is not expected until later this spring, but Morneau’s 2019 budget included more than $1 billion in new spending aimed at making drugs affordable.

That includes $35 million over four years to set up a Canadian Drug Agency to negotiate better drug prices and create a national formulary, and $1 billion over two years, beginning in 2022-23, to help people with rare diseases more easily acquire costly medications.

The budget also contemplated $500 million in ongoing annual spending beyond 2024-25 to help cover the cost of expensive drugs.

“Responsible leadership is about making investments in ways that are going to pay off long-term, and prevention is always a difficult argument because you can’t see it right away. You can’t actually see prevention the minute you spend,” Hajdu said.

“Is it in an election-year budget? Yes. Will it be in our platform? Yes. It’s the next logical step to the kinds of things that we’ve been investing in,” she added.

Hajdu made much the same pitch at a campaign-style event at a Saskatoon seniors’ home.

According to a Canadian Institute for Health Information study published last year, prescription drug spending in Canada was forecast to hit $33.7 billion in 2018, up four per cent from 2017. Around $14.4 billion of that total was expected to have been publicly funded.

The institute said in the same report that the 14 per cent of beneficiaries who received $2,500 or more from publicly-funded drug programs in 2017 accounted for 70 per cent of all public spending on pharmaceuticals.

Public drug programs paid $2,500 or more toward drug costs for 13.8 per cent of beneficiaries — 2.3 per cent received $10,000 or more — accounting for 69.7 per cent of all public drug spending, the institute said in the report.

In his budget, Morneau said the country’s “patchwork” of drug coverage, including more than 100 programs and 100,000 private insurance plans, “is not well equipped to handle the increasingly expensive drugs now coming to market.”

According to the government, the proposed Canadian Drug Agency could cut the cost of drugs by $3 billion per year.

It is not clear, however, what national pharmacare would look like. Hajdu said the new spending — in a budget with a deficit pegged at $19.8 billion and forecast to decline to $9.8 billion by 2023-24 — represents the “first steps” toward such a program.

While the Liberals have struggled in recent years to elect candidates in Saskatchewan — only one of the province’s 14 MPs, Ralph Goodale, represents the party in Ottawa — Hajdu said she hopes the new pitch will help pick up seats in the fall.

The federal government is not likely to be aided in that mission by the Saskatchewan government, which has wasted few opportunities to blast Ottawa for failing to stand up for oilpatch jobs and imposing a “job-killing” price on carbon.

Within minutes Monday afternoon, two good reporters had stories (here and here) about the Chief Justice of Manitoba, who was a candidate to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada and who, later, wasn’t. Both reporters unfurled similar yarns about a lone Prime Minister standing athwart the tide of conservatism by blocking—shudder—a Harper appointee from sitting on the top court. Jody Wilson-Raybould plays the role of villain in the piece.

Both reporters decorously neglect to mention that Trudeau’s choice for Chief Justice, Richard Wagner, was a Harper appointee.

There are many things we can say about this story, working outward in concentric rings from the thing itself. First, Glenn Joyal’s views, as expressed in speeches that were said to alarm the prime minister, are almost comically orthodox. I first became aware of the notion that Charter litigation systematically airlifts important matters from the parliamentary arena and into the realm of jurisprudence in a Chantal Hébert column in the late 1990s. If I had paid more attention to literally any of my Canadian public administration profs a decade earlier I would have caught the argument then, because it is canvassed in every Canadian political science class. This is not wild-eyed Hayekism.

Second, perhaps the many thousands of Canadians who have applied for federal government appointments under what they thought was a confidential process, introduced by this prime minister, will want to contemplate a class-action suit against him. Because it is now radiantly clear to each of them that their CV is being held hostage by a claque of embattled sorcerers’ apprentices who will cheerfully wheel it over the transom to any waiting scribe if anything about them—their opinions, a fallen political star’s unfortunate decision to argue for their advancement—becomes politically inconvenient. This is the very stuff of the police state.

It was immediately fashionable to wonder on social media how everyone would react if Stephen Harper had done such a thing. It’s germane to note that Stephen Harper never did. Because he had more class. Welcome to the Tet offensive of Charter rights: This was the week it became necessary to destroy the village of good government in order to save it.

Third, Justice Joyal’s wife was in poor health. Apparently we are to believe that 9,000 jobs depended on your knowing that.

If the Trudeau government is not the source of the leak, I assume we will see spectacular efforts deployed in the next 36 hours to find the leaker. Mark Norman-scale efforts. But I’m pretty sure that we needn’t hold our breath, because the government is the source of the leak; that the amiable chap who currently sits in the office once occupied by the Attorney General of Canada will not bestir himself to question Monday’s sickening attack on due process; and that the leak will actually be roundly applauded by the ambient cloud of Liberal and Liberal-adjacent opinion, which became self-aware this weekend and decided Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott are a virus endangering the party’s re-election chances and must therefore be stopped.

That’s right, it’s Judgment Day. As early as March 5, it was possible for Andrew Cohen to publish a column identifying Philpott and Wilson-Raybould as enemies of the (right-thinking) people. But not for the first time, Andrew was ahead of the moment, and when that column ran, he found few takers. The news that the Criminal Code had been amended in ways SNC-Lavalin found congenial as it faced a criminal trial for serious alleged misdeeds was interesting to millions of Canadians, including many Liberals. Justin Trudeau’s slow, tentative response was worrisome to lots of people who support the government, just as it was to many others. It was still possible for many minds to find room for both general support for Liberal re-election and general interest in what Wilson-Raybould and Philpott — recent Liberal rock stars, after all — had to say.

Then Maclean’s published my interview with Philpott last Thursday morning. On Thursday night’s At Issue panel, Chantal said that with Gerald Butts and Michael Wernick no longer working in government, Philpott and Wilson-Raybould were clearly looking for someone else to lose a job, and it must be Justin Trudeau. This interpretation became popular quickly (and probably would have even if Chantal hadn’t given it voice). By Saturday it was easy to find Liberals and friends of Liberals — pollsters, the odd political scientist, about half the party’s Ontario caucus — attributing the worst motives to the two former ministers. They were “infatuated with ephemeral attention,” said Frank Graves. They were committing “an attempted coup d’état,” wrote a lawyer with impressive credentials, Ishat Reza. This behaviour is, she added, “disqualifying.” This is understatement: Historical penalties for coup plotting have been harsher than exclusion from a governing caucus.

Qui veut noyer son chien l’accuse de la rage, we say in Quebec. When you want to drown your dog you say it has rabies.

This SNC-Lavalin business has been bewildering — honestly bewildering, in ways that are surely easy to understand — for many Canadians with good hearts since it began. It is an odd scandal by many standards. No money changed hands illegally, or at least not after the Qaddafis were executed. None of the assorted Liberal staffers and high officials who came at Jody Wilson-Raybould was seeking personal advancement, except insofar as many of them wanted to be on the winning side in an election and, she asserts, kept telling her so. They kept asking whether she’d seek outside advice on a decision that was the public prosecutor’s to make and the AG’s to review. When they were done asking, the prosecutor’s decision held. That would have been the end of that, if she hadn’t been shuffled. Then it became a duel of assertions and interpretations.

It’s easy to understand why all of this would seem minor and technical. An interesting theological debating point, but surely not worth more than a month of headlines and anguished commentary. So it didn’t get real, for many people, until Conservatives took the lead from Liberals in the polls — and Jane Philpott, whom Trudeau had been busy promoting in cabinet, announced that she too doesn’t like whatever she says she knows.

This puts the stakes high indeed. Everything Trudeau advocates is endangered, not by his own increasingly conspicuous limitations as a public administrator, but by the shorter route of a possible Conservative election victory this autumn. So it is all Liberal hands on deck. All of this is easy to understand.

I felt something like this was coming when I wrote, near the bottom of a column I wrote last November that was published in December, that an election is “the crudest possible instrument” for fixing serious shortcomings in public administration. It’s simply not true that if you don’t like something a government does you must replace it. But nor should re-electing the Liberals mean endorsing Justin Trudeau’s increasingly obvious flaws. The issues raised by the SNC-Lavalin controversy shouldn’t be settled by an election. Some misdeeds are worth dealing with as themselves, when they come up. And then let the election settle the election.

What is at stake in this affair is whether you can get the rules changed in mid-stream if you have the right friends or can hire them. Whether the decisions of competent professionals — beginning with an experienced prosecutor and defence lawyer, Kathleen Roussel — should be trumped by appeals to a preferred electoral outcome. This sort of system-rigging has been at the heart of, for instance, Poland’s confrontation with the European Union over judicial “reforms” that systematically benefit associates of the current regime. Reforms that are immensely popular among people who agree with the ruling party that they tilt the balance back toward fairness in a confrontation against political opponents they judge to be moral failures. Because it’s not only in Canada that you can win many arguments by saying, “Of course this helps our side, but that’s okay because our side is right.”

There’s a neat symmetry here. Jody Wilson-Raybould claimed she was approached, again and again, by people who said things had to work out a certain way because it was an election year. The emerging Liberal argument this month has been, not that this claim was untrue, but that of course it is true and should be. Wilson-Raybould and Philpott have sinned against a higher virtue so sure of itself that it cannot be troubled with the fine print. This sin is deemed disqualifying. They will soon be disqualified by their fellow Liberals, for the (synonymous) good of the party and the nation. And if you’ve sent your CV to Ottawa, have no fear. It probably won’t get leaked until it needs to be.

I have not found committees like ours to be very effective at conducting inquiries,"" said Erskine-Smith, who was the only Liberal to speak at the meeting.

Pointing to its earlier investigation of the Cambridge Analytica affair, he said committees are not best placed to do investigations.

""We ran into roadblocks and were unable to proceed based on our inability to compel document production in the same way, revisit previous testimony in the same way, frankly the tools we have at our disposal are more cumbersome.""

Still, Erskine-Smith broke with many of his Liberal colleagues, saying that if Wilson-Raybould and Philpott feel they cannot speak fully on the issue, then the prime minister should act to ensure they can.

He also agreed with the Conservatives and denounced what seemed to be a deliberate leak to CTV and Canadian Press aimed at showing relations between the prime minister and Wilson-Raybould had soured as early as 2017 when they disagreed whether a conservative Manitoba judge should be named to a Western vacancy on the Supreme Court. The reports named the judge, Glenn Joyal, who was forced to publicly disavow his candidacy, saying he withdrew his name because his wife had cancer.

""It is outrageous that there's a leak with respect to the Supreme Court judicial appointment process and without question that kind of leak undermines the confidence in the judicial selection process and appointment process. So I think people from all parties ought to condemn that kind of thing. Completely inappropriate.""

Wilson-Raybould told the justice committee last month that she faced ""inappropriate"" and ""sustained"" political pressure from Trudeau and senior officials last fall to mediate criminal charges against the Quebec construction and engineering company.

Trudeau and his team deny they pressured her, and said they only urged her to consider a second outside legal opinion. A mediated agreement would allow the company to avoid a criminal prosecution and with it, a 10-year ban on federal contracts, which had sparked fears within government of job losses.

Ramsay, who is a vice-chair of the justice committee, said there is little hope that committee will resume its hearings into the affair.

And she said the Liberal chair Anthony Housefather has publicly declared there's nothing more to be studied, he'd made up his mind.

In an opinion piece in the National Post last week, Housefather wrote that in his view it is ""duty"" of an attorney-general to consider new facts relative to a possible remediation agreement ""seriously and on an ongoing basis.""

David Moscrop, a political scientist with the department of communication at the University of Ottawa, said the day's proceedings left him ""frustrated."" He said he doesn't believe the office of the federal ethics commissioner is well-suited for this sort of inquiry. And he said the shutdown of the justice committee and now the refusal of the ethics committee to launch an inquiry underscores his belief that a public inquiry is the only forum to get at the facts.

""This is the sort of information that Canadians would like to have ideally before the election so it was frustrating to watch,"" Moscrop said an interview.

""It raises the broader question, can the House and its committees effectively hold the government to account in the current system, I think the answer is not really,"" he said.

""The only thing that's going to ultimately, I think, result in fundamental changes is if voters decide they're not going to have any of it,"" he said.

Last week’s federal budget revealed the Trudeau government’s plan to move forward on national pharmacare.

The problem, however, is that the government still hasn’t outlined exactly what it means by “national pharmacare” or why it thinks middle-class and wealthy Canadians need it. Essentially, these are marching orders to an unknown destination.

Let’s be clear. Recent studies repeatedly indicate that some Canadians (8%, 11% or 23% depending on the data source) have difficulty paying for the prescription drugs they need. If there were ever a role for policymakers, it would be to clearly identify and help these Canadians.

Unfortunately, Tuesday’s budget seems to indicate a vague and likely inefficient approach that may not even help those Canadians in greatest need.

Take, for example, the proposed creation of the Canadian Drug Agency (CDA), which would assess the effectiveness of prescription drugs and negotiate better prices on behalf of insurers. This may sound like good news, but agencies such as the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance, the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board and the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health already exist for these purposes.

And yet, this government has committed $35 million over four years to establish a “transition office” to help create this new bureaucracy. That’s right — taxpayers will spend $35 million to create an agency (the transition office) to help create a new agency in the future (the CDA) to do work that’s already being done by other agencies. While some may argue for this type of amalgamation, this seems like a very expensive game of musical chairs.

When finally created, the CDA will help provinces “develop a comprehensive evidence-based list of prescribed drugs.” Again, the necessity of such an approach is unclear. Most provinces already maintain their own lists (known as formularies), likely tailored to demographic requirements of their specific populations.

It’s also unclear if this will mean a basic formulary of a few hundred “essential” drugs or something much greater. Either way, it’s extremely unlikely that such a list would match the comprehensive lists of drugs routinely covered by private insurance plans across the country. The all-important question of who will ultimately be responsible for funding drugs listed on this new national formulary is entirely absent.

All of this raises a fundamental question — who, exactly, are these new bureaucracies and national formularies targeting?

At best, these proposals may help subsidize a basic list of prescription medications for the vast majority of Canadians who don’t need financial assistance. Meanwhile, it remains unclear if any of these changes will meaningfully improve the lives of Canadians in greatest need.

If governments are truly interested in helping these Canadians, they could explore further reducing or eliminating deductibles and other charges for lower-income individuals and families (among other clearly identifiable vulnerable groups). Provincial governments, specifically, could also consider shifting from inefficient age-based plans to income-based plans, targeting those in financial need irrespective of age rather than potentially subsidizing seniors who may be millionaires.

In fact, the only direct assistance offered in Tuesday’s announcement was the allocation of up to $500 million per year (starting in 2022) to help Canadians with rare diseases. But even here, it’s unclear how much of this money will go directly towards patients since the announcement also includes the creation of another “national strategy” for decision-making and negotiation.

No Canadian should be forced to forego basic medicine due to cost.

However, instead of blindly marching towards some mythical notion of “national pharmacare” and building bigger bureaucracies that are largely unnecessary, we should focus first on those Canadians in greatest need — those who have difficulty paying for their medications.

Although none of their biological parents is Canadian, Alexandra and Calder are Canadian citizens because they were born in the country, and their fathers say it's an important part of their heritage.","With two kids under two, the Berney-Edwards household in southeast England is a busy one. There are toddlers running all over the place. One pokes his dad in the eye and laughs before accidentally hitting his sister with a toy vacuum cleaner, causing her to wail. It can be a bit chaotic.

But Graeme and Simon Berney-Edwards wouldn't have it any other way. As gay men, there was a time when they thought they could never have any of that.

Now, however, they have their twins, the result of an arrangement involving a Canadian surrogate and Canadian surrogacy laws they feel are more progressive than those on the books in the United Kingdom.

""You see them tearing around and they're having fun, and just for a moment, you just sort of step back and go 'Wow, this is it. They're here,' "" Simon Berney-Edwards said in an interview at their home in Redhill, south of London.

""It can be very surreal,"" his husband Graeme Berney-Edwards chimed in.

When they decided surrogacy was the way they would have a family, they reached out to a surrogacy organization that helped them understand their options.

That organization connected them with a clinic in Las Vegas where in vitro fertilization took place. That's also where they learned they could have twins and each be a biological father to one child by fertilizing half of their American donor's eggs with Simon's sperm, the other half with Graeme's sperm, and then implanting the embryos in the same surrogate.

It means Alexandra and Calder, now 21 months old, are twins but only half-siblings. Born just minutes apart, they have the same biological mother, but different fathers.

They quickly chose to have the birth take place in Canada rather the U.K. That was because, they say, the surrogacy laws in their country are dated, primarily as a result of the U.K. considering the surrogate, and her partner, if she has one, to be the legal parents for the first six weeks of the child's life.

""And in that time, if the surrogate decides to change their mind, you have no recourse,"" said Simon Berney-Edwards. ""Basically, that's it. Your child is gone.""

Andrew Spearman, a British fertility and surrogacy lawyer, said the U.K. laws are ""archaic"" and that many of his clients turn to Canada for surrogacy.

""I think it gives an element of certainty. It gives the transparency, which we can't offer always, and it gives a very clear structure,"" he said in his London office.

Spearman said while U.K. surrogates and intended parents do draw up contracts outlining their agreement, the contracts aren't legally binding as they are in Canada.

Neither country allows surrogates to be paid, other than to cover their expenses, which Spearman said helps British parents explain the process to English courts when they return home. They still need to get a ""parental order"" in the U.K. that makes them legal parents and gives their children U.K. citizenship.

The Berney-Edwards say they were also drawn to the altruistic nature of Canadian surrogacy because they wanted more than a ""transactional"" experience.

""We wanted someone that was prepared to be part of a family throughout the children growing up,"" said Graeme Berney-Edwards.

After consulting a website that has profiles of women wanting to be surrogates, they found that in Meg Stone of Hamilton, Ont. Stone said that's also what drew her to them.

""They mentioned that they wanted twins and I'm always up for a challenge,"" she said. ""And they also said they wanted lifelong friendship, which was also something I wanted.""

After a couple of false alarms that saw the dads dashing off to Canada early, Alexandra and Calder were born on June 25, 2017, in Hamilton, where they stayed for the first seven weeks of their lives.

Stone, who has two of her own children, has continued to watch the twins grow from afar, swapping messages and photos and even making the trip to England for the twins' first birthday.

Her 12-year-old son, Jeffrey Seroski-Stone, said he's proud of his mom for helping to create a family.

""I think it's exciting how my mom ended up helping them out by giving them children, and I think we usually have a really good time, so I consider them to be like family to me,"" he said.

Stone is pregnant with twins again, helping another same-sex family have children.

""I love being a mom and why wouldn't I want to help somebody else do that, too?"" she said.

She maintains she wouldn't want to be paid for helping others have children, but there is a debate in Canada about whether paying surrogates should be decriminalized.

The current Canadian law came into force in 2004 and prohibits paying surrogates other than to reimburse them for certain medical and maternity costs.

The federal government is reviewing the legislation, including identifying categories for reimbursement and making them more clear. A Liberal MP tabled a private member's bill that would decriminalize payments to surrogates but opponents say it amounts to commercializing a woman's body.

Stone disagrees with the idea that a surrogate be given the chance to change her mind, as is set out in the current U.K. law.

""I never felt like they were mine to give away,"" she said. ""They were [with] me to watch and nurture until Simon and Graeme were able to.""

The Berney-Edwards say when it comes to surrogacy law, Canada has it right, but that doesn't mean it was easy or cheap.

They won't put a figure on it, but experts say they would have spent tens of thousands of dollars on Stone's expenses, agency and legal fees, not to mention three trips back and forth to Canada.

""But it was worth it,"" said Simon.

""Every single penny, cent, was worth it,"" said Graeme.

Although none of their biological parents is Canadian, Alexandra and Calder are Canadian citizens because they were born in the country, and their fathers say it's an important part of their heritage.

They look forward to the day they can explain to their children how they came into the world, how badly they were wanted and how much love was around them.

EDMONTON – Alberta Liberal Leader David Khan says he would give municipalities a veto over oil and gas drilling within their boundaries if his party were to win the April 16 election.

He says that would allow local governments to plan for safe and sustainable growth and development.

Khan also says he would provide municipalities greater autonomy by amending the Municipal Government Act to formally recognize them as “a new order of government.”

New revenue-generating powers would go to Edmonton and Calgary, and those cities and their voters would be free to make decisions on taxes and spending.

A Liberal government would open talks with smaller municipalities to come up with similar powers.

Khan says he would also create an equitable cannabis revenue-sharing model.

“The NDP government has unfairly compensated cities on cannabis sales relative to the costs they are incurring for legalization,” he said in a release Wednesday.

Urban municipalities currently face unpredictable funding, downloading of costs and a lack of co-operation, he said.

“Our municipalities play an increasingly important role in the life of Albertans, but they are disrespected by higher orders of government.”

CHARLOTTETOWN – Prince Edward Islanders will be going to the polls on April 23, Premier Wade MacLauchlan announced Tuesday night.

“This is Prince Edward Island’s time,” he told a nomination meeting for a local candidate at a Charlottetown hotel. “This is a time to decide if we go forward.”

The Liberal government didn’t have to take voters to the polls until Oct. 7 under the province’s fixed-date election provisions, but there was an apparent desire to avoid overlap with the federal election this fall.

In his speech, MacLauchlan called the Tories a party of division and opposition, and said support for the surging Greens would be an expensive social experiment.

He touted advancements made by his government on housing, lower taxes and reducing child poverty by more than half.

“Prince Edward Island is working,” he told the partisan crowd. “There are now more opportunities for Islanders to get ahead and strive.”

Despite a booming economy, polls suggest the Liberal party is likely facing a rough ride, with the Green party seen as a legitimate contender for power.

A Corporate Research Associates poll released this month suggests the Greens had a healthy lead, followed by the Progressive Conservatives, who picked a new leader, Dennis King, in February.

The Liberals were in third place, the poll suggests.

The Island has only ever been governed by the Liberals or Tories.

Green Leader Peter Bevan-Baker became the first party member elected to the legislature in 2015, and he has worked to build the Green brand, mainly by challenging the notion that the party is devoted to nothing more than environmental activism.

The party snagged a second seat when Hannah Bell, the 48-year-old head of a businesswomen’s association in Charlottetown, won a 2017 byelection.

The Liberals have been in power since 2007, and there are signs MacLauchlan – a longtime academic who began his political career in 2015 as premier – is personally unpopular.

The last time a minority government was elected in P.E.I. was 1890.

MacLauchlan said Tuesday night that he notified the other party leaders earlier in the day.

The election will also include a binding referendum on electoral reform – asking voters if they wish to stay with the current first-past-the-post system or change to a mixed-member-proportional-representation model.

Criticism flowed, along with warnings of potential ...","Justin Trudeau is taking flak from assorted experts for racking up deficits.

Economists, think-tanks and credit rating agencies all warn that the prime minister’s big spending could spell trouble for the economy. And in a swipe at Trudeau, Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer says balancing the budget would be a top priority under a Conservative government.

But the big question is, do people really care about deficits? Do voters reward deficit hawks and punish free-spenders? Polling on the issue is a mixed bag, and the better gauge may be how people actually vote when faced the choice, such as in the recent Quebec election.

The topic, which could be a ballot box issue in the fall, took centre-stage after the Liberal government unveiled a budget that projects more deficits in a year the books were supposed to be balanced. Criticism flowed, along with warnings of potential economic disruption. The trouble is, despite such warnings in recent times, governments of all shades continued to ring in deficits — and win elections. Which leaves open the question of whether people are as concerned about deficits as some might think.

True, there was a time, particularly in the 1990s, when slaying the deficit was a national obsession. With the Ontario and federal governments facing record deficits and on the brink of economic meltdown, most people accepted deep and often painful spending cuts to rein in bulging deficits and soaring debt.

Jean Chretien’s Liberal government led the way, balancing the budget in 1997-98 and leaving a string of surpluses. Conservative Mike Harris also balanced the Ontario budget in 1999 and was rewarded with re-election. That was the golden decade of deficit-busting.

By the 2000s, however, the war on deficits appeared to lose steam.

Harris’s successor, Ernie Eves, recorded a deficit, and Liberal Dalton McGuinty who followed in 2003, ran more deficits than surpluses. Federally, Stephen Harper’s decade-long record was mixed.

Harper balanced the budget on occasion, but recorded several deficits. For both Harper and McGuinty, the 2008 global financial crisis may have been a factor, but importantly by that time, people appeared to have soured on austerity.

The governments of the day understood the changing mood, and the spending trend continued.

Ontario voters soundly rejected Conservative leader Tim Hudak’s plan for big spending cuts to balance the budget in the 2014 election. Liberal Kathleen Wynne, whose platform included significant spending, won.

Perhaps the most telling example of the shift in public mood was last October’s Quebec election. Premier Philippe Couillard inherited a deficit and chose to focus on its elimination in short order, slashing services, including education and health care.

He succeeded but Quebeckers were not amused. Instead of kudos for the man who slew the dragon, they sent him packing. Ironically, the new Coalition Avenir Québec government is splashing out on services with surpluses left behind by Couillard.

Next in line is Ontario Premier Doug Ford, a deficit hawk, whose budget comes down April 11.

Interestingly, the shift in the public mood is happening not just in Canada. Even in the United States, where cutting spending and deficits was religion to Republicans, President Donald Trump has been racking up deficits. The U.S. deficit is set to top $1 trillion this year, and Republicans just shrug their shoulders.

Reneging on his promise to balance the budget this year, and instead splashing billions on services, Trudeau is gambling that program spending will trump deficit reduction in the eyes of Canadians.

Scheer has taken the opposite view and when voters speak in a few months, we’ll know who got it right. Of course, the public mood can change quickly to Trudeau’s disadvantage if the economy tanks. Deficits don’t really matter to New Democrats, who want even more spending. But as the Conservatives digest the Liberal budget and plot election strategy, they may do well to reconsider deficit-slaying as the centrepiece of their campaign. The sand has shifted on the issue and on recent evidence, an arm-to-arm combat on the deficit with Liberals could be risky.

Deficit busters, beware.

But the biggest bombshell, in Brown ...","On Friday, Conservative House Leader Candice Bergen offered some advice to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that he is likely to ignore. Let Jody Wilson-Raybould have her (additional) say. Stop muzzling her with cabinet confidence and solicitor-client privilege. Waive it.

Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners Suddenly, New Attention for List of Harper-Era Abuses Traffic surges for Tyee’s 2015 compilation of 70 Tory law and ethics breaches.

“The longer he continues this cover-up,” Bergen said of Trudeau, “the longer he moves heaven and earth to keep himself protected, the worse this gets for him.”

Does it get worse? Or will Canadians tire of the saga and move on, as the Liberals this week bet by moving to shut down the inquiry?

Martyn Brown, who as premier Gordon Campbell’s chief of staff handled scandals buffeting the B.C. government during the 2000s, thinks that this week Trudeau has moved closer to the brink of disaster. The heightened prospect of an RCMP investigation makes Trudeau an anchor sinking the party he once rescued with his leadership.

Now, says Brown, it’s time for Liberal insiders to convince Trudeau to step down.

More bad days for the PM

In one twist this week, Wilson-Raybould promised to dump a pile of more documents on the Justice Committee in order to prove her allegations of undue political interference are correct, even if she isn’t allowed to testify in person.

In another turn, Celina Caesar-Chavannes, who said she’d been bullied by a shouting Trudeau, left the Liberal caucus to sit as an independent MP.

Meanwhile, SNC-Lavalin’s CEO said Trudeau’s team is wrong to imply that his company asked to be spared a criminal trial or else it would move from Montreal with 9,000 Canadian jobs sacrificed.

But the biggest bombshell, in Brown’s view, was dropped by former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott, Trudeau’s other cabinet minister to resign in dismay over LavScam.

What Philpott had to say in her interview with Maclean’s magazine on March 21 proves she’d “gone rogue,” says Brown.

“I’m not accusing anybody of anything illegal or contrary to the Criminal Code,” emphasizes Brown. But Philpott raised enough questions to possibly prod the RCMP to launch an investigation, and that would mean a severe hit to Trudeau’s political fortunes.

On the phone with The Tyee March 21, Brown laid out his reasoning:

Philpott is “now basically saying in this interview with Maclean’s that Jody Wilson-Raybould was bullied, that there is much more to the story. And so she’s flatly contradicting [Trudeau’s] version of events.”

Philpott has given “new legs” to the demand by five previous attorneys general and the Tories for an RCMP investigation. In Maclean’s she makes it clear she could not remain in “solidarity with cabinet,” because she “felt that there was evidence of an attempt to politically interfere with the justice system in its work on the criminal trial that has been described by some as the most important and serious prosecution of corporate corruption in modern Canadian history.”

She also reveals that she raised deep concerns about the DPA file on SNC-Lavalin a full month before the affair became public.

She says this, Brown notes, as we find out the PMO’s claims about harm to the public interest if SNC-Lavalin were to be criminally prosecuted are baloney.

“What we need to know is, in this period, particularly after Jan. 14 when the shuffle took place, was cabinet misled by false threats or false information of the sort we’ve now learned about? That SNC was leaving Montreal, which [we know] now is patently untrue. Or that Canada was going to lose 9,000 jobs, which the present CEO now says was patently untrue. Was cabinet misled by that? Because if so, that would be a reason for the RCMP to investigate.”

The Mounties would be particularly interested in finding out, says Brown, “if false information was used to try to pressure Jody Wilson-Raybould to get her to politically intervene for something that anyone in government knew wasn’t true. Or if the government knew that it wasn’t true that jobs would be lost, that the company would move, as it was trying to suggest to her was the reason in the public interest, then the public interest argument goes out the window.

“That’s the only legal argument the government currently has. Even though by law they’re precluded in the Criminal Code from considering the national economic interest, they’re trying to couch it in this phrase, ‘the public interest,’ to say that because it was in the public interest, that’s why they could talk to her.

“But if the public interest argument is based on a lie, and they knew that, then all that you’re left with is a political motive, an electoral motive that would be self-serving. And that to me would raise questions of obstruction of justice, breach of trust, all sorts of things that the RCMP would suddenly be concerned with.

“I think that’s what’s really changed, the stakes have been elevated by both what the present CEO has said and what Philpott has said.”

Veteran of scandal management

Brown was chief of staff for premier Campbell on Dec. 28, 2003, the day RCMP officers arrived at the B.C. legislature and carted away boxes of evidence for what would become a years-long scandal involving the botched billion-dollar sell-off of the province’s public rail system.

Neither Campbell nor Brown was charged with any wrongdoing. But eight years later, Brown was the first witness called for the resulting trial, which ended with guilty pleas to fraud by two ministerial aides.

If Trudeau gets a knock on his door by the Mounties any time soon, he might want to give Brown a call for a bit of advice.

Then again, the PM likely won’t like what he hears. Brown, who writes a column for the Georgia Straight, declares in his latest that the Liberals’ best chance of winning the fall election is to “lance the boil” that is Trudeau.

As he told The Tyee in an email today, “The fear of losing Trudeau needs to be flipped on its head if left-leaning progressives want to minimize the chances of a Scheer victory this fall. The Liberals can now only hope to regain the moral high ground that is so vital for securing the values they purport to represent by replacing their leader. They can own the ethical hill they are now choosing to die upon by defending the indefensible by selecting a new leader who the heroines Wilson-Raybould and Philpott and Celina Caesar-Chavannes can all rally behind.”

Brown figures, “I am perhaps one of the first to suggest that Trudeau should be dumped by his caucus in their party’s political interest.”

As such, he joins a club that includes The Tyee’s Crawford Kilian who wrote a column published here March 5 headlined: “Trudeau’s Resignation Is the Party’s Only Hope.”

According to data collected by the Canadian Institute for Health Information, surgical wait times have increased significantly during MacLauchlan’s tenure. In 2015, 85 per cent ...","CHARLOTTETOWN, P.E.I. —

Liberal Leader Wade MacLauchlan began his second day of campaigning by focusing on the thorny issue of health care access in P.E.I.

At an announcement at the Murchison Centre in Charlottetown March 28, MacLauchlan pledged to increase health-care spending by $200 million over the next five years. The spending commitment included $50 million focused on recruitment, retention and training of staff and the establishment of a new primary health-care clinic in Queens County.

MacLauchlan also pledged to improve emergency room services at the Kings County Memorial Hospital.

""We will reopen the emergency services at Kings County Memorial Hospital on a 24-hour basis,"" said MacLauchlan. ""In addition, we will invest in the development of a long-term health services plan that is modern and responsive, through the Kings County Memorial Hospital, to patients needs in the region.""

The emergency room had its hours reduced by two hours in July due to a shortage of physicians.

MacLauchlan committed to improving walk-in clinics, increasing the number of family doctors in rural areas, doing away with ambulance fees, reducing wait times for surgical procedures such as hip and knee replacements, and providing financial support and subsidized Confederation Bridge passes for off-Island health appointments.

MacLauchlan said other health-care announcements focusing on mental health, addictions, seniors and West Prince issues would be forthcoming.

""Our Liberal health-care plan is comprehensive, it is realistic, it is costed and it will put patients first,"" MacLauchlan said.

Over the tenure of MacLauchlan, the complement of family physicians has largely remained unchanged. According to Health P.E.I., between 2015 and 2018, the number of family physicians working P.E.I. has remained at 120, although the number of specialists has increased from 100 to 109.

Currently, 12,904 Islanders lack access to a family doctor. The numbers are highest in Queens county at 8,584.

Incumbent Health Minister Robert Mitchell said the Liberal plan would result in an addition to the total complement of family physicians, but these would be concentrated in the new collaborative practice clinic in Queens County.

""The vision for that would be probably four family physicians, three or four (nurse practitioners) and then all resource staff that would be required for that,"" Mitchell said.

The new clinic would be a collaborative practice and would allow access to a variety of health professionals, Mitchell said.

According to data collected by the Canadian Institute for Health Information, surgical wait times have increased significantly during MacLauchlan’s tenure. In 2015, 85 per cent of patients needing hip replacement surgery, and 83 per cent of patients needing knee replacement surgery, received them within six months. By 2018, only 49 per cent of hip replacement surgeries and 26 per cent of knee replacement surgeries took place within six months.

In 2015, the Liberal platform included a pledge to reduce wait times for hip, knee and cataract surgery, as well as a promise to ensure provincial return-in-services agreements would ensure “adequate physician resources,” particularly in rural regions.

[Please note, this is a very long read.]

I am beginning to think that maybe Justin Trudeau’s best hope for burying his LavScam scandal might be to hire Donald Trump’s attorney general, William Barr, or perhaps his former nemesis and now BFF, Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

Barr’s summary of the Mueller report findings reads like The Donald’s wet dream.

No (new) indictments. No evidence of collusion to conspire or coordinate with the Russians for electoral advantage. And not enough evidence to warrant charges of obstruction of justice.

Obstruction of justice? Pfft. “Totally exonerated,” says Trump.

“While this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.”

Many Liberals would probably be quite happy with a similar ambivalent outcome from the ethics commissioner or—god forbid, from the RCMP—as their beloved leader heads into the fall campaign.

Enough of being haunted by “groundless” suspicions of collusion aimed at the obstruction of justice in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, they might now be thinking.

When the chips are down, who you gonna call? Ghost busters.

Mueller might be available, if a special prosecutor was ever required to step in for director of public prosecutions (DPP), Kathleen Roussel.

That might be a challenge if the RCMP ultimately declines to investigate the scandal. So far, the five former federal and provincial attorneys general and Conservative leader Andrew Scheer who have all called for a police probe are still in the dark, like all Canadians.

More to the point, Canada doesn’t have a clear legislated and/or policy process for appointing special prosecutors in such politically charged cases—unlike British Columbia and some other provinces, or for that matter, the Canadian military.

It is astounding, when you think about it, that the Department of Justice Act or the Criminal Code doesn’t already explicitly empower the DPP to unilaterally appoint a special prosecutor in any situation where the AG’s legal oversight is itself untenable.

Leaving the AG even notionally in charge of a prosecution involving the prime minister who appointed her or him to their job and to cabinet should be legally unthinkable and impermissible.

Ditto for a prosecution of anyone accountable to the PM, or of a person or corporation with obvious political connections to a political party. Especially those who have been large donors to party coffers, or one that illegally contributed over $100,000 to the governing party.

Conceptually, it's an inherent conflict of interest.

As such, I can’t imagine that Canada’s current AG, David Lametti, would ever see fit to even titularly oversee the charge assessment process or prosecution of any political figures in this case, if it should ever come to that.

And that is a big “if”, no doubt. But it is one we should all be thinking about now, if the stuff that has already hit the fan turns out to be as stinky and sticky as the odour emanating from the justice committee and from what’s leaking about all that’s gone on behind closed doors.

David Lametti (second from right) is in an awkward legal position, given what's been declared to date by Jody Wilson-Raybould (far left). MCPL MATHIEU GAUDREAULT, RIDEAU HALL

David Lametti's predicament

Someone should ask Lametti what steps he might take to prevent the appearance or reality of a conflict of interest in any such hypothetical scenario.

What process would apply for appointing a special prosecutor that would completely extricate him from his statutory oversight in such instances?

What process would further apply in appointing a special prosecutor to also remove Ms. Roussel from having further false aspersions cast on her conduct, decisions and/or judgement—especially by those acting on behalf of the prime minister?

Which is really at the root of this scandal. To say nothing of the implied lack of confidence by the prime minister and his crew in the former AG’s judgement, competence, and statutory decision-making.

It was that that gave rise to the pressure they allegedly exerted on her to commission an outside “expert” to “help” her overrule the DPP and to “help” her provide “cover” for taking and defending their desired actions, which ran counter to her own unwelcome professional assessment.

Maybe Anne McLellan should add that requirement for appointing a special prosecutor in such cases to her “to do” list.

She, who has been tasked as the prime minister’s handpicked special advisor, to submit “independent” recommendations for reforming the AG’s role.

She, who can no longer attend Liberal fundraisers to help her party fight the opposition parties that hope to convert this controversy into votes and seats for themselves.

Apart from being the right thing to do, it could be worth its weight in gold and goodwill for her party, as it struggles to regain public confidence in a leader who seems genetically incapable of understanding the concept of prosecutorial independence.

After all, it would be tough to imagine that Lametti would ever preside over the criminal prosecution of anyone in the Trudeau government on the LavScam file.

I mean, given that his predecessor (JWR) feels she was fired from that same office that Lametti now holds, allegedly, for not bowing to her boss’s desire to politically intervening in a criminal prosecution. In respect of the same subject that he maintains may yet qualify for a DPA, because no decision is ever final until a verdict is rendered.

Not that there’s any reason to believe that will ever come pass, as things stand.

Which is also not to confuse the potential for criminal charges with the likelihood (or unpublicized reality) of an RCMP investigation.

Obstruction of justice and breach of trust are notoriously hard to prove, as Trump has now happily discovered in the first instance. And as I expect Vice-Admiral Mark Norman will yet again confirm in the second instance.

It is ironic that even Trump allowed for the special prosecutor’s investigation to go forward that Trudeau is using the full weight of his office to prevent from ever materializing in getting to the bottom of his scandal.

To date, most of the focus in the LavScam controversy has centered on two provisions of the Criminal Code.

Section 139(2) makes it an offence to willfully attempt to “obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice in a judicial proceeding”.

Section 423.1(1) makes it an offence “to engage in any conduct with the intent to provoke fear” in a “justice system participant in order to impede him or her in the performance of his or her duties”.

Of course, both are relevant concerns that Canadians deserve to be assured are either pertinent or inapplicable in this affair.

The mainstream media and opposition parties might also want to focus more attention on s. 122 of the Criminal Code, which deals with “breach of trust by a public officer.”

In R. v. Boulanger the Supreme Court of Canada set out a five-point test for establishing that crime. The Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the following:

The accused is a public official; The accused was acting in connection with the duties of his or her office; The accused breached the standard of responsibility and conduct demanded of him or her by the nature of the office; The conduct of the accused represented a serious and marked departure from the standards expected of an individual in the accused’s position of public trust; and The accused acted with the intention to use his or her public office for a purpose other than the public good, for example, for a dishonest, partial, corrupt, or oppressive purpose.

The first four of those points would all seem to apply to at least some of the individuals and conduct that JWR identified and illuminated in her testimony to the Commons justice committee.

But it is the last point that is really key in this instance. For it speaks to whether anyone used their public office for “a purpose other than the public good, for example, for a dishonest, partial, or corrupt purpose”.

Now, I am just a layman, but my reading of that test suggests it might extend to anyone who deliberately misled an attorney general and/or cabinet about a supposed “public good” rationale for politically intervening in a criminal prosecution.

Say, for the “dishonest, partial, or corrupt purpose” of winning votes in Quebec and elsewhere.

Say, for an ulterior purpose of saving seats for the governing the party, including the one held by the prime minister, or maybe benefitting a company that has been a major donor to the Liberal party.

I’m not suggesting that’s the case here; but it begs to be examined and explicitly ruled out if all is as legally defensible as the prime minister would have us believe.

The truth, as it were, should set him and his government free from all suspicion and doubt, if he has nothing ontoward to hide.

My point is, it is not just the prospect of some illicit personal benefit or monetary gain that constitutes a breach of trust, which no one is now suggesting might be applicable in this instance.

But also, whether information was illegally shared and used in tandem with other inappropriate conduct for “dishonest, partial, or corrupt purposes” of partisan advantage, masked as having been pursued in the “public interest”.

Lest there be any doubt, I am not accusing anyone of any criminal wrongdoing in this LavScam controversy.

Not being a lawyer, or privy to any inside knowledge of the facts beyond those reported by the media, I am left with only my political antennae in trying to guess at where this affair is now legally heading.

Yet my political ""spidey sense"" tells me that the threads of truth that are gradually coming to light are all spinning out a web of intrigue that raise grave questions about the legality of the conduct at issue.

Questions that cry out for closer inspection by the RCMP.

Staff reporting to Bill Morneau and Justin Trudeau repeatedly tried to get Jody Wilson-Raybould to consider a deferred prosecution agreement for SNC-Lavalin.

Why is Trudeau obfuscating?

Despite JWR’s statement to the justice committee that the pressure she experienced was inappropriate, but probably not illegal, it is what she doesn’t know and what she was not aware of that begs to be scrutinized by someone beyond the ethics commissioner.

For as Jane Philpott rightly said, “My sense is that [the commissioner’s office] will not have the appropriate tools to be able to get at all of this.”

That is obvious, which is why Trudeau has tried so hard to suggest the opposite.

It is why he is so content to hide behind the ethics commissioner’s review, hoping that Mario Dion’s severely constrained legal mandate will preclude him from really addressing the most serious questions. Whenever he returns from his “prolonged” medical leave.

It is why Trudeau is so deathly afraid of extending the privilege waiver to release JWR from her sworn oath of cabinet confidence beyond January 14.

It is why he has refused to fully release her from solicitor-client privilege restrictions that he well knows still prevent her from speaking freely about what happened outside of the justice committee that has now terminated its investigation.

He knows that she risks being disbarred for violating that tenet, which she is now being urged to do by those who suggest she should cast caution to the wind and “let 'er rip” in Parliament.

It is why he won’t release Jane Philpott to say anything that would reveal what she knows that might now be protected by cabinet confidence.

And as we all know, she maintains “There’s much more to the story that should be told.”

As she said, “I believe the former attorney general has further points to make. I believe that I have further issues of concern that I’m not free to share.”

It is why seasoned Liberal lackeys like MP Judy Sgro are now attacking JWR and Philpott, challenging them to “put up or shut up”, when their own leader is doing his level best from allowing that to happen.

What Sgro, her cowardly caucus colleagues, and the Liberal social media trolls all really mean by that appalling slapdown of two brave women who had the courage of their convictions to speak truth to power is to just “shut up"".

Because they know that neither of the courageous women they accuse of not being team players are not keen on simply ignoring their sworn oaths and saying their piece under the questionable protection of parliamentary privilege.

That is, to the extent that they might even be afforded a few minutes to make a statement in the House, which really needs to be fully aired and questioned through many more hours of committee testimony.

To make their case in Parliament, they would have to obtain the Liberals’ consent to be heard, which is ridiculous, given how they are the only reason why JWR and Philpott have been largely silenced.

If they really mean what they say, those Liberals should add their voices to those calling on the prime minister to remove any need for parliamentary privlege to trump cabinet privilege or solicitor-client privilege.

They should be calling on him to simply release JWR and Philpott to share their full story, instead of supporting his efforts to clam them up and prevent the truth from outing.

It is now patently clear that the prime minister is panic-stricken by the prospect of allowing his two former senior ministers to say anything about what really transpired from the date of the cabinet shuffle through their respective resignations from cabinet.

He surely must know that something very damaging to him and his government hangs in the balance of their forced silence.

The muzzle that he has put on JWR and Philpott is intended only to prevent him from experiencing the harsh truth—that their bark is itself their bite.

He is terrified of inviting any new testimony from the officials that JWR has identified as key players in this controversy, or from others who may have done things that might provoke an RCMP investigation.

He is petrified at the prospect of anyone being called to testify under oath, at penalty of perjury for lying, to prove his laughable contention that he did nothing wrong.

And yet, the hits just keep on coming.

With every new front-page scoop in the Globe and Mail. With JWR’s next round of written evidence soon to be submitted to the justice committee.

And despite his Liberal lapdogs’ incorrigible attempts to silence JWR and betray that forum’s mandate by shutting down its investigation.

RCMP hasn't revealed anything yet

All of which isn’t just dumb politics on the PM’s part that is backfiring, big time, on him and his party. It further reinforces the need for an RCMP inquiry.

Indeed, I’d wager that an RCMP investigation may already be underway, if only because of its deafening silencing in either confirming or denying whether one has been initiated.

Sure, that’s the standard line they usually give when they don’t want to compromise an active or prospective investigation.

It is one thing to refuse to “confirm” that an investigation is taking place, if it is, and you don’t want to alert its subjects of that fact. Which seems unlikely in this instance, given what it would entail and who the RCMP would be obliged to talk to.

It is quite another thing to refuse to “deny” that an investigation has been launched if it has not been, regardless of what might happen in the future. Especially when it is the government itself and the prime minister’s political neck that is on the line.

When such denials are not forthcoming, inquiring minds race, and rightly so.

Because where there’s smoke, there is usually fire, whether or not it rises to a level hot enough for anyone to get burned with actual criminal charges being laid.

I submit, there is already more than enough on the table to warrant a formal investigation by the RCMP. Especially in the absence of any parliamentary process to help clear the air that is now choking us all in clouds of suspicion, doubt, and poisonous particles of toxic truth.

Here is just some of what we know.

We know that one or more individuals in the prime minister’s office were aware of highly sensitive and privileged information about the status of the SNC-Lavalin prosecution that they should not have been in any position to have.

Information that ostensibly did not come from Public Prosecutions Services and that conflicting accounts suggest may or may not have come from SNC-Lavalin. Information that might have been illegally shared.

I would think that that question and how (or if) SNC-Lavalin might have also been privy to such privileged information is a mystery that cries out for a closer look by the RCMP. Now more than ever, in view of the Globe and Mail's latest story.

We also know that numerous direct overtures were made by SNC-Lavalin officials and/or designates to the former head of the Privy Council and others, through activities that were not listed by the company in its monthly lobbyist activity reports.

What was said, implied, requested, or not in those unregistered communications is unknown.

Nor is it clear if any of those conversations, meetings, and/or written contacts may be construed as constituting lobbying activities as defined under the act.

SNC-Lavalin assures us that all of its communications were in total compliance with the law. I have previously speculated why I believe that is probably the case.

However, we also know that the company’s president and CEO, Neil Bruce, has publicly stated that at no time did he or his agents threaten to move SNC-Lavalin’s head office. Nor did he ever suggest that 9,000 were at risk, or did he or his company ever argue for a deferred prosecution agreement based on national economic interest arguments that would be against the law.

In fact, he said he never asked for a DPA on any of those bases, noting that “Yes, the 9,000 people will get a job. I have no doubt whatsoever about that … But they’ll be working probably for a U.S. company.”

All of which stands in direct contrast to the rationale cited by the prime minister and his senior staffers in pressuring JWR to overrule the director of public prosecutions to help SNC-Lavalin avoid a criminal trial for fraud and corruption.

Note as well that the company’s recent statement to clarify Bruce’s earlier statements really do little to change that fact. It said this:

“Mr. Bruce indeed stated the Government of Canada was never threatened by SNC-Lavalin, however, the company had made it very clear to the Government through its advocacy campaign that the implementation of a remediation agreement (RA)—also known as a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA)—was the best way to protect and grow the almost 9,000 direct Canadian SNC-Lavalin jobs, as well as thousands of indirect jobs through its more than 5,000 suppliers across Canada. The company still asserts this position.” [Emphasis added.]

None of which changes Bruce’s fundamental assertion: that SNC never threatened to move its HQ from Montreal, that it never threatened that jobs would be lost, and that it never suggested that such economic interest imperatives should make it eligible for a DPA.

[March 28 update: It is an assertion that would now seem to be directly contradicted by today’s Canadian Press story about a PowerPoint presentation made by SNC-Lavalin to federal prosecutors last fall.

The company apparently said that it was considering its options if it did not get a DPA. One of those options was “Plan B”.

As CTV reported, “Under that plan, SNC would move its Montreal headquarters and corporate offices in Ontario and Quebec to the U.S. within a year, cutting its workforce to just 3,500 from 8,717, before eventually winding up its Canadian operations.”

In short, it is tough to know who or what to believe about what was really said, in the absence of some sort of formal investigation, since the “jobs threat” story seems to be “fluid” and changing by the day.]

Political considerations and legal concerns

We also know that those false threats of economic sanctions were advanced, either deliberately or unwittingly, by people within the Trudeau administration.

To convince JWR to politically intervene in a way that she and her chief of staff repeatedly expressed would be clearly inappropriate and that had never been done before in a criminal prosecution.

To pressure her to make “her own decision”, using what she perceived to be “veiled threats”—including that she might be fired as AG if she refused to act against her expressed will and contrary to her repeatedly asserted position.

All in an effort to reframe the “national economic interest” considerations, which are expressly outlawed in the Criminal Code in determining whether to grant a DPA, as instead of “public interest” arguments that might be used to effectively nullify that prohibition.

We know that several senior officials in the PMO, the PCO and the finance minister’s office repeatedly tried to convince JWR and her chief of staff to get an outside legal opinion that would give the attorney general reason to politically intervene in a way in which she was unwilling to do.

We know that multiple officials from the prime minister, on down, repeatedly cited ulterior electoral considerations that pointed to political motives.

And that those considerations were communicated to JWR and to her chief of staff in pressuring her to “get it right” by politically intervening on behalf of SNC-Lavalin to overrule the DPP’s decision and spare it from a criminal trial and prospect of being barred from bidding on government contracts for up to 10 years. A benefit that could potentially be worth billions of dollars in new business for the company.

Those suggested political considerations had nothing to do with the public interest and everything to do with partisan interests that were of concern to the prime minister if the company didn’t get the special deal it was after.

Political interests that were heightened by conversations with the premier of Quebec and which JWR says she directly warned the prime minister were plainly inappropriate to raise with her or her staff. Legal advice he ignored.

His “people” persisted in advancing false economic arguments, which we know Quebec’s justice minister also says she also refused to entertain and advance on SNC-Lavalin’s behalf in pressuring her federal counterpart for a DPA.

And finally, we also know that the Federal Court has rejected SNC-Lavalin’s application for judicial review of the DPP’s decision not to negotiate a DPA.

Justice Catherine Kane stressed that the DPP had duly considered the “extensive information” and “had conducted a detailed review of the documents submitted” by SNC-Lavalin “regarding how they met the relevant criteria” in making her decision.

Yet, despite that fact, which JWR had reviewed and properly supported, the Liberals repeatedly tried to undermine her decision.

They ostensibly did so on the basis of their ill-informed judment that she had not given due regard to the economic threats that have now been exposed as groundless, and equally, to the partisan political imperatives that she rightly refused to entertain.

JWR feels she was harangued, threatened, and ultimately fired from her post for being seen as either too politically obstructionist for the prime minister’s liking, or too resistant to accommodate his desire to do things that no one in her former position should be asked to do.

The worst of it is, that is not even the half of what we already know.

And it is only a fraction of the hard truth that screams to be fully heard and thoroughly investigated by the RCMP.

So many other factors reinforce that need.

They include how the prime minister’s people are now all lawyered up.

They include how the prime minister’s former principal secretary was so rapidly given access to records that he relied upon for his testimony to the justice committee. Which stands in stark contrast to the interminable process that Vice-Admiral Mark Norman has gone through in trying to get access to his own records in defending himself in court. Why the difference?

They include the extraordinary efforts that the prime minister has taken to prevent JWR and Philpott from sharing their evidence.

That includes the unconscionable actions just taken by the Liberal members of the Commons ethics committee, who used their majority to block the opposition’s efforts efforts to have that forum complete the work that their Liberal colleagues on the justice committee brazenly voted to short-circuit.

They include the disturbing attacks on JWR’s character that Liberals have advanced in trying to justify the PM’s decision to dump her as AG.

One of those spurious assaults relates to JWR’s supposed attempts to isolate the PMO from information about potential Supreme Court nominees. Specifically, her alleged recommendation to appoint Chief Justice Glenn Joyal of the Manitoba Court of Queen’s Bench as the SCC’s chief justice.

As a conservative appointee of Stephen Harper who had challenged certain aspects of judicial interpretations of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, those Liberals who tried to raise his appointment in trying to undermine JWR only added new fuel to their party’s own fire.

In trying to besmirch her character and her commitment to the charter, they apparently also leaked confidential cabinet information and tried to sully a sitting judge in the process.

It obliged Justice Joyal to issue an extraordinary statement.

“I fear that someone is using my previous candidacy to the Supreme Court of Canada to further an agenda unrelated to the appointment process. This is wrong,” he said.

No kidding, that’s wrong, like the other examples I have summarized above. All of it stinks to high Heaven.

With JWR’s evidence expected later this week, that smoke that the prime minister’s team has tried so hard and so unsuccessfully to douse will only grow bigger and blacker.

The longer Liberals ignore it and try to pretend that all is well, when they should know their collective goose is already being savagely cooked, just makes them look foolish.

Odds are, no one will ever be charged with a crime in this scandal, given how hard the government is trying to suppress the truth and how hard it is to prove criminal intent.

Nevertheless, the prime minister’s personal handling of this fiasco is a politically criminal abdication of leadership and an abuse of Canada’s highest elected office.

And whether this scandal ever results in criminal charges, which now seem unlikely, I predict the RCMP will inevitably feel compelled to investigate this firestorm. If it isn’t doing so already.

Because no privilege—not parliamentary privilege, not cabinet privilege, and not solicitor-client privilege—should ever protect a party that is trying to hide behind those shields to frustrate the evidence that goes to the heart of the rule of law.

Valid questions and concerns demand to be explored and answered.

Ones that are not simply political in nature, but that are also of legal and potentially criminal consequence.

The best way to truly clear the air in this case is to insist on an RCMP investigation that has the full force of the law behind it.

Preferably, under the auspices of a special prosecutor.

Because if even if Trudeau somehow reverses course and decides to let JWR and Philpott speak, that will not and should not be the end of it.

All of the actors and evidence in this controversy need to be exposed and duly questioned.

As I believe they will be, by those whose only interest is to serve and protect us and our democratic institutions—the RCMP.

Liberal Premier Wade MacLauchlan took no shots at his political opponents during a speech at a boisterous campaign rally Friday night, focusing instead on the theme of what he described as the “family affair” of his Liberal team.

The rally, a nomination meeting for MacLauchlan in his home riding of District 8 Stanhope-Marshfield, had more of a feel of a campaign launch than the Liberal meeting Tuesday night, where MacLauchlan announced the beginning of P.E.I.’s election season.

At the Tuesday night meeting, a nomination for longtime Liberal MLA Richard Brown, MacLauchlan called the Progressive Conservative party of Dennis King a “party that practices division.” He also said the Green party was “untested” and referred to leader Peter Bevan-Baker as a “career politician”.

By contrast, Friday night MacLauchlan spoke about his feelings of pride for the record of his government and struck a hopeful tone.

""This is all a family affair, effectively, what we're doing here tonight, from the front to the back of the room,"" MacLauchlan said.

""People have worked together with their hearts and their commitment and with their hard work and vision for a bright future for Prince Edward Island. And that's what we stand for, folks.""

In the gymnasium of L.M. Montgomery Elementary School, MacLauchlan spoke for close to a half hour in front of a crowd of about 260 Liberal supporters.

Prior to MacLauchlan’s speech, each of MacLauchlan’s 26 candidate was called to the stage one by one. Supporters, who chanted “four more years,” bore red T-shirts with the name of their local candidate on their back.

Bobbi-Lynn Gaudet, an educational assistant and mother of four, seconds the nomination of Wade MacLauchlan on Friday night. MacLauchlan was officially nominated as the candidate for Stanhope-Marshfield.

Bobbi-Lynn Gaudet seconded the nomination of MacLauchlan as the Stanhope-Marshfield candidate. She said she was introduced to MacLauchlan by Roxanne Carter-Thompson. Carter-Thompson is the executive director of the Adventure Group, a local non-profit organization that offers supportive programming for marginalized youth and adults. She is also the Liberal candidate for Charlottetown-Belvedere

""Thanks to Wade and this Liberal team, the Adventure Group is now receiving the most financial support for these programs that they ever have,"" Gaudet said.

""This means the world to me as I am a former graduate of the program.""

The audience was also shown a new campaign TV spot on a projection screen. The ad features MacLauchlan describing attending a small schoolhouse in Stanhope as a child.

""There were five students in our Grade 1 class. In typical P.E.I. fashion, three of us were first cousins,"" MacLauchlan says in a voice-over.

""We learned a lot from our teachers, from our families and community and from each other. Most of all, we learned that getting ahead was possible, that if we all worked together, we not only could do well, but should do well.""

The spot outlined what have been the twin themes of the Liberal campaign so far – the MacLauchlan government’s record on economic management and his pledge for better social programs for the poor and middle class.

MacLauchlan has trailed Green Leader Peter Bevan-Baker in recent opinion polls. Bevan-Baker has been ranked as Islanders’ preferred choice for premier in opinion polling for more than two years.

With MacLauchlan’s nomination, all Liberal candidates have been officially been nominated.

Posted on March 27, 2019 by Sunny South News

Government budgets often offer some benefits for voters, but when the budget precedes an election, there’s a lot in common with Christmas — there are plenty of gifts, and you try not to think about having to pay for them later.

So it is with the Liberal government’s federal budget tabled last week that will dole out billions of dollars in new spending on all sorts of goodies for Canadians — many of them aimed at helping middle-class voters save money.

The Liberals were aided by the fact that a stronger economy has produced higher-than expected revenue — a projected extra $27.8 billion over the next six years.

Based on Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s plan, the Liberals will spend $22.8 billion of that additional money.

The budget includes: $1.7 billion over five years, and $586 million a year after that, for a Canada Training Benefit to help workers upgrade their skills and learn new ones while staying in their current jobs; $1.18 billion over five years to tighten border security, including hiring more judges to handle judicial reviews of asylum applications; $3.9 billion for farmers (the majority of them in the vote-rich provinces of Ontario and Quebec) in supply-managed industries affected by new trade agreements with the U.S. and Asian countries; $2.2 billion for municipalities’ and First Nations’ infrastructure projects; $950 million for municipal governments to make their buildings more energy-efficient and to provide subsidy programs to help homeowners do the same; $300 million over three years for rebates of up to $5,000 on electric or hydrogen-fuel-cell vehicles.

The budget also calls for putting money toward lowering the interest rate on Canada Student Loans to the prime rate, and to create a new Canadian Drug Agency to centralize evaluations of new drugs and to buy in bulk nationwide, instead of province-by-province.

The provisions include measures to make housing more affordable, particularly for first-time buyers, by increasing the amount they can borrow from RRSPs and by having the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. contribute a small share of equity for down payments.

The budget also provides new rules that will let working seniors keep more of the money they earn before triggering a claw-back in the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS).

The Canada Training Benefit will provide a tax credit of up to $250 per year to help with covering up to half the cost of job training, such as fees for a college course or other professional training programs. Such training is increasingly becoming crucial to help workers keep their skills up to date in a fast-changing workplace.

Similarly, helping working seniors keep more of their earnings in their pockets will be useful in a world where more seniors are having to remain on the job in order to make ends meet.

Of course, all these goodies have to be paid for, and the money for that ultimately comes from taxpayers’ pockets.

The Canadian Press points out the new budget will result in a 2019-20 federal deficit projection of $19.8 billion, including a $3-billion “risk adjustment,” an increase of $200 million from last year’s forecast. The Liberals’ plan includes a gradual reduction in the deficit, but that will happen more slowly than the government anticipated last year.

Morneau’s 460-page budget is titled “Investing in the Middle Class,” but it could perhaps be more appropriately called “Investing in Middle-Class Voters.”

Rather than using the unexpected windfall to reduce the debt or balance the budget, the Liberals have opted to spend the money like a carefree Vegas vacationer who just got lucky at the slot machines.

We’ve all seen the video of the Viking Sky cruise-ship disaster.

The water rushing in. The chaotic scenes from the bow as the ship is tossed to-and-fro. The helpless tub, dead in its tracks, threatening to crash on the rocks.

Ah, yes. The Leaky Ship Liberal.

Perilously listing. Its passengers screaming for help. A showpiece of negligence and neglect, going nowhere fast.

With Captain Trudeau asleep at the wheel and his first mate Lametti lounging as it leaks. Both are completely confounded by the sudden turn of events that has set their once proud and seemingly invincible ship-of-state reeling.

Holy crap. Now we learn that the former chair of the Liberal Agency of Canada audit committee is bolstering calls for a public inquiry into the LavScam debacle.

Do they even know how ridiculous they look, trying to maintain a stiff upper lip while doing diddly squat to respond to their government’s latest self-inflicted catastrophe?

Do they have the faintest clue how inept, insensitive, and foolhardy they appear in posing as mere bystanders in the accident-in-the-making in the name of the partisan flag now in tatters?

I am referring of course to the appalling attempt by some unknown miscreant to discredit former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould by leaking confidential information aimed at painting Chief Justice Glenn Joyal of the Manitoba Court of Queen’s Bench as an avowed enemy of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

If you are not yet quite up to speed on that fiasco—perhaps, because you’ve been too busy throwing up from the other endless sickening swells in the LavScam disaster—you can learn all about it here, here and here.

The attacks on Justice Joyal were vicious, malicious, and possibly criminal in their motivation, in their abuse of power and position, and in their potentially defamatory content and design.

They were enough to prompt him to respond with remarkable self-restraint, “I fear that someone is using my previous candidacy to the Supreme Court of Canada to further an agenda unrelated to the appointment process. This is wrong.”

They were enough to prompt Conservative MP Lisa Raitt to write to Marc Giroux, Commissioner for Federal Judicial Affairs, urging him to investigate the matter.

He responded by stressing that “The release of any such confidential information is wholly inappropriate,” but that “in light of [his] particular role and [its] enabling statute, he is “not in a position to accede to [Raitt’s] request to investigate”.

The deputy leader of the Conservatives, Lisa Raitt, wants an investigation into the leak concerning the chief justice of the Manitoba Court of Appeal.

And what of the intended target of the Liberals’ scurrilous leaks intended to present her as a de facto anti-Liberal, whose own first choice as chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada was supposedly someone who stood to undermine Trudeau’s father’s proudest legacy?

Puglaas has proved yet again that she is a woman of dignity, sound bearing, and righteous resolve who is not to be trifled with or so easily disparaged by those on her Liberal “team” (“more united than ever!”) who are so intent on doing her harm.

She forcefully responded with a call to investigate the breach of confidence, to find the leaker, and to hold him or her or them duly accountable. We should expect no less of her, as someone who could give current attorney general David Lametti lessons in what the office she held really demands in its leader.

“I do feel compelled to say that I have not—as some have suggested—been the source of any of these stories, nor have I ever authorized any person to speak on my behalf,” she said.

“I strongly condemn anyone who would speak about or provide information on such sensitive matters. Any commentary/reporting in this regard with respect to a SCC [Supreme Court of Canada] appointment(s) could compromise the integrity of the appointments process, our institutions and potentially sitting justices.”

And JWR and Raitt were far from the only persons sending out an SOS.

Others called out the nefarious leakers and urged the prime minister and Lametti to act.

The Canadian Bar Association offered this condemnation:

“There is a process to get informed input about the merits of the applicants. It rightly goes on behind closed doors. Keeping the deliberations confidential respects the privacy of applicants and guards against interference,” said CBA president Ray Adlington.

“Breaching confidentiality by releasing the names and commenting on the suitability of the other applicants after the appointment demeans the selection process and ultimately all those who hold the office of judge.”

The Law Society of Manitoba issued this statement:

“The Law Society of Manitoba is very concerned when circumstances arise that will weaken the public’s confidence in the administration of justice. A highly confidential process has been established to encourage the best and brightest candidates to put their names forward for appointment to all levels of courts.

“The integrity of that process is called into question when the confidentiality of deliberations and discussions about candidates appears not to have been maintained.

“Confidentiality is critical to protecting the reputation of all applicants including sitting judges, who are not able to respond to unjust criticism. The aspersions cast in recent media reports on Chief Justice Glenn Joyal of the Manitoba Court of Queen’s Bench represent an unwarranted attack on a distinguished judicial career.”

Oh, yes. Trudeau’s leakers also had no compunctions about compromising CTV’s journalistic best interests in choosing that esteemed forum as the most suitable outlet for their spurious counter-rationale for JWR’s supposed longstanding friction with the prime minister.

A false twist on the true treachery, as it were, that was supposed create new cover for Trudeau’s firing of the main person who could be trusted to protect the rule of law and the independence of her office as Canada’s first Indigenous attorney general.

David Lametti was sworn in as attorney general and justice minister at Rideau Hall as Justin Trudeau looked on. Adam Scotti/Prime Minister's Office

Yet despite that crescendo of outrage crying out for action, echoed by so many pundits, columnists, and others, what have we heard in response from Trudeau and Lametti?

After three days, no less?

Absolutely nothing of hard consequence.

Neither Trudeau nor Lametti apparently have any intention of investigating that wanton breach of public trust.

They have so far failed to take any action to investigate that egregious violation of personal privacy and that calculated smear on a sitting justice and on JWR, which is at its core yet another deliberate affront to justice.

Lametti’s Twitter response was pathetic.

It was as weak as Trudeau’s mealy-mouthed prattle that could be interpreted as he damn well knows or suspects that the leaks came from within his own office. And it seems he won’t be doing anything to try to identify and potentially prosecute the person(s) responsible.

Video of Raitt demands investigation into SCC appointment leaks Watch Lisa Raitt tell CTV why she thinks there needs to be an investigation.

This, from the guy who only last month waxed on about his father’s deep commitment to justice.

Who bleated that “those principles of justice are fundamental to me in what we are as a country, what we want to be as a society. And I have spent my entire political career fighting for justice and for people … the SNC-Lavalin file was not an exception.”

Some fight. He has done more in his single term in office to erode Canadians’ confidence in justice and the rule of law than any other prime minister in living memory.

Meanwhile, the whole Liberal crew hides behind the ludicrous tweets of Sheila Copps, who seems to be quite comfortable debasing herself with no end of attacks aimed at discrediting JWR and former treasury board president Jane Philpott and driving them both out of caucus.

The party that once held itself above all others as a moral force of international repute is now a rudderless vessle awash in its own bilge water.

It doesn’t look, act, or smell anything like its former “renewed” post-Adscam, self. And that won’t change as long as the guy with the real dirt on his hands is at the helm.

His arrogance knows no bounds, as he demonstrated yet again at the Liberal fundraiser in which he laughed off protesters from the Grassy Narrows First Nation who were concerned about mercury contamination in their communities with the sarcastic dismissal: “Thank you very much for your donation tonight. I really appreciate the donation to the Liberal Party of Canada.”

This is what it’s come to, really? Making jokes aimed at disparaging Indigenous peoples whose health is being threatened by mercury poisoning and tainted water supplies that successive governments have done nothing about?

Yeah, that’ll go a long way to advancing the goal of reconciliation.

Despite his belated apology after getting pounded by all who watched the clip, that type of “leadership” goes a long to explaining why Trudeau’s approval rating is now lower than Donald Trump’s, according to one new poll.

I say again, it ought to be Trudeau who walks the plank if his battered ship is to have any chance of winning back the public confidence needed to convince Canadians it’s safe to ride for another term in government.

And if the contrast between Puglaas and Lametti previously flattered the former, the latter is now also looking like he might be unworthy of the independent office that he was invited to uphold.

Get off your sorry butt and at least pretend that you are not so afraid to offend your sinking captain by getting to the bottom of this matter that was so wrongly initiated under his watch and in his perceived partisan interests.

Like the greater LavScam scandal that gave rise to this new wrongdoing, this fiasco threatens to corrode and degrade all it touches in its filthy wake.

Anyone involved in it deserves to be royally keelhauled.","Martyn Brown: Lametti lounges on the Leaky Ship Liberal, as Puglaas issues an SOS",The Georgia Straight,https://www.straight.com/news/1220131/martyn-brown-lametti-lounges-leaky-ship-liberal-puglaas-issues-sos

After 40 years of farming, 20 of those years on the farmer elected advisory committee to the Canadian Wheat Board (CWB) and one term (the first term) on the Board of Directors who were to control the CWB, I thought I had heard and saw it all.

article continues below

I was at the table when embargoes were placed on Canadian grain for one reason or other, I saw the federal Government implement Ad Hoc piecemeal programs to help take the sting away when agriculture was financially hurt for so many different reasons. The worst of all that changed the prairie landscape was when USA started a trade war against the European Economic Community and Canada was seriously got in the cross fire on Wheat prices. That trade war appeared to last forever and almost bankrupt 1/3 of Western Canadian primary agriculture. I was at the table where I saw the rise and the disasterous fall of Farmer Owned Canadian Grain companies, the likes of UGG, MPE, AWP, and of course SWP which sometimes I still can’t believe it happened. Many today who exited their farms during that period are still being dogged by debts and judgements that carried forward with their names. I was also at the CWB table through those dark days when just about everyone turned on the CWB as the cause of there personal problems. I sometimes wish I could have kept footage of public meetings when individuals heaped UN-imaginable criticism on myself and others for the financial demise of their farms, personal bankruptcies, family breakdowns and even divorces and suicides where all pointed at, that the CWB was the reason why. People don’t care who or why a situation occurs all they want to do is blame someone for there own personal problems. And the Right -Wing Zealots of Western Canada led the way in the all out character attacks until they won the day with the Previous Harper Conservative Government to, sabotage and destroy the CWB, kill any essence of orderly marketing and single desk selling in Canada, take away from western Farmers the business contacts, the infrastructure, the contingency fund (which was in the millions and all Western Canadian Farmers Money) sell most of the assets for pennies on the dollar to a multi-national and place all the funds (I hope) to the general receipts of the Government of Canada.

So what has all this to do with the current situation of China refusing to buy Canadian Canola? Which is known as Canada’s Cinderella crop. Pretty much everything, let me explain. Firstly with China normally purchasing about 40 percent of Canada’s Canola, which amounts to billions of dollars of trade, it is no wonder the price is dropping faster then the Titanic sunk, and we may have not seen the bottom yet.

Does anyone wonder why Richardson Pioneer has been singled out in this new trade war?

Well in case you don’t know your facts, Richardson is one of the last of solely a Canadian Grain Company and as well a big player on the crushing side of Canola and canola meal. So this attack is on Canada, Canola is a Canadian oilseed developed from Rapeseed which was used for industrial oil, but Canadian plant scientist and pathologists worked endlessly to create one of the Worlds best, most popular and healthiests oils and rightfully so named it Canola as in Canadian Oil. The other multi-national companies who buy and sell canola in Canada can move this product to another Country of Origin and continue selling to China under a different disguise. This was done in the past when Canadian cereals where embargoed by certain Countries, The prices dropped in Canada to ridiculous amounts, but yet through multinationals that operated in our and other countries their exports to the country of question would go surprisingly up through one of their other country operations. However Western Canadian products may still be bought but at a much much lower price. Yes Cinderella may have just lost both her glass shoes in Canada.

So if this is a attack on our Canadian Government then we need a all out effort by the Trudeau Governemnt at this time to bring a sensible solution to a unrealistic situation. Please remember China does like and want our Canola Meal, and Canola both raw and manufactured But I would bet anything that talks have been and are going on now between Chinese importers and Canadian Multinationals as to how that product can be redirected through other countries of choice. Remember there is no maple leaf in shipments of Canola so games will be played.

So think about it how can western Canadian Farmers get strong action from the Trudeau Liberals?

I guess our Provincial Premiers could and should get the ball rolling, Oh that’s right most of them are fighting, and in Saskatchewan’s case in courts with the Federal Government over the introduction of a carbon tax. Oh well back in the day this would somehow be turned into a “its the CWB’s fault that this has happened”. So who can we blame now??

It was met with an unseemly display by the Opposition in which they repeatedly chanted, jeered, and carried on with such vigour that no one could hear the minister speak. The Speaker of the House shut down all of the microphones but it didn't help.

article continues below

I say ""unseemly"" but perhaps ""childish"" would be a better term. Yes, getting to the bottom of the Jody Wilson-Raybould affair is important but by protesting in the house during the reading of the budget speech, the Opposition did neither themselves nor the public a favour.

If I was leading the Opposition right now, I would stop talking about the whole affair and let it play out on its own. The Liberals seem to be doing a good job of shooting themselves in the foot all by themselves. They don't really need a hand at this point.

Instead, I would use the time devoted to the budget to focus on the budget. It has an interesting take on our finances going forward but perhaps more importantly, it is not the balanced budget we were promised during the last campaign and in the first budget after the election. Essentially, the government is once again putting off the payments for another year.

Why is that? And what would the Conservatives, for example, do differently?

After all, the last two times the Conservatives were in power, they ran up the national debt to record levels and in unprecedented fashion. For a party which claims to be fiscally conservative, it is hard to understand how they can be so irresponsible with our money.

Perhaps this is why Minister Morneau's speech was turned into a tantrum about a completely different issue. It allowed the members of the opposition to avoid providing an alternative vision for our finances. After all, if you can't beat them with logical sound arguments, maybe a smoke screen is the next best approach.

However, as the Conservatives have yet to provide us with a vision of how they would handle the economy, we are left to speculate based on their previous performance. And in this case the Liberals win, hands down.

The central theme of the budget was ""Investing in the Middle Class."" The Liberals argue they have been doing this since day one and it has resulted in well-paying jobs, a stronger and more connected country, and opportunities for our youth and Indigenous people.

They claim the creation of 900,000 jobs over the past four years - most of which are full time and 54 per cent going to women in the last year alone. Their stewardship has led to the lowest unemployment rate in 40 years.

Our economy hasn't led the world in growth, but that is to be expected as some countries are so far behind and racing to catch up. But within the OECD, we are doing very well and amongst the G7, we are second to the U.S.

If, as pundits often say, ""It's the economy, stupid,"" then the Liberals have done their job. They have strengthened the middle-class. They have provided a stronger economy. They have lowered unemployment or increased employment rates. They have engaged in diversification. They have done much for the average Canadian and haven't really disadvantaged the rich.

To my mind, this is one of the hallmarks defining the different approaches taken by the Liberals and the Conservatives. Under the previous Conservative governments, the approach taken was to give big tax cuts to the wealthy so they will spend their money in a way that it trickles down to the middle class. Give the rich more and everyone else will benefit.

Except it doesn't actually work. Instead, we have a ridiculous situation where the average CEO earns as much money in their first day of work in any given year as their average employee makes in 365 days. How is this allowed to happen? The Conservative argument is wealthy people will give to and provide for those less fortunate. But is this really the case?

The Liberals take a much more direct approach. Instead of providing for the top few earners and hoping the largess will wind its way downward, they are targeting the middle class directly. It is the Henry Ford approach - if you want people to buy your cars, you need to pay your workers well so they can afford them.

The budget does run a deficit, although the $22.8 billion being bandied about is over the next five years. But the deficits are a consequence of previous policy which shed responsibility by providing tax cuts to the top earners thereby limiting revenue. Federal revenue growth is falling behind real growth.

By Nia Williams

CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - The main opposition party in Alberta's April election is using Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as a proxy foe, analysts say, channeling a long-standing sense of western alienation rather than directly attacking a popular premier.

Polls suggest the United Conservative Party is on course to win power in the province, Canada's energy center, capitalizing on voter concerns about a struggling economy and lack of progress on new oil export pipelines.

However, UCP leader Jason Kenney, a former federal cabinet minister, polls behind New Democrat Party Premier Rachel Notley on a number of personal attributes such as honesty, likeability and trustworthiness, and is embroiled in a scandal over his successful party leadership bid in 2017.

Notley, whose late father led the NDP from 1968-1984, is polling well ahead of her party and seeking to profit from that edge.

To overcome that, the UCP is focusing on Trudeau, with repeated references to ""the Notley-Trudeau alliance,"" emphasizing her one-time close relationship with the prime minister, while images of their own leader are less visible.

Trudeau is an unpopular figure in Alberta, where many feel he failed to support the energy industry. The prime minister also faces a political scandal on whether he unduly pressured Canada's former justice minister.

""If you look at the signs the NDP are putting up, their logos are not very prevalent, it's all Rachel Notley,"" said Gregory Jack, vice president at polling firm Ipsos. ""The UCP signs are all about the UCP and their brand, and underplaying their leader to a certain extent.""

The UCP's focus on Justin Trudeau may be effective with older Alberta voters who remember the unpopular National Energy Program in 1980, an effort by his prime minister father, Pierre Trudeau, that sought to give Ottawa more control over the oil and gas industry and a higher share of revenues.

""(The UCP) spin on it is Alberta has been mistreated by a Liberal government and the son of another prime minister who did not treat Alberta well,"" said Jared Wesley, a political science professor at the University of Alberta.

Alberta's energy industry contributes C$80 billion a year to Canada's economy, but opposition from other provinces has shut down new pipelines like TransCanada Corp's Energy East project and helped stall the Trans Mountain expansion plan.

Congestion on existing pipelines out of landlocked Alberta left crude bottlenecked in storage tanks and sent prices spiraling to record lows last year, prompting the NDP to mandate temporary crude production cuts.

Alberta has posted budget deficits since global oil prices started tumbling in 2014, and more than C$20 billion in foreign capital has fled its energy sector since 2017.

Notley and Trudeau came to power in the same year and initially forged a close partnership aimed at pleasing the oil industry and environmental groups with a dual strategy that supported new pipelines and introduced a carbon tax.

They fell out last year over delays to the Trans Mountain expansion project. Notley's camp downplays the relationship that the UCP is working so hard to highlight.

""The job of premier is to work with anyone who has a stake in projects like pipelines. I wouldn't call it an alliance,"" said NDP campaign spokeswoman Cheryl Oates. ""A lot of people feel Jason Kenney is stuck in Ottawa trying to rehash a battle that his party lost.""

Kenney was part of the federal Conservative government defeated by the Liberals in 2015. The UCP campaign declined to discuss its election strategy.

The report’s key findings, according to the CWTA, “shows the significant positive economic impact the industry makes when it comes to GDP, jobs and capital investment,” with year-over-year growth.

Specifically, the CWTA says “in 2017, Canada’s wireless industry contributed $27.5 billion to the Canadian GDP, an increase of 9.1% from $25.21 billion 2016.”

When it comes to jobs, the wireless sector had 151,550 full-time equivalents (FTE) jobs in 2017, an increase of 9.8% over 2016.

As for capital investments, Canadian wireless operators had spending totalling $2.92 billion in 2017, an increase of 13.2% compared to 2016.

“The Nordicity report highlights the critical contribution our industry makes to the Canadian economy,” said Robert Ghiz, President & CEO of CWTA, in a statement.







Nordicity Partner Stuart Jack said, “Our report shows that Canada’s wireless sector contribution to the Canadian GDP continues to increase and is a key growth enabler of the overall Canadian ICT sector.”

In a nutshell, the Canadian wireless industry says a report they commissioned to a third party, has concluded the Canadian wireless industry is very important in Canada.

He had a distinguished career and was well respected. He served in different departments under several ministers in governments led by the Conservative and the Liberal parties.

Wernick's retirement, as a result of the controversy surrounding SNC-Lavalin is, certainly, a sign of things to come for our country.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick leaves after testifying before a justice committee on the SNC Lavalin affair on March 6, 2019.

The political discourse has gone downhill. While we had, in the past, debates on ideas, it has now become about people. You either ""like"" or ""dislike"" a politician or a public servant. Ideas matter little.

The House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights met on several occasions to hear from former Minister of Justice Jody Wilson-Raybould and other officials — including Wernick — on the controversy surrounding the granting of a remediation agreement to SNC-Lavalin.

As a result of his testimony in front of the Justice Committee, he received insults calling him a ""traitor,"" ""dirty"" and other similar nonsensical and unfounded epithets. He asked parliamentarians to look at the emails and social media messages containing the insults — they chose not to. It was easier for the MPs in this committee to go back to the squabbling and foster more negative social media.

Wernick was right to warn Canadians about his concerns about what politics in Canada is becoming. In his presentation, he mentioned that a deterioration of the political discourse could possibly lead to political assassination and violence. Some viewed this as going too far. But you don't need to go far to show that an increasingly polarized society leads to violence. On March 21 this year, Cesar Sayor Jr. pleaded guilty in the U.S. to trying to bomb opponents of President Donald Trump in the U.S.

Social media, encouraged by the behaviour of some politicians, has enabled people to insult others without being held responsible for the language and tone used. Mr. Wernick called social media a ""vomitorium"" — and, again, he is right.

Mass/mainstream media is not without blame.

Repeating the insults, giving airtime to the childish behaviour that some politicians engage in (shouting in Question Period, banging on desks, etc.) can encourage the behaviour.

And, when looking at the main political shows on the various channels like CBC and CTV, the style is to bring in partisan individuals to comment on the news of the day. The polarization then continues to increase.

Some (often media type themselves) believe that the majority of news coverage of politics is presented with context, criticism and expert opinion. I disagree. While the ""right"" and ""left"" wings of the political spectrum blame the other (and related media) for the polarization, some simply believe that the media is not doing enough.

Our political leaders and the media should work to elevate the discourse rather than help it further deteriorate.

Where discourse is heading around the world

What happens when politics descend into the theatre of the absurd? Simple, we observe results similar to what is happening in several countries in Europe, the Americas and Asia.

In Brazil, in 2018, a politician was elected despite telling a female colleague that he wouldn't sexually assault her because ""she's not worthy of it."" He received 55.5 per cent of the votes in the national election and is now the president. A very similar situation exists in the Philippines where President Rodrigo Duterte uses language that I wouldn't repeat to describe women.

In Europe, we have people in the streets burning stores and restaurants in the centre of Paris; far-right and far-left politicians joined together to lead Italy; a surprise Brexit vote a few years ago in the U.K.; far-right politicians making gains in Scandinavia, the Netherlands and Germany. In Ukraine, a newcomer on the political scene — and comedian — is now leading the polls for the upcoming presidential election.

Many of these politicians were elected because they were seen as outside the mainstream movement of politics.

It is not necessary to evoke U.S. President Donald Trump. Canadians take pains to paint Canada as ""different than the U.S.,"" as if what is happening south of the border couldn't take place here. I'm not sure that's true. We have in the U.S. a president that doesn't believe in traditional media — in Ontario, we have a premier that also doesn't believe in traditional media. Other examples abound.

'Descent into the abyss'

In Canada, the words ""traitor"" and ""corrupt"" (and many other words not worth repeating here) are being used to describe elected officials and public servants. While most politicians usually refrain themselves from using these words, they certainly — by their words and actions — encourage the descent into the abyss.

Having worked for more than 25 years around Ottawa's Parliament Hill, I have seen great politicians and public servants and observed... others. I've agreed with some and disagreed with others. But respect — if not of the individual, at least of the function — is essential for our parliamentary democracy to survive.

Former Prime Minister Harper wrote that ""the current populist upheaval is actually benign and constructive compared with what will follow if it is not addressed."" I'm not sure that the current populist upheaval is ""constructive"" or ""benign"" but I agree with him that if legitimate concerns are not addressed, the result will be worse. Interestingly, he chastises ""some leaders and much of the media"" for their response to the populist movement.

Leaders in the mainstream parties should be careful and observe what happens in other countries. Because when voters have lost complete faith in the political system, they turf out ""mainstream"" politicians to elect the extreme. It would be wiser for political strategists to look beyond the short electoral term and observe odds for long-term political survival. If the system is to survive, it needs to be reformed.

Media is saying that Wernick resigned under a cloud. The cloud hasn't gathered over Wernick; he is a distinguished gentleman that served Canada well. My assumption — and I don't know him personally — is that he probably just got tired of the ridicule of it all. The cloud is over the political class and the media.

HALIFAX — Nova Scotia's Liberal government took steps to renew its struggling health care system in a balanced budget Tuesday, though critics say the efforts are incomplete and poorly targeted.

Finance Minister Karen Casey introduced her government's fourth consecutive balanced budget, projecting a thin $33.6-million surplus for 2019-20, on planned spending of about $11 billion.

There are no increases in taxes or fees, but more than $178 million in additional funds from Ottawa are helping cover the costs.

Spending increases by Premier Stephen McNeil's government are sprinkled in small increments including more funding targeted at homecare, new tax credits to assist new firms, and new public awareness programs that will begin as the sales of edible marijuana products start up.

However, the Liberals biggest spending increase by far is in the health budget.

The government confirmed $157 million in capital grants for ""the largest health care redevelopment projects in Nova Scotia history,"" at the Queen Elizabeth II Health Centre in Halifax and the Cape Breton Regional Health Centre in Sydney.

The budget notes that 120 long-term care beds will eventually be added as part of the Cape Breton project, as well as beds that are part of replacement projects in Meteghan and Mahone Bay, but these additions won't be coming this year.

In addition, the budget for the Nova Scotia Health Authority — the province's merged health agency — is up $57.2 million.

Overall, when compared to last year's budget estimate, spending on health would grow by more than $191 million over the amount spent in 2018-19.

Casey devoted close to a quarter of her speech to the province's health care system, which has come under continuing criticism for hospital crowding, doctor shortages and high numbers of pressure injuries among nursing home residents.

""When we looked at what the needs were and what the province could afford we were certainly identifying health as a priority,"" she told reporters just before speaking in the legislature.

The province's health spending has grown by almost one fifth in five years to $4.6 billion, consuming a steadily rising percentage of the government's revenues.

However, a portion of this year's projected increase is the result of health transfer and equalization payments from the federal government, which make up about one-third of all Nova Scotia's revenues.

This included an agreement that provided an additional $28.5 million for mental health care.

The province is also planning $16.8-million for home care, and another $10-million for collaborative care centres to help battle the persistent shortage of family doctors.

The province's opposition parties criticized McNeil's government for failing to spend enough on what they said are some of the root causes of the province's health care problems.

""The government can spend more money but the delivery of health care is not improving,"" said Tory Leader Tim Houston.

""Health care in this province is getting worse and worse.""

Meanwhile, NDP Leader Gary Burrill said hospitals will continue to be too crowded, and as a result people will wait hours in emergency rooms.

He diagnoses the lack of nursing home care beds as among the key root causes, and noted there was little in the budget to address the shortfalls.

""It's a dumpster full of disappointment ... Every front line health care worker says the source of this is there's an inadequate supply of long-term care beds to move people out of hospitals,"" he said.

While the benefit ""is no panacea ...","Investors are becoming increasingly convinced that Canada is headed towards recession.

A key indicator of rough times ahead, known as the yield curve, recently inverted for both the U.S. and Canada, something that usually happens shortly before the economy starts shrinking. Long story short, investors are betting Canada's interest rates are going to be coming down, which usually is a sign of hard times.

Couple that with the economy's surprisingly weak showing at the end of last year, and you have a recipe for trouble ahead. But one major part of the picture is signalling just the opposite: Canada's labour market, which is going from strength to strength these days.

Watch: Canada's most in-demand jobs in 2019. Story continues below.

Statistics Canada data released Monday showed there were 548,000 job vacancies nationwide in the fourth quarter of 2018, up 16.6 per cent in a year. All 10 of the largest industrial sectors saw an increase in job openings. Among provinces, only Saskatchewan saw a decrease in job openings, and only by about 500 jobs.

Even with anemic exports and consumer demand slowing down (retail sales have fallen for five of the past six months), Canadian employers are showing no signs of slowing down their hiring.

Long-term job vacancies are also on the rise, with the number of job openings sitting vacant for three months or more hitting record highs around 400,000 over the past year, according to data from the Canadian Federation of Independent Business.

This shortage of workers means that Canada's employers are — finally — beginning to seriously raise the wages they're offering to new hires. The average offered hourly wage in Canada jumped 5.2 per cent over the past year, to $21.10.

Ontario saw the strongest spike in offered wages, up 7.6 per cent in a year, to $21.85, though this coincided with the large increase to the province's minimum wage at the start of 2018, StatCan noted.

HuffPost Canada

The job vacancy rate ""points to further employment gains ahead,"" wrote Krishen Rangasamy, senior economist at National Bank of Canada, in a client note.

But while the labour shortage is good news for those looking for work or a raise, at these elevated levels it's actually beginning to harm the economy.

A report from the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC Canada) issued in January found 53 per cent of small and medium-sized businesses say the shortage will cause them to limit business investment this year.

That's a bad sign for Canada in the longer term, because business investment is pretty much the only thing that drives job growth in the private sector.

Some businesses ""will not accept new clients, they will refuse contracts. They just can't do it,"" BDC Canada chief economist Pierre Cléroux told HuffPost Canada last month.

Skills 'mismatch'

Rangasamy believes the spike in the job vacancy rate over the past few years, as the jobless rate dropped, is a sign of ""inefficiency and (a) skills mismatch"" in Canada's labour market.

This argument is strengthened by the fact that, despite record low unemployment rates recently, the average length of unemployment in Canada is nearly as long as it was in the last recession.

Simply put, the 1.1 million people on Canada's unemployment rolls today largely don't have the skills employers are looking for (or are unwilling to work the jobs available for the pay being offered).

Policymakers are waking up to the problem.

The federal Liberals' latest budget, unveiled last week, included the creation of a new Canada Training Benefit to ""help pay for training, provide income support during training, and, with the cooperation of the provinces and territories, offer job protection so workers can take the time they need to keep their skills relevant,"" according to Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC).

That program is also meant to address the growing risk of automation, with one in 10 Canadian jobs at ""high risk"" of being replaced by machines, ESDC said.

On average, homes are twice the cost here than in the U.S., though traditionally the two numbers have been at parity. Even with some easing in ...","With last week’s budget, Ottawa reversed course somewhat on measures to cool the country’s overheated housing market. Having tightened borrowing rules to reduce the risk of people defaulting on their mortgages and help ease the unsustainable upward pressure on home prices, the government is looking to make borrowing easier for first-time buyers.

Over three years, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) will make up to $1.25 billion available under the First-Time Home Buyer Incentive. The program will provide such buyers a shared equity mortgage equal to five per cent of the cost of a resale home or 10 per cent for new construction. Only households with annual incomes of less than $120,000 qualify, with the maximum mortgage value set at four times household income.

The maximum rate will cover the average sale price in much of the country, but not in the particularly troublesome markets of Toronto and Vancouver, where average prices are $765,000 and $925,000 respectively.

The budget also boosts the Home Buyers’ Plan (HBP) tax-free RRSP withdrawal limit to $35,000 from $25,000.

The government’s moves are something of a pre-election sop for millennials – the entire budget is an attempt at vote-buying, of course – and will be welcomed by groups that balked at the previous measures, particularly those who profit on the backs of homebuyers. They want to see the government back into pumping the real estate market that’s driven a good chunk of the economy while putting Canadians even deeper into debt, all the while excluding growing numbers of people with artificially high prices.

The bigger picture must be taken into account, particularly the on-again, off-again bursting of the housing bubble.

A series of reports, from agencies with no horse in the race, raises doubts about the sustainability of a decade-long upward trend that slowed only marginally during the worst of the 2008 recession, the same one that continues to plague housing prices in parts of the U.S.

There are glaring differences between the housing markets in the two countries. Where the U.S. wilted under foreclosures and soft sales, the Canadian market remained hot in many quarters. On average, homes are twice the cost here than in the U.S., though traditionally the two numbers have been at parity.

Even with some easing in Vancouver and Toronto, average home prices remain far out of reach of many residents.

None of that sounds sustainable. Some economists and market watchers are waiting on a correction. Still, there are plenty of us who see housing as a safe investment, unlike, for instance, the stock market, which remains volatile. Both markets are a gamble, however, and both were and continue to be heavily manipulated by the financial sector, the very industry responsible for the systemic corruption at the root of our economic woes.

Speculation, of course, is another word for gambling. When you buy stocks, you’re betting they’ll go up in price (or down, if you’re shorting). Other than securities, there are a host of speculative investments for those willing to take the risk. Speculation also extends to the housing market. This applies not only to people who buy homes to flip them, or farmland in the hope of a future subdivision, but to many who’ve entered the housing market in recent years.

Moves that counter risk and end the speculative aspect of real estate can only be a good thing. The real goal is housing people, after all, and the lower the price, the better.","Looking for votes, Liberals change tack on housing issues",ObserverXtra,https://observerxtra.com/2019/03/28/looking-for-votes-liberals-change-tack-on-housing-issues/
325,World,2019-03-28T17:37:00.0000000Z,"The bill, presented Thursday, also includes two notwithstanding clauses to override guarantees in the Quebec and Canadian human rights charters ... The main opposition Liberals and the second opposition Québec Solidaire caucus remained seated Thursday ...","QUEBEC — Teachers, judges, lawyers, transit commissions, municipalities, school boards and the staff of provincial government bodies would be bound by the Coalition Avenir Québec’s proposed bill enshrining “the laicity of the state.”

Immigration Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette called the bill “the logical followup” to Quebec’s Quiet Revolution, a period of rapid social change in the 1960s, when the role of the Roman Catholic Church in education and health care was scaled back.

The bill would amend Quebec’s human rights charter to affirm the religious neutrality or “laicity” of the state.

A ban on wearing religious signs by designated officials, including the Speaker and Deputy Speakers of the Quebec National Assembly would be imposed under Bill 21, which the government of Premier François Legault hopes to see adopted before the assembly’s summer adjournment.

The bill, presented Thursday, also includes two notwithstanding clauses to override guarantees in the Quebec and Canadian human rights charters protecting fundamental rights, including religious freedom.

“It’s a very important day today,” Legault told reporters on his way into the assembly.

“What I want to try to do in the next few weeks is to unite as many Quebecers as possible.”

And he appealed for a “serene debate,” although Quebec’s human rights commission and religious minorities in the province have expressed opposition to the bill even before it was presented.

Legault said the issue of dealing with religious differences has been left unresolved in the province for too long, calling his bill “an important act” to resolve an issue that should have been dealt with “years ago.”

In Halifax Thursday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said “it is unthinkable for me to legitimize, in a free society, discrimination against citizens based on their religion.”

To get more support for his bill, making Quebec officially a secular state, the premier said, he has agreed to remove the crucifix from the National Assembly and has agreed to a “grandfather clause” that would allow teachers who wear them on the job to continue to do so.

“Because my goal is really to unite Quebecers,” he explained.

Bill 21 makes no mention of the crucifix, leaving it to the assembly to decide. However, the assembly voted unanimously Thursday morning to remove it.

Judges in the province have told the government they cannot be bound by a ban on religious signs, under the separation of powers protecting the judiciary. The bill calls on Quebec’s Conseil de la magistrature to enforce the ban.

Bill 21 does not appear to apply to federally-appointed judges, named to Quebec Superior Court, Federal Court and the Quebec Court of Appeal.

While teachers, principals and vice principals in public schools would be subject to the ban on religious signs, their counterparts in Quebec’s subsidized private schools could still wear religious signs.

In Quebec, there are few religious signs worn by judges, prosecutors or peace officers. Some teachers, who are Muslims, do wear the hijab head covering. In addition to judges, court staff such as clerks, sheriffs and bankruptcy registrars could not wear religious signs on the job.

The ban would apply to Quebec prosecutors and persons designated by the National Assembly, as well as police and other peace officers.

Bill 21 also includes provisions banning the Islamic niqab and other face coverings, with such a ban applying to elected members of the National Assembly, municipal councillors, school board commissioners, National Assembly and Lieutenant Governor’s staff, and peace officers.

The ban on face coverings applies to doctors, dentists and midwives and daycare staff.

As well, people seeking public services, such as driving tests or health care and those boarding public transit could be refused these services if they refused to uncover their faces.

Exceptions are allowed for reasons of health, disability “or because of the requirements tied to their functions or the performance of certain tasks.”

The Parti Québécois, now the third opposition in the assembly, with nine seats, said it would be willing to support Legault’s bill if he agreed to a grandfather clause, allowing affected employees now wearing religious signs, to continue to do so.

The main opposition Liberals and the second opposition Québec Solidaire caucus remained seated Thursday as the CAQ caucus rose in a standing ovation for Immigration Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette.","Quebec’s new ‘laicity’ bill to override provincial, Canadian rights charters",iPolitics,https://ipolitics.ca/2019/03/28/quebecs-new-laicity-bill-to-override-provincial-canadian-rights-charters/

Islanders will go to the polls April 23 in a provincial election announced late Tuesday.

Recent polls have put the Greens out in front, and leader Peter Bevan-Baker believes his party can win a province that has only ever been governed by the Liberals or Tories.

“That possibility is there. Emotionally, politically and intellectually, I feel like I’m ready for that challenge, in a way that I wasn’t perhaps a year ago,” he said.

“This could be a truly historic moment not only in Canadian politics but for the future of our grandchildren.”

READ MORE: Liberal premier calls Prince Edward Island election for April 23

Bevan-Baker, 56, grew up in Scotland and immigrated to Canada in 1985, living in Newfoundland and then Ontario before settling in Prince Edward Island in 2003. He became a Canadian citizen in 1992.

A dentist by profession, he became his party’s first member of the P.E.I. legislature in 2015, following nine unsuccessful bids provincially and nationally for the party.

Since then, the Greens captured a second seat on the Island, and have been successful in getting members elected in other provinces, including three during last year’s New Brunswick election.

Bevan-Baker – who celebrated Tuesday’s election call by playing “First Call” on his trumpet at a nomination meeting – said he believes the time for the Green party has arrived.

“That sort of global movement away from conventional politics and unimaginative politicians, you see that expressed everywhere,” he said, citing recent elections in U.S. and Ontario as expressions of disgruntlement with conventional politics.

“I think what’s happening on P.E.I. is a local expression of that global phenomenon,” he said.

WATCH: New Brunswick election: Elizabeth May congratulations Greens for big win

A Corporate Research Associates opinion poll released this month suggests the Greens had a healthy lead, followed by the Progressive Conservatives, who picked a new leader, Dennis King, in February.

The Liberals were in third place, the poll suggests.

Bevan-Baker said that both delights and surprises him. He said he has to accept the possibility of forming government.

“We’ve crafted a platform, that for perhaps the first time ever in Canada, a Green platform that might have to be implemented. You come at it with a different lens. You can’t be just aspirational and vague and uncosted. You have to have a detailed and costed platform, which we have,” he said.

But Liberal Premier Wade MacLauchlan has issued a caution about the Green party, saying the province’s future is too important to risk on uncertain expensive social experiments.

Bevan-Baker said he’s not sure what MacLauchlan is referring to, but believes it could be his suggestion that P.E.I. would be a good place for a pilot program for a universal basic income. He said that would be expensive at first, but pay off in the long run.

For his part, MacLauchlan used the first full day of the campaign to promise at least 3,500 new jobs over the next four years.

He said that’s in addition to the 5,000 full-time jobs added over the last four years.

“As I have said numerous times since I became premier, the creation of jobs and job choices for Islanders has to be the number one priority of government.”

“Our record in this field is strong. However, our present success is no reason to take the foot off the gas. Support for workers, for employers and for the next generations of workers needs to continue.”

READ MORE: P.E.I. election speculation mounts as Liberals plan ‘special announcement’

The announcement includes a $4.5 million P.E.I. Worker Benefit to assist 12,600 low-income Islanders.

The Liberals would also spend $750 million on infrastructure programs to improve roads, bridges and schools, with a focus on job creation.

MacLauchlan said money would also be spent on a number of training programs, including new vocational facilities at Island high schools, and the small business tax rate would be reduced to 2.5 per cent by 2020.

Repeated calls requesting an interview with Progressive Conservative Leader Dennis King were not returned Wednesday.

Bevan-Baker said his party’s platform will be released in its entirety – likely next week.

While the parties have begun to pitch their issues, Don Desserud, a political scientist at the University of Prince Edward Island, said he believes the election will come down to personalities.

“It’s going to be an election based on the personalities of the leaders and people are going to vote according to whether they like or dislike the leaders of the parties,” Desserud said.

“The Progressive Conservatives are rising in the polls. The Liberals are falling in the polls and the Greens are staying quite steady high in the polls. I think it all has to do with the leaders and how well they’re liked,” he said.

The Island economy has been strong and the Conference Board of Canada recently said P.E.I. would lead the country in economic growth for the year ahead.

Desserud said voters blame the government when the economy is bad, but unfortunately for the Liberals, they don’t often credit the government with the economy is good.

“The Green party has been prudent in the way in which they have presented themselves and their policies and have appealed to the small ‘c’ conservatism of the Island. That’s worked really well for them, but I think right now they’re benefiting from the fact they are the alternative,” Desserud said.",Prince Edward Island’s Green leader keen to make electoral history,Global News,https://globalnews.ca/news/5103444/pei-election-green-party-leader/

The company secured the funding from existing investors including Green Acre Capital, alongside new investors including Newstrike Brands, a Canadian licensed producer whose strategic partners include The Tragically Hip.

“This financing will enable Green Tank to capitalize on new opportunities on a global scale.”

“This financing will enable Green Tank to capitalize on new opportunities on a global scale,” said Corey Koffler, Green Tank’s COO. “It will allow us to achieve our innovation goal of producing the highest performing vape technology on the market and to become the premiere B2B solution for our brand partners around the world.”

The company, which launched in 2016 by brothers Dustin and Corey Koffler, experienced annual revenue growth of nearly 300 percent last year. It is now working alongside more than 130 brands, and has signed partnerships with over a dozen licensed producers in Canada.

Green Tank said the capital will be used to help the company scale operations, accelerate product innovation, and attract top talent. The funding comes at a pivotal time for the company after the legalization of recreational cannabis came into effect last October, permitting the legal sale of cannabis vapes across Canada.

According to BDS Analytics, vaping is quickly becoming the top cannabis consumption method for recreational and medical use in the United States. In California, vaporizers account for approximately 30 percent of all legal cannabis transactions.

“Our strategic investment in Green Tank underscores our vision of building a premier consumer brand for the adult recreational market, with significant emphasis on the vape category,” said Mark E. Burton, chief strategy officer of Newstrike Brands. “We expect vape products to be a significant part of our overall revenue profile and we are excited to be working closely with Green Tank to design and deliver highly innovative vaporization hardware specifically designed to work seamlessly with our unique cannabis extracts.”

Last year, Green Tank raised a $4.3 million seed round from Toronto-based Green Acre Capital and Snoop Dogg’s venture capital firm Casa Verde.

According to Green Tank, consumer demand, led by vaporizers, is driving cannabis concentrates toward a projected $8 billion USD in retail sales over the next three years, outpacing growth in traditional cannabis flower sales. Vape sales are expected to hit $6.5 billion within the same timeframe.

Health Blue-green algae can have major effects on Canadian lakes Thursday, March 28th 2019, 2:41 pm - New research indicates an increase in blue-green algae found in Canadian lakes may have longterm effects. If you’re a Canadian cottager, your lake, or one nearby, has likely experienced a blue-green algae bloom in the past decade. Until recently, however, any health concern was limited to those who might have had direct contact with the algae, either by drinking the water or swimming in it. But new research out of Florida Gulf Coast University (FGCU) reveals that particles can become airborne and travel, getting into the lungs of those as far away as two kilometres from the algae itself. RELATED: Blue-green algae made a stink in Toronto last summer Blue-green algae is cyanobacteria, which contains the toxins microcystin and BAMA, both of which are dangerous to humans and animals. What isn’t yet known is at what levels they cause negative health issues and over what length of exposure. SEE BELOW: THE EFFECTS OF BLUE-GREEN ALGAE

Michael Parsons, a professor of marine science at FGCU and one of the researchers, isn’t sounding the alarm yet, though he says more research is crucial to find out whether these detectable levels of toxins can negatively impact health. “There are World Health Organization guidelines that say don’t get in the water if the microcystin concentrations are above a certain level,” says Parsons. “But for the air, there are no strict guidelines around when you should be avoiding the air or not breathing without a filtration device and so forth.” What’s more, he says, “we have no idea how long these toxins stay in our system.”

The bacteria can be found in almost every Canadian lake, David Schindler, a professor of ecology at the University of Alberta, told CBC News last summer, after the deaths of three dogs in New Brunswick were blamed on the bacteria. Most of us don’t notice the presence of the bacteria until we can see it in the form of a bloom and, often, smell it.

John Cassani’s primary concern is chronic exposure. Cassani is the Calusa Waterkeeper in southwest Florida for the Waterkeeper Alliance, a global organization dedicated to preserving water quality. He says that a lot of people are nervous about these new findings. “We’d all like to know more about what it means,” he says, noting that these blue-green algae blooms are happening more frequently and covering a broader area.

Until we get more answers, Parsons encourages cottagers to stay out of the water (and keep pets out) when there’s a bloom. And, he says, “listen to your body. If it smells bad, and you’re not feeling well, avoid the area.”

After a fourth quarter of 2018 that included short attacks, lawsuits, and a hostile takeover bid, the company entered 2019 with a major management shakeup that fundamentally transformed the company.

For months afterward, it was all quiet on the Aphria front. But now, the company is back in the news with an announcement that it has received clearance from Health Canada to pursue a major expansion project. This news is a signal that Aphria could be gearing up for even more growth after increasing revenue 154% year over year in its most recent quarter. To understand why this news is so big, we need to take a look at what exactly Health Canada approved.

Health Canada approves expansion

For marijuana growers, nothing is more important than production space. The ability to meet the growing demand for cannabis in this country requires significant grow space, and so far, the cannabis growers don’t have enough of it. As a result, the post legalization era has been marked by major supply shortages.

For Aphria, that may be about to change. Earlier this month, Health Canada approved an 800,000-square-foot expansion to the Aphria One grow space in Leamington. This new space will have the capacity to produce 110,000 kg of marijuana a year for about $800 million in revenue at the current cannabis selling price.

$1 billion in revenue predicted

Partially as a result of the recent expansion, Aphria is now forecasting $1 billion in revenue by the end of 2020. The math behind this makes sense given the figures above: the space the company is adding will be able to generate $800 million a year, and that’s on top of the company’s existing space, which drove about $13 million in sales in the most recent quarter. This would represent phenomenal revenue growth, the only question being whether demand for cannabis will be strong enough to justify it.

Takeover seems unlikely

A final point about Aphria is worth mentioning — this one pertaining to the much-discussed hostile takeover bid from Green Growth Brands.

Thanks to all the good news coming from Aphria, it seems unlikely that the Green Growth bid will go through. The all-stock bid valued Aphria at about $9, but with the company’s meteoric growth, its stock has risen to $13 so far this year. Assuming this price level holds, Aphria will be well out of Green Growth’s reach. This is good news for Aphria shareholders, since it means they won’t be forced to exchange each of their shares for 1.5 shares in a much less proven enterprise. This, combined with the recently approved expansion, indicates that this once maligned company may have a bright future ahead of it.

The last time I ate at 100 Laurier, it was still called the Canadian Museum of Civilization — I was 13; it was a cafeteria, nothing “spectacle,” as they say across the river.

Now, with Bistro Boreal, there are more varied and sophisticated food offerings. Located on the Laurier side of the building, the restaurant is a calm space that mirrors the museum’s graceful curves. (Though it’s a shame it doesn’t take in the waterfront view.)

The menu offers plenty of meat and cheese dishes, as well as creative sandwiches and salads. The salmon rillettes, for example, is presented as a tower of diced salmon atop stone-milled toast, adorned with a caper aioli and pickled red onion. Salmon can be light, but this is different, and the richness is welcome on a chilly day. The wilted micro-greens tossed haphazardly on top, however, signal an issue with the ingredients, the service, or some combination of the two.

Those same greens appear on my open-faced chicken sandwich. The meat portion is huge and surprisingly moist. We are excited to see mention of “local” regarding the brie; however, when asked about the source, the server replies “somewhere in Quebec.” In the end, the chicken overwhelms the brie.

On another lunch visit, the soup of the day is a creamy, subtle purée of carrot and squash with maple notes. The braised-beef poutine is good, though it would benefit from a tangy element. The bison burger is cooked to perfection, and the grilled naan wrap — with juicy chunks of chicken breast in an aioli sauce — is a hit. And the fries are excellent.

Desserts include a bread pudding that is more like fruitcake, but that’s fine — it is warm and comforting and much better than the typical museum café treats. Servers are friendly, but not well informed about the menu. The drinks list offers Canadian and international choices in beer and wine, and a display of Quebec gin hints at an effort to connect with its suppliers.

Overall, there is a sense that Boreal is a cafeteria growing up into the kind of modern eatery people are coming to expect. There are hits and misses at Boreal, but it is heading in the right direction.

The Green Organic Dutchman (TGOD), one of Canada's fastest-growing pot producers, applied for a bylaw exemption last summer to allow a 123,000-square-foot cannabis greenhouse at the corner of Jerseyville and Alberton roads. The current rural size limit in Hamilton for pot is 20,000 square feet.

Council rejected the proposal last year over the advice of its own planners, spurring an appeal to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.

A hearing was expected later this year — but council voted late Wednesday to sign off on a settlement proposal, although with unspecified conditions.

Related Content Take a tour of Green Organic Dutchman as it tries to woo Hamilton

The organic pot grower celebrated the settlement in a release that said the decision will ""allow TGOD to operate its cannabis greenhouse in Ancaster"" and start growing by June with a staff of up to 85 people. The company embarked on a lobbying and charm offensive after the fall election in the hopes council would reconsider.

Details of the settlement and proposed city conditions are still secret, so it was not immediately clear if the original planned size of the contentious greenhouse — about one-fifth as big as Lime Ridge Mall — was endorsed by council.

Mayor Fred Eisenberger did not take part in the vote because he is an investor in the company.

TGOD originally earned criticism from some politicians, particularly Ancaster Coun. Lloyd Ferguson, for starting to build the big greenhouse before earning permission to do so.

Ferguson had pushed to fight the proposal, arguing ""monster"" pot greenhouses could pop up across rural Hamilton.

After the city issued a stop work order last year, TGOD applied for an alternate permit to continue building the greenhouse — only for potted mums.","Hamilton settles with medical pot grower, the Green Organic Dutchman, to allow ‘monster’ Ancaster greenhouse",The Hamilton Spectator,https://www.thespec.com/news-story/9246102-hamilton-settles-with-medical-pot-grower-the-green-organic-dutchman-to-allow-monster-ancaster-greenhouse/

Post-yield curve inversion, let’s take a look at one of the most America-exposed of the Big Six, as well as one regional alternative, plus a member of the elite FAANGs that wants to take over your finances.

Toronto-Dominion Bank (TSX:TD)(NYSE:TD)

TD Bank is fairly exposed to the U.S., and its customer base south of the border may become something of an issue for Canadian investors should the spectre of an American recession materialize into something more tangible. While TD Bank’s stats themselves show little indication of risk, the bank’s position in the U.S. could become problematic should a downturn become a reality (as could others), and investors might start acting on it.

Down 3.07% in the last five days, could the biggest bank on the TSX index be already reacting to news of the American yield curve inversion? Trading at a 37% discount against its future cash flow value, the home of the green leather armchair boasts a slick P/E of 12.1 times earnings, while its one-year past earnings growth of 10.6% is identical to the of the TSX index itself, and very close to the Canadian banking average.

Laurentian Bank of Canada (TSX:LB)

A regular on the undervalued TSX index stocks lists, Laurentian Bank of Canada offers a more Canada-centric option for fans of financials with a more local flavour. Its negative past-year earnings rate is compensated by a five-year average earnings growth of 14.3%, beating the Canadian banking average of 8.6% for the same period, and signifying a solid overall track record.

One area in which TD Bank has the upper hand over Laurentian Bank of Canada is in its tolerance for bad loans, which is higher than that of the latter stock. However, this is a weak spot for the majority of bank on the TSX index, including some of the Big Six. Laurentian Bank of Canada is a strong, undervalued antidote to the usual big name bankers, and pays a handsome dividend yield of 6.25%.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)

Leaning heavily into its reputation for security, Apple is preparing to muscle in on your banking habits with the introduction of its new Apple Card. This new credit card will potentially be available with a spread of APR rates, opening it up to a range of income brackets. They’ll be going in with Goldman Sachs Group to offer the new initiative, which may offer low interest rates to customers with good credit scores.

One might expect better stats from one of the top stocks on the NASDAQ, and while a one-year past earnings growth of 17.7% and five-year average 6.8% are positive, they may denote a market that’s close to saturation. Meanwhile, a P/E of 15.6 times earnings is standard, though a PEG of 5.4 times growth and P/B of 7.7 times book show where the overvaluation is lurking.

The bottom line

TD Bank’s dividend yield of 4.05%, matched with a good-enough 9.7% expected annual growth in earnings, makes for the strongest reason to be invested in this heavyweight TSX index banker. However, U.S. exposure could be a worry, and could lead to real changes in Canadian investment behaviours down the line. Laurentian Bank of Canada makes for a potentially better buy for a defensive investor, meanwhile, and a decently valued one at that.

Jeremiah Rodriguez, CTVNews.ca Staff





Two Canadian brothers Nick and Will Laporte have been stranded after Icelandic budget airline WOW Air shut down on Thursday.

Nick was set to fly to Sweden from Toronto while his brother Will was scheduled to fly back home to Toronto from Sweden. But both of their flights were cancelled, with both brothers saying they were confused by the lack of clear communication from the airline.

Icelandic budget airline WOW Air ceased operations on Thursday, stranding passengers across two continents. In a statement on its website, the airline, which had earlier suspended all its flights, told passengers there would be no further flights and advised them to check for flights with other airlines for ways to reach their destinations.

Nick told CTV News Channel that -- on his way to the airport -- he initially received a text message from WOW Airlines stating his flight would be delayed by half an hour.

“So no big deal,” he recalled thinking. But the flight kept being pushed back. Nick said after some confusion over the status of the flight, it was eventually cancelled for good.

Will was genuinely thankful for the “very helpful” airport staff not associated with the airline. “I know there were some frustrated passengers that weren’t exactly polite to these people. So it was a tough situation all-around,” he said.

Meanwhile, his brother Will was headed home to Canada after wrapping up his hockey season in Sweden.

He’s now stranded in Osby, Sweden. He told CTV News Channel that he had initially received an email stating his flight was being delayed by 10 hours.

“But this morning, I read the news that they were no longer running their airline … it’s very disappointing,” Will said. He was later informed by an airline employee he “wasn’t entitled to a refund.”

His brother Nick said he’s since had difficulty reaching any representative from WOW Airlines, but has seen that Icelandic Airlines is offering discounted flights to stranded passengers if they filled out a form.

“I’m waiting to hear back from them and as soon as I get the green light for discounted airfare, I’ll be on my way to Iceland,” he said. Nick will ultimately be headed to Sweden for a training camp he hopes can help him qualify for the men’s 100-metre sprint at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.

“So I’m just kind of sitting tight until then,” he said.

Three students from Kitchener were also affected by the shuttering. They were returning home from Copenhagen and only realized something was wrong when they reached the airline’s front desk and realized no one was there.

Erin McBurney told CTV Kitchener they had to take a costly $1,300 detour in order to return to Toronto. She said their only other options at the time were a $2,000 three-day flight with Air Canada with layovers or a $5,000 direct flight through another airline.

Other passengers have taken to twitter to voice their own frustrations with the flight cancellations.

The Yellowknife Co-op recently installed a hydroponic greenhouse on its property. Its general manager hopes to start selling homegrown leafy greens and fresh herbs in four to six weeks time.

""We've had requests for years and years and years here about selling local produce or Canadian produce,"" said manager Justin Nelson.

""There was an opportunity to get involved in a hydroponic greenhouse, so we decided to do an investment in it. We just want to provide to our members some locally-grown produce.""

We've had requests for years and years and years here about selling local produce. - Justin Nelson, manager

Hydroponics are systems for growing plants in water— without soil. The co-op's food is growing in a greenhouse made out of an upgraded shipping container from Ottawa-based company The Growcer.

The Growcer's greenhouses use water enriched with nutrients, an artificial light source and carbon dioxide to grow plants ""as quickly as possible,"" said Corey Ellis, a company co-founder. He said the greenhouses can grow seeds into full plants in about six weeks.

The greenhouse, from Ottawa-based company The Growcer, is made out of an upgraded shipping container and is meant for use in cold climates. (Submitted by Yellowknife Co-op)

The sea cans are outfitted to keep plants growing when outside temperatures drop as low as -52 C. Ellis said the greenhouses use about as much electricity as an air conditioner that's running 24/7.

He said the Yellowknife Co-op should be able to stock its vegetables the same day they are harvested, ""which is pretty unique and I think something [customers] will really appreciate.""

The Yellowknife Co-op's sea can greenhouse isn't the first in the North. Ellis said his company has installed them in Kugluktuk, Nunavut, and Kuujjuaq, Que., as well.

Right now, the Co-op is growing kale, spinach and bok choi, as well as a variety of lettuces and herbs.

Nelson said the plants are pesticide-free and when harvested, are expected to be fresher and last longer than their counterparts trucked up from the South.

If all goes well, he said, the store will harvest about 400 plants a week.

Curious Yellowknife Co-op shoppers will be able to watch the in-house farming live.

Cameras have been set up in the greenhouse and the plan is to broadcast a livestream onto a large-screen TV set up in the produce department, said Nelson.

Nelson said the idea is not to produce a cheaper vegetable.

""Power and heat up here isn't cheap, so this isn't something to subsidize produce here,"" he said. ""Produce is cheap, it's no different than other locations in the South.""

The hope is to make a profit off the home-grown greens, said Nelson, and then return those profits to co-op members.

Westway LAB, Portugal’s first showcase festival and professional music conference, will take place for the sixth consecutive year from 10th to 13th of April in Guimarães, Portugal. Founded in 2014 with a clear mission: to operate a cultural, social and economic transformation through music, crossing borders enabling the construction of sustainable internationalization of artists and professionals from Portugal. During the 4 day event, Guimarães becomes a music city, combining in an innovative way the realization of an event based with three dimensions: Process (artist residencies), Thought (PRO Conferences) and Product (showcases and headline concerts).

According to Rui Torrinha, artistic director of the festival, “continuing to think about the cosmos from this unique place has made Westway LAB a powerful world of possibilities on a human scale, in which the time and space generated have allowed us to recover the original meaning of the word … quality. Not everything here can be said, so discover it and let yourself be discovered but do not miss out, because the spirit is of inclusion.”

And Canada’s stars will be shining soon in Guimarães when the CIMA gang heads to sunny Portugal for a Canadian Country Showcase at Westway Festival! “The Canadian Independent Music Association (CIMA) is always striving to increase export markets for our stakeholders. Westway LAB has an excellent reputation in Europe as a small but bustling festival and conference. We are honoured to have Canada selected as their country of focus for the 2019 edition.

MEGAN NASH

On her new album, Seeker, Saskatchewan Juno Nominee singer/songwriter Megan Nash collaborates with ambient/alt-rock unit Bears In Hazenmore with brilliant results. In sharp contrast to the starkness of her previous acclaimed album Song Harvest Volume One, Seeker takes Nash’s roots-based songwriting into a bold new sonic territory, displaying the undeniable chemistry she has forged with the group over the past year. That shared excitement was the hallmark of the sessions that produced Seeker over the winter of 2017 with engineer Orion Paradis (Library Voices), held at Soul Sound, a space shared with a contemporary dance studio. The flexibility of the location offered Nash the freedom to fully explore the range of her new material, from the atmospheric “Girl Vs Ocean” and “Summer,” to the anthemic “Lavender & Leather” and “Bad Poetry.”But as the concept of Seeker (embodied as well in its title track) suggests, Megan Nash is in the midst of her personal quest for spiritual meaning on her own terms. Her chosen path is through music, and as an artistic statement, Seeker displays the breadth of Nash’s talents as a songwriter, vocalist and producer—the culmination of one stage of her journey while simultaneously beginning the next.

TRIBE ROYAL

From Canada's capital city of Ottawa to the ""Hit Recording Capital of the World"" in Muscle Shoals, Alabama to record with legendary producer Norbert Putnam. Everything changed in 2018 for the fast-rising eclectic quartet when they played Live at Heart Sweden and Live at Heart Newfoundland, which has now led them to upcoming showcases in France at MIDEM, back to Live at Heart Sweden, Milwaukee Summerfest in the USA and now to the prestigious and innovative WESTWAY LAB in Portugal. With a sound that's hard to peg, but familiar nonetheless, the band are commonly marked as having a fresh vibe - vintage sound', nostalgic yet entirely their own; touching on sounds where acts such as The Eagles, The Lovin’ Spoonful, The Beatles and even the late Tom Petty left off. Their sound and style span decades from the clean, warm pop ballads of the early 1960s to the gritty rock of the mid-1970s modernized by the bands own musical era; the alternative rock of the mid-1990 's-early 2000s.

THE EAST POINTERS

The East Pointers - fiddler/singer Tim Chaisson, banjoist Koady Chaisson and guitarist Jake Charron – write about real life, sketching out its joys and sorrows in vivid strokes. That palpable authenticity makes their instrumental tunes practically cartwheel and infuses their lyric-driven songs with poignancy. And it’s why listening to The East Pointers’ brilliant and hotly anticipated second album What We Leave Behind – produced by superstar East Coast-bred songwriter/producer Gordie Sampson – is akin to meeting up with an old friend. As a follow-up to 2015’s internationally acclaimed, JUNO Award-winning debut Secret Victory, What We Leave Behind shares stories previously unheard but framed by a familiar context. The album reflects on the traditions of Canadian Celtic music, where it comes from, and what it means to the people, but also strides in new directions. With a captivating balance between their traditional-sounding instrumental tunes and catchy radio-ready songs, The East Pointers reach out with open arms to a wide range of listeners, inviting them to discover a new love of folk music. The East Pointers continue to blur the lines between traditional and popular music while developing a devoted fan base around the globe.

OTTAWA—The Canadian economy returned to growth to start the year after contracting in November and December as broad-based growth led by the manufacturing and construction industries offset weakness in the resource sector.

Statistics Canada said Friday real gross domestic product grew 0.3 per cent in January.

Economists on average had expected no growth for the month, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.

“There are no two ways about this one, as it was quite simply above everyone’s expectations,” said Doug Porter, chief economist at the Bank of Montreal.

“This nice gain augurs very well, given that Alberta’s oil production cuts were viewed as the biggest drag on the economy at the start of the year, and growth sailed right through that headwind.”

The growth came as 18 of 20 industrial sectors moved higher.

Goods-producing industries increased 0.6 per cent, led by growth in manufacturing and construction. The manufacturing sector rose 1.5 per cent in January, while the construction sector grew 1.9 per cent, its best showing since July 2013.

Services-producing industries rose 0.2 per cent as all but one sector increased.

The better-than-expected result for January came after the economy ended 2018 on a weak note.

Growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 came in at an annualized pace of 0.4 per cent, its worst showing in two and a half years.

The weakness prompted economists to raise concerns about the strength of economic growth this year, while the possibility the Bank of Canada may even look to cut interest rates this year was also raised.

The Bank of Canada kept its key interest rate on hold in its rate announcement earlier this month, but did warn Canadians on of a weaker economic performance in the months ahead.

Weakness in the report Friday could be found in the mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction sector that pulled back 3.1 per cent.

Oil and gas extraction fell 2.6 per cent, due in part to Alberta’s imposition of oil production cuts that began at the start of the year.

Mining, excluding oil and gas, fell 4.0 per cent.

CIBC chief economist Avery Shenfeld said Friday he’s expecting a more modest gain in February, but noted his bank is raising its first-quarter GDP forecast to 1.3 per cent from 0.5 per cent.

“If that’s on the mark, it’s not slow enough to prompt a Bank of Canada rate cut, but neither is it quick enough to justify a further monetary tightening,” he said.

“Markets had been piling on bets that the Bank of Canada would be pushed into an ease, and today’s data were seen as making that less likely.”","Canadian economy grew 0.3% in January, beats expectations",Canadian Manufacturing,https://www.canadianmanufacturing.com/operations/canadian-economy-grew-0-3-in-january-beats-expectations-229947/

The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) is asking everyone to switch off their lights from 8:30-9:30 p.m. on Saturday, as part of its annual Earth Hour.

READ MORE: Here’s what a world of net-zero carbon emissions looks like

The campaign started in 2007 to promote energy conservation in Australia, and has since morphed into a global movement aimed at raising awareness about the environment. The WWF is using this year’s event to call attention to the loss of biodiversity as hundreds of species die out due to climate change and human activity.

Climate change is more than just rising temperatures🌡️; Extreme weather 🌪️, loss of wildlife species and habitats 🐼, and rising seas all affect us. This #EarthHour, switch off to show that you stand for climate change. Let’s #Connect2Earth on 30 March at 08.30pm your local time. pic.twitter.com/s32RGp4x6c — Earth Hour (@earthhour) March 27, 2019

Megan Leslie, chief executive of WWF Canada, says turning off the lights is largely symbolic since it won’t have a noticeable impact on the environment by itself.

“It’s not about electricity savings,” she told Global News. “It’s about us coming together as a community to show that we care about this issue, and we’re in it together.”

WATCH BELOW: How constructing new buildings can affect carbon emissions

Some parts of the world have actually reported an increase in electricity use during Earth Hour. In British Columbia, for instance, BC Hydro said energy use crept up by 0.2 per cent during Earth Hour 2018. The utility also reported a net energy savings of just 0.3 per cent for 2017.

READ MORE: Electricity use actually went up in B.C. during Earth Hour, says BC Hydro

Earth Hour doesn’t do much to slow global warming on its own, but it can open the door to greater change, according to Christopher Knittel, a professor of applied economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He says there are many small changes people can make to cut down on the greenhouse gas produced by their everyday actions — something often referred to as a carbon footprint.

The United States produces 16.5 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide per capita, according to 2014 data from the World Bank. Canada produces slightly less, at 15 metric tonnes per capita. That means one person’s annual carbon footprint would weigh about as much as three African elephants.

WATCH BELOW: How to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions

“We need to remind ourselves that climate change is a long-term problem and the solutions are long-term,” Knittel told Global News.

“We need to change habits for decades, not just for one hour.”

Here’s how you can tweak your own habits to knock a few tonnes off your carbon footprint on this planet – and perhaps save it for the generation after you.

The world at stake

Top United Nations scientists warned last year that humans are on the verge of causing irreversible damage to the climate within the next three decades unless drastic action is taken to reduce carbon emissions and prevent the world’s average temperature from warming by 0.5 C.

READ MORE: New U.N. report on climate change carries life-or-death warning

A massive report from 90 UN scientists paints a dire picture of the situation, and offers little hope that the world will actually rise to the challenge. However, a handful of those scientists are cautiously optimistic.

WATCH BELOW: What half-a-degree of global warming means

“We have a monumental task in front of us, but it’s not impossible,” said Natalie Mahowald, lead author of the study and a climate scientist at Cornell University. “This is our chance to decide what the world is going to look like,” she told The Associated Press in October.

The report also warned that climate change and human activity are proving catastrophic for the world’s biodiversity.

“A major species extinction event, compromising the planetary integrity and Earth’s capacity to meet human needs, is unfolding,” the report says.

Switching off the lights doesn’t go far enough

Turning off the lights is actually one of the least effective ways to save energy around the house, according to Seth Wynes, a PhD candidate studying individual carbon emissions at the University of British Columbia. He also co-authored a paper analyzing the carbon footprint of more than 100 factors in a person’s daily life.

WATCH BELOW: Time lapse video shows Hong Kong going dark for Earth Hour 2016

Wynes says Earth Hour can be misleading because lights are a major factor in our lives, so we wrongly assume that they have a major impact on the environment. He says there are many other less noticeable lifestyle factors that can actually have a greater impact on a person’s carbon emissions.

READ MORE: Everyday plastics quietly pollute as they degrade, study finds

“You can save more energy by switching your washing machine to cold water than by turning off the lights,” Wynes told Global News. He adds that most modern LED lights are extremely energy-efficient, so it’s more helpful to upgrade the lights in your home than to switch them off for an hour.

“That doesn’t require you to constantly make good decisions about turning them off,” he said. “You just purchase LED light bulbs once — they save you money and they’re more efficient all of the time that you use them.”

WATCH BELOW: How small things can make a big difference when saving energy

You can also save a lot of energy by easing up on your use of heaters and air conditioners, according to MIT professor Knittel.

“It’s the sum of lots of smaller decisions that can have a bigger impact,” he said.

Knittel also recommends getting a hybrid, electric or more fuel-efficient vehicle the next time you buy a car, and cutting down on needless travel.

Cutting and taxing carbon to save the climate

Wynes says the most effective way to reduce our individual carbon footprint is to change the way we eat and travel because those are among the largest contributors to a person’s CO2 emissions.

“The best things you can do for the climate would be to eat a plant-based diet, avoid air travel and live car-free,” Wynes said.

Meat generally requires more land, resources and effort to produce than the equivalent amount of any plant-based crop, Wynes says. He adds that eating plants is good for biodiversity because it reduces the need to convert forests into farmland for cattle.

WATCH BELOW: Why people are complacent about climate change

However, the “best hope” to fight climate change is for more countries to embrace a carbon tax, according to Knittel.

“If we can each do our small share to get a carbon tax adopted, then those efforts are going to have a much larger impact than our own individual impacts,” said Knittel, who lives in the United States.

The Canadian government is poised to introduce a federal carbon tax on Monday, which will take effect in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick, where no provincial carbon taxes exist. The pricing scheme is expected to add approximately $2 to the cost of a tank of gas, and $8 to natural gas users’ monthly heating bill.

READ MORE: Carbon tax to kick in next week — but details for small businesses not yet finalized

Wynes says it’s unfortunate that carbon pricing has become a politically polarizing issue.

“It brings up all of these cultural ties that people have,” he said. “When they hear ‘carbon tax,’ that brings to mind whatever political group they are a part of, and often people make their decision based on that rather than the evidence,” he said.

WATCH BELOW: Scheer, Ford and Moe oppose federal carbon tax

Wynes says all governments need to move aggressively to curb global warming through measures like the carbon tax. That’s why he encourages people to support Earth Hour as a symbolic gesture to show lawmakers that their voters care about climate change.

“Turn off those lights, but somewhere in that day, also find time to contact an elected official and let them know … ‘I want you to do more than symbolic action,’” Wynes said.

WATCH BELOW: How climate action incentive payments work

WWF Canada’s Megan Leslie hopes people will also do more than symbolic actions after Earth Hour.

Based on current weather reports West of the green line should be to warm for ice like that. #ForTheThrone pic.twitter.com/7ugDFULBaU — Erik (@Adremdico) March 25, 2019 Though ...","And it seemed the show's Alberta fans were at least partially right. On Monday evening, YouTube user COWanderer commented on the 360-degree video, saying they had had a ""strange request"" to ship a 600-lb. throne to Tumbler Ridge, in British Columbia. They followed up with a link to a video of Lower Babcock Creek, near Tumbler Ridge, which people can ski up in the winter. Twitter users got to work verifying the claim.

Tumbler Ridge is a nine-and-a-half-hour drive from Calgary, just over the provincial border on the eastern side of the Rockies. The large icicle formations seen in the HBO video and videos of Babcock Creek are ""seeps,"" which emerge from the rocky banks.

YouTube user anathema replied to the supposed throne deliverer saying they drove out to check the location and found Babcock Creek almost entirely melted.

""If you tried to walk on it, you'd be swimming,"" they commented, adding that fans may have to ""bushwhack"" through the forest instead of trekking up the once-frozen creek.

Kevin Sharman, who is retired and spends his winters skiing at Babcock Creek and other nearby locations, told The Star earlier Tuesday that the HBO video was clearly filmed ""several weeks ago."" Now, he said the unusually early warmth is melting the ice in the area, and he and his wife had their last ice ski of the season a couple of days ago.

He said it would be tough to get to the location, and ""brutal"" to go through the forest.

Babcock Creek is likely only knee-deep in most areas, he said, but falling through the ice is still no joke. He added that Babcock Creek rises significantly once spring melting is in full force. By early May, the creek will be ""roaring,"" he said, and guessed the throne could be swept away by the water.

But the moment he saw the 360-degree video, Kevin said he knew where the throne was. In the first interview, he said he played it cool, saying he might try to find the throne in a couple of days. He added in an email later that in fact, he was ""on the phone with one hand and packing with the other.""

Sharman ventured out with his wife to try to find it. When they got to the base of the creek, they saw snowmobiles and a trailer and thought somebody had beaten them to the punch.

In reality, Babcock Creek was melting just as Kevin said it would — the ice was cracked and water was rushing, he said — and so HBO had moved the throne to a location that wouldn't endanger the lives of fans who were looking for it.

Two men emerged wearing long fur coats and leather garb for the throne ceremony, Kevin said, and in ""typical Canadian fashion,"" he and Birgit had trouble deciding who would sit on the throne. In the end, Birgit did, and posed for a photo with the two robed men, wearing a large golden crown. (The heavy crown, which comes with its own stand, is so big that Kevin said he'd need to wear a ball cap for it to fit).

""We were very excited,"" said Kevin, adding that they got to keep the crown.

DUMBO: The jive-talking crows are gone in this re-make of the beloved animated film from 1941. That’s good; they’d be culturally incorrect these days. But much of the emotional connection has been dropped too in this live-action Tim Burton version that goes for spectacle instead. There are fires and crowd surges and tent collapses and power outages and panic and an explosion. Once those kick in, there’s no stopping the rush.

Before that we get the charming story of the baby elephant with ears big enough to let him fly. He’s watched over by a one-armed World War I vet (Colin Farrell) and his two children inside a failing circus run by Danny DeVito. His celebrity attracts a New York huckster (Michael Keaton) who buys the whole circus and absorbs it into his theme park, Dreamland. (Sort of like an early Disneyland). A glamorous trapeze artist from France (Eva Green) gets to ride him on a tense and thrilling flight over giant crowds inside a huge tent. Then things start going wrong. The ultimate money man (Alan Arkin) wants more box office. The circus staff are fired. Dumbo’s mother is sold and he once again feels separation anxiety. (Small children cry every time it happens). It’s a frantic, noisy and tense sequence that corrects things. The film is beautifully visualized but low on what it really needs lots of: poignancy and whimsy. Purists will note that “Baby Mine,” the songs that won an Oscar for the 1941 version, is sung this time too. (Dunbar, International Village, Marine Gateway and many suburban theatres) 3 out of 5

THE WORLD BEFORE YOUR FEET: This is a terrific film; don’t miss it. It’s funny, captivating, informative and eccentric. It’s for people with a sense of curiosity about the world right in front of them. If you’ve ever just wandered a street or a neighborhood to see what you can find, on vacation in another city for instance, this film will speak to you.

Matt Green is on a marathon walking tour of New York and all its boroughs. Over six years or so he’s covered 8,000 miles of streets, lanes and paths and says he’s not finished yet. A few years ago he walked across the entire US and hasn’t gone back to his engineering job since. With a bit of money he saved, a small income from work as a cat sitter and endless couch surfing at friends’ places to sleep at night, he lives on and spends very little. But you’ll delight as he shows you sights he’s encountered: Houdini’s enormous grave for instance; Basquiat’s modest tiny one, the site on Wall Street where New York’s slave trade was centered, a corn field in Queens, many 9-11 memorials and “the puddle that never goes away”. And many more sights and a lot of history. He can’t explain why he does it except that most of these things he’d never see if he was driving. There’s a buoyant mood in this film and the encounters with people along the way are friendly. A real treat.

Solutions will be offered to companies looking to close their packaging loops.","Hosted in New York on 8th May, a new masterclass will discuss the future direction of the organic food market. Organic is a major success story in the food industry. In North America, organic food sales have increased from almost nothing to over USD 50 billion over 20 years. However, questions are being asked about the future evolution…

Major questions answered

What growth is projected for the North American and global market? How is the competitive landscape changing? As few dedicated organic food enterprises now remain, will large corporations and food retailers wield greater influence? What new certification schemes are emerging? With growing risks of food fraud, how can organic food companies strengthen their supply chains? How can they reduce their packaging impacts? Such questions will be addressed in this new one-day event, organized by Ecovia Intelligence.

Market updates

The morning seminars begin with an update on the US organic food market by the Organic Trade Association. Amarjit Sahota, Founder and President of Ecovia Intelligence (event organizer), will cover major trends and market developments in the global arena. Growth openings will be highlighted for companies looking to build exports to Europe, Asia and other regions.

Standards and labels

Diana Martin from the Rodale Institute will give details of the Regenerative Organic Certification scheme. Backed by pioneering organic enterprises, the new standard adds soil health, social fairness, and animal welfare to organic production methods. Erin Matchett from Non-GMO Project Verified will give an update on GM labeling and transparency in the food industry. Launched in 2010, Non-GMO Project Verified is the fastest growing eco-label in North America with sales now surpassing USD 26 billion.

Marketing trends

Targeting the millennials – some of the most avid buyers of organic foods – will be discussed by the marketing consultant Sourabh Sharma. In his seminar, he will give some insights into how to reach this increasingly influential demographic. How can organic food brands utilize digital marketing? Other seminars will cover organic ingredient trends & outlook, and traceability in organic supply chains. Guidance will be given to companies looking to mitigate risks of food fraud in their supply networks.

Packaging impacts

Plastic packaging is now a major concern for organic food companies. It is estimated that over 8 million tonnes of plastic enters the ocean each year. Andrew Dent, Executive Vice-President at Material ConneXion, will conduct an afternoon workshop. Titled ‘Sustainable Packaging Solutions’, the workshop is a practical guide for companies looking to make their packaging more sustainable. An update will be given on green alternatives to plastics, as well as the use of eco-design approach. Solutions will be offered to companies looking to close their packaging loops.",What is the future direction for organic food markets?,canadianpackaging.com,https://www.canadianpackaging.com/sustainability/what-is-the-future-direction-for-organic-food-markets-162922/

The recently announced public art program is open to both Canadian and international artists.

Stage 2 will add 24 new stations, extending the O-Train lines farther south, to Limebank Road and the airport; east to Trim Road in Orléans; and west to Baseline Road and Moodie Drive.

However, 24 new stations does not mean opportunities for 24 artists. With a budget of close to $7 million, the O-Train Stage 2 Public Art Program will engage five artist teams to design for several stations at once.

These stations are clustered by geography, which the City website says is meant to create “a cohesive narrative between and along” the O-Train line.

Artist teams will be given the opportunity to transform the following stations and surrounding landscape:

East: Montreal Road, Jeanne d’Arc, Place d’Orléans, Trim, Orléans Blvd.

Trudeau government brought down a notch

Thank you, NOW Magazine, for Enzo DiMatteo's balanced and sane article on the SNC-Lavalin soap opera (NOW, March 7-13, 2019).

The Canadian media has whipped itself into an irrational frenzy over this supposed scandal.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his government are not corrupt: a tad unethical, maybe, and somewhat fraudulent, but they hardly meet the threshold of high crimes and misdemeanours that the hapless, silly opposition wants us to think they do.

Trudeau is not Donald Trump. Canadian democracy has worked. We pretty much know what happened – the virtuous Trudeau government has been deservedly brought down a notch and voters will make a decision on his governance in October.

Now it’s time for the media to move on to more important issues.

Scheer laughs

Thanks for reminding us of some of the, um, more egregious incidents in Andrew Scheer’s career. I have been watching him with amazement throughout the SNC-Lavalin affair as he declares the Conservative party’s principled opposition to giving any help to corporations when they fall afoul of the law. I had no idea!

Jody Wilson-Raybould for Prime Minister?

Jody Wilson-Raybould should be Prime Minister of Canada. She is a courageous and honest woman. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau seems to think that when a woman says no what she really means is “keep bothering me.”

Crystal meth reality check

Re Crystal Meth Myths (NOW, March 7-13). I have trouble understanding the argument of this article. Is it that the meth=death campaign is ineffective in getting people to stop using Tina, or that Tina is not that dangerous and that people can use it recreationally?

All drugs make a person feel wonderful – that is their function by definition. Some of them while making you feel wonderful are also highly addictive and extremely harmful, not only physically, but also psychologically.

I am the child of two gay men. One has overdosed on meth three times in the past three years. More to the point he has lost his mind and his life is in a seeming never-ending downward spiral. I have lost my father and am essentially waiting for him to die.

I am sure that he felt in control at first and that he could “manage” his use of Tina during sex. Right before he wasn’t in control and it began to destroy him.

Homeless deaths on council’s head

I am away for the winter and keeping in touch with home by reading about homeless people in Toronto. The mayor’s comments are sickening (NOW, February 14-20). Why does it take so long to find empty buildings – many owned by the bloody city of Toronto – to get people inside and give them a chance at life?

I am 80 years old, born and raised in Toronto and appalled and sickened by the homelessness problem. How could the city council have over their heads that they caused homeless men and women to die because they are not taking this seriously?

A different side of poverty

Regarding NOW’s recent articles on the growing homelessness problem in Toronto (NOW, February 14-20).

Walking home recently, a well-dressed gentleman with two young girls stopped me outside Futures. He whispered if I could help him buy breakfast for his daughters. I gave him $20 and told him he could find decent sandwiches at Metro. He thanked me with tears in his eyes, which brought tears to my eyes. Here I was in a wealthy area of Toronto and some people cannot feed their children.

Planning Toronto for social cohesion

Thank you to NOW for covering how we’re building for loneliness in Toronto (NOW, February 28-March 6).

Young people and the elderly alike can find the busy city a lonely place. And that can lead to greater chance of death. Planning for social cohesion needs to be a priority and part of all developments.

Growing, cooking, buying and sharing food can be a great tool to bring people together.

Animating public spaces, parks, green spaces and community rooms can work wonders, too, especially within social housing.

Toronto also needs to clear its paths and sidewalks of snow and slush citywide. Not being able to get around with a bad hip, in a scooter, wheelchair or walker further isolates people all winter.

Meredith Macleod, CTVNews.ca





A Canadian filmmaker says an invitation to have her work screened at the Beijing International Film Festival has been rescinded over political tensions between China and Canada.

Maja Zdanowski was “ecstatic” when she received word on Monday that her debut film “In God I Trust” would be screened in the Forward Future category of the festival in April. She was also offered a round-trip flight and accommodation to attend the screening.

But the euphoria did not last long.

Two days later Zdanowski received an email from the co-ordinator of the Forward Future committee, which she provided to CTVNews.ca.

“We are really sorry, though we both like your film but because of the politics we can’t receive the Canada film this year,"" the email read.

Zdanowski pushed for answers and was told Friday by the same BIFF official: “We have made every effort, but as you know, the censorship in China is very strict and the standards are constantly changing. We tried many ways to get the film through but failed. It’s not the film itself that has political problems, it’s going abroad (I’m sure you’ve heard about Huawei.) So we are very sorry.”

That is a reference to Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of the giant Chinese technology firm Huawei, who was detained by Canadian officials in Vancouver on Dec. 1. Court proceedings are underway in British Columbia regarding her extradition to the United States to face allegations she conspired to violate sanctions against Iran.

The case has made headlines in China and Chinese officials have repeatedly demanded her release. Since Meng was detained, China detained two Canadians who were working in the country and halted canola shipments from Canada -- moves largely regarded as retaliatory.

It is unclear whether the BIFF is accepting any Canadian films. The festival does not appear to categorize films by country on its website.

Zdanowski submitted her self-funded film through the Telefilm Canada portal that helps filmmakers submit to international film festivals.

CTVNews.ca has reached out to the Beijing Film Festival, but has yet to hear back.

“To get accepted there, at this massively huge festival, was an opportunity of a lifetime for me,” Zdanowski said in a phone interview with CTVNews.ca. She says representatives of Telefilm Canada were “shocked” to hear of the reversal.

Telefilm Canada told CTVNews.ca that it ""simply facilitate the submissions of Canadian films"" to the festival and does not have ""any more details to provide"" on Zdanowski's case.

“In God I Trust” weaves together three stories set in a town in northern Idaho. Zdanowski says it confronts issues of racism, religion and gun violence.

“It has nothing to do with politics between China and Canada,” she said. “As a filmmaker, I shouldn’t be caught up in this fight between countries.”

Zdanowski co-wrote, directed and edited the film, which was shot on weekends over 18 months while she worked her full-time job in post-production for television.

The movie has already been screened at film festivals in Whistler, B.C. and Omaha, Neb. It’s being screened next week at the Beverly Hills Film Festival and at the European Independent Film Festival in Paris.

It has been nominated for the Borsos Award for Best Canadian Feature, the Alliance of Women Film Journalists Award for best female-directed film and has won the Stars to Watch award for the lead actor’s performance.

The film was to be shown among 17 others in the Forward Future category at the BIFF.

The Forward Future section “is established with the objectives to discover fresh filmmakers, hunt for the future trends of global film industry, encourage the spirits of innovation in filmmaking and display a culture diversity of film art,” reads the letter Zdanowski received.

Zdanowski was born in Warsaw but her parents fled Poland in 1981, fearing communism, when she was a baby. She lived in Johannesburg until she was nine, when her parents immigrated to Canada. She grew up in London, Ont. and studied communications and video production at the University of Windsor.

She worked in television in Vancouver for 14 years, before moving to Toronto in December to pursue her film career.

“I’m super proud that my film is being shown to film festival audiences, but it’s so disappointing about Beijing. It was a chance to showcase Canadian talent to people there.”

The Beijing film festival is in its ninth year and bills itself “as the city's most internationally influential large-scale cultural event, a major platform for global exchange, a bellwether of the film market, an incubator for new filmmakers and new productions, and a new brand of Beijing culture.”",Canadian film pulled from Beijing festival over 'politics',CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/canadian-film-pulled-from-beijing-festival-over-politics-1.4357930

He had a distinguished career and was well respected. He served in different departments under several ministers in governments led by the Conservative and the Liberal parties.

Wernick's retirement, as a result of the controversy surrounding SNC-Lavalin is, certainly, a sign of things to come for our country.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick leaves after testifying before a justice committee on the SNC Lavalin affair on March 6, 2019.

The political discourse has gone downhill. While we had, in the past, debates on ideas, it has now become about people. You either ""like"" or ""dislike"" a politician or a public servant. Ideas matter little.

The House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights met on several occasions to hear from former Minister of Justice Jody Wilson-Raybould and other officials — including Wernick — on the controversy surrounding the granting of a remediation agreement to SNC-Lavalin.

As a result of his testimony in front of the Justice Committee, he received insults calling him a ""traitor,"" ""dirty"" and other similar nonsensical and unfounded epithets. He asked parliamentarians to look at the emails and social media messages containing the insults — they chose not to. It was easier for the MPs in this committee to go back to the squabbling and foster more negative social media.

Wernick was right to warn Canadians about his concerns about what politics in Canada is becoming. In his presentation, he mentioned that a deterioration of the political discourse could possibly lead to political assassination and violence. Some viewed this as going too far. But you don't need to go far to show that an increasingly polarized society leads to violence. On March 21 this year, Cesar Sayor Jr. pleaded guilty in the U.S. to trying to bomb opponents of President Donald Trump in the U.S.

Social media, encouraged by the behaviour of some politicians, has enabled people to insult others without being held responsible for the language and tone used. Mr. Wernick called social media a ""vomitorium"" — and, again, he is right.

Mass/mainstream media is not without blame.

Repeating the insults, giving airtime to the childish behaviour that some politicians engage in (shouting in Question Period, banging on desks, etc.) can encourage the behaviour.

And, when looking at the main political shows on the various channels like CBC and CTV, the style is to bring in partisan individuals to comment on the news of the day. The polarization then continues to increase.

Some (often media type themselves) believe that the majority of news coverage of politics is presented with context, criticism and expert opinion. I disagree. While the ""right"" and ""left"" wings of the political spectrum blame the other (and related media) for the polarization, some simply believe that the media is not doing enough.

Our political leaders and the media should work to elevate the discourse rather than help it further deteriorate.

Where discourse is heading around the world

What happens when politics descend into the theatre of the absurd? Simple, we observe results similar to what is happening in several countries in Europe, the Americas and Asia.

In Brazil, in 2018, a politician was elected despite telling a female colleague that he wouldn't sexually assault her because ""she's not worthy of it."" He received 55.5 per cent of the votes in the national election and is now the president. A very similar situation exists in the Philippines where President Rodrigo Duterte uses language that I wouldn't repeat to describe women.

In Europe, we have people in the streets burning stores and restaurants in the centre of Paris; far-right and far-left politicians joined together to lead Italy; a surprise Brexit vote a few years ago in the U.K.; far-right politicians making gains in Scandinavia, the Netherlands and Germany. In Ukraine, a newcomer on the political scene — and comedian — is now leading the polls for the upcoming presidential election.

Many of these politicians were elected because they were seen as outside the mainstream movement of politics.

It is not necessary to evoke U.S. President Donald Trump. Canadians take pains to paint Canada as ""different than the U.S.,"" as if what is happening south of the border couldn't take place here. I'm not sure that's true. We have in the U.S. a president that doesn't believe in traditional media — in Ontario, we have a premier that also doesn't believe in traditional media. Other examples abound.

'Descent into the abyss'

In Canada, the words ""traitor"" and ""corrupt"" (and many other words not worth repeating here) are being used to describe elected officials and public servants. While most politicians usually refrain themselves from using these words, they certainly — by their words and actions — encourage the descent into the abyss.

Having worked for more than 25 years around Ottawa's Parliament Hill, I have seen great politicians and public servants and observed... others. I've agreed with some and disagreed with others. But respect — if not of the individual, at least of the function — is essential for our parliamentary democracy to survive.

Former Prime Minister Harper wrote that ""the current populist upheaval is actually benign and constructive compared with what will follow if it is not addressed."" I'm not sure that the current populist upheaval is ""constructive"" or ""benign"" but I agree with him that if legitimate concerns are not addressed, the result will be worse. Interestingly, he chastises ""some leaders and much of the media"" for their response to the populist movement.

Leaders in the mainstream parties should be careful and observe what happens in other countries. Because when voters have lost complete faith in the political system, they turf out ""mainstream"" politicians to elect the extreme. It would be wiser for political strategists to look beyond the short electoral term and observe odds for long-term political survival. If the system is to survive, it needs to be reformed.

Media is saying that Wernick resigned under a cloud. The cloud hasn't gathered over Wernick; he is a distinguished gentleman that served Canada well. My assumption — and I don't know him personally — is that he probably just got tired of the ridicule of it all. The cloud is over the political class and the media.

Tory MP Luc Berthold shot back at China during a meeting Friday of the House of Commons agriculture committee in Ottawa.

The committee is debating a Conservative motion to compel testimony from Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland, International Trade Minister Jim Carr and Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau to address what they say is a broader political crisis with China that's affecting the livelihoods of Canadian farmers.

China's decision to ban $2 billion worth of Canadian exports is widely seen as retaliation for Canada's arrest of Meng Wanzhou, an executive with Chinese telecom giant Huawei, at the behest of the United States.

Saskatchewan Conservative MP Randy Hoback said the cabinet ministers need to provide ""comfort"" to farmers by assuring them they'll have a market to sell to this fall.

China says it has found hazardous organisms in the shipments of two major canola exporters, Richardson International Ltd. and Viterra, Inc.

China was infuriated by Meng's Dec. 1 arrest on a U.S. extradition warrant alleging fraud.

Nine days after Meng's arrest, China imprisoned two Canadians — ex-diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor — and accused them of violating China's national security.

'We need a solution fast:' Berthold

The Canadian Chamber of Commerce says China's canola decision has no basis in scientific fact.

Mark Agnew, senior director of international policy for the chamber, says he trusts the assessments by Health Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency that Canada's crop is safe.

Agnew, however, stopped short of linking the arrest with the canola issue.

""When you look at the numbers the canola industry has put out, there's a massive market here that looks like it's being shut off for Canadian canola exporters,"" Agnew said Friday in an interview.

""We trust what Health Canada and CFIA say about the safety of Canadian exports. It's quite easy to see there's not a science-based justification for what China is doing to Canadian canola exports.""

Berthold denounced the Chinese complaints about the quality of Canadian canola.

""To claim the canola sent to China didn't meet quality standards is completely absurd,"" said Berthold.

""We need a solution fast.""

China is the recipient of about 40 per cent of Canada's exports of canola seed. China is the only country to raise a technical issue with the product.

The Canadian canola industry is urging Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to press China for solutions.

Uncertainty for farmers

Canadian farmers say China's ban has created uncertainty ahead of the spring planting season. Along with the Canola Council of Canada, they are calling on the government to send a delegation to China to address the issue.

Earlier this week, Trudeau mentioned the possibility of sending a delegation to China, as he defended the quality control of the product as ""top-notch and world-class.""

Hoback warned that unless the government can repair the damaged relationship with China, other sectors could be vulnerable to retaliation, including maple syrup and seafood.

Earlier this week, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China's actions on canola were ""scientific and reasonable.""

Without mentioning Huawei directly, Geng said China hopes Canada can ""get along with us to ensure the sound and steady development of China-Canada relations.""

Geng said Canada should ""take practical measures to correct the mistakes it made earlier"" in the bilateral relationship.",Tories push for probe of political spat with China following 'absurd' canola ban,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canola-committee-freeland-carr-1.5076919

And this is a man who is, for the most part, dismissed as a buffoonish and aggrieved crank with no ...","For more than a week, ever since a heavily armed white man charged into the Masjid Al Noor and opened fire on worshippers, I’ve been heavily occupied with thoughts of cowardice. That of the shooter, of course, but also my own. In fact, cowardice is the reason I’ve been putting off the writing of this column.

Let me explain.

A few weeks ago, Edmonton-based writer and educator Minister Faust asked if I would consider writing about the populist movement coalescing in Alberta, known as the Yellow Vests. I gave it some thought, but decided it was too niche of an issue to pitch my editor. I’ve written about the ideological capture of populist movements by hate groups before, of course. But I rationalized the Yellow Vests as an astroturfed campaign by oil interests which would, much like America’s Tea Party, amount to a brief and self-annihilating costume party for aggrieved white xenophobes.

After the shooting, I exchanged messages with Bashir Mohamed, another Edmonton-based writer, regarding the tendency of Alberta politicians to be photographed or associated with white nationalists. They did so without the prospect of being shamed into resignation by Canadian media. Mohamed was interested in writing a column specifically calling out Kerry Diotte, Member of Parliament for Edmonton Griesbach, and I recommended he broaden the scope to include other politicians, lest the pitch come off as a vendetta column and not cogent political analysis.

In both of these instances, and other conversations I’ve had with writers of colour lately, I did what I promised myself I would never do as a Black writer with a platform, which was to play the role of gatekeeper. I told myself that I was looking for angles that could find a foot through the door of the notoriously white-centred Canadian media. In reality, I had been cowed by hate groups and their enablers in my industry into silence, and I was unconsciously passing on the memo to others.

In January, after I wrote a column asserting the MAGA hat is a symbol of hate, a deluge of racist emails poured into my inbox. Normally I expect hate mail whenever I write about right-wing white populism, but this was not long after I’d received death threats (that, strangely enough, stemmed from another article I’d written years ago), so something about this iteration of being called a “subhuman,” a “savage,” and a “n–ger piece of s–t” got under my skin. It was followed by a brigade of harassment spurred by a Rebel Media reporter (with his own ties to white nationalism), who took one of my tweets and turned it into a streeter for Yellow Vest supporters in Sudbury.

I’ve spoken often with my fiance, family members, and friends about prioritizing my family’s safety over writing and community work. We’ve been recognized in public and approached, and while it’s so far been in a friendly manner, the threats and hate mail I’ve received are never far from the imagination when a stranger comes up to us to say hello. The thing is, while my fiance, children, and I are quite obviously Black (and therefore potential targets for hate crime), we’re also Christians. Our racialization isn’t further complicated by visible markers of religious affiliation—she doesn’t wear a hijab, and I don’t wear a topi cap. My beard grows free and styled according only to my own tastes. Nobody bats an eyelash when we say grace before meals when we dine out.

This isn’t the case for Bashir and other members of the Somali community in Edmonton, a city which is quickly becoming a cancerous node in the spread of overt white supremacy throughout Canada. This also isn’t the case for someone like Ginella Massa, a visibly Muslim anchor for CityNews Toronto, who recently needed to ask security to escort her to her vehicle after a Peterborough-based neo-Nazi made a “hypothetical” open call for the killing of media figures and anti-racism organizations. It wasn’t the case for the Muslim family confronted by a drunk and belligerent white man at Toronto’s Harbourfront, who shouted slurs and told them to “get out of my province,” nor for a Muslim man subjected to a “citizens arrest” on the way out of a London-area Sobeys.

I’ve been occupied with cowardice because, in the wake of the most deadly shooting in New Zealand history, I have shrunk back from my responsibility as a journalist to swing the glare of public discourse towards hatemongers, as well as their enablers in media and government. This is something I profoundly regret.

But there’s a different metric at work when it isn’t your own safety, your family’s, or that of your community consistently on the line. Too many of my white colleagues in journalism still seem to believe their profession and the assumed stance of objectivity places them at a distance from white supremacy.

This, to me, is a different tier of moral cowardice.

A week after Ginella Massa tweeted about the threat of white supremacist violence making it unsafe to leave her workplace without security, PEGIDA (a German-based anti-Muslim political movement) organized a march in downtown Toronto. A CityNews reporter assigned to cover the event, Pam Seatle, found herself confronted (and even followed) by anti-racist protesters to the march, who shouted her for “giving a platform to fascists.” In response, Seatle tweeted “I felt more threatened by them than any of the so called ‘dangerous violent racists.’ ”

The tweet was hastily deleted, probably wisely so. A cornerstone of white supremacist politics is the purported defence of the purity of white women from foreign savages, and PEGIDA supporters have been fairly busy promoting the falsehood that refugees from Africa and the Middle East are essentially roving gangs of rapists. According to PEGIDA’s own philosophy, a white woman like Seatle is the utmost protected class—of course they mean her no harm. The same cannot be said for nonwhites, including her own colleagues.

While Seatle may have had cause to feel unsafe in the moment she was followed by protesters, the fact is, she was covering the march of an organization whose founder, a man who calls refugees “cattle” and filth, was found guilty by a German court for inciting racial hatred. It was not only Seatle’s decision to attend and cover the rally from a rather slanted angle, calling out the protesters’ lack of decorum, but the choice of her news department to approve the segment, if not covering PEGIDA’s rally (and the counter-rally) to begin with.

In Alberta, the United Conservative Party continually finds itself dealing with members who espouse bigoted views (including the recent resignation of Calgary-Mountain View candidate Caylan Ford and Calgary-South East candidate Eva Kiryakos), or have direct ties to white supremacist organizations. For his part, Kenney himself repeatedly reminds people why his reputation for homophobia was well-earned. Yet Kenney and his party somehow continue to deliver press conferences and policy announcements without being pressured to answer how the party could possibly serve all Albertans when bigotry has so clearly infected its ranks.

The people behind the bylines and headlines in Alberta’s media class are, as with the rest of the country, very white. They carry with them the sensibilities that often insulate white supremacy, even if inadvertently (as with the Calgary Herald headline that uncritically repeated Kiryakos’s claim that she was the victim of a ‘smear’ campaign). That is, of course, when they aren’t outright mainstreaming white supremacist smear campaigns against refugees in European countries, as talk radio host and former Wildrose Party leader Danielle Smith recently did during a segment on her program. This is an endless source of frustration for the communities of colour in the province, and across Canada, as we are perpetually dragged back to the same naïve and uncomplicated conversations about racism, even as our communities increasingly come under attack.

When infamous white nationalist Faith Goldy carried her message into the Toronto mayoral election, and was photographed not only with members of the Toronto Police Service, but also the premier of Ontario, neither the leadership of the Toronto Police nor the premier offered an apology or rebuked Goldy directly. Instead, Ford tweeted a condemnation of “hate speech” and “anti-Semitism” should it happen to issue from Goldy “or anyone else.”

And that was that—Ford has more or less moved on from having anything to do with white nationalism (often due to his tendency to surround himself with sycophants of all colours). While his party continues its agenda of governance-by-spite, and while he heralded the arrival of the Yellow Vests’ so-called “convoy” to Ontario, Premier Ford is able to show his face in public without the prospect of being questioned by Queen’s Park reporters just why racism seems to follow him around like a noxious cloud.

Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer has also surrendered political principles for the bigot’s vote, presiding over a party willing to virtue-signal anti-immigrant sentiment to supporters whose “Canada First” mantra places them firmly in our country’s white nationalist tradition. There was the empty grandstanding around and misrepresentation of the UN Migration Pact, often reported by media as if the pact were legitimate cause for sovereign concern, with only a nod to the fact that the pact is non-binding. There was also an infamous tweet sent out by the party, meant to stoke further fear and paranoia over asylum-seekers crossing into Canada from the U.S., that just so happened to echo this country’s history of migration pessimism where Black refugees are involved.

Despite this abysmal record, Scheer is given leave to credibly present the Conservatives as a viable governing party that will act in all Canadians’ interests, while retaining the services of staffers who include Georgeanne Burke (who co-founded a political organization which, regardless of its stated purpose, effectively keeps the fear of Sharia in the headlines of right-wing publications) and Hamish Marshall (a former corporate director at Rebel Media). Scheer doesn’t acknowledge the problem of white nationalism in Canada, or within the party ranks, because there is no media pressure on him to do so. Not even when he speaks at the same Ottawa rally promoted and attended by far-right hate groups. That’s simply not the way things are done in this country.

Scheer’s tolerance for subordinates blowing the dog’s whistle is not limited to his office, but has trickled down to regional MPs such as Kerry Diotte, himself a former journalist. In 2017, Diotte tweeted a picture of himself with Faith Goldy, lauding her efforts to “Make the Media Great Again.” The tweet remains on Diotte’s Twitter timeline. When this was called out by Bashir Mohamed as an endorsement of racism, Diotte’s lawyers sent him a letter threatening legal action. Additionally, Diotte filed a lawsuit against The Gateway, a student newspaper at the University of Alberta, which is, to date, the only media organization to pull together his history of dog-whistle politics (which includes tweeting a picture of a “Liberal Buzz Word Bingo card,” including the words “indigenous” and “Syrians,” for which he later apologized).

In a private conversation with a white journalism colleague, I discussed Diotte’s litigiousness against his critics, as well as the picture he took with Goldy. That colleague, as with others, could not be convinced that Diotte’s picture was a problem, as Goldy’s full-bore descent into racism apparently didn’t take place before her trip in 2017 to Charlottesville, Virginia*. Even though her Rebel segments, designed to stoke white paranoia against nonwhite immigrant populations, long preceded that.

It seems that, no matter the amount of evidence pointing towards a problem with white nationalism in our political ranks, white journalists will quickly get on code to inform those of us (who are the most likely targets of white supremacist violence) where the line is to be drawn in naming that problem. In fact, it seems the only figure in Canadian politics who is consistently problematized as entertaining white nationalist sentiment is Maxime Bernier. And this is a man who is, for the most part, dismissed as a buffoonish and aggrieved crank with no viable base outside of the alt-right.

Again and again this happens in Canada, where political figures and movements flirt openly with the very same white nationalist figures and rhetoric that have been cited by multiple anti-racism organizations as catalysts for the surge in hate crimes and mass violence in recent years. But they are only held to account by journalists for as long as their latest faux-pas can carry a headline. After the news cycle has passed, we’re back to square one. This interminable loop not only puts the onus of writing and talking about this problem on journalists of colour, but exposes us and our communities to the opprobrium, and too often the violence, that is increasingly being legitimized under the shifting auspices of normal political dialogue and free speech in this country.

I may have been a coward in failing to speak up when my brothers in Edmonton asked me to say something, or help them find a platform to say something themselves. At the same time, I have thousands of fellow travellers in Canadian media who are not only insulated from white nationalist violence by dint of their political views, but by the fact their whiteness too often qualifies them as Canadian, without question.

Old stock, if you will.

There should, therefore, be thousands of helping hands willing to break this media cycle on white nationalism. But there are hardly any to be found. Instead, we’re faced with a wall of white silence, as if the wave of hate crimes and terrorism in recent years hasn’t been aided by the bigoted rhetoric from acquaintances and even family members they’ve muted in group chats.

Already, we are moving towards the typical both-sides conversation that swings the glare away from white supremacists, and back towards establishing terror-inducing violence as the sole province of people of colour. The expressions of horror and sympathy for the victims of the shooting in Christchurch are quickly fading; the platitudes for peace and tolerance were forgotten almost immediately. As always happens with this sort of thing, enough temporal distance from a terrorist incident causes the incandescent urgency of confronting white supremacist violence to gutter out.

The question I would pose to my professional colleagues, then, is this: knowing that your co-workers, your peers, and people you claim to be your friends are facing danger in our homes, in the streets, and in our places of worship, what will it take for you to do something?

Because our cancerous political climate, and all of the attendant bigotry that arrived with it, is what happens when you do nothing.

Tory MP Luc Berthold shot back at China during a meeting Friday of the House of Commons agriculture committee in Ottawa.

The committee is debating a Conservative motion to compel testimony from Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland, International Trade Minister Jim Carr and Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau to address what they say is a broader political crisis with China that’s affecting the livelihoods of Canadian farmers.

China’s decision to ban $2 billion worth of Canadian exports is widely seen as retaliation for Canada’s arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of the founder of telecom giant Huawei, at the behest of the United States.

WATCH: Canada’s canola industry calls on government for help

Saskatchewan Conservative MP Randy Hoback said the cabinet ministers need to provide “comfort” to farmers that they will have a market to sell to this fall.

China says it has found hazardous organisms in the shipments of two major canola exporters, Richardson International Ltd. and Viterra, Inc.

China was infuriated by Meng’s Dec. 1 arrest on a U.S. extradition warrant alleging fraud.

Nine days after Meng’s arrest, China imprisoned two Canadians — ex-diplomat Michael Kovrig and the entrepreneur Michael Spavor — and accused them of violating China’s national security.

The Canadian Chamber of Commerce says China’s decision has no basis in scientific fact.

WATCH: Canada considering delegation to China to discuss canola ban, Trudeau says

Mark Agnew, senior director of international policy for the chamber, says he trusts the assessments by Health Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency that Canada’s crop is safe.

Agnew, however, stopped short of linking the arrest with the canola issue.

“When you look at the numbers the canola industry has put out, there’s a massive market here that looks like it’s being shut off for Canadian canola exporters,” Agnew said Friday in an interview.”

READ MORE: China yet to explain why it blocked canola imports from Winnipeg company: trade minister

“We trust what Health Canada and CFIA say about the safety of Canadian exports. It’s quite easy to see there’s not a science-based justification for what China is doing to Canadian canola exports.”

Berthold denounced the Chinese complaints about the quality of Canadian canola.

“To claim the canola sent to China didn’t meet quality standards is completely absurd,” said Berthold.

“We need a solution fast.”

China is the recipient of about 40 per cent of Canada’s exports of canola seed. China is the only country to raise a technical issue with the product.

The Canadian canola industry is urging Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to press China for solutions.

WATCH: Trudeau says government reaching out to those effected by canola imports

Canadian farmers say China’s ban has created uncertainty ahead of the spring planting season. Along with the Canola Council of Canada, they are calling on the government to send a delegation to China to address the issue.

Earlier this week, Trudeau mentioned the possibility of sending a delegation to China, as he defended the quality control of the product as “top-notch and world-class.”

Hoback warned that unless the government can repair the damaged relationship with China other sectors could be vulnerable to retaliation, including maple syrup or seafood.

Earlier this week, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China’s actions on canola were “scientific and reasonable.”

Without mentioning Huawei directly, Geng said China hopes Canada can “get along with us to ensure the sound and steady development of China-Canada relations.”

Geng said Canada should “take practical measures to correct the mistakes it made earlier” in the bilateral relationship.",Conservatives call for quick solution to China’s ban on Canadian canola,Global News,https://globalnews.ca/news/5110951/canola-ban-conservatives-china-canada/

MajaZdanowski told CBC Toronto the rejection wasn't because of the film's content. Her first feature-length film, In God I Trust, focuses on racism, religion and gun violence in the United States and had been accepted to the Beijing International Film Festival.

Zdanowski said she went from being excited to devastated in the span of 48 hours.

""It would have been an amazing opportunity for me to showcase the talent that we have here in Canada,"" the independent filmmaker said.

I want people to know that art and filmmaking and expressing yourself should have nothing to do with what's happening with political tensions between countries. - Maja Zdawnowski

Zdanowski's rejection comes during a tense time for Canada-China relations. Recently, China halted canola shipments from this country and detained two Canadians working abroad — moves that came after Canadian authorities detained Meng Wanzhou, the vice-president of the Chinese technology firm Huawei.

In the first email exchange viewed by CBC Toronto, one of the film festival's organizers said they liked Zdanowski's film and apologized for having to remove it from the festival, but only said it was due to ""political reasons.""

In a follow-up email Friday afternoon, they provided a more thorough explanation:

""We like this film very much. We have made every effort, but as you know, the censorship in China is very strict and the standards are constantly changing. We tried many ways to get the film through, but failed. It's not the film itself that has political problems, it's going abroad (I'm sure you've heard about Huawei). So we are very sorry.""

CBC Toronto has also reached out to the Chinese consulate for more information about why the film was pulled.

'My passion is telling stories'

In God I Trust follows three people in a small town in northern Idaho whose stories become intertwined. It touches on heavy subjects like racism, religion and politics.

Zdanowski self-funded the film.

""I just don't understand why they would accept and then deny, because it has nothing to do with the actual film itself,"" she said.

""My passion is telling stories, and it shouldn't be stopped because of some political tensions between countries,"" she said.

'The bilateral relationship is still very, very tense'

Lynette Ong, an associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto and an expert on China and southeast Asia, said was likely canceled not because of its subject matter, but because the festival organizers feared backlash from the central government for including a Canadian film.

""[Local agencies] are afraid of the authorities. They do not want to be seen as doing anything that may defy central orders because they want to protect their own position, otherwise they might be punished if this is seen as an act of defiance,"" she said.

Due to ongoing political tensions, Wong says Canadians working in China or with Chinese organizations may continue to encounter issues.

""Any Canadians who [are] thinking about doing things in China should be prepared for this sort of nuisance when the bilateral relationship is still very, very tense,"" she said.

Zdanowski says her experience as an immigrant — she was born in Poland before her family was forced to flee to Austria, then South Africa and finally Canada — inspired her film.

She's still eager for it to be seen.

In God I Trust has been accepted into several other festivals, including the Beverly Hills Film Festival and European Independent Film Festival in Paris.

But Zdanowski says she's still disappointed politics appear to have blocked a wider release.

Last week, board members, employees and executive spoke about the exciting plans ahead for Stampede Park; the strategic plan for both the Stampede and the new BMO Centre and in general spoke about the strong consensus among all of the Stampede leadership regarding the future of that organization.

I have often referred to the Calgary Stampede as being “not an event but a culture,” and in so many ways, it is a culture that our entire community can be proud of.

One of the most positive aspects of the meeting I attended is the respect that all volunteers, employees and board members have for each other, and the smooth transition of leadership without acrimony.

Contrast that to what we are seeing in our own province these days. Individuals calling each other “liars or racists or incompetent” and it gets worse from there. Is this what Canadian democracy has become — insults over policies and a stream of personal attacks over planning substance.

I cannot imagine what you might drum up if you went back to my 20s and tried to repeat some of the things I said when I was a young man, yet individuals are constantly attacked for what they might have said or done in their youth. Wisdom may not come with maturity, in fact, I am pretty sure that it does not. But maturity does bring a certain amount of realization that what we believed to be absolutely true when we were 20 often proves to be absolutely incorrect when we have the chance to look back over time.

For many years, I have said that we should all have respect for anyone who runs for office. Without people willing to put their names forward for political service, we cannot have a democracy. I have never forgotten the words of the late energy minister Merv Leitch, speaking at a Rotary Club meeting, many years ago. “Canada is unique in the world in the fact that the amount of corruption, self-interest and dishonest action by politicians is undoubtedly the lowest by far of any country on earth,” he said.

I still believe that to be the case, and while I do not endorse much of what is often proposed, I am still naive enough to believe that our political leaders put forward ideas and concepts that they personally believe are the best for their constituents.

With that in mind, I sincerely wish that the discourse in these election battles focus more on policy and much less on personal insults and attacks. I still believe Canada is a special place, a place of tolerance, adaptation and peace.

There is a reason that we call our Parliament buildings the Peace Tower and there are even more reasons why our Constitution calls for “Peace, Order and Good Government.” I still believe that most politicians deserve a “thank you for your service” rather than an attack or insult and that politicians themselves, should be looking for ways to reach more consensus in their strategic plans rather than trying to bounce us from one extreme position to another based on their feelings that they need to score big political points with their political base.

I would urge every single person running for office to bear in mind that at the end of the day, we are all Canadians, we all have a “Canadian way” of conducting ourselves and that if the politics of the day are reduced to nothing more than a series of personal attacks and personal insults, it will only result in an even further loss of respect and an even further reduction in our ability to function as a country or as a province.

“This was the first movie I’ve ever directed,” Zdanowski, 38, told the Star. She’s a former Vancouver resident who recently moved to Toronto. “It was a chance to showcase a Canadian film to a huge Chinese audience. And then, within a span of 48 hours, it got taken away.

The letter promised to cover Zdanowski’s airfare and hotel costs, a benefit worth thousands of dollars. Less than two days later, she received a one-line email from the festival rescinding the invitation, saying that “because of the politics we can’t receive the Canada film (sic) this year.” While Zdanowski attempted to puzzle out the meaning of that, an email arrived Friday afternoon. It blamed the reversal on the ongoing feud between Canada and China, sparked by the arrest in Vancouver last December of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Chinese tech giant Huawei. The arrest, made on behalf of the U.S. Justice Department, has caused a rift in Canada-China relations that has threatened trade in canola, seafood — and now film, too. A Beijing Film Fest spokesperson named Songke told Zdanowski in an email that although China has strict censorship rules, there’s nothing in the film — a tense race relations drama set in Northern Idaho — that would have prevented the festival from screening it.

“We like this film very much,” Songke wrote. “We have made every effort … It’s not the film itself that has political problems, it’s going abroad (I’m sure you heard about Huawei). So we are very sorry.”

Songke closed by offering to recommend In God I Trust to other Chinese film festivals “when the environment improves.” Zdanowski said she appreciates the candour of the Beijing officials, but she’s unhappy to have been drawn into a battle that’s not of her making. “I kind of feel bad for the festival. They really liked my film and they were really supportive of it. They tried to push the film to go through, but it just got denied.” In God I Trust has been well received by other festivals around the world. It had its world premiere in December at the Whistler Film Festival in B.C., which has a trailer for it still on its website. Zdanowski has also taken her film to the Omaha Film Festival and next week will screen it at the Beverly Hills Film Festival, ironically at the TCL Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Blvd. In God I Trust had been submitted to the Beijing fest by Telefilm Canada, a Crown corporation that helps fund and promote Canadian productions. But Telefilm says there’s little it can do in this case. “We aren’t implicated in the festival’s programming decisions, but simply facilitate the submissions of Canadian films,” said Telefilm spokesperson Andréane Leblanc in an email. She was speaking on behalf of Francesca Accinelli, Telefilm’s national promotions and communications director. “This process is managed between the festival and the film teams. We therefore do not have any more details to provide on this particular case.” Attempts to reach spokespersons for the Beijing International Film Festival and the Chinese embassy in Ottawa were unsuccessful.

In a report issued this week, Al Mussell, research lead at Agri-Food Economic Systems in Guelph, Ont., noted that an outbreak of African Swine Fever (ASF) in China is also disrupting the global meat supply.

“We’re in uncharted waters,” Mussell said. “We’ve never had a structural bull market in agricultural products led by the protein complex, while at the same time experiencing an opposite trend in oilseed.”

Generic lean hog futures have shot up 40 per cent since the beginning of March as a result of the outbreak, one that could wipe out seven million sows according to Rabobank estimates cited by Mussell.

“There’s not enough meat in the world to fill the Chinese pork shortage that’s coming this year,” Mussell said, predicting that the demand for all kinds of meat would rise as a result.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency says ASF is a highly contagious viral disease of domestic and wild pigs. It causes high death rates in infected pigs and can infect swine herds in various ways. There is no treatment.

Mussell said that swine populations in other countries, including Canada, are at risk of infection and that the disease has already spread to Vietnam, Russia and some Eastern European and African countries.

There’s not enough meat in the world to fill the Chinese pork shortage that’s coming this year Al Mussell

According to a Bloomberg News report, China may increase U.S. pork imports to a record 300,000 metric tonnes in 2019 as part of a commitment to increase American farm imports to resolve the trade war – 81 per cent more than the 166,000 tons in 2017.

But Pan Chenjun, an analyst at Rabobank International in Hong Kong, noted that increased U.S. pork imports alone would not be enough to offset China’s shortage.

“All protein imports may rise,” as a result, she told Bloomberg.

Ray Price, president of Sunterra Farms in Acme, Alberta, is worried about ASF.

“The biggest risk is people bringing meat into Canada,” he said. “But we have a very high standard of health and biosecurity in this country.”

While the swine flu outbreak poses risks, high pork prices could also create an opportunity Mussell said, and bring about investment in pork production in China and Canada.

“This is an incredible earning opportunity for hog producers and processors,” he said.

That comes in contrast to the potential bear market in oil seeds.

On March 22, the Chinese Government placed a ban on all Canadian canola imports, with both Viterra Inc. and James Richardson International having their canola importing permits suspended for unspecified reasons.

According to the Canola Council, Canada produces 18 million tonnes annually — 10 per cent of which is exported. Approximately 40 per cent of Canadian exports go to China.

Mussell said farmers will need to rotate to different crops.

“This would increase the supply of wheat and other grains at a time when China is drawing down its supply of rice, which will lower the demand for imported feed grains.”

Jay Schultz, co-owner of a 7,000-acre Alberta grain farm, said the Canadian grain sector is in for a rough ride.

“Normally markets are driven by fundamentals, charts, supply and demand — now it might be politics,” he said.

“Right now, we should be locking in new crop pricing for harvest,” he said. “And we haven’t signed futures contracts for next year yet – something we normally do.”

Schultz explained that many farmers have already purchased seed, equipment and chemicals.

“It’s hard to change at this point,” he said.

“No one can, with a straight face, tell us that Canadian steel and aluminum pose a threat to American national security,” said federal Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland after a meeting in Washington March 25, as she attempts to get a deal headed to Congress for approval.

“I made the case to ambassador Lighthizer that these tariffs are completely unacceptable to Canada … to impose these tariffs on steel and aluminum on national security grounds is illegal, unjustified and frankly completely absurd,” she said.

Freeland was fresh from a meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, where the two spent most of their time discussing that issue in the face of attempting to ratify last year’s three-nation trade deal.

“These tariffs cause many questions about ratifying NAFTA under these conditions…. Many Canadians feel this NAFTA is a free trade deal with the United States. All countries made some compromises to make this deal and in order to move ahead with that deal, the right thing is there should be no 232-tariffs or retaliatory measures between our three countries,” said Freeland.

The U.S. imposed its Section 232 tariffs for steel and aluminum a year ago to create advantages for its domestic producers on the grounds of protecting national security, while leveraging negotiations around the renewal of NAFTA. A program to lift tariffs on the two metals from Canada and Mexico was linked to the renegotiation of the NAFTA but did not make it through that process. Both Canada and Mexico have told U.S. lawmakers that it must be removed for the new NAFTA to be completed.

Freeland said she knows Canada’s retaliatory measures on $16 billion of targeted trade are hurting American businesses. These include import surtaxes on many steel and aluminum products, as well as agriculture and food products, such as processed meats, and many paper items.

Canadian farm equipment manufacturers say they are having to increase equipment and building prices as a result of the effects of the 232 tariffs (see our story on page 1 in this edition of The Western Producer), which have driven up prices for the American metal they have to buy.

Several U.S. lawmakers have said they did not believe the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, or CUSMA as it is known in Canadian legislation, could be ratified by the U.S. Congress if the metals tariffs along with retaliatory duties on American farm and other products were left in place.

The U.S administration has sought quotas on steel and aluminum in lieu of tariffs, but Canada and Mexico have resisted these, arguing that their metals pose no threat to U.S. national security.

Moscow that implicates and embarrasses much of the new country’s political leadership. Adamonis’ counter-intelligence coup burnishes his ...","Very much in the tradition of the Cold War spy and espionage novels of writers such as John Le Carré or even Graham Greene, Provisionally Yours relays the story of a Lithuanian expat soldier named Justas Adamonis. He is returning to the country in the wake of Czarist Russia’s collapse after the First World War and the creation at Versailles of the modern-day Lithuanian state after centuries of its being controlled by Russia or Poland.

In the afterword of his new book Provisionally Yours , Lithuanian Canadian novelist Antanas Sileika observes how his native land was, for much of its modern existence, poised perilously between the “hammer of Germany and the anvil of the Soviet Union.” With the sabre-rattling, Crimea-annexing antics of Russian president Vladimir Putin currently destabilizing the Baltic region, Lithuanians both at home and abroad are once again fearful about their country’s future and its sovereignty. This makes Sileika’s new novel very timely indeed.

Kaunas becomes the new provisional capital of the country — Vilnius, its real capital, remains in Poland. After the Great War, the boundaries of many European states were in flux. Almost as soon as Adamonis disembarks in Kaunas, he is press-ganged into becoming the director of military intelligence. What ensues is his discovery of a smuggling scam between Berlin and Moscow that implicates and embarrasses much of the new country’s political leadership. Adamonis’ counter-intelligence coup burnishes his reputation and, with his newly acquired celebrity/notoriety, he is on a fast track to leading one of the landmark events in modern Lithuanian history: the liberation of the Lithuanian French-occupied seaport city of Klaipeda.

Adamonis’ motivation for this risky raid is personal as well as political. Early in the story, he falls in love with his beautiful American cousin, Lily, who recently returned to her native land with her blueblood diplomat husband in tow. Divorce is out of the question in Catholic Lithuania, but not in its soon-to-be liberated protestant province. Once Klaipeda is free of the French, Lily could divorce her husband and marry Adamonis. But love and politics form a toxic brew in Provisionally Yours and happy endings, it seems, are better suited to romantic novellas than espionage thrillers. I’ll leave the fate of our star-crossed lovers for intrepid readers to uncover for themselves.

Sileika’s novel is based on actual events in Lithuania’s often tragic modern day history. The Justas Adamonis character is modelled loosely, Sileikas notes in his afterword, on a man named Jonas Budrys who reached his apotheosis as the liberator of Klaipeda and ended his days as a chicken farmer in New Jersey.

Beinisch was Israel’s first female state attorney and the first woman ...","An independent judiciary is critical to upholding minority rights, yet Israel’s strong court system is under attack from many of the country’s political elite, according to Supreme Court Justice Rosalie Abella and Dorit Beinisch, the former president of the Israeli Supreme Court, who took part in a panel discussion in Toronto.

Over 650 people gathered at Beth Tzedec synagogue on March 24, to hear the two speak about the role that courts play in a free and democratic society.

The event was one of a number that are being held to mark the retirement of the synagogue’s senior rabbi, Baruch Frydman-Kohl, who will step down this summer after 26 years on the job.

The justices both stressed how important it is for the courts to remain independent from politics. In democracies, political pressure will, by definition, generally come from the majority. But it is incumbent upon the courts to protect the rights of the minorities, they argued.

“If you parse democracy as what it is, the most important part of democracy is having somebody there to say, ‘Majority, no. What you’re trying to do is bad for society,’ ” said Abella, before listing multiple countries where authoritarian regimes have been validated by majorities at the ballot box.

“It’s happening all over the world and we’re supposed to say it’s none of our business.… We already saw in our lifetime the consequences of ignoring that,” she continued, to applause. “We will not be silenced by people who say it’s none of your business. It is all of our business.”

Beinisch and Abella both have impressive resumes, even for Supreme Court justices. Abella became the youngest judge in Canadian history in 1976 and was the first Jewish woman to serve on the Supreme Court. Beinisch was Israel’s first female state attorney and the first woman to be appointed president of the Israeli Supreme Court.

Beinisch joked that she only became a judge because other political players didn’t want her around once her term as state attorney came to an end. “They thought the quickest way to (remove) my influence there is to send me to the Supreme Court,” she said.

The two justices also spoke about the difference between the judicial system in Canada, where commentators and politicians may disagree with a ruling but respect the institution that administered it, and Israel, where politicians are actively trying to undermine the independence of the court.

“The Israeli court became very strong in the eyes of politicians because of its independence, because we really don’t have to be popular in very difficult situations – when the state fights terror, when we have so many problems,” said Beinisch. “This is a tension that we know everywhere. The situation in Israel became more and more difficult.”

For example, Israeli politicians Nafatali Bennett and Ayelet Shaked want to curb the power that the country’s courts have over the Israel Defence Forces.

Abella said that she admires her colleagues who work in the Israeli judicial system, because they are able to do their jobs with so many external forces working against them.

“The Israeli supreme court is under regular and constant siege, rhetorical siege, from people who are trying to undermine its legitimacy, precisely because it’s doing its job properly and trying to make sure that the country’s feet stay close to the fire of morality and values that they started with,” she said.

Abella gave a lecture in Jerusalem in April 2018 on the independence of Israel’s courts that touched on many of the same themes as her panel discussion with Beinisch.

“Patriotism means upholding the values on which your country is based. Those values in Israel are Jewish and democratic. They include respect for human rights, tolerance, equality and dignity. That is what being patriotic means. Yet in championing those values, the Israeli judiciary finds itself demonized by some for being independent from political expedience and immune to political will,” Abella said in her lecture last year.

Throughout the evening, Abella and Beinisch constantly found themselves echoing each other’s points on the importance of a strong and independent judiciary that protects the rights of minorities.

“You know, we are not the best panel, because we agree on everything,” Beinisch joked at one point.

“That’s my favourite kind of panel,” replied Abella.","Panel hears Canadian, Israeli supreme court justices",Canadian Jewish News,https://www.cjnews.com/news/canada/panel-hears-canadian-israeli-supreme-court-justices

Polls suggest the United Conservative Party is on course to win power in the province, Canada’s energy center, capitalizing on voter concerns about a struggling economy and lack of progress on new oil export pipelines.

However, UCP leader Jason Kenney, a former federal cabinet minister, polls behind New Democrat Party Premier Rachel Notley on a number of personal attributes such as honesty, likeability and trustworthiness, and is embroiled in a scandal over his successful party leadership bid in 2017.

Notley, whose late father led the NDP from 1968-1984, is polling well ahead of her party and seeking to profit from that edge.

To overcome that, the UCP is focusing on Trudeau, with repeated references to “the Notley-Trudeau alliance,” emphasizing her one-time close relationship with the prime minister, while images of their own leader are less visible.

Trudeau is an unpopular figure in Alberta, where many feel he failed to support the energy industry. The prime minister also faces a political scandal on whether he unduly pressured Canada’s former justice minister.

“If you look at the signs the NDP are putting up, their logos are not very prevalent, it’s all Rachel Notley,” said Gregory Jack, vice president at polling firm Ipsos. “The UCP signs are all about the UCP and their brand, and underplaying their leader to a certain extent.”

The UCP’s focus on Justin Trudeau may be effective with older Alberta voters who remember the unpopular National Energy Program in 1980, an effort by his prime minister father, Pierre Trudeau, that sought to give Ottawa more control over the oil and gas industry and a higher share of revenues.

“(The UCP) spin on it is Alberta has been mistreated by a Liberal government and the son of another prime minister who did not treat Alberta well,” said Jared Wesley, a political science professor at the University of Alberta.

Alberta’s energy industry contributes C$80 billion a year to Canada’s economy, but opposition from other provinces has shut down new pipelines like TransCanada Corp’s Energy East project and helped stall the Trans Mountain expansion plan.

Congestion on existing pipelines out of landlocked Alberta left crude bottlenecked in storage tanks and sent prices spiraling to record lows last year, prompting the NDP to mandate temporary crude production cuts.

Alberta has posted budget deficits since global oil prices started tumbling in 2014, and more than C$20 billion in foreign capital has fled its energy sector since 2017.

Notley and Trudeau came to power in the same year and initially forged a close partnership aimed at pleasing the oil industry and environmental groups with a dual strategy that supported new pipelines and introduced a carbon tax.

They fell out last year over delays to the Trans Mountain expansion project. Notley’s camp downplays the relationship that the UCP is working so hard to highlight.

“The job of premier is to work with anyone who has a stake in projects like pipelines. I wouldn’t call it an alliance,” said NDP campaign spokeswoman Cheryl Oates. “A lot of people feel Jason Kenney is stuck in Ottawa trying to rehash a battle that his party lost.”

On September 17, 2018, Parliament’s first day back from summer break, Leona Alleslev, the Liberal MP from Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill, rose in the House of Commons to announce her defection from the governing Liberal Party of Canada. “The government must be challenged openly and publicly. But for me to publicly criticize the government as a Liberal would undermine the government and, according to my code of conduct, be dishonourable,” she said. “After careful and deliberate consideration, I must withdraw from the government benches to take my seat among the ranks of my Conservative colleagues.”

New to politics when she was first elected in 2015, Alleslev is a hard-nosed and plain-spoken air force veteran. Before her dramatic exit, her time in office had been somewhat unexceptional, save for her early career appointment as parliamentary secretary to public-services and procurement minister Judy Foote—a notable promotion for a rookie MP. Still, she was, until she switched sides, little known outside of political and military circles.

The media immediately scoured her social media for signs of dissent but turned up nothing—no instances of serious disagreement with the party, no off-the-cuff clashes with Liberal colleagues, no pretension of sticking it to the man for the sake of her constituents. Rather, by all appearances, Alleslev had fallen in line with the party. Throughout her tenure, she offered reassurances that team Trudeau was on the right track. In July, two months before switching sides, she fawned over the prime minister, foreign-affairs minister Chrystia Freeland, and defence minister Harjit Sajjan in a private email, calling them “truly awesome.” Nine days later, she praised Trudeau’s leadership at a fundraising event.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer wasted no time taking advantage of her move. “For all those Canadians who supported Justin Trudeau in 2015 and are dissatisfied or even angry about the leadership that he’s been giving,” he told a room full of reporters, “the Conservative Party needs you.” He had apparently forgiven her previous anti-Conservative criticism. During a 2015 election debate in her riding, Alleslev lamented having watched the country under Stephen Harper “become something I barely recognize—socially, politically, economically, and internationally.” But the Trudeau government, in the end, apparently fared just as poorly in Alleslev’s eyes. Bidding adieu to her fellow caucus members, she referenced wide-ranging failures on tax reform, trade, foreign policy, defence, and security. She assured everyone who asked that it was never only one issue.

The act of switching teams requires a flexibility uncommon among twenty-first-century politicians. Alleslev considers herself among that rare breed of lawmaker. “As a member of Parliament, it’s my job to listen to everybody,” she told me. “I’m not sure that’s always the most widely held opinion.” She sees in modern politics a tendency to characterize all debate as conflict and worries about where that will lead. “If you look where we are, not only in Canada but in the world, where we’re becoming far more divided, far less able to have conversations with those that we have differing opinions with, we’re at risk of losing the value of debate.”

The resignations of two high-profile cabinet ministers over the Liberals’ mishandling of the SNC-Lavalin affair have since brought the question of debate within parties into greater focus. Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former justice minister and attorney general, and Jane Philpott, the former Treasury Board president, two of Trudeau’s most respected ministers, brazenly stood against the prime minister and his office and still remain in the Liberal caucus. Their actions lend credibility to Alleslev’s story while undermining the necessity of her departure. She chose to keep her quarrels with the party silent, she says, because dissenting openly would jeopardize its ability to govern.

But, in keeping quiet for so long, Alleslev has opened herself up to accusations of political opportunism. “Did you put your finger in the air to see which way the wind was blowing,” pressed CTV’s Don Martin, “and figure it was going to go Conservative in 2019, so you might as well join the parade?” If she hopes to regain her seat in 2019, Alleslev will need to prove those accusations wrong. She will need to convince her supporters that switching sides was more than simply self-interested politics, despite what the opposition says. And the Liberals will come armed with stories spun by former staffers and Liberal hard-liners with an incentive to discredit her. All voters have is her word. Whether she honestly acted in their interest or not, the fallout that ensued suggests intentions are moot. Few things are as politically isolating as crossing the floor.

Since Confederation, 340 MPs have changed party affiliation, willingly or not, between elections. Those who leave tend to opt for independence, with many soon switching again to join another party or to return to their former caucus. While some forty countries have laws pertaining to crossing the floor—in most cases, defecting legislators are forced to give up their seats—there’s no federal convention, legislation, or parliamentary rule regarding it in Canada. Manitoba and New Brunswick have enacted laws forcing outgoing caucus members to sit independently for the remainder of the term. But both the Liberals and Conservatives seem less keen to hamstring members’ freedom. In 2005, the federal government defeated a bill proposing that changes in party affiliation be followed by a by-election. Similar legislation has been introduced regularly in parliamentary sessions since; all have failed to pass first reading.

However, a series of ethics inquiries suggests floor crossers came under greater scrutiny beginning in the early 2000s, as crossing grew in popularity. Some forty-four MPs switched sides between 2001 and 2005, which, according to a 2006 study, outpaced the previous eighty-year average of twenty-three crossings per decade. In 2005, former ethics commissioner Bernard Shapiro was asked to determine whether a member had contravened the Conflict of Interest Code in switching parties. The following year, his attention turned to investigating Prime Minister Stephen Harper. In question was whether Harper had bribed Liberal MP David Emerson into leaving his party with the perks of a cabinet position with the Conservatives. Shapiro found no wrongdoing, but noted, “The discontent expressed by Canadians on this matter cannot be attributed merely to the machinations of partisan politics. Fairly or unfairly, this particular instance has given many citizens a sense that their vote—the cornerstone of our democratic system—was somehow devalued, if not betrayed.”

A number high-profile defections have been viewed as politically expedient, such as those of Belinda Stronach, in 2005, and Eve Adams, in 2015. Stronach left the Conservatives and was granted a cabinet seat with the Liberals, a move she made, some suspect, to help keep Paul Martin’s minority government in power ahead of two important budget votes. Adams deserted the Conservatives over their “mean-spirited leadership” six months after dropping out of a nomination-race in a new riding and was welcomed by Trudeau’s Liberals with open arms.

In Alleslev’s case, journalists and political pundits raised the possibility that she was reacting to the Ontario Liberal Party’s defeat in June 2018. During that provincial election, the riding of Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill saw Conservative Michael Parsa win by more than twice as many votes as the Liberal runner-up. By comparison, in 2014, each of the predecessor districts that now make up the new riding—Newmarket-Aurora, Oak Ridges–Markham, and Richmond Hill—had voted Liberal. The losses are notable, but they offer little insight into the projected electoral outcome for the region in October. According to the CBC, the federal party that has won the most seats in Ontario has been different in 52 percent of elections from the one currently in power provincially.

At the federal level, the ethnically diverse riding of Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill remains a toss-up between the reds and blues. It would be foolish to think Alleslev had special insight, more than one year out, into how the election will unfold. What we know is this: in Ontario, the parties have been neck and neck in the polls since early 2018, and an analysis of polling numbers by the website Calculated Politics, taken only weeks before Alleslev’s defection, projected the Conservatives were on par to win Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill by a margin of just 2 percent.

What seems to set defectors apart is an ability to exploit the divisive nature of politics today to their own advantage. It’s a quality Alleslev seems to have put to work during her 2014 nomination race. Clayton Haluza, president of the federal Liberal riding association in Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill, hadn’t the faintest idea who she was when she approached him at a fundraising event that year. Haluza found her straightforwardness refreshing for a political hopeful. But Alleslev had no ties to the Liberal party, hadn’t served in municipal politics, and wasn’t particularly involved in the community.

Alleslev’s aloofness was the result of having, as she says, “never, ever considered” a life in politics. Instead, she envisioned spending her entire career in the military—a calling she says teaches you to put country first. Her father retired as a two-star general from the Royal Canadian Air Force; his father had resisted the Nazis in Denmark as a member of the Danish underground. She came to believe that “serving one’s country is an honourable profession.” In 1991, she joined the Canadian military as a second lieutenant, logistics officer in Comox, BC, having studied history and political science at the Royal Military College in Kingston, Ontario. A decade later, following her retirement from the military, she worked as a consultant, at times within the federal government, and eventually landed in the private sector at IBM and Bombardier Aerospace.

Alleslev says it was Harper government that motivated her to join the Liberal Party in 2014. She thought their policies weren’t positioning Canada competitively and that, in contrast, the Liberals were making bold promises on everything from foreign policy to infrastructure spending, which she found appealing. Sitting in her Richmond Hill office late last year, she told me she began to sense, around four years ago, that “some pretty dramatic things” were unfolding at home and abroad. She was unsure about running for office, however, until she met Jason Cherniak, who was seeking the nomination. A lawyer based out of Richmond Hill, then in his midthirties, Cherniak was as faithful as they come: a card-carrying Liberal since high school, he went on to serve on the Young Liberals of Canada national executive and later as president of the Richmond Hill federal riding association and as president of the Liberal Party of Canada (Ontario) Central Region.

“Considering how significant the challenges facing the country and world are right now, I’m not sure he’s the right guy to represent me as a member of Parliament,” she said, thinking back. “Ah rats—I’m going to have to run.”

With existing ties to the Liberal Party, Cherniak was confident he had a shot at the nomination. But he began to suspect party upper brass were favouring Alleslev. “That part of it has been very difficult for me,” Cherniak says, “because after all these years of volunteering, I really thought that at the very least I had earned a chance at a fair race.” Alleslev had virtually no political experience, but she was a veteran and strong leader who stood in contrast to Conservative incumbent, Costas Menegakis. She played right into the optimistic, feminist narrative the Liberals were hoping to tell. As the Globe and Mail’s Adam Radwanski has noted, Trudeau “made a point of recruiting a diverse array of candidates who, despite impressive professional credentials, often did not have much partisan political experience.”

So intent was the party to win the riding that it overlooked what one former staffer now considers several “red flags.” Alleslev’s sister Caroline vied for the Conservative seat in Beaches–East York in 2008. And, throughout the nomination race, Alleslev could be found in tow of Greg Beros, a staunch Conservative and Richmond Hill city councillor. “You know that Leona’s a good, dear friend,” Beros would say when introducing her to members of local community groups. “While I can’t vote for her, because she’s with the Liberal Party, she is a great individual and would represent us well.” Beros recused himself from supporting her come the election. “Some people are candidate first, party second,” he says. “I’m always party first, candidate second.”

Alleslev succeeded at connecting with influential members of the riding’s Muslim community, whose support, both financial and otherwise, was “key to her getting the nomination,” says Haluza. She was later able to leverage constituents’ unhappiness with the Conservatives’ anti-immigrant rhetoric over “Canadian values” to garner widespread approval among members of the Muslim community. Without their support, many Liberals believe she would have lost in the general election. In the end, a combination of Alleslev’s own political abilities and the Conservatives’ hardline tactics helped mobilize the Muslim community at the polls, and she clinched the seat by fewer than 1,100 votes.

Following the win, a different picture of Alleslev began to emerge, one the Liberals could attempt to resuscitate during the upcoming election. In several instances, sources speaking on background say Alleslev was reluctant to credit the Muslim community for its role in her electoral success. This, they say, left some supporters feeling hurt and embittered. (In a request for comment, Alleslev apologized. “I like to think of myself as being sensitive,” she said. “So if I have been in any way insensitive, then I’m very sorry for that.”). According to the sources, that resentment was amplified by Alleslev’s decision to join the Conservatives, a party which has shown itself—most recently through its promise to withdraw Canada from the UN’s Global Compact for Safe, Orderly, and Regular Migration—to be less open to refugees and immigrants. In 2019, Alleslev will have to grapple with having alienated a group that fervently supported her only four years ago.

“A political party is made up of the people who are in it at the time and must be judged by what the country needs at the time,” Alleslev has said, in explanation of her actions. By this, she appears to suggest that political parties aren’t monolithic entities but rather are born out of a particular time and place and defined by their caucuses, which presumably have voters’ best interests at heart. This logic enables Alleslev to argue it’s not her principles but rather the needs of Canadians that have changed since she first entered politics.

Her position reveals a grey area, rarely acknowledged in federal politics, that can be exploited by politicians willing to see beyond fervent partisanship. The Liberals and Conservatives may have the tendency to disagree, especially during election years, and their rhetoric may be different, but their track records suggest they’re more similar than they’re wont to admit. “To this day, if you go down line by line and look at what the Conservative and Liberal party stand for,” Haluza says, “at least on paper, it’s shades of grey.”

Alleslev seems to have leveraged this dynamic to her own advantage. Justifying her defection, she accused the Liberals of failing to meet the NATO target that members spend at least 2 percent of GDP on defence, even though Trudeau campaigned on maintaining previous spending levels. The truth is, no sitting government has met NATO’s targets since they were enacted in 2006. Alleslev also rebuked the Liberals’ diplomatic track record, citing tensions with Saudi Arabia, China, and India. This critique ignores the Conservatives’ own failings, such as in 2010, when Canada was forced to withdraw from pursuing a seat on the UN Security Council, a move interpreted by an article in OpenCanada as a “stinging rebuke of Harper’s anti-UN foreign policy.” (Trudeau has pledged to vie for a seat on the council in 2020). Their similarities extend to the economy, where both parties are quick to talk about more free-trade agreements and tax relief for the middle class.

But, if the parties are so alike, why would Alleslev leave one for the other? To the former colleagues who are quick to mention Alleslev’s ambition, it’s easy to craft a tale of opportunity. Alleslev’s political career was off to a strong start when, in late 2015, she was named Foote’s parliamentary secretary. The public-services minister’s mandate included replacing the country’s fleet of aging CF-18s and supporting a national shipbuilding procurement strategy—two areas that would seem to be of strong personal interest to Alleslev. As parliamentary secretary, she supported these files. But she also worked on Phoenix, the payment system for the federal civil service, the deployment of which has been riddled with complications.

According to a 2018 Senate finance committee report, more than half of the Canadian civil service has not been properly paid since Phoenix’s implementation in 2016. The report notes that the project will likely amass $2.2 billion in unplanned costs by 2023, making it an “international embarrassment.” When questioned about Phoenix on Foote’s behalf, Alleslev would assure legislators the system would soon be fixed. But the situation remained chaotic, and following a cabinet shuffle in January 2017, she was demoted from her role as parliamentary secretary. Historically, such appointments have been used to prepare (or rather to test the readiness of) future cabinet ministers. Alleslev would later cite the Liberals’ failure to resolve Phoenix as among her reasons for leaving the party.

Throwing herself in with the Conservatives has, conveniently, allowed her to regain lost momentum. National media attention has made her a familiar face and a champion of the Conservative cause. And, with Scheer swiftly appointing her shadow cabinet secretary for global security, she has reclaimed a prominent role in the House. It may prove to be an important career pick-me-up, given that she was ousted as chair of the Canadian NATO parliamentary association one month after defecting. Like the majority of floor-crossing MPs before her, Alleslev could have ridden out her term as an independent, thereby limiting speculation on her motives, but she says she decided against it, believing that the Canadian system is not “structured for independence.” Independent members rarely sit on committees, are not recognized as often during Question Period, and lose the support of a caucus. They are, in other words, less influential.

Alleslev has always been focused on maximizing her influence. She entered politics with her mind set on transforming the country and, after three years, came to believe she couldn’t do it as a Liberal. An early party switch meant trying to make the most of what could be her last year in office, she says, noting she had the support of her family and many constituents. But it also meant alienating supporters and staff who fought to get her elected and who now have reason to want to see her lose. Later this year, they will get their say on whether her actions were genuine and, above all, justified.",The Politics of Switching Parties,The Walrus,https://thewalrus.ca/the-politics-of-switching-parties/

I love election time because I get to exercise my democratic right to vote, to have a say (well, at least a symbolic kind of say) in how our province is run. But I also hate election time because I know I’m gonna see oodles of melodramatic, fear-mongering, attack ads.



Attack ads have a long history in Canadian elections, being used by parties across the political spectrum to sling copious amounts of mud. They aren’t designed to make voters change allegiance from one party to the other; they’re primarily used to hurt morale and turnout for the opposing party. This is where my deep hatred for them lies; they don’t help people engage critically in politics, but just funnel discourse into incredibly simple good versus evil narratives.



I’ve been bombarded with the same goddamn NDP-sponsored attack ad on YouTube for an entire week. In it, the NDP attack Jason Kenney for “[stopping] dying AIDS patients from seeing their same-sex spouses in hospital.”



The issues the NDP have brought up in relation to Kenney through their attack ads are valid and important. We should be concerned about a party leader who has a track record of pushing for anti-abortion legislation and challenging the idea of same-sex rights. But we also need to be looking deeper into actual political issues facing us, which often transcend party lines due to their systemic nature.



When attack ads draw our attention away from issues and towards individuals, we get sucked into discursive spirals that can put blinders on our political outlooks. I will freely admit I’m no fan of Kenney, but I’m also no fan of Rachel Notely and her uncritical push for pipelines in the face of a global climate crisis. If I were to focus on Kenney’s unsavory traits without critically examining Notley’s negatives, what kind of responsible political actor would I be?



Attack ads just suck. Let’s leave them behind.

The Canadian dollar is drifting lower ahead of tomorrow’s release of January Gross Domestic Product data. The forecast is for a modest improvement from -0.1% to 0.0%, which in the big scheme of things, is rather pathetic. Q4 ended on an ugly note, and some analysts believe January could start similarly. Yesterday, data showed January Merchandise Trade deficit narrowing to $4.25 billion from $4.82 billion, but that was less than expected. That result suggests Q1 GDP could be a tad worse than forecast.



A drop in oil prices managed to undermine the Canadian dollar as well. WTI oil fell from a peak of $60.20 U.S./barrel to a $58.80 U.S./b on Wednesday after the Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that U.S. crude inventories rose 2.8 million barrels in the week ended March 22.



Broad-based U.S. dollar demand further eroded the Canadian dollar. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi hinted that euro-zone interest rates could stay unchanged beyond the end of 2019 which undermined EUR/USD and led to buying of U.S. dollars across the G-10 major currency spectrum. The U.S. dollar closed the Toronto trading session with small gains across the board



Overnight, FX markets were distracted by U.K. politics and wide price swings in GBP/USD. Prime Minister Theresa May’s announcement that she would resign her position if the MP’s passed her Brexit deal was initially seen as a good sign for sterling. Prices rallied to $1.3260 just before yesterday’s close. There were eight votes on a series of motions to facilitate a Brexit deal, and all of them failed miserably. GBP/USD plunged to 1.3127.



U.S./China trade talks resume in Beijing today. Analysts believe that both sides are motivated to get a draft of a deal ready to sign before China President Xi Jinping returns to the U.S. in April. There are reports that China is making concessions on key issues like forced technology transfer. More talks are scheduled next week in Washington. If the headlines suggest that the two sides are close to a deal, it could spark a shift into risk-seeking trades and give the Canadian dollar a boost, in the process.



Traders are waiting for this morning’s U.S. data which includes Q4 GDP. Analysts are forecasting growth of 2.4%, down from the 2.6% previously estimated. The weaker than expected Retail Sales data gets the blame for causing the drop.

The Canadian charter further requires a legislature to renew the declaration every five years, failing which the ...","The Legault government is about to table its long-promised bill banning the wearing of religious symbols in a number of public service jobs, most notably by teachers. The indications are that the legislation will invoke the “notwithstanding clauses” to override the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Quebec was the first jurisdiction in Canada to adopt a comprehensive charter of rights, guaranteeing in law the respect of such basic human rights as freedom of conscience, of expression, of religion, and protection against discrimination. Quebec’s lead role in anchoring these fundamental rights in law was the outgrowth, perhaps the legal culmination, of Quebec’s Quiet Revolution, with the new charter offering a bulwark against a return to the type of state activities that characterized the Duplessis era.

Through the charters, we seek to prevent the recurrence of evils such as the internment of Japanese Canadians in the West or the persecution of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Quebec, perpetrated by our own society in the not-so-distant past.

Both charters, however, allow the legislator to override protected rights by expressly declaring that a law will operate notwithstanding the charters, the so-called “notwithstanding clauses.”

There is an inherent tension, if not contradiction, in enacting a charter to protect fundamental rights from encroachment by the majority and then allowing the majority to override those rights by merely declaring that it wishes to do so.

To dissuade use of this power, the drafters provided that a law must expressly declare that it will operate notwithstanding the charter, in the hope that this would impose a political cost on a government that does so. The Canadian charter further requires a legislature to renew the declaration every five years, failing which the override ceases to have effect. This ensures that the suppression of a fundamental right will continually be put back on the political agenda.

By and large this has been successful. The notwithstanding clauses have rarely been invoked and never been renewed.

The Legault government now seems poised to invoke the notwithstanding clauses so that it may violate freedom of expression, freedom of religion and the protection against discrimination while removing recourse to the courts by the victims of those violations. This is almost breathtaking in its implications.

Premier François Legault may deny that the proposed law violates fundamental rights, or argue that the violations are minor and justified under the charters. But in our society, the courts, not Legault, must be the arbiters of what constitutes a violation of a right. Why, in the case of religious symbols only, should the state prohibit access to the courts to determine whether the measures are compatible with fundamental rights?

Also, contrary to Legault’s stated desire to deal with the issue of religious symbols once and for all, using the notwithstanding clause would ensure that the issue returns to the agenda every five years, a recipe for continuing debate and social discord.

Invoking the notwithstanding clause where fundamental freedoms are squarely at issue would normalize use of this extraordinary power and is an attack on the charters themselves.

If Quebec has moved away from Duplessis era politics, it is not because we are better than our predecessors or are no longer at risk of having a majority trammel the rights of minorities. It is because of conscious choices made to protect ourselves from such excesses. The charters are central to this. Allow them to be set aside so cavalierly, and we are all at risk.

Whatever one’s view on religious symbols, we must vigorously protest use of the notwithstanding clause to prevent access to the courts, especially by minorities, to have our rights determined and protected.

OIL – Crude Recovers Ground After Trump Puts Spotlight on OPEC

Oil had a volatile session on Thursday as supply concerns were put on the back seat as US President Donald Trump took to twitter to put pressure on the OPEC to pump more crude. The OPEC+ agreement to limit production has been the major factor behind price stability considering rising US output. This is not the first time Trump uses social media to ask oil producers to lower the price of oil by introducing more supply into the market.

Higher inventories this week piled on pressure on crude, even as the situation in Venezuela could spin out of control as blackouts and political pressure from the opposition could be the undoing of President Nicolas Maduro.

The threat of less waivers for Iranian crude purchases and longer sanctions against Venezuela will keep pushing prices higher alongside the efforts of the OPEC+ to keep soaking up excess supply with their agreement.

GOLD – Dollar Puts Pressure on Gold Ahead of Brexit and Trade Developments

Gold dropped more than 1 percent on Thursday as the US sucked the air out of the market putting pressure on the yellow metal. With the US-China trade negotiations ongoing and Brexit outcomes losing clarity by the minute the greenback was higher as investors preferred it as a safe haven above gold.







It is too early to count gold out for the week, given the British parliament could vote for the third time for Theresa May’s proposal on Friday. The British PM’s option remains the only one firmly on the table after MPs failed to reach consensus on a plan B as the factions remain too far apart to compromise.

May’s proposal despite being more tangible option, it is likely to fail, and with it Brexit itself as it opens the door for remaining if the Conservative government cannot deliver on the drawn-out process.

Morneau's office to halt the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. The ensuing political fallout has cost Trudeau two cabinet ministers -- Wilson ...","

Jordan Press and Christopher Reynolds, The Canadian Press





OTTAWA -- SNC-Lavalin warned federal prosecutors last fall about a possible plan to split the company in two, move its offices to the United States and eliminate its Canadian workforce if it didn't get a deal to avoid criminal prosecution, newly obtained documents show.

The documents, part of a PowerPoint presentation obtained by The Canadian Press, describe something called ""Plan B"" -- what Montreal-based SNC might have to do if it can't convince the government to grant a so-called remediation agreement to avoid criminal proceedings in a fraud and corruption case related to projects in Libya.

Under that plan, SNC would move its Montreal headquarters and corporate offices in Ontario and Quebec to the U.S. within a year, cutting its workforce to just 3,500 from 8,717, before eventually winding up its Canadian operations.

""The government of Canada needs to weigh the public interest impact of the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin,"" the presentation reads.

""We must humbly ask whether the public interest is served to prosecute SNC-Lavalin, and to try to achieve a guilty verdict. Such a decision would effectively lead to the end of SNC-Lavalin as we know it today and has been for more than 100 years.""

Of all the options for the future of the company, the plan in the presentation was the ""most obvious"" to follow and ""well advanced"" in terms of planning, say the documents, which the Privy Council Office confirmed receiving in late September, at the same time as prosecutors.

The company's board and senior management were prepared to quickly bundle parts of the business that had no role in the Libya case into a new entity, putting the ""trio of possibly convicted entities"" into another organization that would operate ""on a reduced business level in Canada or heading into eventual wind-up,"" they read.

The details appear to contradict public statements by chief executive officer Neil Bruce, who has denied both that the company threatened to move its headquarters, and that the company cited its some 9,000 Canadian jobs as a reason the construction giant should be granted a remediation agreement.

The company walked back the comments days later in a statement, saying a remediation deal was the best path to protect its Canadian workforce.

SNC-Lavalin spokesman Nicolas Ryan confirmed the authenticity Thursday of what he called a ""confidential document"" that was submitted to the Public Prosecution Service of Canada to allow the director of public prosecutions to consider the company's request for an agreement.

""We have always been transparent with our various stakeholders about the importance of the public interest argument/case for Canada in having a globally competitive SNC-Lavalin as part of Canada, headquartered in Montreal,"" Ryan said in a statement.

A remediation agreement remains ""the best way to protect and grow the almost 9,000 direct Canadian SNC-Lavalin jobs, as well as thousands of indirect jobs,"" the statement continues.

""We have also said that we have a fiduciary duty to our shareholders and employees, and as such is our responsibility to look at all our options available.... this does not mean that we have chosen one option or that a decision has been taken on which option we will pursue, simply that there are various possibilities we must consider.""

The presentation, which was delivered by mail to The Canadian Press anonymously and without a return address, also suggests the end of seven-figure donations and sponsorships for various community causes, hundreds of millions more in lost tax revenues, and the loss of spending on research positions at universities.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has held up the threat of job losses as the main reason he and others pressed former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to look into the prosecutor's decision.

Wilson-Raybould told the Commons justice committee last month she came under ""consistent and sustained"" pressure -- including veiled threats -- from Trudeau, his office, the Privy Council Office and Finance Minister Bill Morneau's office to halt the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

The ensuing political fallout has cost Trudeau two cabinet ministers -- Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott, who said she had lost confidence in the government's handling of the affair -- as well as one of his top aides, Gerald Butts, and Michael Wernick, clerk of the Privy Council, who will leave his post as the top federal civil servant before the fall election.

Bruce and Wernick met on Sept. 18 about the company's legal troubles.

Notes taken at the meeting, tabled as evidence with the House of Commons justice committee, show that Wernick told Bruce to take the public interest argument to the director of public prosecutions, adding the company ""will want to get it right.""

Wernick testified earlier this month that he spoke with Wilson-Raybould the next day where the former attorney general appeared ""very firm in her mind"" that the prosecutor's decision to not negotiate a deal with SNC-Lavalin was final. Wernick said Wilson-Raybould told him the only option for the company was to make public interest arguments through its lawyers.

Starvation and chronic hunger have continuing, epigenetic effects that last ...","It really is the perfect time for Alicia Elliott’s A Mind Spread Out on the Ground to be published. In what the 31-year-old Tuscarora writer calls the Indigenous renaissance, Indigenous artistry has never had so spectacular a presence across Canada’s cultural spectrum. Maliseet composer Jeremy Dutcher took the Polaris Music Prize last year, the third Indigenous winner in ﬁve years, while three Indigenous artists have won the annual Sobey Art Award since 2013. Indigenous poets have won the Grifﬁn Prize, one of the richest and most prestigious poetry prizes in the world, three years running. With a constant presence on bestseller lists and among literary prize nominations and wins, Indigenous literature is now as integral to CanLit as the immigrant story. If the current wave of Indigenous cultural prominence recedes anywhere, it won’t be in literature. Whatever this says about the country’s blind spots in the past, there’s never been a brighter spotlight on or a broader audience for incisive Indigenous cultural commentary.

Elliott delivers that commentary in exceptional essays as arresting as her title, which comes from a richly evocative Mohawk phrase for someone in the grip of depression. Assured enough to mock herself on occasion—“I don’t have all the answers,” she writes, after 200 pages of laying them down with utter assurance, “even if I sometimes imply I do”—Elliott ranges over a wide canvas. She tackles the vexed question of identity, both personal and political, powerfully linking larger questions of Indigenous life—from the residential school legacy to the loss of languages—to the unfolding of her own life. In forthright prose, in a format—a buzzed-about book from a major publisher—that should make it difficult for non-Indigenous Canadians to ignore, she also links past and present, laying out how the colonial legacy still shapes contemporary lives, Indigenous and non-Indigenous. And how real reconciliation is going to require an internal reformation within non-Indigenous Canada.

It’s “complicated,” Elliott says of her own identity, in her ﬁrst use of a word that becomes a theme running right through an interview with her. She calls herself Tuscarora, one of the Six Nations of the Haudenosaunee (historically known to white Canadians as the Iroquois), whose reserve near Brantford, Ont., is the country’s most populous. That’s not the federal government’s assessment of Elliott’s ethnicity. “Haudenosaunee people are matrilineal,” she continues. “But the imposition of the Indian Act changed everything. If you were to look at my status card it would say I’m Mohawk because it traces through patrilineal lines and my father is Mohawk. We had to actually do research into what we would be traditionally, which—going through my father’s maternal line—is Tuscarora.”

Elliott traces herself through her father’s maternal lineage because, complicating matters further, her own mother is white. She describes her “white-passing” skin colour as both a lifelong “shield” against casual racial harassment and a childhood “barrier” between her and her darker cousins, making her “both winner and loser, abuser and victim.” Also, not having been raised on the reserve, Elliott did not have Haudenosaunee culture “slowly, carefully poured into her hands” as those cousins did.

“There’s so much misunderstanding about Indigenous identity,” she says. “I look at it as being a citizen of a country. Indigeneity as a racial concept was something created by colonialism, something that we never acknowledged. We had adoptions into our nations that would have been similar to the way immigration works: you have to agree to certain things, to abiding by the Great Law and so forth. For me to say that I am Native means that is my afﬁliation, my nation, the group I have allegiance to. It doesn’t conflict to say I’m both Native and white-passing, or that I had to come to the culture later in life because of family circumstances. Those are things a lot of people who are Indigenous have to deal with.” Canada’s preferred image of an Indigenous person, she writes, is not “the modern Native girl in a sweatshirt and jeans trying to ﬁgure out how she ﬁts in ‘Reconciliation© Canada,’ ” but a stoic full-blooded Indian man decked out in beads and leather.

“Although,” she adds, in what could be a swipe at an unnamed Joseph Boyden, or, to be precise, at Boyden’s fans, “should the genuine artifact be unavailable, Canada will happily accept a handsome, agreeable white dude with tenuous Indigenous ‘roots’ as a substitute.”

If Elliott’s family circumstances brought her to parse identity closely, they also impelled her toward wider connections. Both her parents have engaged in domestic abuse and been arrested on various charges; the criminal justice system “didn’t help them, or our family.” Her mother’s abuse Elliott links to episodes of severe mental illness, eventually diagnosed as bipolar disorder, her father’s to intergenerational trauma—what his father inflicted on him. But the depression that has afflicted all of them, Elliott included, she believes to be as much a cultural phenomenon as a matter of personal history and brain chemistry. “We live in a society that is very much about the individual,” she says, where we are each responsible for pulling ourselves up, or where no one’s responsible when mental illness strikes. “The problem with that is that we don’t think of things such as class or race, even when you’re consistently having to worry about where your next meal is coming from or you know that when you’re looking for an apartment people are going to take one look at you and not want to rent. But those things are there—cultural depression, if you will.”

There are a lot of supposed “individual” choices in Indigenous life that are in fact out of people’s control, Elliott notes. Reading a study on the lingering effects of the Holodomor, the Ukrainian famine deliberately induced by a Soviet government determined to extinguish Ukrainian resistance and identity, she feels her breath catching in her throat. Never before had she seen an account of a non-Indigenous people sharing “my people’s experience of genocide,” especially as the decades roll on. Despite high literacy rates and economic success, Ukraine has the highest percentage among 41 countries surveyed of 11-, 13- and 15-year-olds who drink alcohol at least once a week, and 11-year-olds who smoke at least once a week, as well as the lowest life expectancy in Europe, all familiar pathologies in Canadian Indigenous communities. Starvation and chronic hunger have continuing, epigenetic effects that last for generations, among them substance abuse and elevated rates of diabetes among Indigenous people, rates that many non-Indigenous people blame on “lifestyle choices” or Indigenous biology, Elliott writes. “My father has diabetes,” she comments, and she looks warily ahead to her own diagnosis.

Unlike in Ukraine, the original crime continues, she writes. Many observers decry an ongoing “cultural genocide” still levied on Indigenous peoples. Elliott has no use for the adjective—it’s just plain genocide that she sees coming from a Canadian state that has not fundamentally changed its attitude, only its tactics. How else to explain an apology for residential schools co-existing with ongoing underfunding of Indigenous children’s education, or widespread anger over the fate of the murdered Tina Fontaine paradoxically combined with silence over the child welfare system that left Fontaine vulnerable in the ﬁrst place? “Today, the child welfare system abducts Indigenous children at abnormally high rates,” says Elliott. “And it is kind of terrifying to realize the number of Indigenous kids who are currently in the system exceeds the number of kids that were ever involved in residential schools. Yeah, that’s pretty alarming, given the high rates of high school failure and prison time among children from foster care. You know something is at play—it’s not much different from residential schools, just a variation.” Canada carries on as it began, she says, its economic system still “based on Indigenous destruction.”

If there are sparks of hope, one of the brightest lies in the cultural renaissance, in the admiration and respect Canadians are according Indigenous art. Although Elliott believes Indigenous writers are still treated differently in a way that reflects lingering colonial attitudes—“I read a magazine interview with [Grifﬁn Prize winner Billy-Ray] Belcourt in which the interviewer seemed almost offended at the fact Belcourt is very well-educated and uses a lot of big words, when his poetry deals with very complex issues of sexuality, gender and colonialism”—the situation is changing rapidly. “We are moving on from a situation where we had to constantly address who we are, why we matter, constantly explaining things about our culture, things that white writers speciﬁcally don’t have to deal with. They can move on to what actually interests me: what do I want to do stylistically, what really cool things that would play with form or time? We have gone from Lee Maracle ﬁghting to get a foot in the door to Joshua Whitehead writing a cyberpunk poetry book. We’re now able to show our creativity and talk about things other than just our identities.”

Respect for artistry is a balm Elliott acknowledges, but it doesn’t come close to countering continuing assaults on Indigenous life. Canada still wants what it has always wanted, the resources on (or beneath) Indigenous land, which means the path to true reconciliation—which requires acceptance of Indigenous sovereignty—can seem permanently impassable. In her last and most provocative essay, which links domestic violence to state-sponsored violence in the same way she sees her own family as the micro reflection of macro Indigenous culture, she asks her readers a series of questions about their true responses to abuse and exploitation. It culminates in questions about what Elliott, borrowing a term from writer Leanne Betasamosake Simpson, refers to as extract­ionism, the entrenched idea that the land and its resources are there to be plundered. “What do you want? Are those desires based on extraction? Are they dependent on capitalism or colonialism?”

Elliott’s message is clear: For reconciliation to ﬁnally arrive, it’s non-Indigenous Canada that has to change, to become more like Indigenous Canada, rather than the reverse. Otherwise, the past—not dead at all or even really in the past—will carry on and on and on.

So we are very sorry,"" the organizer said, before adding: ""We hope that ...","But in a March 26 email, the state-run Beijing festival after receiving final documentation from Zdanowski said the Canadian director and her film wouldn't be welcome after all.

Toronto-based Zdanowski told The Hollywood Reporter she received an official invitation March 25 for her film to screen in competition in Beijing. ""It's a great pleasure to inform you the excellent film In God I Trust is selected by the committee of the Beijing International Film Festival to screen in Forward Future Section and compete with other 17 films for final awards,"" the invitation stated.

The Canadian film In God I Trust by director Maja Zdanowski has been disinvited by the Beijing Film Festival from its 2019 event next month amid a growing diplomatic feud between the U.S. and China over the Chinese mobile phone maker Huawei Technologies.

That was followed March 29 by another email from a coordinator for the Forward Future section that confirmed In God I Trust had been caught up in the diplomatic crossfire between governments in China, Canada and the U.S. related to the Dec. 1 arrest in Vancouver of Meng Wanzhou, the CFO of Huawei Technologies, at the request of U.S. authorities.

Huawei's Meng, who is out on bail in Vancouver, faces possible fraud charges in the U.S. for her alleged dealings with American banks if extradited to the U.S.

""We tried many ways to get the film through, but failed. It's not the film itself that has political problems, it's going abroad (I'm sure you've heard about Huawei). So we are very sorry,"" the organizer said, before adding: ""We hope that the film will meet Chinese audiences when the environment improves.""

THR has viewed the correspondence between Zdanowski and the Beijing Film Festival organizers.

Officials at the Beijing Film Festival could not be reached for comment on the invitation for In God I Trust being pulled.

""They do not say why, but it's pretty obvious that they are not receiving a film from Canada at this time,"" Zdanowski told THR.

As China-Canada relations get caught up in the geopolitical tensions over the Huawei exec's extradition proceedings, Beijing authorities earlier detained two Canadians in China on vague national security charges, and suspended some Canadian farm product imports as a part of a campaign of intimidation and retribution.

And Toronto-based apparel maker Canada Goose, whose cozy fur-lined jackets are popular with Hollywood celebs and a luxury status symbol in China, has seen its stock price tumble since the arrest of Huawei's Meng late last year, and calls on Chinese social media sites for a boycott of the pricey Canadian parkas.

Diplomatic tensions also veered into the film and entertainment arena in 2016 when China targeted Korean K-pop stars over Seoul's decision to deploy a U.S.-made missile defense system on the Korean peninsula in spite of vocal opposition from Beijing.

Jaclyn Corin, 18, has become a prominent advocate for gun control after experiencing one of the worst mass school shootings in American history, when 17 of her fellow students and staff were gunned down and 17 more injured on Valentine’s Day, 2018 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. A former student has confessed to the murders.

Corin and other students have channeled their grief, suffering and constant anxiety attacks from that shooting into a push for gun control. Corin is a central figure in the “Never Again” movement and helped organize March for Our Lives, one of the largest youth protests since the Vietnam War. It's a campaign that has prompted fierce opposition from the U.S. National Rifle Association (NRA).

She told an Ottawa crowd on Friday that the tactics she has observed from the NRA are similar to what is now being deployed by the Canadian Coalition for Firearms Rights against Dr. Najma Ahmed, a surgeon at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto.

One year ago, the world changed. Thanks for sticking with us. #MarchForOurLives 💙 pic.twitter.com/50acE3EBpf — Jaclyn Corin (@JaclynCorin) March 24, 2019

The NRA, she said, was “among the most powerful special interest lobby groups in the U.S., with a substantial budget to influence — or bribe — members of Congress on gun policy.”

""It's pretty similar to the Canadian Coalition for Firearm Rights, the CCFR, here (in Canada), which, if you guys didn't know, started a campaign telling members to file complaints against a doctor advocating for stricter gun control — someone that actually sees the results of gunshot wounds, someone that is just trying to save people's lives,” said Corin at the Progress Summit, a public policy gathering organized by the Ottawa-based Broadbent Institute, named after former NDP Leader Ed Broadbent.

In response, the Canadian Coalition for Firearm Rights, declined to say whether it was using NRA tactics. But it denied that it was acting in bad faith, and told National Observer that it believed Corin was using ""dismissive and insulting language.""

Canadian doctors plan day of action on gun control

Ahmed, the Toronto surgeon, co-founded Canadian Doctors for Protection from Guns, a group of largely emergency room physicians. She was on call the night of the Danforth shooting in July 2018, when three people died and 13 others were shot and injured.

She has accused the CCFR of being behind roughly 70 complaints against her that were filed with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario. This month, the college, which investigates professional misconduct allegations, dismissed those complaints as “frivolous” and “vexatious.”

Meantime, Ahmed is carrying on.

Her group is spearheading a nationwide Day of Action next Wednesday calling for stricter gun control. The group wants to see the Trudeau government’s Bill C-71 passed.

The bill, which has cleared the House of Commons and is now being considered by a Senate committee, would overhaul the background check system and create new retailer record-keeping rules.

In February, Ahmed testified at the committee looking at C-71, saying the bill was ""a small but positive step."" She argued that even though Canada's gun fatality rate was five to six times lower than the United States, it was also eight times greater than other peer nations of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Japan and Australia.

""Guns are the vector in this preventable public health crisis. They are the key exposure in this epidemic. Physicians are witnesses to the human toll that guns take on our patients, their families and their communities,"" she told the committee.

Gun group: shooting survivor's words 'insulting'

The CCFR, however, says Ahmed’s work with the doctors group means she is “moonlighting as a social justice warrior,” and accused her of “verging on narcissism” for “politicizing” the Danforth shooting.

""You would think someone this educated, with a background in the sciences would be more of a critical thinker,"" the group said about Ahmed on a webpage it has set up about her.

They also say Ahmed's actions detract from “credible work we need to demand on crime, gang violence, mental health and terrorism.” For example, the CCFR believes that the March 26 seizure of 26 firearms and hundreds of rounds of ammunition is ""exactly where the resources being wasted on C-71 should be going.""

CCFR CEO and executive director Rod Giltaca told the Senate committee that C-71 was ""completely ineffective"" as there were ""no provisions that address the root causes of violence in our society.""

""The idea that Bill C-71 is needed to increase public safety isn’t true. The government has been caught lying and manipulating statistics to support this unnecessary bill,"" he said.

Asked on Friday by National Observer about Corin’s comment, Giltaca said the school shooting survivor’s words were out of line.

“In place of a civilized debate, the dismissive and insulting language of Ms. Corin and those in the doctor's group is what we've come to expect from them,” said Giltaca.

Giltaca also argued that the College of Physicians and Surgeons’s dismissal of the complaints were not because they were unfounded, but rather “not the forum for this issue.” The college has said it is unusual to receive complaints about advocacy work instead of patient outcomes.

“Whether we believe that complaints to the CPSO was the correct course of action, the doctors have demonstrably spread misinformation and we fear that Canadians believed it without question because they are doctors,” he said. “We believe that lodging complaints with the licensing body was a reasonable course of action.”

This is EXACTLY where the resources being wasted on C-71 should be going. Into programs, and investigations that have real world, tangible results while leaving law abiding Canadians alone.https://t.co/z4SYMgoOpV — CCFR/CCDAF (@CCFR_CCDAF) March 26, 2019

'Anxiety attacks, memorial visits, vacant desks'

This week, the Parkland students were forced once again to confront their grief after the apparent suicides of two students.

""Thousands of people in my community would now have to redefine their new normal,” Corin told the Broadbent crowd Friday. She described never-ending ""anxiety attacks, memorial visits, vacant desks.”

In 2017, she said, nearly 40,000 Americans died as a result of guns, or an average of 109 people a day. There were 24 school shootings last year that resulted in gun-related deaths or injuries.

""The worst part is, far too many stories of gun violence go untold or are forgotten back home as American society willingly moves on,” said Corin.

""Young people, specifically those who reside in low socioeconomic areas, grow up with gun violence as their reality. Days without gunshots as their background noise seem unusual.”

Trauma doesn’t disappear. — Jaclyn Corin (@JaclynCorin) March 24, 2019

Perhaps the one thing worse than gun violence, she added, is its normalization in society.

“We are coerced by continual propaganda into believing that this reality cannot be changed, as guns have been completely and totally fused into our culture, largely due to the NRA's influence on American politics.""",Parkland school shooting survivor calls out Canadian gun lobby for acting like NRA,National Observer,https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/03/29/news/parkland-school-shooting-survivor-calls-out-canadian-gun-lobby-acting-nra

Trudeau’s favourability among the public continues to sink alongside Liberal fortunes

March 28, 2019 – Two months of scandal have eroded support for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Liberal Party, opening up a nine-point lead among Canadian voters who say they would vote for the Conservative Party of Canada if an election were held tomorrow.

This, according to a new analysis of public opinion polling data by the non-profit Angus Reid Institute. The data was donated to ARI by Angus Reid Global Public Affairs.

The Conservatives capture 37 per cent of the decided and leaning vote – essentially unchanged from where they stood last month – but it is the governing Liberals who have dropped three points to 28 per cent as the SNC-Lavalin affair has remained in the headlines.

The principal beneficiaries of this decline in Liberal support appear to be the New Democratic Party and smaller parties, including the Green Party and the People’s Party of Canada.

These parties are seeing their fortunes rise as the Canadian public expresses unfavourable views of the main parties and their leaders.

More Key Findings:

More Canadians have a favourable view of CPC leader Andrew Scheer (44% do) and New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh (39%) than Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (36%)

Demographics are a huge driver of partisanship, with men and older Canadians skewing much more Conservative, while women and younger Canadians are more likely to be sticking with the Liberals or choosing other left-of-centre parties

Regionally, the Liberals trail the Conservatives in every region but Quebec, where vote intentions show a competitive four-way race

About ARI

The Angus Reid Institute (ARI) was founded in October 2014 by pollster and sociologist, Dr. Angus Reid. ARI is a national, not-for-profit, non-partisan public opinion research foundation established to advance education by commissioning, conducting and disseminating to the public accessible and impartial statistical data, research and policy analysis on economics, political science, philanthropy, public administration, domestic and international affairs and other socio-economic issues of importance to Canada and its world.

Part 1 – The political landscape

Liberal decline benefitting smaller parties

A lot can change during a federal election campaign. In 2015, each of the three main federal parties held the lead in Angus Reid Institute polling at some point between the time writ was dropped and election day.

With more than six months to go until the 2019 vote, it is not understatement to say a lot may change. That said, if the election were held tomorrow, it’s unlikely that the Trudeau Liberals would retain their majority in Parliament.

Among decided and leaning voters, 37 per cent say they would back the CPC if they went to the polls tomorrow. Fewer than three-in-ten (28%) would vote for the Liberals, and roughly one-in-six (17%) would cast their ballots for the NDP.

Conservative strength comes from the party’s higher retention rate. The party is holding the votes of nearly nine-in-ten who voted CPC in 2015, while fewer than six-in-ten 2015 Liberals say they’re inclined to vote for Trudeau’s party again today:

Perhaps the biggest advantage for the Conservative Party at this stage is the firmness of its base. While a significant proportion of potential Liberal and NDP supporters say they are uncertain or only somewhat certain that they will, indeed, end up supporting one of those two left-of-centre parties, four-in-five Conservatives say they are very certain about where they stand.

This is not a new phenomenon. The CPC had the most committed base in ARI polling ahead of the 2015 election as well, but were unable to rally enough voters outside of that base to retain former Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s majority government.

The Liberal Party’s low retention of its 2015 supporters is one part of the equation. Also notable is where those voters are going.

About one-in-eight 2015 Liberals (13%) say they plan to support the CPC, and one-in-ten (11%) say the same of the NDP. Significant numbers are also turning to the Green Party or remain truly undecided:

The CPC, by contrast, appears to be losing just a handful of supporters (6%) to former Conservative cabinet minister Maxime Bernier and his People’s Party of Canada. Aside from that challenge, few 2015 Conservatives are jumping ship – with 88 per cent saying they intend to support the party again:

Demographic differences

A key component of the vote intention story is the influence of gender and age – often working in tandem – on political partisanship. The Conservative Party commands a healthy lead among men in Canada, but it runs basically even with the Liberals among female voters. Women are also almost twice as likely as men to say they would vote for the NDP:

This three-way race among female voters is also seen among younger Canadians (those ages 18-34). The three parties are close to a statistical tie among this age group, while the CPC leads by a wide margin among Canadians over the age of 35 – a group who are historically much more likely to turn out and vote.

Looking at these two variables in combination, a clear pattern emerges. Men of all ages are more likely than women their age to support the CPC, while women of all ages are more likely than men their age to support the Liberals and the NDP:

These age and gender differences are significant not only because they tell such different stories about the moods of different segments of the Canadian electorate, but also because of the dramatic differences in turnout between age groups.

The 2015 election saw a massive increase in turnout among younger voters, a phenomenon that bucked the trend of previous elections and was widely seen as contributing to the Trudeau Liberals’ victory. If turnout among this age group were to revert to where it was in the 2011 election or the several before it, which are shown in the graph that follows, this poll suggests the Liberals would be in even greater electoral trouble.

The regional picture

Regional vote intentions have remained fairly consistent since ARI’s last poll in February, which currently spells trouble for Justin Trudeau’s Liberals. The party’s lead in Quebec has diminished to a statistical tie with the Conservatives, while the NDP and Bloc Quebecois trail closely behind.

The CPC leads by wide margins in the prairie provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, and by smaller, four-point margins in vote-rich Ontario and 2015 Liberal stronghold Atlantic Canada.

Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives also hold a wide lead over the Liberals in B.C., where the NDP and Greens are strongest and likely help to split left-of-centre respondents:

The large sample size of this study allows for a deeper dive into the regional results. Generally, it shows the Liberals performing strongest in urban areas – as they did in 2015, when they won every riding in the City of Toronto and nearly all of the ridings in the Greater Toronto Area.

Today, the Liberals lead by a wide margin in the City of Toronto and are neck-and-neck with the NDP in the City of Vancouver, but they find themselves tied or trailing in in those cities’ suburbs, and trailing badly in the rest of B.C. and Ontario:

In Quebec, the Liberals are strongest in Greater Montreal, while this poll finds a competitive four-way race elsewhere in the province:

Even in provinces where the Conservatives have a wide lead, the Liberals keep things closer in major cities, but trail by much wider margins outside of them:

Part 2 – Issues and approval

Deficits, economy, environment top the list

Campaign strategies are undoubtedly being tested and plotted by each party’s team in preparation for the writ later this year, and these data offer a window into which issues are likely to carry the most weight for Canadians.

Asked to choose the top three issues in Canada today, Canadians name three topics – the deficit/government spending (35%), the economy (35%), and the environment/climate change (34%) – at a roughly equal rate. The balance between economic growth and environmental sustainability is something the government has been vocal about since 2015, and represents a difficult challenge for each leader to make their case on.

Health care is also a top issue for roughly one-in-three Canadians (32%), ahead of immigration and taxes, chosen by just under one-quarter (23%):

Looking at responses from decided and leaning voters yields some interesting insights into partisan concerns during this election year.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, would-be Liberal voters are not especially likely to name deficits and spending by a government they support re-electing as a top issue in Canada today. The government has continued to spend well past its initial 2015 campaign promises, but has boasted that low unemployment and low poverty rates are a direct result of that spending. Those inclined to vote for the Conservatives, meanwhile, are more than four times more likely to choose the deficit as a top concern than potential Liberal and NDP supporters.

Notably, at least half of all potential supporters for the Liberals (56%), NDP (51%), Bloc (53%) and Green Party (66%) say that the environment and climate change are a top issue for the country. Meanwhile, just 6 per cent of Conservatives say this a top concern:

One-third approve of Trudeau’s performance

At the personal level, Justin Trudeau’s approval rating continues to sputter. One-in-three Canadians (33%) say they approve of the PM this quarter, statistically unchanged since December, when his approval stood at 35 per cent.

Importantly, nearly half say they “strongly disapprove” of Trudeau, compared to fewer than one-in-ten who “strongly approve”:

While Trudeau’s approval remains strongest with Canadians under the age of 35, the days of majority approval among that group have vanished, down to just 39 per cent currently:

Asked a similar question of each of the party leaders, Canadians are more likely to hold unfavourable than favourable views of everyone except Green Party leader Elizabeth May. Just over four-in-ten Canadians say they have a favourable view of Andrew Scheer (44%), while slightly fewer say the same of the NDP’s Jagmeet Singh (39%).

Looking at net favourability (unfavourable minus favourable) makes it clear that – although each of the three main leaders is more disliked than liked – Trudeau is easily the least popular:

Scroll through your Facebook feed and you’ll see it’s the Wild West for political advertisers on Facebook, communication experts say. As Alberta heads to the polls on April 16, political parties and third-party advertisers are corralling votes through mobile apps and online advertising.



All of this comes as online advertisers and platforms face increasing scrutiny from federal regulators concerned with interference that could ultimately influence election results.

Going Mobile

However, new federal rules won’t impact Albertans who will see their fair share of targeted political messages this coming provincial election.Targeted Facebook AdsFacebook ads are excellent for reaching audiences advertisers want to connect with. But, it’s the ability to target ads at specific demographics that has some experts, like analyst Sara Bannerman, worried.“What’s concerning to me is the lack of transparency. That we really don’t have a tool for monitoring what kind of advertising is out there,” says Bannerman, the Research Chair in Communication Policy and Governance at McMaster University.Bill C-76, introduced by the federal government last December, is attempting to force online platforms to maintain a sharable database of political advertisements.Google Canada has already decided they won’t be hosting political ads for the next Federal Election due to that requirement. In the U.S., U.K., India, and Brazil, Facebook maintains ad libraries that track who purchases political ads, how much they paid, and how the ads performed.Facebook promises to launch a Canadian ad archive in June, before the next federal election, but after Alberta’s provincial election.Under Alberta law, political advertisers only need to disclose their expenses to Elections Alberta. However, Bannerman insists more information, including how organizations are aiming particular messages to certain groups and which groups are being targeted with specific ads, should be shared with the public.“If ads are only seen by the people who [are meant to] see them, then we’re not even participating in the same conversation.”

Mobile apps are one of the newer tools being made available by political parties. Apps can be used to communicate directly with supporters, gather data, and organize campaigns.

Peter Ryan, public relations professor at Mount Royal University, says Albertans should be concerned about how easily these apps collect users’ private information.

The Alberta NDPs app Forward is the only mobile app made available to the general public.

“If they’re downloading a partisan app, we don’t know what information is getting collected by that party … we don’t know how [the data] is being used, and what effect it will have on the election.”



Ryan added there is also no way of knowing what security is in place in the event of a hack.



So far, the Alberta NDP’s app, Forward, is the only one available within the Google Play and Apple app stores.



The app requests biographical information such as name, constituency, phone number, and email.



However, as of March 14, the app wasn’t completely accessible to the public, as users who provided basic information, and granted notification and text message permissions were never sent the invitation code needed to access any in-app content.

Third-party advertisers

While political parties will be doing their share of advertising online, they’re not the only ones with a stake in this election.

Organizations not affiliated with political parties can spend up to $150,000 on advertising, per legislation introduced by the current government back in 2017.

Third-party advertisers and other groups not directly linked to political parties have the capacity and legal ability to advertise as well, which Ryan says is going to show us a lot about their role in our politics.



“We will learn which political parties will be able to leverage the third-party space to effectively amplify their messages to strategically frame their opposition and drive voters to the polls to support their election policies.”



While these third parties can advertise, they are required by law to register with Elections Alberta but can spend no more than $150,000 on advertising.



The Alberta Federation of Labour, the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees, and political-action organizations like Shaping Alberta’s Future are three examples of groups registered as third-party political advertisers with Elections Alberta.

Unregistered groups

Public Facebook groups with thousands of members can spread suspicious news articles to non-members through sharing.

While registered third parties will have their spending monitored by the province, Ryan raises the issues of groups who may not be receiving or spending any money at all, but still exerting great influence.



“If you aren’t receiving any money you can still have a [Facebook] group and post away,” says Ryan.



“A huge group right now is the Yellow Vest movement online, over 100,000 people are following it. That could influence a provincial election.”



Yellow Vests Canada identifies itself as a group that supports the building of pipelines and opposes carbon taxes, globalists and ‘treason’ committed by Canadian politicians. The group’s Facebook page is filled with posts by members sharing from sources such as Debate Post which makes unsubstantiated claims, often about immigration or Prime Minister Trudeau.



Ryan encourages voters to be critical of posts they see online and attempt to verify what they see with trusted media outlets and official government sources, like Elections Alberta.



“If it’s not the mainstream media reporting or circulating information to you, I would say consumers beware of that information.”

Renee Merrifield Wasylyk and I meet on a brisk Saturday afternoon. She’s at home, so it’s not the power-suit-clad executive with that signature red lipstick who greets me; it’s a relaxed, makeup free, softer version of Renee who pours two glasses of VQA and invites me to her kitchen table.

This is home base for a busy, blended family of eight: Renee, her fiance Carlos, the five (mostly grown) children between them that come and go, and the adorable hound, Winston.

I let Renee know my intention is not to write an article about her political aspirations, but as we talk and the conversation flows freely, I realize her passion for being a voice and bringing people together at the family, business and political levels is truly who she is at her core. We can’t “not” talk about it.

“Honestly, I love it. I don’t love politicking, politics or shenanigans, but I love democracy,” she says, leaning forward in her chair. “I love the conversation, contrary ideas that have to be shared in order to figure out the consensus.”

Renee is seeking the Conservative nomination in the federal riding of Kelowna-Lake Country. She doesn’t see herself as a politician; she prefers the word conduit.

“I am simply someone who can get people to the table. I’m not the one doing anything other than putting the pieces together.”

Renee has been putting pieces together and asking the big questions since she was a child.

“At eight years old I asked my dad why there were no female presidents and he told me, ‘honey, you can be the first female president of the United States of America.’” She chuckles at the memory, adding that this could never be the case as a Canadian citizen; however, the seed was planted.

“If I look back, that was one of the two moments in my life that told me it’s okay to be a change-maker.”

The other inspiration came from a Rabbi professor at Concordia University. (Renee holds a Bachelor of Arts in Religious Studies and a Master of Theology)

“He said, ‘Renee, God is so big, He is not afraid of your questions, but also don’t be afraid when He asks you to change the world.’”

Renee has been enacting change, most notably on the Kelowna development scene, since she started Troika Developments in 1998. Based on her degrees and first career job as a Celebrative Arts Ministry Associate at Trinity Baptist Church, development wasn’t the obvious choice. It became a necessary choice as Renee faced the reality of financially supporting a young and growing family.

“I started working for a developer. I negotiated a land assembly. Then I started my own consultation business. It was the school of hard knocks, just learning on the go.”

After just two and a half years of consulting on land assemblies, acquisitions, permits and contracts for other developers, Renee was ready to launch Troika — and she most definitely made waves.

“When I launched, I had three projects. A 56-unit townhome development, a 44-unit apartment block and a mixed-use commercial site that I launched all at once,” she says, shaking her head. “I would never do it like that again, but it really put me on the map. Other developers where like, ‘Who is she? Who does she think she is?’”

Renee says “she” is simply someone who listened to people who knew more than her; someone who accepted help when it was offered and someone who still lives by those principles today.

“I remember being overwhelmed by the kindness. If I was doing it wrong, they’d say, ‘Renee, you should do it this way.’ My network became my teachers and I still look at it that way.”

With 21 years in business under her belt and many business accolades, including Entrepreneur of the Year – Pacific Region, Most Influential Business Woman of the Year – BC, and two appearances on Canada’s list of the Top 100 Most Powerful Woman, Renee is ready to step into a new role.

“When [Conservative Party Leader] Andrew Scheer came and asked me to run, that to me was an invitation to the table. So now I have an invitation to be able to affect change and that’s a pretty powerful invitation. I will also get to bring my community to a greater standing on the national stage. Who wouldn’t want to do that?”

As of press time, no date for the Conservative nomination has been set, but Renee is actively talking to the people in her community as if she’s already representing them and loving every minute of it.

“Should I win the nomination, and you don’t do this because you think you’re going to lose” she adds, “I want to make sure the right people are part of the conversation. I’m meeting all these farmers, for example. My mind is blown — they have incredible stories and incredible knowledge. They should be at the table telling their story and allowing me to make it easier to build our economy with their businesses.”

Renee’s family supports her decision to pursue the nomination. She smiles from ear to ear when I bring up her children. I wonder aloud what someone who expects so much of herself might expect from her kids.

“I have high expectations for them, but I’m not proud of them when they achieve something. I’m proud of them when they work hard, when they put in effort. I’m proud of them because of what they give to what they care about.”

When it comes to pride, Renee’s fiance, Carlos, is brimming with it. The importance of that support is not lost on her.

“That is sometimes a difficult thing for a man to be, but when you find the man who is happy to be your champion, cheerleader, lover and friend — you hold on to him tightly and you will do the same for him.”

Carlos appears as if on cue. Our time is almost up as Renee has another function to attend. As I swallow the last of my wine and feel grateful that I am going home to enjoy a quiet night “in,” Renee seems just as enthusiastic about her night “out.” An opportunity to meet more people, to listen as they share their stories and — as that cherished Rabbi professor told her all those years ago — to accept a role that may one day “change the world.”",Troikia’s Renee Merrifield Wasylyk Considers A Move To The Political Arena,Abbotsford News,https://www.abbynews.com/life/troikias-renee-merrifield-wasylyk-considers-a-move-to-the-political-arena/

A recording made by Wilson-Raybould of a 17-minute Dec. 19 call between herself and Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick was released today, along with 43 pages of emails, texts and a written statement from Wilson-Raybould herself which were tabled to the Commons justice committee.

Wernick — who was not aware he was being recorded — told the minister there was ""rising anxiety"" over the fate of a major employer.

""He's quite determined, quite firm,"" Wernick said of the prime minister's position on getting a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) for the Quebec-based engineering company.

""I was anxious to ensure that I had an exact record of what was discussed as I had reason to believe that it was likely to be an an inappropriate conversation,"" she wrote.

""So while I typed out notes during the phone call, I took the extraordinary and otherwise inappropriate step of making an audio recording of the conversation without so advising the Clerk. This is something that I have never done before this phone call and have not done since.""

Why she resigned

In her statement, Wilson-Raybould also sheds new light on why she resigned from cabinet on Feb. 12.

Conservatives have suggested she was fired from the justice portfolio and moved to Veterans Affairs for refusing to budge on the SNC-Lavalin matter.

But Wilson-Raybould said that while she initially thought she'd been shunted to Veterans over the SNC-Lavalin affair, she ultimately decided that was not the reason.

""After much reflection, I decided to take the prime minister at his word, that this was not the case, and accepted a post I was honoured to have as the Minister of Veterans Affairs and Associate Minister of National Defence,"" she wrote.

Wilson-Raybould went on to say that a subsequent series of meetings with Trudeau in Vancouver, and a Feb. 11 news conference, led to her resignation:

""The prime minister stated publicly, when issues about the propriety of the government's conduct in relation to the SNC matter arose, that my ongoing presence in cabinet spoke for itself. I resigned the next day, and I trust my resignation also speaks for itself.""

That news conference came just days after the explosive Feb. 7 Globe and Mail story which first reported the allegations of inappropriate political pressure on Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case.

When Trudeau was asked at that press conference about inappropriate pressure on Wilson-Raybould, he said she ""confirmed"" a conversation she had with him in the fall where he said any decision on the matter was hers alone. He said he was limited in terms of what more he could say because of cabinet confidentiality.

""In our system of government, of course, her presence in cabinet should actually speak for itself,"" he said at the time.

While Wilson-Raybould and former cabinet minister Jane Philpott have suggested there is much more to tell in the story, today Wilson-Raybould said she has now divulged all her relevant information.

""I do not believe I have anything further to offer a formal process regarding this specific matter, though of course if compelled or asked to participate in a judicial, investigative or parliamentary process I would do so,"" she said.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said this is more evidence the prime minister has lost the moral authority to govern and must resign.

""Justin Trudeau also told Canadians what he knew to be false,"" he said. ""He knew that his attorney general had serious concerns about his plan to get SNC-Lavalin off of serious criminal charges. But he looked Canadians in the eye and told them that no one had raised concerns with him. This is false and he owes Canadians an explanation.""

When Wernick testified before the committee for a second time on March 6, he said he did not have ""independent recollection"" of what he said during a Dec. 19 conversation with Wilson-Raybould.

'I did not wear a wire': Wernick

""I did not record the conversation. I did not wear a wire. I did not take notes and that is not my recollection of how the conversation flowed,"" he testified.

During his testimony on March 6, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick said he did not record his conversations. 0:28

Wernick resigned as Privy Council clerk, the country's top civil servant, on Mar. 18, saying there was ""no path"" for him to have a ""relationship of mutual trust and respect"" with opposition party leaders.

Wernick's first appearance in front of the justice committee was widely criticized by Opposition MPs and pundits as partisan for the way he defended the behaviour of various government officials.

He is set to officially leave his post on April 19.

During the recorded call released today, Wilson-Raybould repeatedly stated that she thought the conversation with Wernick was inappropriate and that she wanted to protect the prime minister and the integrity of the government. In his testimony before the justice committee, Wernick said that Wilson-Raybould could have raised her concerns about inappropriate pressure, but did not.

Trudeau still 'wishes' Wilson-Raybould had come to him: PMO

Trudeau's spokesman, Cameron Ahmad, issued a statement Friday saying that the Prime Minister's Office was unaware of the full contents of the audio recording and now acknowledge that Trudeau ""should have spoken directly with the former justice minister and attorney general about this matter — and he wishes that she had come to him.""

Ahmad said there has clearly been an erosion of trust ""over the past few months"" between Wilson-Raybould, Wernick and the PMO and that steps are being taken to improve cabinet relations.

""All the facts are on the table now, and everyone involved has shared their perspective, including the prime minister. We are focused on moving forward as a team on the issues that matter to Canadians and governing in the best interests of the country,"" Ahmad said.

In an interview with CBC Radio's The House to air Saturday, Conservative deputy leader Lisa Raitt said Wernick sounded uncomfortable, likely because he was doing something inappropriate in delivering the prime minister's message.

""He didn't give her comfort. He didn't say, 'That's okay Jody.' He landed it with, 'Well I guess we've got nothing else to talk about,'"" she told host Chris Hall.

""So he is complicit in it. He threatened her job and he threatened her position. There's no question about it. And he did it on the behest of the prime minister. He may have sounded uncomfortable doing it, but he still did it.""

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said the fresh evidence is so compelling that a public inquiry must be called to get to the bottom of the affair.

""The PMO has tried to spin this as a miscommunication or personal disagreement. What we see in this submission is a lawyer acting in her client's best interests to protect him from his own recklessness,"" he said in a statement. ""The former attorney general repeatedly made clear to the prime minister and those around him that their inappropriate actions would be seen as political interference, and they ignored her.""

Former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould submitted written material to the Commons justice committee this week for its study of the SNC-Lavalin affair. The material, released by the committee Friday, included a recording of her conversation with Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick. (Canadian Press photos)

As attorney-general, Wilson-Raybould was acting as the government's lawyer and was bound by solicitor-client privilege. In Canada, it is not illegal for a person to record a conversation with another person without their knowledge — but it would be unusual for a solicitor to knowingly record conversations with a client without informing them first.

Many law societies, including the B.C. Law Society and the Law Society of Ontario, forbid lawyers from recording conversations with clients without their knowledge under code of conduct rules.

Wilson Raybould was called to the Ontario bar in June 2016 under a section of the Barristers Act which entitles a minister of justice and attorney general of Canada or solicitor general of Canada to be called to the bar.

Trudeau's waiver on cabinet confidence and solicitor-client privilege allows Wilson-Raybould to speak freely about events up to her departure as justice minister and attorney general. It does not cover the period when she remained in cabinet after being moved to Veterans Affairs.

Pressure, veiled threats

She testified on Feb. 27 that she faced intense, inappropriate pressure and veiled threats for refusing to overturn a decision by the director of the Public Prosecution Service of Canada to deny the Quebec-based construction and engineering company a DPA, and instead proceed with criminal charges.

SNC-Lavalin faces bribery and fraud charges related to contracts in Libya, and could be barred from bidding on federal contracts for ten years if convicted.

Liberal MPs on the justice committee used their majority to close down the hearing without recalling Wilson-Raybould to testify a second time. That prompted the Conservatives to trigger a 31-hour voting marathon in the House of Commons last week in protest.

Liberals also used their majority on the Commons ethics committee to block an inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin affair.

The NDP is pushing for an independent public inquiry, while the Conservatives have requested an RCMP investigation and Trudeau's resignation.

This ...","OTTAWA – Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould was cautioned about a potential “collision” with the prime minister over the SNC-Lavalin file by outgoing Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, a newly-released audio recording reveals. This caution came a month before she was shuffled out of her role, and nearly two months before the scandal began unfolding publicly.

According to an audio recording of a conversation that the pair had, submitted to the House Justice Committee by Wilson-Raybould, Wernick said he was worried what might happen if Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould remained at “loggerheads” about whether or not to offer a deferred prosecution agreement to the Quebec engineering firm.

In the audio, Wilson-Raybould can be heard issuing repeated and stern warnings that senior officials pressuring her over the SNC-Lavalin case would “look like nothing but political interference” if the Quebec construction and engineering company were granted deferred prosecution. By the time of her recorded conversation with Wernick, Wilson-Raybould says she had already endured months of intense lobbying from such officials.

She said in the audio that she was absolutely confident in her decision -- to back the Director of Public Prosecutions’ decision not to grant the agreement and to continue pursuing the criminal charges -- and in response, Wernick said he was “worried about a collision then because he is pretty firm about this. I just saw him a few hours ago and this is really important to him.”

In a statement late Friday, Trudeau’s office said that he was “not briefed by the Clerk on his conversation with Jody Wilson-Raybould,” and that the PMO was “unaware of the full contents of this recording before today.”

The PMO statement reiterates that Trudeau wishes she would have gone to him directly about the matter, reinforcing his message that there “was clearly an erosion of trust over the past few months” between all key actors in this affair.

“I don't get the covert ops program or holding on to the tape for a convenient moment,” Wernick’s lawyer Frank Addario said in a statement, according to The Canadian Press. According to his lawyer, Wernick was not aware the call had been recorded until it was released on Friday.

“She was the chief legal officer for the country. She didn't give her tape to the RCMP. She didn't give it to the PM or the Ethics Commissioner. She didn't even give it to the committee when she first testified. Most peculiar,” CP quotes him as saying.

The 17-minute audio file was provided to all members of the House Justice Committee on Friday, as part of the new and supplementary evidence related to the SNC-Lavalin scandal that she handed over days ago.

The 43-pages of additional material also includes a 21-page written statement, as well as screen shots of text messages and copies of emails that she referenced during her initial testimony, adding more fodder to the continuously developing controversy that’s dominated political headlines for the last two months.

The secret recording is of a Dec. 19 phone call with Wernick that both parties have previously testified to. In the recording Wilson-Raybould can be heard saying that she was trying to protect Trudeau by issuing these cautions about prosecutorial independence.

She said the way the case was being handled “screams of” political interference and that while she agrees jobs are important, the issue is how it would look if federal prosecutors dropped the criminal charges of fraud and corruption, in exchange for a remediation agreement.

Throughout the scandal -- which touched off on Feb. 7 when The Globe and Mail reported that Wilson-Raybould faced pressure to interfere in a criminal case against SNC-Lavalin -- the federal Liberals have cited the 9,000 jobs at stake as their main motivator for any actions in this case.

Should SNC-Lavalin be found guilty, they could face a 10-year ban on applying for federal contracts, leading to the company having to move out of Canada.

“I feel that I am giving him my best advice. And if he doesn’t accept that advice then it’s his prerogative to do what he wants. But I’m trying to protect the prime minister from political interference, perceived or otherwise,” she said.

Wernick -- who was not made aware during the recording that he was being taped -- can also be heard saying that he “respects” where Wilson-Raybould was coming from, but that Trudeau’s view was that “he’s not asking you to do anything inappropriate or to interfere. He’s asking you to use all the tools that you lawfully have at your disposal, Wernick said.

“You’re not just being attorney general, you’re the minister of justice and a cabinet [minister] – and, you have context within which you exercise your roles and your responsibilities. Like, I’m not seeing anything inappropriate here,” Wernick can be heard saying.

Chair of the committee, Anthony Housefather, has said that ""no redactions have been made"" to Wilson-Raybould’s submission by the committee, though there are portions of the submission that appear to have been redacted by Wilson-Raybould before it was submitted.

Wilson-Raybould, who is still a member of the Liberal caucus, provided this evidence to further bolster the testimony she gave to the committee on Feb. 27, and to respond to contradicting stories that others have offered since her appearance.

RECORDING OF CALL WITH WERNICK

During her initial testimony on this phone call, Wilson-Raybould said she was alone and took the call from home. She said that Wernick wanted to communicate where Trudeau was at regarding the file, and spoke about the company potentially moving its headquarters.

She quoted him saying “I think he is going to find a way to get it done, one way or another....So he is in that kind of mood, and I wanted you to be aware of it.”

When asked about this call during his follow up testimony, Wernick said that it was not his recollection of that call. “I did not wear a wire, record the conversation or take extemporaneous notes,” Wernick said.

“I never raised partisan considerations at any time. I reminded her repeatedly that she was the final decision-maker. I did not attempt to influence her decision. I was giving her relevant context about public interest considerations for a decision that was hers to take. I never suggested consequences for her,” Wernick testified.

The audio call largely confirmed Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, but also backed up Wernick’s assertion that he did not make any direct partisan considerations, like Quebec votes, which Wilson-Raybould has alleged she was consistently reminded of while the file was on her desk. Though he did cite a “rising anxiety” following job losses in Oshawa and tough times in Calgary.

In the recording you can hear her taking a deep breath before the conversation begins.

“I actually feel really uncomfortable having this conversation because it’s wrong,” Wilson-Raybould says on the tape.

“Does he understand the gravity of what this potentially could mean? This is not just about saving jobs. This is about interfering with one of our fundamental institutions. This is like, breaching a constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence,” Wilson-Raybould asks Wernick about Trudeau.

“Well I don’t think he sees it as that,” Wernick said, offering that it was a case of people talking past eachother.

“Well then nobody’s explaining that to him, Michael,” she replied.

The conversation ended with Wilson-Raybould saying that she was “waiting for the other shoe to drop,” and that ""I am not under any illusion how the prime minister has and gets things that he wants. I am just stuck doing the best job that I can.""

After she got off the call, the new evidence shows that she texted her then-chief of staff Jessica Prince that “the s**** is going to hit the fan.”

In her written submission Wilson-Raybould said she recorded the conversation because she “I had reason to believe that it was likely to be an inappropriate conversation.” She said she had never done this before, and has not done so since, recognizing that her recording of this conversation would otherwise be inappropriate

Law societies in Canada prohibit lawyers from knowingly recording conversations with clients without their knowledge, including the Law Society of Ontario, which Wilson-Raybould belongs to. In a statement the Society told CTV News that it “does not comment on possible breaches of the Rules of Professional Conduct.""

“I did this simply to ensure that my notes were accurate and given the ongoing pressure and attempts to interfere in this case, the nature of conversations that had occurred… and my strong suspicion that this matter would continue to escalate in even more inappropriate ways,” she wrote.

Her unprecedented decision to then make the recording public as part of her submission was done, she says, to allow Canadians to decide for themselves whether Wernick’s comments amount to the “veiled threats” that she alleges, and which he denies.

Wernick will soon be retiring from his job as Canada’s top public servant, a decision he says is because there ""is no path for me to have a relationship of mutual trust and respect with the leaders of the Opposition parties,"" after both the Conservatives and New Democrats have called for his resignation given his role in the still unfolding controversy.

COPIES OF TEXTS, EMAILS

In her initial hours-long committee appearance she offered an in-depth account of approximately 20 exchanges --10 phone calls and 10 meetings -- specifically on the SNC-Lavalin case. She also worked through a chronology of communications, ranging from in-person meetings and phone calls, to text messages and emails, from 11 senior staffers from the Prime Minister's Office, Privy Council Office and the finance minister's office.

Throughout her testimony, she cautioned there were limitations in her ability to speak broadly about the case because of the specifics of the waiver of solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had issued.

What she has handed over to the committee stays within the lines of what is permitted in the waiver, which includes any relevant information related to the case against SNC-Lavalin over her years-long tenure as attorney general.

Contained within the new documents are transcripts as well as screen shots of conversations she or Prince had. These include email exchanges with members of Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s office who the documents describe as being involved in the “mucking around” on the case.

In one it details a phone call Prince had with Morneau’s deputy chief of staff Justin To, in which he allegedly said that Wilson-Raybould had “a philosophical problem” with the entire promise of a deferred prosecution agreement, which remains a yet-to-be-used tool that this government passed through an omnibus budget bill last year.

“She hated it the whole time and wouldn't even use it if we could,"" To is quoted as saying to Prince, who said that was incorrect.

It also includes the conversation between Wilson-Raybould and Prince about a meeting Prince was asked to have with Trudeau’s chief of staff Katie Telford and then-principal adviser Gerald Butts.

In the instance of the meeting between Trudeau’s top two staffers and Prince, the text messages back up Wilson-Raybould’s telling of the interactions, and contradicts Butts saying during his March 6 committee appearance that “there was no urgency to attend that meeting.”

The meeting request was labeled “URGENT” the documents show.

Though the texts do not offer any evidence to dispute Butts’ saying that the recounting of the exchange with Prince was taken out of context and that he had a ""very different recollection of that meeting.""

MORE DETAILS ON RESIGNATION

Wilson-Raybould’s submission also shed new light on the series of events that led to her ultimately resigning from her role as veterans’ affairs minister, which she was shuffled into in January.

She had previously told the committee that she believed she was shuffled out of her job because of her refusal to change her mind about the case, but in the new statement Wilson-Raybould said she took Trudeau at his word when he insisted that wasn’t the case.

Though, at the time she says she made the decision to resign if her replacement decided to issue a directive to interfere in the SNC-Lavalin matter, “as this would confirm my suspicions as to the reason for the shuffle of me in particular.”

A deferred prosecution agreement has not been pursued by current Justice Minister and Attorney General David Lametti, though the government has made signals that they aren’t ruling it out.

She also confirmed that she was offered the Indigenous services job, as Butts had testified. She said she was shocked they’d offer it to her since she says she made it clear from the moment the Liberals started assembling a transition team, that she’d never be able to fill that role.

Wilson-Raybould also said that she had a series of meetings with Trudeau in Vancouver after the initial story broke, and in the days before she ended up resigning from cabinet on Feb. 12.

“The prime minister stated publicly when issues about the propriety of the government’s conduct in relation to the SNC matter arose that my ongoing presence in Cabinet spoke for itself. I resigned the next day and I trust my resignation also speaks for itself,” Wilson-Raybould says in her statement.

OPPOSITION RESPONSE

In the opening remarks of the new documents, Wilson-Raybould says her view is that the real issues at the heart of the SNC-Lavalin scandal are not about “how things are ‘experienced’” or considerations like caucus dynamics, political ambitions, or poll numbers. Rather she says it is about prosecutorial independence, the rule of law, and Canada’s democratic institutions.

She also offers that she thinks all sides should be working across party lines to fix what she calls “fissures and weaknesses” in Canadian institutions, and that she looks forward to a future where “we truly do politics differently,” seeming to lean on a phrase Trudeau regularly touted during the 2015 campaign.

The opposition wanted to invite Wilson-Raybould back to testify again -- something she was open to -- but Liberal MPs on the House Justice Committee shut down the study, saying that they’d heard all they needed to.

Wilson-Raybould also offered that while she has nothing further to add to the formal process, if she was asked or compelled to participate in a future investigation or parliamentary process, she would.

In a statement reacting to the new information, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called it “concrete evidence that proves Justin Trudeau led a campaign to politically interfere in SNC-Lavalin’s criminal prosecution.” He called the entire affair “corruption on top of corruption on top of corruption.”

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said the evidence was “so compelling and well-documented” that an independent public inquiry is needed.

“The PMO has tried to spin this as a miscommunication or personal disagreement… The former Attorney General repeatedly made clear to the Prime Minister and those around him that their inappropriate actions would be seen as political interference – and they ignored her,” Singh said in a statement.

Since her testimony, Trudeau has faced calls to resign, the House of Commons agenda has been largely usurped by opposition-prompted procedural moves, and several other high-profile officials have resigned amid insistence that nothing improper occurred.

The PMO’s statement claims that “all facts are on the table now,” and that the Liberal government is focused on “moving forward as a team on the issues that matter to Canadians and governing in the best interests of the country.”

All eyes are set to be on Parliament Hill when MPs return on Monday, particularly when Liberal MPs convene for their weekly caucus meeting on Wednesday. There, it is likely that the developments that have occurred on this file over the last few days will come up, as some of her colleagues are expected to get up and call for her removal.

She also raises further questions about whether her replacement has decided to cut a deal with the Montreal firm by stating that she when she accepted her new role as minister of veterans affairs, she also decided to “immediately resign” if Attorney General David Lametti made the decision to offer SNC-Lavalin a deal.

Released on Friday afternoon, the audio recording is of a phone call previously described by the former attorney general as having taken place on Dec. 19, 2018, and as being the one in which she said Wernick, the country’s top civil servant, made “veiled threats” against her over her refusal to offer a deal to the firm.

It corroborates virtually all details of Wilson-Raybould’s explosive four-hour testimony on the SNC-Lavalin affair on Feb. 27, 2019, and shows the former attorney general told Wernick repeatedly the conversations both he and other senior political staff were having with her were “wrong.”

“Michael, I have to say, including this conversation, previous conversations I’ve had with the PM and people around him are entirely inappropriate. It is political interference,” Wilson-Raybould tells Wernick during the 17-minute phone call, released as part of a package of additional material submitted by her to the House of Commons justice committee after Liberal members there blocked attempts by the opposition to invite her back to testify a second time.

“It can’t be politically motivated. All of this screams of that.”

Wernick, who is the country’s top civil servant, denied making threats to her during his second appearance at the justice committee earlier this month.

But his defence of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau quickly came under fire from the opposition parties, who described him as overly partisan and called for his resignation.

Wernick announced last week he had decided to retire early. He’s expected to step down on April 19.

In the recording, Wernick can be heard telling Wilson-Raybould again and again that Trudeau was in a “mood” and that “I think the way he sees it and the advice he’s getting is you still have things you can do that are entirely lawful.”

WATCH BELOW: Michael Wernick on SNC-Lavalin case says ‘I made no threats’

Wernick continued, telling her that “He’s in a pretty firm frame of mind about this so I’m a bit worried.”

“A bit worried about what?” Wilson-Raybould asks.

“It’s not a good idea for the PM and his attorney general to be at loggerheads,” Wernick responds, adding that Trudeau “doesn’t have the power to do what he wants, all the tools are in your hands.”

Wilson-Raybould responded by telling him, “I’m having thoughts of the Saturday Night Massacre here.”

She acknowledged in her submission that recording Wernick was wrong but that she made the decision to do so out of concerns the conversation would follow the pattern of those she says she had previously and also be inappropriate.

READ MORE: Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick retiring amid questions over his role in SNC-Lavalin affair

In her submission package, Wilson-Raybould also offered new information on her level of concern that her replacement, Attorney General David Lametti, might offer the same deal she had refused to intervene in the case to help SNC-Lavalin secure.

Under the terms of the waivers of solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidentiality, she has consistently maintained that she cannot discuss what ultimately led to her resignation from cabinet after she made the decision to accept the role of minister of veterans affairs.

“I did make another decision at this time — that I would immediately resign if the new Attorney General decided to issue a directive in the SNC-Lavalin matter as this would confirm my suspicions as to the reason for the shuffle for me in particular,” she wrote.

That decision, she said, was made while she was still attorney general and so is included in her submission.

WATCH BELOW: What was being asked of Jody Wilson-Raybould over SNC-Lavalin was ‘unprecedented’

Opposition critics were quick to argue the material also showed she had in fact raised concerns about political interference over and over again with political officials, which contradicts assertions by both Wernick and Gerald Butts, former principal secretary to Trudeau, that she never raised concerns.

In a statement on Friday, the Prime Minister’s Office said Wernick did not brief Trudeau on his conversation with Wilson-Raybould, and they were unaware of the “full contents” of the recording until Friday.

The statement referenced “an erosion of trust” between Wilson-Raybould, the PMO and Wernick, and said Trudeau would have liked to have spoken directly with the former attorney general about the SNC-Lavalin issue.

“He wishes that she had come to him,” Trudeau’s spokesman said, adding that steps are being taken to address the issues raised by the case.

“All the facts are on the table now, and everyone involved has shared their perspective, including the prime minister. We are focused on moving forward as a team on the issues that matter to Canadians and governing in the best interests of the country.”

WATCH: Trudeau says Liberal caucus is ‘strong and united’

In her testimony before the committee, Wilson-Raybould had described as a “consistent and sustained effort” by senior officials within government, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, to pressure her into intervening in the SNC-Lavalin criminal case.

Her testimony was prompted by a Globe and Mail report, outlining allegations of pressure on her that was published on Feb. 7, 2019.

Trudeau initially called the report “false” but later defended what he described as discussions about potential job losses if SNC-Lavalin, a Montreal engineering giant, were forced to face trial and potential conviction on the corruption and fraud charges against it.

He brushed off questions about the veracity of the original report on Feb. 11 by saying that Wilson-Raybould’s continued presence in cabinet “speaks for itself.”

COMMENTARY: Justin Trudeau’s handling of the Jody Wilson-Raybould matter likely wouldn’t fly in the corporate world

But on Feb. 12, Wilson-Raybould resigned from his cabinet.

“I resigned the next day and I trust my resignation also speaks for itself,” she wrote in her submission.

She had been shuffled out of the attorney general portfolio the month previously and into the role of minister of veterans affairs.

She told the justice committee in her testimony last month that she believed the move was because of her refusal to take the unprecedented — but legal — step of overruling the director of public prosecutions.

Kathleen Roussel, the director, had decided to proceed with criminal charges despite heavy lobbing from the company for a new legal tool called a remediation or deferred prosecution agreement.

Such a tool was created after lobbying by the company last year and would let a firm facing a reasonable chance of conviction admit wrongdoing and pay a fine.

Conviction in court could carry a 10-year ban on bidding for federal contracts.

SNC-Lavalin lead estimator Paul Lemay says Nalcor Energy project team members were always around him at the project office on Torbay Road in St. John’s.

He said they approved the appointment of every member of his team. They checked in every morning to ask what he would be working on. They hovered, he says.

“We had Nalcor on our back almost every day,” he said, while on the stand at the Muskrat Falls Inquiry on Friday. “I think it was overdoing it a little bit.”

But while he wasn’t a fan of the management approach, Lemay spent much of Friday also testifying about how his 11-person team’s estimate was not interfered with by the project owner.

There was some dancing around it, but he was finally asked point blank if Nalcor Energy ever attempted to change or influence his numbers, before they were formally documented and filed in 2011.

“Never,” he said. He later reiterated: “They never did that.”

The relationship between SNC-Lavalin and Nalcor Energy changed in 2012. SNC-Lavalin had been contracted for engineering, procurement and construction management (EPCM) on the project but, as the inquiry has heard from other witnesses, clashes between SNC and Nalcor personnel and disappointment over parts of the early estimate were part of a decision to change to an “integrated management” team.

Lemay supported previous testimony that SNC personnel were moved from more private offices out into the “bull pen” of cubicles at Torbay Road. He reported to Nalcor’s Jason Kean and Mark Turpin as of early 2012, and says they were all talking more at that point about the estimate numbers and overall costs.

There were puts and takes to what SNC-Lavalin filed in 2011.

“I was not responsible anymore,” Lemay said.

SNC-Lavalin was not tasked with estimating costs for the Strait of Belle Isle subsea cable crossing, or risk and contingencies. That was always Nalcor Energy’s responsibility in developing a total project cost estimate.

The $6.2-billion capital cost announced to the public at the end of 2012 was a combination of SNC-Lavalin’s submission at the end of 2011 for the bulk of the project’s capital budget, plus edits in 2012 and the other estimating work Nalcor was responsible for.

Lemay testified there was no SNC-Lavalin “basis of estimate” finalized after the mid-December 2011 submission. The $6.2 billion trumpeted at sanctioning was a Nalcor estimate.

While on the stand, Lemay did say the SNC-Lavalin estimate in 2011 used labour rates that were provided by Nalcor Energy, which were arrived at before project trades agreements were settled.

“If the final union agreement matched that number, I don’t know sir,” he said, again referring to his change in status in 2012 and the difference he saw between what SNC-Lavalin contributed in 2011 to what came thereafter.

On labour, he said the estimate he signed off on did factor in the fact the Hebron offshore oil platform construction was ongoing in Newfoundland and that could affect the availability of top people for Muskrat Falls work, particularly early on.

Commission associate counsel Michael Collins asked many questions about benchmarking for the figures Lemay used in the 2011 filing, diving deep in the example of concrete work, challenging reasonableness of the benchmarking there, productivity concerns and Lemay’s understanding of the project he was costing.

Lemay’s lawyer, Sheilagh Murphy, noted the back and forth was all based on a very small sampling of a few pages, from a basis of estimate covering roughly 54 binders-worth of documents.

Lemay transferred back to Montreal from St. John’s in January 2014 and continued work on the Muskrat Falls project until December 2018. He continues to attribute the end of his work on the project at least in part to his participation in the inquiry, although he acknowledged he has no evidence to that effect.

384,Politics,2019-03-29T21:56:00.0000000Z,"The country's top bureaucrat gave Jody Wilson-Raybould a blunt warning about Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's desire for a special deal for SNC-Lavalin, saying — in a recorded telephone conversation released publicly today — that the PM wanted to ""get ...","The country's top bureaucrat warned Jody Wilson-Raybould that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was ""quite determined"" to prevent SNC-Lavalin's criminal trial from leading to job losses — and wanted to know why the then-justice minister hadn't used a new legal tool to allow the company to avoid a criminal trial.

A recording made by Wilson-Raybould of a 17-minute Dec. 19 call between herself and Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick was released today, along with 43 pages of emails, texts and a written statement from Wilson-Raybould herself which were tabled to the Commons justice committee.

Wernick — who was not aware he was being recorded — told the minister there was ""rising anxiety"" over the fate of a major employer.

""He's quite determined, quite firm,"" Wernick said of the prime minister's position on getting a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) for the Quebec-based engineering company. ""But he wants to know why the DPA route, which Parliament provided for, isn't being used. And I think he's going to find a way to get it done, one way or another.""

Listen to the call:

In her written statement, Wilson-Raybould explains why she recorded the call.

She said she normally has a staff member present to take careful notes, but on this occasion she was alone in her Vancouver condo.

""I was anxious to ensure that I had an exact record of what was discussed as I had reason to believe that it was likely to be an an inappropriate conversation,"" she wrote.

""So while I typed out notes during the phone call, I took the extraordinary and otherwise inappropriate step of making an audio recording of the conversation without so advising the Clerk. This is something that I have never done before this phone call and have not done since.""

Why she resigned

In her statement, Wilson-Raybould also sheds new light on why she resigned from cabinet on Feb. 12.

Conservatives have suggested she was fired from the justice portfolio and moved to Veterans Affairs for refusing to budge on the SNC-Lavalin matter.

But Wilson-Raybould said that while she initially thought she'd been shunted to Veterans over the SNC-Lavalin affair, she ultimately decided that was not the reason.

""After much reflection, I decided to take the prime minister at his word, that this was not the case, and accepted a post I was honoured to have as the Minister of Veterans Affairs and Associate Minister of National Defence,"" she wrote.

Wilson-Raybould went on to say that a subsequent series of meetings with Trudeau in Vancouver, and a Feb. 11 news conference, led to her resignation:

""The prime minister stated publicly, when issues about the propriety of the government's conduct in relation to the SNC matter arose, that my ongoing presence in cabinet spoke for itself. I resigned the next day, and I trust my resignation also speaks for itself.""

That news conference came just days after the explosive Feb. 7 Globe and Mail story which first reported the allegations of inappropriate political pressure on Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case.

When Trudeau was asked at that press conference about inappropriate pressure on Wilson-Raybould, he said she ""confirmed"" a conversation she had with him in the fall where he said any decision on the matter was hers alone. He said he was limited in terms of what more he could say because of cabinet confidentiality.

""In our system of government, of course, her presence in cabinet should actually speak for itself,"" he said at the time.

While Wilson-Raybould and former cabinet minister Jane Philpott have suggested there is much more to tell in the story, today Wilson-Raybould said she has now divulged all her relevant information.

""I do not believe I have anything further to offer a formal process regarding this specific matter, though of course if compelled or asked to participate in a judicial, investigative or parliamentary process I would do so,"" she said.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said this is more evidence the prime minister has lost the moral authority to govern and must resign.

""Justin Trudeau also told Canadians what he knew to be false,"" he said. ""He knew that his attorney general had serious concerns about his plan to get SNC-Lavalin off of serious criminal charges. But he looked Canadians in the eye and told them that no one had raised concerns with him. This is false and he owes Canadians an explanation.""

MONTREAL — Quebec's pension fund manager could play an outsize role in whether SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. eventually pulls up stakes for the United States.

The engineering and construction giant told federal prosecutors that its ""Plan B"" in the event of criminal prosecution on corruption charges is to move its headquarters south of the border and shed more than 60 per cent of its 8,700 Canadian jobs, internal documents reveal.

Quebec's Caisse de depot et placement holds a roughly 20 per cent stake in SNC-Lavalin, making it far and away the biggest shareholder. The pension fund also has a $1.5-billion loan agreement with SNC-Lavalin stipulating that the firm must remain rooted in Montreal until at least 2024, though refinancing may be an option.

The roughly $1.18 billion in company shares held by the Caisse — which has a mandate to grow Quebec business — gives the pension fund extra clout at the boardroom table, said Altacorp Capital analyst Chris Murray said. The loan, while partially paid off, adds leverage to a pension fund whose investing pedigree carries respect.

""A 20 per cent shareholder has some pretty significant influence,"" Murray said.

The Caisse also aims to grow its investments, making a move to the U.S. potentially more attractive as conflicting mandates collide, said Karl Moore, an associate professor at McGill University's business school.

""SNC being one of our larger firms, it would absolutely fall within [its] mandate and the Caisse would not want them to move. On the other hand, as good business people, they might see that as the best course.

""They absolutely would have a pipeline to [CEO] Neil Bruce,"" Moore added.

Last month Caisse chief executive Michael Sabia said the pension fund would ""be a rock'"" for SNC-Lavalin and ready to boost its stake in the company, barring any technical barriers.

The Caisse declined to comment for this story.

Internal SNC-Lavalin documents — part of a PowerPoint presentation for prosecutors last September and obtained by The Canadian Press — state that criminal prosecution ""will likely have very negative consequences for Canadian employees, shareholders, pensioners, customers"" and other groups.

Earlier in the week, the firm walked back a statement by its chief executive, who said he never cited the protection of 9,000 Canadian jobs as a reason the construction giant should be granted a remediation agreement.

Opinions vary on the impact of an exit by the 108-year-old company.

SNC-Lavalin is working on the five biggest infrastructure projects in the country, according to trade magazine ReNew Canada. Those contracts alone amount to $52.8 billion, and include projects for Bruce Power and the Darlington nuclear plant in Ontario as well as the Site C dam in B.C.

""It will be sad, very sad, because we will lose decision centres, we will lose key jobs and all of the impacts on the accounting firms and law firms,"" said Michel Nadeau, a former Caisse executive.

Local construction contractors and suppliers would likely find work for other firms while sought-after SNC-Lavalin layoffs would quickly be snapped up, he said.

But the disruption would still be sizable, according to Murray. ""You just can't take something of that magnitude out of the system and not expect there to be impacts.""

On Thursday, the Montreal-based engineering company announced an official restructuring of its business, and made three leadership changes adding to earlier turnover in its ranks.

The company framed the changes as an attempt to “de-risk” its business by consolidating certain business segments. It follows several damaging mishaps, including the loss of a $350-million contract in Chile earlier this month, and a cloud that moved over its oil and gas business particularly in Saudi Arabia, both of which led to major writedowns and earnings revisions.

“This new organizational structure will position us for further improving project delivery, driving sustainable growth and more consistent cash flow generation,” Neil Bruce, chief executive of SNC, said in a press release.

The company has twice slashed its profit forecasts this year and last month it reported a $1.6-billion loss for the fourth quarter. That prompted Standard & Poor’s Ratings agency to downgrade its credit from BBB to BBB minus, the lowest investment grade rating for its bonds to still be eligible for bank investment.

Part of its losses flowed from a dispute with the Chilean-run copper producer Codelco.

In January, Bruce said he was “deeply disappointed” in his mining team for cost overruns on the project, and the company’s chief financial officer said it would result in hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. Earlier this week, SNC confimed it had been fired from a $350-million contract to build acid plants for Codelco, and walked back claims that it hoped to resolve that dispute on an accelerated time frame.

That project was an engineering, procurement and construction contract, in which SNC agreed to design and build the project at a set price. Such contracts are higher risk as the company is responsible for cost overruns.

As part of the restructuring, SNC announced a new “project oversight” position to “foresee and fix project-related issues in a timely fashion,” that will report directly to Bruce.

He has stressed to investors that there won’t be any future debacles similar to what happened with Codelco on its outstanding EPC contracts.

“We have gone through 20 of our top contracts,” Bruce said during the last earnings call in February. “In terms of the work we do in this arena … we’ve done all the checks again to make sure that what we approved is what we signed and that they are on track and we don’t have anything of any similar nature whatsoever.”

This new organizational structure will position us for further improving project delivery, driving sustainable growth and more consistent cash flow generation SNC CEO Neil Bruce

Per its restructuring on Thursday, the company is focusing on four core segments including nuclear, infrastructure, resources and lastly, engineering, design and project management, or EDPM.

It will also have a technology business, which includes clean power and cybersecurity, and its capital business, meaning six discrete units down from seven.

SNC also announced new people to lead its EDPM, capital and resources segments — the last of which combines the old mining with the oil and gas segment.

This follows the appointment of a new chief operating officer Ian Edwards in January, a replacement named to succeed him as head of infrastructure, and the planned exit of its former head of the oil and gas business unit this summer.

Meanwhile, in Ottawa, the company has faced heightened scrutiny after former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould testified earlier this month that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s administration pressured her to reach a settlement with SNC on longstanding criminal charges that it bribed Libyan government officials.

The entire situation has lead to growing speculation about whether SNC may seek to break up some of its business, and sell certain units. Market reaction to the latest news was tepid, with the price barely moving from around $34.

The federal government announced Friday that Ian Shugart will take over as clerk of the Privy Council on April 19, which also marks the last day of Wernick’s nearly 38-year career in the public service.

Opposition parties called for Wernick’s resignation after he vehemently rejected allegations that he and other senior government officials improperly pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to halt a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Wernick’s combative testimony to the House of Commons justice committee was denounced as partisan and unbecoming of a senior bureaucrat who is supposed to be impartial.

In a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on March 18, Wernick said he would retire before this fall’s federal election campaign kicks off, but didn’t provide a departure date.

He noted at the time that the clerk of the Privy Council is supposed to be “an impartial arbiter of whether serious foreign interference” occurs during the campaign as part of a new federal watchdog panel.

The clerk is also supposed to be ready to help whichever party is elected to form government, he said, adding that he did not believe he could fulfill either role.

Shugart is a long-serving member of the federal public service. Over the last decade, he has been deputy minister at Environment Canada, Employment and Social Development Canada, and since 2016, Global Affairs Canada.

Wernick has been clerk of the Privy Council since 2016, shortly after the Trudeau Liberals assumed office. Government insiders have previously said he wanted to retire as clerk a year ago, but was persuaded to stay on.

Wilson-Raybould accused Wernick of making “veiled threats” that she’d lose her job as justice minister and attorney general if she didn’t halt the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin on charges of bribery and corruption related to contracts in Libya.

She said Trudeau and others inappropriately pressured her to instruct the director of public prosecutions to negotiate a remediation agreement with the Montreal engineering giant, which would force the company to pay stiff penalties while avoiding the risk of criminal conviction that could threaten its financial viability.

Wernick has denied the accusation and maintained that all concerned acted with the highest standards of integrity.

He has also maintained everything he did was within the boundaries of acceptable behaviour for his job of aiding the prime minister and cabinet as a non-partisan public servant.

The Canadian Press





OTTAWA -- Five things we learned from a written and audio submission made by former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to the House of Commons justice committee Friday.

On the cabinet shuffle

Trudeau's former principal secretary Gerald Butts told the justice committee Wilson-Raybould was shuffled because they needed someone to fill in Indigenous Affairs and she refused. He said a minister has to serve at the pleasure of the prime minister and a refusal to be moved couldn't stand.

Wilson-Raybould says she told Trudeau and his former principal secretary, Gerald Butts, she couldn't understand the rationale for being part of the January cabinet shuffle, and that she had told them many times in the past that she would never take on a job of ""delivering services to Indians"" under the Indian Act and was shocked that she was then offered the Indigenous Services ministry.

Butts told the justice committee in March he didn't know her position on that when the offer was made but acknowledged he should have known.

Wilson-Raybould also denies she ever referred to being attorney general as her ""dream job"" and instead said she thinks it was Butts who said it. Butts told the committee she called it her dream job when she was told she was being shuffled.

She said she took Trudeau at his word that the shuffle was not related to the SNC-Lavalin matter and agreed to take the job of veterans affairs minister, but said she made a decision to ""immediately resign if the new Attorney General"" issued a directive about the SNC-Lavalin case because it would confirm her suspicions she was moved for not intervening.

On her resignation from cabinet

Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet on Feb. 12, but told the justice committee in her live testimony that she couldn't discuss the conversations she had with Trudeau on the reasons.

In her written submission, she is more clear about why she resigned, pointing to a comment Trudeau made to the media on Feb. 11.

""The Prime Minister stated publicly when issues about the propriety of the government's conduct in relation to the SNC matter arose that my ongoing presence in Cabinet spoke for itself,"" Wilson-Raybould wrote.

""I resigned the next day and I trust my resignation also speaks for itself.""

Some Liberals felt Wilson-Raybould didn't like remediation agreements in general

Finance Minister Bill Morneau's deputy chief of staff, Justin To, in a phone call with Wilson-Raybould's chief of staff, Jessica Prince complained that Wilson-Raybould was not intervening in the SNC-Lavalin case because she ""has a philosophical problem"" with remediation agreements and ""wouldn't even use it if we could."" He calls it ironic that Wilson-Raybould is in favour of restorative justice in some sense but not for SNC-Lavalin.

Prince tells him ""that is absolutely not true.""

To apologized in a follow-up email and then Prince laid out for him all the things Wilson-Raybould had done in favour of remediation agreements.

Disagreement with her deputy minister

Nathalie Drouin, the deputy minister of justice, told the justice committee that Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick, had asked her office for a briefing on the consequences, including job losses, if SNC-Lavalin did not get a remediation agreement, but that once that document was prepared, Wilson-Raybould ordered her not to give it to Wernick or anyone else in the Privy Council Office.

Wilson-Raybould denies that she ever knew about the memo or that she ordered Drouin not to hand it over to Wernick. She also says given that she had told Wernick she had made her decision she was not sure why he would have asked for such an opinion anyway.

Former prime minister Kim Campbell

Prince alleges that in a conversation with Butts, he pointed to a case involving former prime minister Brian Mulroney and the case of David Milgaard, who was wrongfully convicted for murder in 1970, and exonerated more than two decades later. Butts allegedly told Prince that Kim Campbell, who was then the attorney general, was asked by Mulroney to review the case after Mulroney met with Milgaard's mother. Campbell, who would replace Mulroney as prime minister in 1993, is reported to have told Mulroney she couldn't because it would interfere in an independent process.

Wilson-Raybould says she fact-checked the story with Campbell in Vancouver the next day over coffee, adding the former Tory prime minister had a ""vivid memory of the case.""

""She categorically denied what Mr. Butts had said and was quite offended and outraged by the comments. She adamantly denied the characterization not only of her as the Attorney General, but also of her former boss, Prime Minister Mulroney,"" Wilson-Raybould wrote.

Mulroney was ""too good a lawyer to intervene improperly in the matter,"" Wilson-Raybould recounted Campbell telling her.",Five things in Wilson-Raybould's written evidence on the SNC-Lavalin affair,CTV Toronto News,https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/five-things-in-wilson-raybould-s-written-evidence-on-the-snc-lavalin-affair-1.4358461
390,Politics,2019-03-30T04:48:00.0000000Z,OTTAWA — A trove of detailed evidence documenting Jody Wilson-Raybould’s final days as justice minister and attorney general — including a secretly-recorded phone call with then-Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick — has reinforced her claim that ...,"OTTAWA — A trove of detailed evidence documenting Jody Wilson-Raybould’s final days as justice minister and attorney general — including a secretly-recorded phone call with then-Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick — has reinforced her claim that government officials attempted to interfere in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin and undermined the accounts of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and some of his top aides.

The evidence, submitted to the House of Commons justice committee Tuesday and made public Friday, shows that Wilson-Raybould repeatedly warned top officials working for Trudeau that they were attempting to politically interfere in a criminal prosecution, violating a constitutional principle.

In an extraordinary 17-minute phone call on Dec. 19, 2018, Wernick can be heard telling Wilson-Raybould that Trudeau was “determined” to find a way for Montreal-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin to get a deferred prosecution, despite Wilson-Raybould’s insistence that it was wrong to overrule the prosecution service’s decision to proceed with a trial.

“This is not a great place for me to be in,” Wilson-Raybould tells Wernick near the end of the phone call. “But what I am confident of is that I have given the Prime Minister my best advice to protect him and to protect the constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence.”

“Alright, but … I am worried about a collision then because he is pretty firm about this,” Wernick replies, referring to Trudeau. “I just saw him a few hours ago and this is really important to him.”

Ending the phone call, Wilson-Raybould tells Wernick she is waiting for “the other shoe to drop.”

“I am not under any illusion how the Prime Minister has and gets things that he wants,” she said.

Less than three weeks after that phone call, Wilson-Raybould was told she would be removed as justice minister and shuffled into a different cabinet role. She said the Prime Minister’s Office denied that it was over the SNC-Lavalin issue.

Wilson-Raybould’s evidence also includes lengthy text-message exchanges between herself and her chief of staff, Jessica Prince. In one conversation, Prince details a conversation she had on Dec. 18, 2018, with Trudeau’s top aides, Chief of Staff Katie Telford and then-Principal Secretary Gerald Butts.

Prince said that Telford and Butts were adamant that SNC-Lavalin get a deferred prosecution, and that Butts in particular didn’t care about respecting the Public Prosecution Service of Canada, given it had been created as an independent body under former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper.

“Gerry kept talking about how it was created by Harper,” Prince said in a text message. “I was like ‘sure but it is what we have and we have to respect the statute.’ No scruples.”

“So crazy,” responded Wilson-Raybould. “Gerry said the same thing to me.”

I am not under any illusion how the Prime Minister has and gets things that he wants

The new material shows that Wilson-Raybould repeatedly said that she felt the pressure being put on her was inappropriate and constituted an attempt at political interference — despite the fact that Trudeau, Butts and Wernick have all contended that Wilson-Raybould did not bring her concerns forward at the time.

“If anyone, particularly the attorney general, felt that we were not doing our job fully, responsibly and according to all the rules, as a government, it was her responsibility to come forward to me this past fall and highlight that directly to me,” said Trudeau on Feb. 12, 2018. “She did not. Nobody did.”

After the material was released, Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer repeated his call for Trudeau’s resignation, which he first made following Wilson-Raybould’s committee testimony on Feb. 27.

“(Trudeau) looked Canadians in the eye and told them that no one had raised concerns with him,” he said in a statement. “This is false and he owes Canadians an explanation. The entire SNC-Lavalin scandal is corruption on top of corruption on top of corruption. Two cabinet ministers have resigned on principle and both Justin Trudeau’s top political advisor and his top civil servant have resigned in disgrace. The Prime Minister has lost the moral authority to govern and must resign.”

NDP leader Jagmeet Singh called the material “so compelling and well-documented that we must have an independent public inquiry to get to the truth.”

“The PMO has tried to spin this as a miscommunication or personal disagreement,” said Singh’s statement. “What we see in this submission is a lawyer acting in her client’s best interests to protect him from his own recklessness.”

The Prime Minister’s Office on Friday evening released a statement saying, “The Prime Minister was not briefed by the Clerk on his conversation with Jody Wilson-Raybould, and we were unaware of the full contents of this recording before today.”

In the introduction to her submission, Wilson-Raybould wrote that the context of the justice committee’s study “is the core principle of prosecutorial independence — a principle that at times appears to have been obscured by layers of commentary, hyperbole, and spin.”

Wilson-Raybould submitted the material after Liberal MPs on the Commons justice committee voted to conclude their study of the issue without inviting her to testify a second time — despite the fact they had invited Wernick twice.

She originally testified before the justice committee on Feb. 27, a four-hour-long appearance in which she described the Dec. 19 phone call with Wernick. She said she felt he was making “veiled threats,” and that she’d told Wernick she was having thoughts of the Saturday Night Massacre — a reference to U.S. President Richard Nixon’s firing of the independent prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal.

Wernick testified to the committee on Feb. 21 and again on March 6. In his second appearance, Wernick disputed Wilson-Raybould’s version of the phone call. “That is not my recollection of the conversation,” he said when asked to respond to her description. But he said he didn’t take notes about it and didn’t have a strong memory of what was said.

“I do not have an independent recollection of the event. I did not wear a wire, record the conversation or take extemporaneous notes,” he said.

In her Feb. 27 appearance, Wilson-Raybould had not told the committee she’d recorded the call. In her submission published today, in which she provided both the transcript and the audio of the call, she said she made the recording because she didn’t have a staff member with her to take notes, and because she “had reason to believe that it was likely to be an inappropriate conversation.”

“So while I typed out notes during the phone call, I took the extraordinary and otherwise inappropriate step of making an audio recording of the conversation without so advising the Clerk,” she wrote. “This is something that I have never done before this phone call and have not done since.”

During the phone call, Wilson-Raybould made clear several times that she was uncomfortable. “Again, I am surprised that you and I are having this conversation, but I’m just saying that I really feel uncomfortable about the appropriateness of this conversation,” she said at one point.

I am not seeing anything inappropriate here

The audio recording confirms Wilson-Raybould’s description of her conversation with Wernick during her February testimony.

In the call, Wernick said Trudeau was concerned about potential job losses and wanted “to be able to say that he has tried everything he can, you know, within a legitimate toolbox, to try to head that off,” including consulting an external legal expert like former Supreme Court Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin.

Wilson-Raybould repeatedly raised concerns about prosecutorial independence. She said that if she were to step in and order the director of public prosecutions to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement, “there is no way that anybody would interpret this other than interference.”

“It does not matter how I would look in doing that — I would be a mockery, and that is not the problem — the bigger problem is what it would look like down the road for the government,” she told Wernick.

“One, it has never been done before, but two, this is going to look like nothing but political interference by the prime minister, by you, by everyone else that has been involved in politically pressuring me to do this.”

Wernick insisted that he and the other officials approaching her on this issue were acting lawfully. “You are not just the attorney general, you are the minister of justice in a cabinet,” he said. “I am not seeing anything inappropriate here.”

Wilson-Raybould was on guard about her conversation with Wernick in part because of the meeting that Prince, her chief of staff, had taken with Telford and Butts the day before.

In a text message on Dec. 18, Prince said there was “nothing new” being provided as evidence from the Prime Minister’s Office on why to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case.

“They want external counsel retained to give you an opinion on whether you can review the DPP’s decision here and whether you should in this case,” she told Wilson-Raybould, noting they had also suggested Beverley McLachlin.

Prince said she told Butts that such a move would amount to interference, to which she said Butts replied, “Jess, there is no solution here that doesn’t involve interference.”

“At least they are finally being honest about what they are asking you to do!” Prince then said to Wilson-Raybould.

The former attorney general responded, “OMG. I do not even know what to say to that.”

Prince said she emphasized to Butts and Telford that it was extremely important to maintain the independence of the attorney general. “They didn’t seem to get or even care. Yup, I was floored,” she said.

After her phone call with Wernick, Wilson-Raybould wrote that the next time she heard from the prime minister or anyone in his office was on Jan. 7, when Trudeau told her she was being shuffled.

Wilson-Raybould also confirmed that she had a “series of meetings” with Trudeau in Vancouver that led to her Feb. 12 resignation from cabinet in the wake of a Globe and Mail article that broke the story of allegations of political interference.

“The Prime Minister stated publicly when issues about the propriety of the government’s conduct in relation to the SNC matter arose that my ongoing presence in cabinet spoke for itself,” she wrote. “I resigned the next day and I trust my resignation also speaks for itself.”

Her brief to the Commons justice committee — the committee that had refused to allow her right of reply, after her earlier testimony had been challenged by government witnesses — is a stinging rebuke, not only to her critics within the government, but to the many partisans and media commentators who have allowed themselves to lose sight of the central issue in the SNC-Lavalin affair: the attempts, involving officials from the prime minister on down, to interfere in a criminal prosecution for political reasons, in violation of the independence of both the attorney general and the director of public prosecutions.

The headlines will be about the former attorney general’s recording of a telephone conversation last Dec. 19 between her and the then clerk of the Privy Council, Michael Wernick. The tape backs up in minute detail her previous accusations that the clerk — like the prime minister, like his former principal secretary, Gerald Butts, his chief of staff, Katie Telford, and a half a dozen other senior government officials — improperly pressured her to reverse her decision not to intervene with prosecutors in the case.

In particular, it makes hash of his denials that he made “veiled threats” that she would be removed from her job if she did not instruct the director of public prosecutions to drop charges of corruption and fraud against the company in favour of a so-called “remediation agreement.” The language is not even all that veiled:

“I think he is gonna find a way to get it done one way or another … he is in that kinda mood and I wanted you to be aware of that… he is in a pretty firm frame of mind about this so… I am a bit worried… It is not a good idea for the Prime Minister and his Attorney General to be at loggerheads.”

Neither can he claim to have been unaware she felt pressured to decide things the prime minister’s way, and that this amounted to “political interference.” She makes clear at multiple points in the conversation: that it and previous conversations with the prime minister and “many other people” were “entirely inappropriate,” that she was “uncomfortable having this conversation,” that she was “issuing the strongest warning I can possibly issue” against interfering with decisions by the DPP, that “we are treading on dangerous ground,” that “there is no way that anybody would interpret this other than interference.”

Her brief also provides new details of a meeting the previous day between her chief of staff, Jessica Prince, and Butts and Telford, though alas without the benefit of tape recordings: just Prince’s contemporaneous account, relayed to her, first via text message, later by phone. Not only are there the lines quoted previously (Butts: “Jess, there is no solution here that doesn’t involve some interference”; Telford: “We don’t want to debate legalities any more.”), but further evidence of Butts’s dismissive attitude towards the independence of the DPP. Prince reports:

“They clearly do not care about the (Public Prosecution Service of Canada.) Gerry kept talking about how it was created by Harper. I was like ‘sure but it is what we have and we have to respect the statute.’ No scruples”

And there are further troubling allegations about the proposed involvement of external counsel — the name of former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Beverley McLachlin, keeps coming up — to “advise” the former attorney general on her “options”. To hear Butts’s testimony, though officials kept pressing Wilson-Raybould to seek this “advice”, it had no predetermined agenda. Wilson-Raybould’s brief suggests otherwise:

“My COS asked what if the opinion comes saying, ‘She can review it, but she shouldn’t’ or simply, ‘She can’t review it’ end of story? Mr. Butts stated, ‘It wouldn’t say that.’”

But all of this is mere detail. What is at stake in this affair remains, as Wilson-Raybould reminds the committee, nothing less than “the core principle of prosecutorial independence — a principle that at times appears to have been obscured by layers of commentary, hyperbole, and spin.” It is not, she says, “about how things are ‘experienced’, caucus dynamics, political ambitions, poll numbers, ‘erosion of trust’ or the role of social media.”

Worse yet are the facile rationalizations for interfering the prime minister’s officials have offered — among them, that “prosecutorial decisions are never final” (that’s true, as a prerogative of prosecutors, not as a pretext for endless importuning of them by political staff) or that the attorney general is entitled to seek advice (to seek it, not to have it imposed upon her), or that there were “new facts or evidence” that somehow justified their actions (there was none, Wilson-Raybould says).

There is no “middle ground” on prosecutorial independence, no room for argument on the right of the attorney general to make decisions on criminal prosecutions, free of pressure from other government officials: it is settled constitutional law, absolute and inviolable. It doesn’t matter what good reasons the prime minister might think he has.

Nor is the AG obliged to keep him apprised of her decisions in such matters (though she did). It’s quite literally none of his business.",Andrew Coyne: Wilson-Raybould recording brings SNC-Lavalin affair crashing back to reality,O Canada,https://o.canada.com/opinion/andrew-coyne-wilson-raybould-recording-brings-snc-lavalin-affair-crashing-back-to-reality/wcm/27b9818b-98e9-4a18-a135-fe9c99bb51f9

OTTAWA – Former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould’s new and supplementary evidence, including a written statement and an audio recording, have been made public.

The documents were provided to the House Justice Committee that had been studying the ongoing SNC-Lavalin scandal, before Liberal MPs shut it down.

This additional material is meant to elaborate on Wilson-Raybould’s Feb. 27 testimony. It was during this hours-long appearance that she detailed what she considered to be months of high-level political interference in an ultimately unsuccessful effort to have her instruct federal prosecutors to drop the criminal prosecution of the Quebec construction giant.

Here are some highlights from the conversation.

‘I FEEL REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE’

Jody Wilson-Raybould: “I am surprised that you and I are having this conversation, but I’m just saying I feel really uncomfortable about the appropriateness of this conversation.”

Wernick: “OK, I understand that but I mean, I think [Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s] view is that he’s not asking you to do anything inappropriate or to interfere. He’s asking you to use all the tools that you lawfully have at your disposal.”

‘HE’S IN A VERY FIRM MOOD’

Jody Wilson-Raybould: “I know I have a tool under the prosecution act that I can use. I do not believe it is appropriate to use it in this case.”

Michael Wernick: “OK. Alright. That’s clear. Well, he’s in a very firm mood about this, so, um—“

JWR: “Does he understand the gravity of what this potentially could mean? This is not just about saving jobs. This is about interfering with one of our fundamental institutions. This is like, breaching a constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence.”

Wernick: “Well I don’t think he sees it as that—“

JWR: “Well then nobody’s explaining that to him, Michael.”

‘YOU’RE NOT JUST BEING ATTORNEY GENERAL’

Wernick: “OK, I respect where you’re coming from—“

JWR: “You know what, I hope that you do, because I don’t think anybody respects this. The conversation that Gerry and Katie had with my chief of staff, and like, she wrote down what they said, like, saying that they don’t want to have anything, or hear any more about the legalities but want to talk about jobs. Entirely inappropriate.”

Wernick: “OK, well I mean, I wasn’t—“

JWR: “Well I have it. I have it all. It’s just—“

Wernick: “OK, but I mean you’re not just being attorney general, you’re the minister of justice and a cabinet [minister] – and, you have context within which you exercise your roles and your responsibilities. Like, I’m not seeing anything inappropriate here. But, um, I mean, you’re right. And the PM—I mean – people are talking past each other. I think the way he sees it and the advice he’s getting is that you still have things that you could do that are not interference and they’re still very much lawful. So--”

JWR: “And it’s not that they’re not lawful. The perception, and what will happen, is it will be deemed political interference from day one when people were talking about why are we entering into or putting a DPA regime in place. Everybody knows it was because of SNC, whether that’s true or not, that’s what people think—“

Wernick: “It’s a tool that’s used in lots of other countries, though.”

JWR: “Fair.”

Wernick: “—for these kinds of purposes. And especially if there’s been a change of ownership or management in the company that’s being prosecuted. It is a public policy tool.”

‘I’M WORRIED ABOUT A COLLISION’

Wernick: “Alright. Um, well, I don’t – I’m going to have to report back before he leaves. He’s in a pretty firm frame of mind on this though, so I’m a bit worried.”

JWR: “A bit worried about what?”

Wernick: “Well, (incompresensible) for the prime minister, for him and his attorney general to be at loggerheads. “

JWR: “I feel that I am giving him my best advice. And if he doesn’t accept that advice then it’s his prerogative to do what he wants. But I’m trying to protect the prime minister from political interference, perceived or otherwise.”

Wernick: “I understand that. But I mean he doesn’t have the power to do what he wants. All the tools are in your hands. So.”

(Long pause)

JWR: (Laughs) OK, so then, I mean, I’m having like, thoughts of the Saturday Night Massacre here, Michael. Like, to be honest with you. And this is not a great place for me to be in. I don’t relish being in this place. But I am confident of is that I have given the prime minister my advice to protect him and to protect the constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence.”

Wernick: “OK. Um, alright, but I mean (sighs) I’m worried about a collision then because he is pretty firm about this. I just saw him a few hours ago and this is really important to him.

393,,2019-03-29T23:32:00.0000000Z,OTTAWA — Jody Wilson-Raybould secretly recorded a conversation with Michael Wernick in which she claims the country's top public servant issued veiled threats that she'd lose her job as justice minister if she didn't intervene to stop the criminal ...,"OTTAWA — Jody Wilson-Raybould threw another can of gas on the SNC-Lavalin fire — and prompted calls for her expulsion from the Liberal caucus — with the revelation Friday that she secretly recorded a phone call in which she claims her job as justice minister was threatened if she didn't intervene in the criminal prosecution of the Montreal engineering giant.

An audio recording and transcript of the Dec. 19 call with Michael Wernick, the country's top public servant, was released as part of additional written testimony Wilson-Raybould submitted to the House of Commons Justice committee, which last week shut down its examination of her allegation that she was relentlessly, improperly pressured to intervene in the case.

The 17-minute recording backs up Wilson-Raybould's version of the words spoken during the conversation, about which she told the committee on Feb. 26 during nearly four hours of oral testimony. But it doesn't resolve the question of whether the Privy Council clerk's words constituted ""veiled threats,"" as she has alleged.

Wernick's tone throughout is calm and respectful, while Wilson-Raybould becomes increasingly agitated as she tries to impress on him her belief that intervening in the case would be perceived as political interference in the justice system.

""I am 100 per cent confident I'm doing nothing inappropriate,"" Wilson-Raybould can be heard telling Wernick.

""This is gonna look like nothing but political interference by the prime minister, by you, by everyone that has been involved in this, politically pressuring me to do this.""

This is something I have never done before this phone call and have not done since. Jody Wilson-Raybould

In her written submission, the former minister acknowledges the ""extraordinary and otherwise inappropriate step'' of recording the conversation. But she says she was at home alone in Vancouver at the time and was ""anxious to ensure that I had an exact record of what was discussed as I had reason to believe that it was likely to be an inappropriate conversation.''

""This is something I have never done before this phone call and have not done since.""

Wernick declined to comment directly but his lawyer, Frank Addario, said recording the call was ""inappropriate.""

""A lot of the tape is her making a speech for a different audience, since she could have just told him she did not want to discuss it further. I don't know any lawyer who records conversations with work colleagues or clients. I don't get the covert ops program or holding on to the tape for a convenient moment,"" Addario said in an email.

""She was the chief legal officer for the country. She didn't give her tape to the RCMP. She didn't give it to the PM or the Ethics Commissioner. She didn't even give it to the committee when she first testified. Most peculiar.""

Watch: Jody Wilson-Raybould says she faced 'veiled threats'

The code of conduct for the Law Society of Ontario, of which Wilson-Raybould is an honorary member, prohibits a lawyer from recording a client without the client's permission. As justice minister and attorney general at the time, Wilson-Raybould was the government's chief lawyer. A spokesman for the law society said Friday that it ""does not comment on possible breaches of the Rules of Professional Conduct.""

The Canadian Bar Association code of conduct prohibits a lawyer from recording anyone without permission.

Wilson-Raybould has said she believes she was moved out of the justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs in a mid-January shuffle as punishment for refusing to succumb to relentless pressure last fall from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his senior staff, Wernick and others to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case. She resigned from cabinet a month later.

In the recording, Wilson-Raybould repeatedly tells Wernick that the director of public prosecutions had decided to pursue a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin for bribery and fraud related to its work in Libya and that she would not use her power to step in to override that decision and insist upon a remediation agreement. Essentially akin to a plea bargain, such an agreement would mean the company would have faced stiff financial penalties while averting a possible criminal conviction.

During the call, she acknowledges she has the legal right to intervene but argues it would be unprecedented and viewed as political interference.

""This goes far beyond saving jobs. This is about the integrity of the prime minister and interference. There is no way that anybody would interpret this other than interference, if I was to step in,"" she says.

""I would be a mockery. And that is not the problem. The bigger problem is what it would look like down the road for the government.""

At another point, Wilson-Raybould says she's trying to ""protect the prime minister from political interference"" and if he doesn't accept her advice ""then it is his prerogative to do what he wants."" She tells Wernick several times she feels ""uncomfortable"" just having the conversation with him.

""I actually feel uncomfortable having this conversation. It's wrong.""

It is not a good idea for the prime minister and his attorney general to be at loggerheads. Michael Wernick

Wernick tells Wilson-Raybould that Trudeau ""wants to be able to say that he has tried everything he can within the legitimate toolbox'' to head off the possibility of SNC-Lavalin leaving the country and putting thousands of Canadians out of work. He says Trudeau is ""quite determined, quite firm'' about this and adds: ""I think he's going to find a way to get it done one way or another. So he is in that kind of mood and I wanted you to be aware of that.

""It is not a good idea for the prime minister and his attorney general to be at loggerheads,"" he says later. ""I am worried about a collision, then, because he is pretty firm about this.""

He tells Wilson-Raybould that Trudeau is ""not asking you to do anything inappropriate or to interfere. He is asking you to use all the tools you lawfully have at your disposal.""

Towards the end of the call, Wilson-Raybould tells Wernick she's ""having thoughts of the Saturday Night Massacre here"" — a reference to former U.S. President Richard Nixon's attorney general resigning rather than follow the president's order to fire the special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal. She also says she's waiting for ""the other shoe to drop.""

""I am not under any illusion how the prime minister has and gets things that he wants.""

Canadian Press Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick leaves after testifying before a justice committee on the SNC Lavalin affair on March 6, 2019.

Wernick's lawyer said nothing said by the clerk constitutes a veiled threat.

""He was asking for information that only she could give. The clerk said this (remediation agreement) is a legitimate tool and why are we not exploring it here and he asked repeatedly for an explanation to pass on to the prime minister and she refused to give it. She didn't shut the call down,"" said Addario.

Addario said Wernick did not know the call had been recorded until it was released Friday, although he appeared to anticipate it during his second appearance at the justice committee on March 6. In response to questions about his recollections about the conversation, Wernick snapped: ""I did not wear a wire, record the conversation or take extemporaneous notes.""

In a statement late Friday, the Prime Minister's Office said Wernick did not brief Trudeau about his Dec. 19 conversation with Wilson-Raybould and he was unaware of its full contents until the recording was released.

Addario said the day after the conversation, ""everyone went on holidays."" By the time they returned at beginning of January, ""the first burning issue"" was Scott Brison's retirement and the consequent cabinet shuffle.

""The SNC issue never made it back to the top of the discussion list. The clerk never discussed SNC again with the PM or PMO until someone leaked the story to The Globe and Mail in early February.""

Patrick Doyle/Reuters Jody Wilson-Raybould watches Prime Minister Justin Trudeau arrive at Rideau Hall of a cabinet shuffle on Jan. 14, 2019.

The PMO statement reiterated Trudeau's previous admission that ""he should have spoken directly"" with Wilson-Raybould about the matter and that ""he wishes she had come to him"" with her concerns about improper pressure. He again attributed the controversy to an ""erosion of trust"" between her office and his, and tried to close the door on the fiasco, which has engulfed his government for two months, cost him two cabinet ministers, his principal secretary and Wernick, who officially retires on April 19 after concluding he's lost the confidence of opposition parties following his combative testimony at committee.

""All the facts are on the table now and everyone involved has shared their perspective,"" the statement said, adding it's time to ""move forward as a team on the issues that matter to Canadians.""

If they had any sense of decency, they would resign before it would even get there. Alexandra Mendes, Liberal MP

However, Liberal backbenchers appear to be in a less forgiving mood.

Montreal MP Alexandra Mendes called Wilson-Raybould's secret recording ""horrendous"" and called for her and Jane Philpott — who resigned from cabinet earlier this month saying she had lost confidence in the government's handling of the SNC affair — to be booted out of caucus.

""If they had any sense of decency, they would resign before it would even get there,"" Mendes said in an interview, questioning why anyone would want to stay ""where they're clearly not wanted.""

Liberal MPs have been growing increasingly upset with Wilson-Raybould and Philpott's seeming desire to keep fanning the flames of the controversy and have been quietly discussing among themselves this week — a break week for Parliament — how to deal with the pair. The expectation now is that caucus members will insist on expelling them at their next meeting on Wednesday, or earlier if an emergency meeting is called. Precisely how to go about that is being debated since votes are not normally taken in caucus.

The documents released Friday also include transcripts of text messages and notes on phone calls Wilson-Raybould or her chief of staff, Jessica Prince, had with various senior government staffers.

One of them is a phone call between Prince and Justin To, Finance Minister Bill Morneau's deputy chief of staff, in which he says that there is a sense that Wilson-Raybould ""has a philosophical problem"" with the concept of remediation agreements, a new tool for dealing with cases of corporate corruption that went into effect last September.

""That she hated it the whole time and wouldn't even use it if we could,"" To allegedly told Prince, who told him that wasn't true.

'... undeniable elements of misogyny'

In her submission, Wilson-Raybould also complains that the controversy over her allegations has included ""undeniable elements of misogyny, much of it aimed at myself.""

And while she says, ""I do not believe I have anything further to offer a formal process regarding this specific matter,"" she say she would comply ""if compelled or asked to participate in a judicial, investigative or parliamentary process.""

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Wilson-Raybould's latest revelations are ""so compelling and well documented"" that they prove the need for an independent public inquiry into the whole affair.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said they represent ""concrete evidence that proves Justin Trudeau led a campaign to politically interfere in SNC-Lavalin's criminal prosecution.''

The city said Friday afternoon it reached financial close with TransitNEXT, a wholly owned subsidiary of Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin, to extend the north-south Trillium Line to Riverside South as part of the second stage of Ottawa’s LRT.

The fixed contract for the southern extension is priced at $663 million, though the city says that the full value of the deal, including maintenance and rehabilitation on the existing Trillium Line track, is $1.6 billion. SNC-Lavalin will pay $136 million in upfront capital contributions.

Before the city was able to sign on the dotted line, it had to finalize funding agreements from both the federal and provincial governments. While the federal commitments had long been public, it wasn’t until last Friday that Ontario Premier Doug Ford officially announced the province would contribute $1.2 billion towards the transit project. A memo from the city states both funding deals were signed earlier this week.

Though council approved the $4.7-billion worth of contracts for LRT’s second stage at a March 6 meeting, councillors have continued to petition for further transparency in the procurement process.

Capital Coun. Shawn Menard gave notice earlier this week that he’d like to have the auditor general investigate the decision-making process on stage two in light of allegations that SNC-Lavalin’s bid did not meet the minimum technical score for the project.

Phase two will see the Trillium Line extend 16 kilometres past its current terminus, Greenboro Station, to Limebank Road in Riverside South, with an additional eight stations and a link to the Ottawa International Airport.

Work on the southern extension is expected to begin in the coming weeks, with construction wrapping up by 2022. The city is expected to reach financial close by the end of April on an agreement with the consortium of Nebraska’s Kiewit and France’s Vinci to extend the LRT to Moodie Drive in the west and Orléans in the east.",City closes stage 2 LRT deal with SNC-Lavalin subsidiary amid ongoing scrutiny,Ottawa Business Journal,https://obj.ca/article/city-closes-stage-2-lrt-deal-snc-lavalin-subsidiary-amid-ongoing-scrutiny

There is a cover-up going on in Parliament and the Prime Minister is going to great lengths to stop the truth from coming out. On top of that, Liberal operatives have now leaked confidential information on the selection of a Supreme Court Justice to cast doubt on former Jody Wilson-Raybould’s judgment. This level of potential political interference from the Prime Minister’s Office damages our democratic institutions and their ludicrous behavior, as Paul Wells recently said in a Macleans article, “is the very stuff of a police state.”

article continues below

I am also extremely disappointed with the five Liberal MPs on the Justice Committee who shut down the investigation into the alleged political interference with the former Attorney General. Due to her extraordinary testimony, it is unfathomable why the Prime Minister won’t permit her to answer direct questions regarding meetings and interactions after he removed her as the Minister of Justice, which she herself acknowledged are relevant to the matter at hand.

It boggles the mind why the Prime Minister is refusing to waive solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence as it only drags this scandal on even longer. It has been going on for weeks, overshadowing his budget and ripping apart the Liberal caucus.

It begs the question, if he thinks it’s better to take the political heat for this, is he really worried what his two former Ministers want to say?

Every day we learn information about how the Liberals inappropriately pressured Jody Wilson-Raybould. Now Jane Philpott, who resigned from Trudeau’s cabinet, revealed there is still more evidence that must be released.

I firmly believe not getting to the truth would be a grave injustice to the rule of law and to the democratic principles that we were elected to uphold. In a recent speech to Parliament, I urged my colleagues to check their political allegiances at the door and vote in favor of our motion to let Jody Wilson-Raybould speak. While almost every Liberal MP voted it down, there were a few who refused to be whipped against the motion.

Those in high office are not beyond reproach. Members of Parliament are not elected to protect the Prime Minister, nor should their political survival – or even our own political futures – trump the independence of an Attorney General.

It is time for Liberal MPs to rise to the occasion and put aside their political fidelities. I will continue to implore them to join us in calling for the Prime Minister to waive full solicitor-client privilege and all Cabinet confidences and let Jody Wilson-Raybould finish her testimony. Canadians deserve the truth.

Member of Parliament

396,Politics,2019-03-29T10:51:00.0000000Z,"The SNC-Lavalin affair will once again take centre stage on Parliament Hill, as new evidence into the scandal could be released as early as Friday. Earlier this week, former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould filed a written submission with the Justice ...","Ottawa – Jody Wilson-Raybould threw another can of gas on the SNC-Lavalin fire with the revelation Friday that she secretly recorded a phone call in which she claims her job as justice minister was threatened if she didn’t intervene in the criminal prosecution of the Montreal engineering giant.

An audio recording and transcript of the Dec. 19 call with Michael Wernick, the country’s top public servant, was released as part of additional written testimony Wilson-Raybould submitted to the House of Commons Justice committee, which last week shut down its examination of her allegation that she was relentlessly, improperly pressured to intervene in the case.

The 17-minute recording backs up Wilson-Raybould’s version of the words spoken during the conversation, about which she told the committee on Feb. 26 during nearly four hours of oral testimony. But it doesn’t resolve the question of whether the Privy Council clerk’s words constituted “veiled threats,” as she has alleged.

Listen: Conversation between former Justice Minister Jody Wilson Raybould and Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick

In her written submission, the former minister acknowledges the “extraordinary and otherwise inappropriate step” of recording the conversation. But she says she was at home alone in Vancouver at the time and was “anxious to ensure that I had an exact record of what was discussed as I had reason to believe that it was likely to be an inappropriate conversation.”

“This is something I have never done before this phone call and have not done since.”

Wernick declined to comment directly but his lawyer, Frank Addario, said recording the call was “inappropriate.”

“A lot of the tape is her making a speech for a different audience, since she could have just told him she did not want to discuss it further. I don’t know any lawyer who records conversations with work colleagues or clients. I don’t get the covert ops program or holding on to the tape for a convenient moment,” Addario said in an email.

“She was the chief legal officer for the country. She didn’t give her tape to the RCMP. She didn’t give it to the PM or the Ethics Commissioner. She didn’t even give it to the committee when she first testified. Most peculiar.”

As justice minister and attorney general at the time, Wilson-Raybould was the government’s chief lawyer.

The code of conduct for the Law Society of Ontario, of which Wilson-Raybould is an honorary member, prohibits a lawyer from recording a client without the client’s permission. The Canadian Bar Association code of conduct prohibits a lawyer from recording anyone without permission.

Wilson-Raybould has said she believes she was moved out of the justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs in a mid-January shuffle as punishment for refusing to succumb to relentless pressure last fall from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his senior staff, Wernick and others to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case. She resigned from cabinet a month later.

In the recording, Wilson-Raybould repeatedly tells Wernick that the director of public prosecutions had decided to pursue a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin for bribery and fraud related to its work in Libya and that she would not use her power to step in to override that decision and insist upon a remediation agreement. Essentially akin to a plea bargain, such an agreement would mean the company would have faced stiff financial penalties while averting a possible criminal convictionbility.

During the call, she acknowledges she has the legal right to intervene but argues it would be unprecedented and viewed as political interference in the justice system.

“This goes far beyond saving jobs. This is about the integrity of the prime minister and interference. There is no way that anybody would interpret this other than interference, if I was to step in,” she says.

At another point, Wilson-Raybould says she’s trying to “protect the prime minister from political interference” and if he doesn’t accept her advice “then it is his prerogative to do what he wants.” She tells Wernick several times she feels “uncomfortable” just having the conversation with him.

Wernick tells Wilson-Raybould that Trudeau “wants to be able to say that he has tried everything he can within the legitimate toolbox” to head off the possibility of SNC-Lavalin leaving the country and putting thousands of Canadians out of work. He says Trudeau is “quite determined, quite firm” about this and adds: “I think he’s going to find a way to get it done one way or another. So he is in that kind of mood and I wanted you to be aware of that.”

“It is not a good idea for the prime minister and his attorney general to be at loggerheads,” he says later. “I am worried about a collision, then, because he is pretty firm about this.”

He tells Wilson-Raybould that Trudeau is “not asking you to do anything inappropriate or to interfere. He is asking you to use all the tools you lawfully have at your disposal.”

Towards the end of the call, Wilson-Raybould tells Wernick she’s waiting for “the other shoe to drop.”

“I am not under any illusion how the prime minister has and gets things that he wants,” she said.

Wernick’s lawyer said nothing said by the clerk constitutes a veiled threat.

“He was asking for information that only she could give. The clerk said this (remediation agreement) is a legitimate tool and why are we not exploring it here and he asked repeatedly for an explanation to pass on to the prime minister and she refused to give it. She didn’t shut the call down,” said Addario.

Addario said Wernick did not know the call had been recorded until it was released Friday.

In a statement late Friday, the Prime Minister’s Office said Wernick did not brief Trudeau about his Dec. 19 conversation with Wilson-Raybould and he was unaware of its full contents until the recording was released.

Addario said the day after the conversation, “everyone went on holidays.” By the time they returned at beginning of January, “the first burning issue” was Scott Brison’s retirement and the consequent cabinet shuffle.

“The SNC issue never made it back to the top of the discussion list. The clerk never discussed SNC again with the PM or PMO until someone leaked the story to The Globe and Mail in early February.”

The PMO statement reiterated Trudeau’s previous admission that “he should have spoken directly” with Wilson-Raybould about the matter and that “he wishes she had come to him” with her concerns about improper pressure. He again attributed the controversy to an “erosion of trust” between her office and his, and tried to close the door on the fiasco, which has engulfed his government for two months, cost him two cabinet ministers, his principal secretary and Wernick, who officially retires on April 19 after concluding he’s lost the confidence of opposition parties following his combative testimony at committee.

“All the facts are on the table now and everyone involved has shared their perspective,” the statement said, adding it’s time to “”move forward as a team on the issues that matter to Canadians.”

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Wilson-Raybould’s latest revelations are “so compelling and well documented” that they prove the need for an independent public inquiry into the whole affair.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said they represent “concrete evidence that proves Justin Trudeau led a campaign to politically interfere in SNC-Lavalin’s criminal prosecution.”",Wilson-Raybould's submission on SNC-Lavalin could be released Friday,680 News,https://www.680news.com/2019/03/29/wilson-raybould-submission-snc-lavalin/
397,Politics,2019-03-29T13:53:00.0000000Z,This week’s appointment of former Liberal cabinet minister Anne McLellan as a “special advisor” to the Prime Minister continues the government’s bumbling campaign to wrest control of the SNC-Lavalin narrative so they can bury it six-feet under.,"This week’s appointment of former Liberal cabinet minister Anne McLellan as a “special advisor” to the Prime Minister continues the government’s bumbling campaign to wrest control of the SNC-Lavalin narrative so they can bury it six-feet under. Here, it appears, the goal is to magically switch the SNC-Lavalin conversation from discussion of political interference in the justice system to a topic destined to make people doze off: analysis of the “operating policies and practices across the cabinet, and the role of public servants and political staff in their interactions with the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada,” to quote the PMO press release.

Enlisting the longtime Liberal party loyalist as a “change-maker,” however, offers yet another example of a government once famed for its finesse controlling imagery losing its optics mojo. Anyone following the SNC-Lavalin scandal or controversy or whatever you want to call it knows the problem isn’t “operating policies and practices across the cabinet.” In fact, if there’s one thing both sides do agree on, it’s that systems, or “Canadian’s confidence in their institutions,” weren’t the problem laid bare by the SNC-Lavalin conflict: the problem was the behaviour of the people running them. Wilson-Raybould testified that she faced inappropriate political pressure and interference in her role as attorney general from several people, some of whom have resigned. The government framed the problem as an interpersonal communications breakdown—an “erosion of trust” or the “two people can experience the same event differently” boilerplate that’s become a Trudeau-government mantra. In this context, analyzing operating policies and practices is a bit like obsessing about a car’s brakes after a collision caused by human error.

That said, reviewing a system in place since Confederation is not a bad idea. Wilson-Raybould herself recommended that the justice committee look into bifurcating the attorney general and justice minister roles. But it’s off topic. Dividing the roles also wouldn’t preclude any government that didn’t respect the rule of law from pressuring an attorney general.

The choice of McLellan, now senior counsel at the Edmonton-based law firm Bennett Jones LLP, comes with its own optics challenges. The former law professor and politician, who served 13 years in governments headed by Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin, is respected, a staple on boards and task forces. But bringing in an active Liberal fundraiser as an “independent” adjudicator is a dissonant choice for a government that needs to distance itself from charges of partisan politics. McLellan has also been associated with the Pierre Elliot Trudeau Foundation, where she served as a mentor. The PMO press release notes that McLellan’s former roles as justice minister and attorney general, as well as deputy prime minister, make her “uniquely suited for this role.” But insider familiarity with a system doesn’t make one an objective critic of said system. Arguably, the reverse can be true: no one is exempt from unconscious biases, among them affinity bias and conformity bias.

McLellan’s arrival also signals willingness to take advice from the Liberal old guard, the very scandal-prone establishment the Trudeau government defined itself against in terms of bringing new transparency, accountability, and a decentralized PMO. But McLellan, deputy PM during the Liberals’ “sponsorship scandal,” was also front and centre after the Liberals’ federal defeat in 2006 when the party needed regeneration. She and John Manley, Chrétien’s former right hand, co-chaired a conference at Mont Tremblant in June 2006 that marked the founding of the Canada 2020 think tank. Attendees included Justin Trudeau. Eight months later, Trudeau entered politics, announcing his run for a Montreal riding; five years after that, he was party leader.

Those with longer memories will also recall McLellan’s last federal assignment—chairing the 2016 task force advising the government on how to move forward with its plan to legalize marijuana—triggered its own controversy: conflict-of-interest charges involving business and government, the gist of the SNC-Lavalin case. At the time, concerns were raised that McLellan was potentially shaping legislation that could benefit her employer, Bennett Jones, which marketed itself as an advisor to companies in the cannabis sector; unearthed securities documents listed at least 15 of its employees having been issued several hundred thousand of shares in a company the firm advised, which was positioned to profit from legalization (McLellan’s name was not listed among them).

Drug-policy expert Michael DeVillaer, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioural neurosciences at McMaster University, took issue with McLellan heading the task force in a 2017 paper, “Cannabis Law Reform in Canada: Pretense & Perils, which raised concerns about the integrity of the process: “… the broader entanglement of interests among Canada’s current ruling party, at least one major cannabis producer, and a prestigious law firm connected to both, and of the cannabis producer’s business relationship with criminal elements in the U.S., may nonetheless pose a credibility risk. It may threaten the confidence that at least some public health advocates and the general public will have in the integrity of a process meant to ensure a public health priority in cannabis law reform.”

After the task force wrapped in December 2016, McLellan also came under fire for speaking about her government work at industry-sponsored events across Canada. She saw no problem with her dual role working for a firm that advises and invests in the marijuana industry while speaking about past task force work, McLellan told the Globe and Mail: “When I do these speaking engagements, I do so in my role as the former chair of the task force. I’m not there as senior adviser at the law firm of Bennett Jones LLP.”

McLellan’s new assignment is unpaid (her expenses will be covered), a Privy Council Office spokeswoman tells Maclean’s. She is expected to deliver her “independent recommendations” by the end of June. If all goes to government plan, by then no one will even remember why she was appointed.

Wilson-Raybould had provided the trove of documents to back up her allegation that she was pressured to intervene in SNC-Lavalin’s criminal case. The company desperately wanted the chance to negotiate a remediation agreement that would avoid a criminal trial on charges of bribery. Wilson-Raybould testified in a marathon hearing in late February that she “experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion.”

She was denied a chance to appear a second time at the committee. Her response includes a 17-minute recording of a conversation she had with Privy council clerk Michael Wernick. Listen to that here (or read the full text below):

View the other documents she submitted to the committee:

Wilson-Raybould explained in her submission (on page 12) why she decided to record her call with Wernick:

“While this recording was made simply as a personal aide memoire because I had no staff present to make notes, I am releasing the recording now given the Clerk’s repeated assertions that he made no threats to me veiled or otherwise, or that he had no recollection of the specifics of the call, or otherwise called into my question my previous testimony. The recording allows the members of the Committee and the public to decide for themselves.”

Here is a transcript of the call, as it appears in Wilson-Raybould’s submission to the justice committee:

Clerk [Wernick]: Hello.

JWR: Hello Michael, it is Jody.

C: Hi, sorry about the phone tag.

JWR: That’s ok.

C: Um…l am not calling you about litigation directive . I am calling about the other important one—the Deferred Prosecution thing/ SNC and so one—I wanted to pass on where the PM is at… so our intelligence from various sources is that company is getting to serious point now… the board has asked consulting firms for options for the board for their next which could be selling out to somebody else, moving…you know, various things.

JWR: yep.

C: So it seems to be real and not a bluff. Um, there is another rising anxiety as you can imagine about a signature firm and job loss and all that co ming after the Oshawa thing and what is going on in Calgary and what not . So the PM wants to be able to say that he has tried everything he can within legitimate toolbox to try to head that off. So he is quite determined, quite firm but he wants to know why the DPA route which Parliament provided for isn’t being used. And I think he is gonna find a way to get it done one way or another. So, he is in that kinda mood and I wanted you to be aware of that.

JWR : ok

C: So, um, I don’t know if he is going to call you directly – he might – um and he is willing – I think he is thinking about getting somebody else to give him some advice…you know he does not want to do anything outside the box of what is legal or proper – um…but his understanding is – you know – the DPA tool is there and you have options that we talked about before to ask for reason from the DPP or even take over the prosecution. He just wants to understand more at this point of why the DPA route is not taken up on this route. So he is thinking on bringing someone in like Bev Mclachlin to give him advice on this or to give you advice on this if you want to feel more uncomfort able you are not doing anything inappropriate or outside the frame of…

JWR: I am 100 percent confident that I am doing nothing inappropriate.

C: Ya, no but would not be if you decided to use some of these tools under the law…cause I think he feels that the government has to have done everything that I can before we lose 9,000 jobs…and a signature Canadian firm.

JWR: Right so – um – I again am confident in where I am at on my views on SNC and the DPA haven’t changed – this is a constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence that Michael – I have to say including this conversation and previous conversations that I have had with Prime Minister and many other people around it – it is entirely inappropriate and it is political interference . And l…the Prime Minister obviously can talk to whomever he wants – but what I am trying to do is to protect him . I could have a conversation with Beverley Mclachlin…l can call her right now…um…l am just – um – issuing the strongest warning I can possibly issue that decision s that are made by the independent prosecutor are their decisions. We gave her, and them, the tools – the additional tools- I made it very clear at the cabinet table and other places that these tools are at the discretion of the prosecutor – and everybody agreed to that and that there was no guarantee that there would be a DPA in t his or any other case . So we are treading on dangerous ground here – and I am going to issue my stern warning – um – because I can not act in a manner and the prosecution cannot act in a manner that is not objective, that isn’t independent, I cannot act in a partisan way and I cannot be politically motivated. All of this screams of t hat . So I am actually un comfortable having this conversation but I am happy to talk to you. I will cal l Beverley Mclachlin…l cannot even imagine her fee ling in any way, sh ape or form comfortable interfering with the independent prosecutor.

C: Ok but I think that is where people are talking past each other. I mean I think t he view that h e has for med – I share – I am not the lawyer in any of these conversations – and Elder and others is – um – it is not interference – the statute specifically has these other provisions i n it that all ow you to ask questions of the OPP and that is provided for and that is not interference …

JWR : But I would have to issue a Directive, I would have to Gazette this…

C: Yes.

JWR : the Prosecutor – the director – whom I know and understand after having several conversations wit h her about another directive on HIV that I issued – she is a by the book person. If this is gazette – this will be – and I hear you on the jobs and wanting to save jobs – I mean we all want to do that – this goes far beyond saving jobs – this is about the integrity of the Prime Minister and interference – there is no way that anybody would interpret this other than interference – if I was to step in. It does not matter how I would look in doing that – I would be a mockery – and that is not t he problem – the bigger problem is what it would look like d ow n the road for the government. It is not about jobs – and I know that jobs are import ant so I do not want any body to misinterpret t hat I don’t care ab out those jobs – this is about the integrity of the government and recognizing that there is t he ability to issue a directive under the act…um …it is still irrespective of the ability that I have to do that – 1. it has never been done before but 2. t hi s is going to look like nothing but political interference by the Prime Minister, by you, by everybody else that has been involved in this politically pressuring me to do this.

C: Well…um…

JWR : I actually really feel uncomfortable havin g this conversation because it is wrong and I hear the Prime Minister obviously can call me…like I said to you I will have a conversation…I am going to call Beverley Mclachlin and have a conversation with her about his.

C: Well…of course it has not been done before because parliament only created the instrument barely a year ago…

JWR: No no no…this instrument was… you mean the directive – the directive on a specific prosecution has never occurred… And this happened… cause Harper brought this law in as you probably know 10 years ago. The Directive – or the DPA has n ever been it just entered the Criminal Code back in September so I understand that this is the first case. The prosecutor sent me what is called a Sect ion 13 – you told me that you hadn’t seen it before – but I read it and I have reread it – and the Prime Minister’s Office has a copy of it. She explains in it why she is not doing it in this case – we have to, I have to be – unless it is something outrageous – com fortable with the decision – recognizing it is the first one likely and obviously I am confident wasn’t entered into lightly – made the decision not to enter into a DPA with respect to this case. And she explained why.

C: So when did she convey that to you?

JWR: She issued the Section 13 back in September when I was down in Australia for that…five eyes – and then all this transpired…I mean I have a timeline of every single conversation and everything that everybody has said to me on this so…um… So like…anyway…again – I am surprised that you and I are having this conversation but I am just say ing that I re ll y feel uncomfortable about the appropriateness of this conversation.

C: Ok I understand that – but I mean I think his view is that his is not asking you to do anything inappropriate or interfere . He is asking you to use al l the tools that you lawfully have at your disposal…um.

JWR: I know I have a tool under the prosecution Act that I can use. I do not believe it is appropriate to use tool in this case.

C: ok alright … that is clear – um – well his is in a very firm mood about this so um….

JWR: Does he understand the gravity of what this potentially could mean – this is not about saving jobs – this is about interfering with one of our fundamental institutions – this is like breaching a constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence.

C: Well I don’t think he sees it as that…

JWR: No one is explaining that to him Michael. Like this is… we can stand up in the House of Commons on Norman on – tyotally appropriately on Norman – on extradition and we can talk about the rule of law – um… The cases are not dissimilar – the principle or the integrity of how we act and respond to the tools we have available and what we should and shouldn’t do – again …I just. l don’t know…

C: Ok, then I am – I respect where you are coming from… l just think…

JWR: You know what – I hope that you do because I do not think any body respect s this. The conversation that Gerry and Katie had with my Chief of Staff and I have it – like she wrote down what was said – saying that they do not want to hear anymore about the legalities – but want to talk about jobs is entirely in appropriate.

C: Ok well I was not

JWR: Ok I have it…l have it all.

C: Ok but you are not just the Attorney General, you are the Minist er of Justice in a cabinet and … context in which you exercise your roles and responsibilities … I am not seeing anything inappropriate here but…um… I mean … you are right … and the PM … people are talking past each other…l think the way he sees it and the advice he is getting is that you still have things you can do that are not interference and are still very much lawful…

JWR: It is not that they are not lawful. ..the perception and what will happen is that it will be deemed political interference from day one when people were talking about why we are entering into a DPA or putting in a DPA regime in place … Everybody knows that it was because of SNC whether that is true or not that is what people will think.

C: It is a tool used in lots of other countries though…

JWR: Fair

C: …for these kind s of purposes and especially if there has been a change of ownership or management of the company that is being prosecuted … it is a public policy tool.

JWR: Fair, but in our MCs all the way up and in the law that we changed we gave the Director of Public Prosecutions the discretion to enter into the DPAs and the judge to oversee the regime . There is no guarantee in any particular case – this one or the ones that will come – that they will enter into the DPAs or think it is appropriate to do so. And that is what we consciously made the decision on when we decided as a cabinet to enter into this process and I amending the law.

C: Is there anybody that can talk to Kathleen then about the context around this or to get her to explain why she is … or I guess the company has talked to her directly …

JWR: The company has… but Michael there was a preliminary inquiry- I am still try ing to get an update on what happened at the Pl. Like the suggestion that I made ages ago which Gerry talked to you about in Montreal was … nobody from the company ever contacted me or sent me a letter expressing concern – had that happened I would have done what I believed to have been appropriate was to forward that letter on to the DPP.

C: I think they have made direct representations to the prosecutor though…and they tried to make the public interest argument and so on and so on. But they gave the impression that they are not being listened to so…

JWR: ya…

C: Alright…um…well I am going to have to report back before he leaves…he is in a pretty firm frame of mind about this so…l am a bit worried…

JWR: Bit worried about what?

C: Well…it is not a good idea for the Prime Minister and his Attorney General to be at loggerheads.

JWR: Well I feel that I am giving him my best advice and if he does not accept that advice then it is his prerogative to do what he wants… But I am trying to protect the Prime Minister from political interference or perceived political interference or otherwise.

C: Alright, I understand that… but he does not have the power to do what he wants… all the tools are in your hands so…

JWR: … Ok so then…so I am having thoughts of the Saturday Night Massacre here Michael to be honest with you and this is not a great place for me to be in – I do not relish this place – but what I am confident of is that I have given the Prime Minister my best advice to protect him and to protect the constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence.

C: Ok…alright but…I am worried about a collision then because he is pretty firm about this…I just saw him a few hours ago and this is really important to him… Ok…um…there is not much more we can cover for now them… um…I understand where you are coming from … Um…The section 13 response from Kathleen…you are saying Elder has that or had a version of that?

JWR: The Prime Minister’s Office has had it since September since I have had it.

C: Since September …ok that is import ant . That is new to me so … ok. Alright…um…

JWR: They will tell you that they have not received a copy of it … Elder and Mathieu said it to me when they came to my office…um…but we have documented evidence in terms of emails etcetera where that has been provided…so they do have it …maybe they have misplaced it. I can send it back over to them but I know that Jessica asked the other day when she was over at the PMO office…

C: And what did they tell her…that they didn’t have it or that they never seen it…?

JWR: I have to ask and I will tell you exactly what they said. I will have to ask her.

C: My advice is that Jessica should send it to Elder then just to make it ‘tripley’ sure they have it. JWR: Ok, I will get her to do that right now.

C: Alright thanks for calling me.

JWR : Than s.

C: Thanks for calling back so quickly .

JWR: No problem.

C: OK, he is still around tomorrow so… (inaudible)

JWR: I am waiting for big…the other shoe to drop…so I am not under any illusion how the Prime Minister has and gets things that he wants… l am just stuck doing the best job that I can…

C: Ok alright.

“The PM wants to be able to say that he has tried everything he can, within a legitimate toolbox, to try to head that off. He’s quite determined, quite firm, but he wants to know why the DPA [deferred prosecution agreement] route, which Parliament provided for, isn’t being used. And I think he’s going to find a way to get it done one way or another. So, he is in that kinda mood and I wanted you to be aware of that,” Mr. Wernick is heard telling Ms. Wilson-Raybould during the first few minutes of their phone call.

The purpose of the call, as Mr. Wernick characterized it, was “to pass on” information on the prime minister’s concerns that SNC-Lavalin could move its headquarters or be sold. “It seems to be real, and not a bluff. There’s another rising anxiety, as you can imagine, about a signature firm and job loss and all that coming after the Oshawa thing,” Mr. Wernick says, referring to recent layoffs at General Motors in Oshawa.

It was included along with a handful of documents the House Justice Committee released today, days ahead of the House’s return from its weeklong hiatus. The Prime Minister’s Office announced Friday that Mr. Wernick’s successor, Ian Shugart, will assume the post on April 19.

In the 17-minute phone call with Mr. Wernick, Ms. Wilson-Raybould is heard raising concerns about intervening in the SNC-Lavalin case, saying that their conversation is inappropriate and amounts to political interference, as well as other conversations she’s had calling on her to consider a DPA.

Mr. Wernick had raised the possibility of asking someone like former chief justice Beverley McLachlin to weigh in on the case, if she felt “uncomfortable” about intervening.

“What I am trying to do is to protect him [the prime minister],” she said in response. “I am just issuing the strongest warning I can possibly issue that decisions that are made by the independent prosecutor are their decisions.”

Her 43-page submission to the committee includes text messages between her and her then-chief of staff, Jessica Prince. In one text exchange, on Dec. 18, Ms. Prince tells Ms. Wilson-Raybould that then-principal secretary Gerald Butts allegedly said, “Jess, there is no solution here that doesn’t involve some interference.” Mr. Butts, who resigned over the issue, claiming responsibility for a “breakdown in trust” between himself and the former AG, has repeatedly denied there was inappropriate interference.

During her four-hour testimony before the Justice Committee on Feb. 27, Ms. Wilson-Raybould (Vancouver Granville, B.C.) said she spoke with Mr. Wernick on Dec. 19, during which he allegedly said that the prime minister is “determined” to find a way to get a deferred prosecution agreement for the embattled company and that he and his AG can’t be at “loggerheads” over this issue. Ms. Wilson-Raybould has expressed concern that she was shuffled out of her role as AG and moved to Veterans Affairs for her refusal to grant the company a DPA.

In responding to Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s account of that call, during his second appearance, Mr. Wernick said he had no “independent recollection” that there was inappropriate interference, saying he did not “wear a wire” during his conversations with the ex-minister.

The publication of the documents and recording will likely re-energize opposition parties’ push for the government to allow the ex-minister to fully air her side of the story and potentially add to calls from some Liberal MPs for her to be expelled from caucus.

The affair has roiled the Trudeau government for more than a month, and has overshadowed the release of its pre-election budget. Ms. Wilson-Raybould said she faced a “consistent and sustained” effort involving political staffers and bureaucrats, including Mr. Butts, and Ben Chin, chief of staff to the finance minister, to cut a deal for SNC-Lavalin, the Quebec engineering giant facing fraud and corruption charges, to protect 9,000 jobs.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Papineau, Que.) has repeatedly denied there was ever any inappropriate pressure, saying that he takes responsibility for the erosion of trust between his Mr. Butts and his former AG.

The release of the former attorney general’s submission to the Justice Committee comes after days of leaks on the judicial appointment process for the Supreme Court, something that’s supposed to be confidential, which Ms. Wilson-Raybould has said need to be investigated and the PMO has denied came from it.

Mr. Trudeau and his ministers have been touring the country for the past few days to sell the budget to key voting blocs, including young Canadians and seniors. Throughout his engagements, Mr. Trudeau has faced questions over whether his office orchestrated the leaks that alleged he questioned Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s judgment over her recommendation for a Supreme Court chief justice. Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s political motivations have also been an object of speculation of late, with some pundits raising questions about her end-game and concerns about the ethics of releasing an audio recording.

Questions have also been mounting over whether Ms. Wilson-Raybould and ex-Treasury Board president Jane Philpott (Markham-Stouffville, Ont.), who resigned over the government’s handling of the affair, will remain in caucus.

Despite her resignation from cabinet, Ms. Wilson-Raybould has repeatedly indicated that she intends to run under the Liberal banner in October’s election. Ms. Philpott, for her part, has said she supports the party’s policies and intends to remain a Liberal. Speaking to reporters in Maple Ridge, B.C., on Monday, Mr. Trudeau appeared to signal that the two would remain in the party, saying, “I look forward to continuing to engage with both Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott as they make their way forward.”

Even before the release of the documents and audio recording, several MPs were clamouring for both ex-ministers to be booted from caucus, according to a CBC report. The publication of the documents and audio file could add to those calls.

Liberals on the Justice Committee twice blocked opposition parties’ push to recall Ms. Wilson-Raybould to respond to the testimonies given by Mr. Wernick and Mr. Butts, which conflicted with her own. In an interview with CBC, Liberal MP Francis Drouin (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Ont.), who was subbing in for his colleagues on the committee, said he had “heard enough,” noting that the option is open for Ms. Wilson-Raybould to submit more information, expanding on her testimony.

Opposition parties earlier this week attempted to use the Ethics Committee as a forum to continue the Justice Committee’s probe, but the motion was voted down. The Justice Committee, meanwhile, is meeting in private next week to discuss committee business and its new focus on a study on online hate.

Brexit options shrinking after third defeat
