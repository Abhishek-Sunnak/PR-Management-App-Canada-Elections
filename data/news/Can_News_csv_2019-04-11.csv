With 87 seats in the legislature, a party needs 44 to form a majority government.

The province can be broken down into three battlegrounds: Calgary with 26 seats, Greater Edmonton with 27, and smaller cities and rural ridings with 34.

No one block is enough to vault a party into office, so traditionally the winning party needs to take at least two of the three.

If polling holds and the NDP loses rural Alberta, the party needs to all but sweep Edmonton and Calgary. The party traditionally finds its deepest support in Alberta’s capital.

Likewise, if the UCP wins Alberta’s small cities and rural ridings, the party still needs to make inroads in one of the major cities.

Gar Gar told HuffPost Canada he was door-knocking in Calgary's Penbrooke neighbourhood on Wednesday when he ran into a man and a woman who said they supported his campaign. The man told Gar he wanted him to meet his mother and took the candidate back to their house.

Gar said she, too, was a supporter and was interested in a lawn sign.

""Everything went fine. I installed it for her and screwed it in,"" he said.

Gar Gar/Twitter A screengrab from a video that Alberta Party candidate Gar Gar shared on Twitter shows a man forcibly removing one of his campaign signs.

""We were about to go to my car, me and my wife, and I heard somebody calling me from my back and say 'hey, you, come back',"" said Gar.

The candidate said he thought it was another voter who wanted to speak about the election, but he quickly noticed the man's body language as he approached.

""Just mad. Bursting,"" Gar said, adding that he started filming when he realized something serious could happen.

The man told Gar he was the landlord of the property and didn't want the signs on his lawn.

Destroying a lawn sign right in front of a renter. In #CalgaryEast, where most voters are renting homes, this only continues to isolate and instill fear in our community.

Wanting to de-escalate the situation, Gar said he was about to offer to remove the sign when the man decided to ""take matters into his own hands.""

""Everything just happened so fast, this guy just burst in ... took [the sign] out, ripped it and said here you go,"" he said.

Election Act outlines tenants' rights

In the video he shared on Twitter, Gar can be heard asking about the woman's rights since — as several users on the social network pointed out — Alberta's Election Act prohibits landlords or condo boards from preventing tenants from displaying election advertising material.

Gar said he could ""sense the fear"" from the renters, that they wanted to avoid any problems for their living situation.

Screengrab/Gar Gar/Facebook Gar Gar, an Alberta Party candidate in the riding of Calgary-East, says a man who tore out one of his election signs from a lawn owes Calgarians an apology.

She later came to him and said that they still supported Gar. But he said she spoke in a lower voice, as if she didn't want the landlord to hear her.

""She was saying 'I'm so sorry.' She shouldn't be the one saying sorry.""

Gar said he's running in Alberta's election to help fight what he calls a stigma between renters and homeowners. He said some voters, like the woman on that lawn, might ""fear"" casting a ballot because they believe they can't make a difference.

""For every poster that goes down, it's a slap in the face to donors who believed in us. The people that go out and vote.""

This isn't the first time that Gar's election material has been damaged. Last month, he found one of his posters defaced with the phrase ""vote for your future.""

Thinking is about our children is a positive vision, but the real way to make change is through the ballet box.

Other parties have also seen sign trouble during the campaign.

According to Global News, several fake signs mocking the United Conservative Party have popped up in Calgary, promoting candidates like ""Lake of Fire"" and ""Another Bozo."" The UCP blamed the NDP for the signs. The NDP denied the accusations.

“I think we do need to do a better job of being present, being out in the community, listening to people — battle this sort of a stereotype that somehow rural communities are more conservative, because I just don’t think that’s true,” the former political reporter told Global News.

But Thompson knows better than anyone that past election results have painted a different picture: this is his second shot to steal the seat from third-term Conservative MP Ben Lobb. And the southwestern Ontario Huron-Bruce riding, and all those that surround it, have been blue for at least a decade.

WATCH: Longtime Conservative MP Larry Miller on whether there’s a secret to winning rural votes.

Thompson also knows a lot about the mindset of those rural voters, and not just because he grew up on a farm in the riding.

In 2015, the Liberals won a sweeping majority across the country in large part due to their success in urban centres. But they didn’t fare well in more traditional Conservative territory: small-town, rural Canada.

Thompson wanted to learn why, and spearheaded a task force that produced an internal party report on how the Liberals could do better in Southwestern Ontario and beyond.

WATCH: Courting the country voter: what the urban/rural divide means at the polls

“One of the things we suggested was we should be more present. People should see their prime minister and cabinet ministers in rural settings, and we’ve seen a lot of that,” he said. (Thompson said Justin Trudeau’s visit to the International Plowing Match in 2017 was the first by a prime minister since Louis St. Laurent.)

In January, Trudeau created a new ministry with rural voters in mind, naming Nova Scotia MP Bernadette Jordan Minister for Rural Economic Development. That was another recommendation from Thompson’s report.

WATCH: PM Justin Trudeau put on his farmer hat at the International Plowing Match in Walton, Ont. (2017)

“It’s my campaign slogan but it’s also my motto — I really do think our political leadership needs to be reminded over and over and over that a quarter of Canadians live in a rural setting.” “And every time we’re making any decision, somebody has to be at the table to say, ‘OK that’s great, but what will that mean for people who live in a rural community?’” Thompson said.

The difference between rural and urban voters

Some of Thompson’s potential electors say they do feel forgotten by the Liberal government, and most told Global News they’ve long voted Conservative.

“I find that the Liberals just seem to focus more on the big city,” said Sarah Fagan in Goderich, Ont.,’s downtown.

“A lot of the issues that they deal with are Toronto issues and it’s not helpful to us. Any of the high-speed transportation systems, none of the stations ever get up here,” Fagan said.

One riding away to the north, longtime and popular Conservative MP Larry Miller said there’s no magic to winning the rural vote, but there are differences between urban and rural voters.

And transit is a good example.

“I totally get why transit is important, especially in larger cities, but not only is it not expected up in rural parts like Bruce-Grey-Owen Sound. … It’s just not practical,” Miller told Global News at his home just outside Wiarton.

“There’s no way that transit is going to work for me out here, and I don’t want it anyway, you know. So there’s a lot of those issues that, you know, we just don’t expect them. Ambulance, police — we know it’s going to take longer for them to get to our place and we’re OK with that.”

Miller said country voters are drawn to his party in part because of the Conservative focus on fiscal responsibility.

“We know government has to provide some services for us and that’s normal but outside of that, get out of our face and let us live our lives,” Miller said.

Very popular among voters and in his Conservative caucus, this will be Miller’s last term — he’s decided to retire after nearly 30 years in politics.

But he’s not worried about his riding swinging red. (He stole it from a Liberal back in 2004.)

“Not a chance,” Miller said.

“I can thank Justin Trudeau for that, because if there was any kind of doubt or chance in some people’s minds to vote Liberal, everything that he did here in the past couple months has totally taken that away.”

(Several of the people Global News stopped to chat politics with across Southwestern Ontario raised the handling of the SNC-Lavalin scandal as a concern, without being asked about it specifically.)

Allan Thompson hopes to land a seat for the first time by telling voters Conservatives aren’t actually in step with rural voters.

“Their definition of rural is somehow different. It’s got a slight anti-immigrant tinge and not as much focus on socially progressive issues,” Thompson said.

Helping others in need is a “core rural value,” Thompson said. “Somebody can show up at your door in a snowstorm and get a meal or a coffee or stay the night. That’s a core value that came from the pioneer and that corresponds pretty well with a lot of what the Liberal party advocates about looking out for people who are in need,” Thompson said.

In his campaign, he wants to counter stereotypes of the idyllic country lifestyle, and he thinks voters are ready to talk about that.

“There’s a lot of poverty in rural communities. It’s very striking when you knock on doors,” Thompson said. “Seniors in need, people who are homeless or live in substandard housing conditions, people who are dealing with addiction with mental health issues — those things can all be even more difficult to deal with when you’re in a rural setting.”

A question of relevance

Since the Liberals were able to win a majority in 2015 without winning rural voters, is their vote really necessary in 2019?

“Rural areas aren’t going to be as important as say, the 905 [vote-rich, battleground suburban area surrounding Toronto] or Toronto, and I think that’s just a function of the population shifting from rural communities to urban ones, and I think that’s just a demographic challenge,” said Earnscliffe strategist Rob Leone.

Leone understands the challenge well. He’s a former Conservative member of provincial parliament for the riding of Cambridge, which includes that city but also a wide rural area, such as Ayr, where he calls home.

“It’s a whole electoral map,” said Leone, speaking of the federal election. “And I think there is a lot of strategy that goes into who’s going to win where and where are your strengths and where are your weaknesses.”

On the flipside, for Conservatives looking to fare better in big cities, Leone said they need to tackle both policy and demographic issues.

“Certainly, younger people, more educated people, tend to live in urban areas, and right now it seems the Liberals are doing a better job of attracting those kinds of voters to their fold.”

“The Liberals are making a big play on multiculturalism and diversity. Those are the kinds of ideas that are resonating among urban voters right now, and if the Conservatives want to tie into that, they certainly have to look at how they’re going to address those policy concerns for voters,” Leone said.

Back in the countryside, Allan Thompson said thinking about the rural vote means thinking beyond the polls.

“Yes, you’re trying to win. But I think you’re also trying to make sure that you properly represent Canadians across the board. And I don’t think a government can effectively do its job if it is not hearing from the 25 per cent of Canadians who live in rural communities.”

Rural campaigning is more costly and time-consuming, with no high-rise buildings where hundreds of doors and voters can be reached much faster, for example.

“Where are most of the votes in this country? They are in big urban centres. It’s actually a lot of work and it’s a bit more expensive to get off the 401 and get out to rural communities and hear what people have to say,” Thompson said.

WATCH: Ontario does not want cities to get infrastructure funding, Trudeau says

As a result, rural concerns are not always heard “in the corridors of power,” Thompson said.

It’s an area where he and Conservative Larry Miller agree.

“Rural voters, if they’re not aware of that or not ticked off about it, they should be,” Miller said.

“They basically just take us for granted — ‘We’re not gonna win it anyways, so why would we pour money in there?’”

“And that’s another thing that divides or pounds a wedge between [rural and urban voters] — ‘So you’re not even going to give me infrastructure for highway projects or whatever, but you’re going to take my tax dollars and spend it in foreign countries and in other crazy ways that rural Canada gets absolutely no benefit from?’ — And that one there really sticks in the craw of rural people,” Miller said.

As he reflects back on nearly 30 years in politics, Miller attributes his own success to staying true to his roots.

“I’ve made a very conscious effort to make sure I never forgot where I came from. … I know that people appreciate that. You know, I love hockey, I love to hunt, I love all sports, love the outdoors. … I know lots of politicians, that if they hunted, they wouldn’t say a word about it because it may be unpolitically correct or politically unpopular or whatever. I don’t care about that.”

“What you see with me is what you get. And I’m very proud of my rural roots and what I do,” Miller said.

And that’s his outgoing advice for all politicians, of any political stripe, and whether aiming to woo voters in cities or towns: don’t forget where you came from.",IN-DEPTH: Courting country voters ahead of election 2019,Global News,https://globalnews.ca/news/5156380/rural-vs-urban-voters-canada/

Population: 45,519

Eligible voters: 30,886

One of the NDP’s most vocal cabinet ministers is hoping for second term in the Edmonton-Glenora riding.

Sarah Hoffman, who served as deputy premier and health minister in Rachel Notley’s government, became the riding’s first NDP MLA in 2015. Since the 1970s, the riding has oscillated between Liberal and Progressive Conservative MLAs. Hoffman snagged a commanding 68.4 per cent of the vote when the NDP’s orange wave washed over Alberta’s cities.

In 2017, provincial electoral boundaries were redrawn, and the riding expanded eastward to include the Prince Rupert neighbourhood and the yet-to-be-developed Blatchford area, where the City Centre airport once sat.

As the United Conservative Party leads in the polls provincially, hoping to capitalize on less right-wing vote splitting, could the party’s Marjorie Newman make inroads in Edmonton-Glenora? After moving to Canada 13 years ago from the Philippines, Newman works as a regulated immigration consultant helping families resettle in the country — a job she says helps families reunite and achieve their dreams.

Hoffman and Newman are up against the Alberta Party’s Glen Tickner, a senior economist with the Worker’s Compensation Board, and roofing business owner Clint Kelley of the Alberta Independence Party.

For the first time since 1975, no Liberal candidate is running in the riding.

In 2015, the Wildrose and PC party together garnered 24.9 per cent of the vote in Edmonton-Glenora. However, PC MLA Heather Klimchuk preceded Hoffman, winning the 2012 ballot against former NDP stalwart and past party leader, Ray Martin.

Land of opportunity

Although they may disagree on how to do it, three candidates say they’re motivated by a calling to make life better for Albertans.

Kelley could not be reached for comment.

Alberta needs to wean itself off oil revenues and focus on its other advantages, such as its young population and entrepreneurial drive, said Tickner, who moved to the province from B.C. 30 years ago. He’s “appalled by the NIMBY (not in my backyard) attitude” of British Columbians resisting oil pipelines running to the coast from Alberta, he said in an interview.

Alberta’s rising debt is no lost cause, he said, and he sees no need for austerity.

“The positive things are there,” Tickner said. “I really do think they’re there, we just have to take advantage of them.”

Newman said in a written statement she chose to settle in Alberta because it was the “land of promise and opportunity.” She said that status has been at risk since the NDP government came to power in 2015.

“I have come to love my new home Alberta,” she wrote. “I’m determined to help restore Alberta to that promised land of opportunity I once knew.”

Hoffman, who had been an Edmonton public school trustee since 2010, said NDP Leader Rachel Notley approached her to run in the last provincial election when she was frustrated by proposed freezes to education funding in the growing school district. Notley told Hoffman she should run for office and try to change it, so she did.

On the doorsteps, seniors told Hoffman they want more long-term care and dementia facilities, she said. A mom with a three-month-old baby told her she was excited about the NDP’s plans to expand $25-a-day daycare across Alberta.

Employees at Woman’s Health Options, a clinic in the riding that offers abortions, have thanked Hoffman more than once for creating a “bubble zone” preventing protestors from harassing them and their patients, Hoffman said.

“My commitment is to be a fierce fighter the people I work for,” she said.

Sarah Hoffman, Alberta NDP

Age: 38

Occupation: Minister of health

Reason for running: “I’m running to ensure our loved ones have the health care they need and that our kids are learning in good schools. From Edmonton Public School Board chair to being your local MLA and minister of health, I’ve committed to ensuring families have the support and services they need. We must keep our province moving forward to build one Alberta that sticks together as our economy recovers.”

Priorities: Investing in public health care — we cancelled the Progressive Conservatives’ unfair health premiums and expanded home care to support our seniors. Fighting to ensure our kids get the best possible start in life by investing in new, modernized schools and hiring teachers. Supporting women and families by expanding midwifery and maternal health care.

Reason for running: “I am running as part of the United Conservative team because I want to give my daughter an Alberta with opportunities where she can achieve prosperity through hard work and sacrifice. I am concerned that the NDP’s misguided policies are pushing jobs and opportunities out of the province and families are being squeezed by their out-of-touch taxes.”

Priorities: Getting Albertans back to work by pursuing policies that catalyze growth and jobs. Boosting our economy and protecting front-line services. Standing up for Alberta within the federation by unapologetically defending our economy.

Glen Tickner, Alberta Party

Age: 63

Occupation: Senior economist

Reason for running: “I am concerned that Alberta needs to adjust in response to changes in petroleum extraction technology; that the downturn since 2015 is structural rather than cyclical. The province retains many advantages that would allow a gradual adjustment, but not if we continue to follow economically unwise policies such as the 20 per cent increase in the Alberta corporate tax rate, run high deficits and suffer bond downgrades.”

Priorities: A budget with a credible path to reducing Alberta’s debt to GDP ratio, rather than the unrealistic back-end loaded program of the NDP. Review health care so that spending can be directed to achieving better outcomes at lower cost. A model for higher post-secondary enrolment rates, to help those 18-25 adjust to changes in the Alberta economy.

Mike Blanchfield, The Canadian Press





OTTAWA -- Britain's prolonged divorce proceeding from the European Union will give it more time to forge a proper free-trade deal with Canada, says the country's envoy to Ottawa.

The United Kingdom is not legally allowed to engage in free-trade negotiations until it has departed the EU, but High Commissioner Susan le Jeune d'Allegeershecque said her country's top trade negotiator has been meeting regularly with Canadian representatives to sketch out the broad strokes of a bilateral deal.

Britain remains part of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between the EU and Canada as long as it is a member of the 28-country bloc.

Canadian and British negotiators aim to replicate CETA as much as possible in a two-country pact, le Jeune d'Allegeershecque told The Canadian Press from London on Thursday.

She spoke hours after a frustrated EU, in an emergency meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May, granted Britain a Brexit reprieve until the end of October.

The Halloween extension avoids a messy no-deal departure from the EU that was to occur Friday, which could have triggered a British recession with immediate tariffs on trade with the continent.

""The plan is still to have a transitioned form of the CETA agreement, which would reflect all the benefits that that (deal) has,"" le Jeune d'Allegeershecque said. ""We obviously now have a little bit more time.""

That includes technical discussions about particular chapters and topics, she added.

""The legal position is we're not allowed to negotiate,"" said le Jeune d'Allegeershecque. ""Technical talks about what an agreement might look like are possible and those have been going on. There's been intense co-operation and contacts between our two trade-policy and trade-negotiating teams.""

That work follows May's September 2017 visit to Ottawa during which she and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pledged a ""seamless"" transition out of CETA and into a new trading relationship after Brexit.

The May government's attempts to follow through on its pledge to break from the EU have been fraught with frustration, delays and no end of drama.

The extension was reached in Thursday's early morning hours in Brussels, between May and EU leaders. She was back in London later Thursday and told Parliament she wanted to strike a compromise to exit as soon as possible.

That won't be easy because the House of Commons has rejected her Brexit plan three times. In multiple votes meant to gauge what the British Parliament might support, majorities have rejected every scenario they've been offered, from simply scrapping the plan to leave the EU to holding a new national vote on the idea to leaving in a ""hard Brexit"" with no agreed terms.

May said if her own divided Conservatives and the opposition Labour Party can't find a way forward soon, Britain will have to take part in the European Parliament election late next month.

May told reporters before leaving Brussels that she was hopeful the departure could take place before June 30 and if possible, before the European election.

""It's quite an ambitious objective on her part because she will have seen how difficult it has been to get anything through Parliament recently,"" said le Jeune d'Allegeershecque.

Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said her department has been ""very assiduous in working out a transition on all of our treaties, including CETA"" for a post-Brexit Britain.

""However, I think it would be fair to say we are negotiating with a target which is both moving and quite understandably focused on serious challenges at home,"" Freeland told the Senate foreign-affairs committee this week.

Canada views the situation as it's watching two married people it cares about ""going through some difficulties,"" Freeland said.

""They seem not quite yet to have decided where they're going to end up as they work through those difficulties, but what we say to both the EU and to Britain -- and this is very warmly received -- is we are going to remain the best of friends with both of them, no matter what the outcome.""

The prolonged British departure is weighing heavily on Britain's European allies.

Kareen Rispal, the French ambassador to Canada, said that as a long-time EU booster she hopes that Britain's inability to say goodbye might actually lead to its staying in the bloc.

""Brexit is not a win-win for anyone,"" she said in an interview. ""It's not one for the U.K. It's not one for Europe. It's not one for France. France will suffer because we do lots of trade with the U.K.""

France will find a way to carry on with Britain, regardless of the outcome, she said, but added: ""At one point we need to end this uncertainty because it's not good for the economy, for companies.""

U.S. President Donald Trump used Twitter Thursday to complain that it was ""too bad that the European Union is being so tough."" He said the EU is ""likewise a brutal trading partner with the United States,"" something he said he would change.

Le Jeune d'Allegeershecque had no comment on Trump's tweet, but said the EU has not been tough on her country.

""I think they have legitimate concerns about such things as the European parliamentary elections. I think what came out was a very decent compromise, which gives us both what we wanted,"" she said. ""The fact that we and the EU are content to what's been agreed is the most important thing.""","Brexit delay makes time for Canada, Britain to craft trade deal, envoy says",CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/brexit-delay-makes-time-for-canada-britain-to-craft-trade-deal-envoy-says-1.4375630

The province has no Crown corporation ...","CALGARY — As websites go, it doesn’t stand out. Unlike the polished, visually appealing sites the governing NDP and opposition UCP have launched to attack each other in recent weeks, this one has the black-and-white esthetic of a Windows 95 text document. However bland and antiquated its look, though, it inserts a set of damning allegations into the middle of this Alberta election campaign.

The site, not-so-artfully named after the person running it, was launched earlier this month by lawyer and former power executive Robert Hemstock, who is currently suing the Alberta government, Deputy Premier Sarah Hoffman and NDP Premier Rachel Notley’s top spokesperson Cheryl Oates for defamation. It breaks down in lawyerly detail what Hemstock considers to be a series of mistakes the NDP government made as it changed the rules governing the province’s deregulated electricity market — moves he claims cost Alberta power consumers $2 billion, a niggling scandal of the NDP’s first term.

Hemstock filed the defamation suit in July 2018, based on events dating as far back as 2015, when Notley’s New Democrats were elected. The website went live after he filed a new affidavit on March 29.

He launched the suit because he believes the government unfairly blamed him for a series of contract cancellations in the power market in 2015 and 2016, based on a clause he helped negotiate into those contracts in 2000.

He launched the website because he wants to “expose” the details of the controversial episode, and because he believes the public doesn’t understand how or why those cancelled contracts ended up saddling consumers “with an estimated $2 billion in unnecessary costs” — and how the province could have avoided those mistakes in order to save Albertans money.

Both the suit and the website also appear to be an attempt by Hemstock to clear his name.

“It’s also about how our elected representatives in the Alberta Government used their position of power and access to taxpayer funds to attempt to achieve their political objective of avoiding accountability,” the website charges.

Hemstock declined to comment on the site because his defamation suit is still before the court but the affidavit filed March 29 contains a new allegation that the government has not provided all the documents requested in the case.

“That a decision was made to defame me, by implicating me as the cause of the loss of approximately $2 billion to electricity consumers, with no records showing how that decision was arrived at discloses the defendants have not discharged their obligation to provide all relevant material records,” Hemstock states in the affidavit.

“I’m not aware of anything new being filed, but because the matter is before the courts we won’t be commenting,” said Oates, who was Notley’s communications director before the writ dropped and is working on the NDP campaign.

It is a scandal. It is absolutely a scandal

Alberta’s electricity sector is unique in Canada and is confusing even for Albertans. The province has no Crown corporation like BC Hydro, SaskPower or Hydro Quebec that produces and distributes power to its residents. Instead a jumble of private-sector companies and some city-owned utilities like Calgary’s Enmax Corp. own the power plants, transmission lines and distribution networks while multiple provincial government agencies regulate or oversee the market.

In the middle of 2015, the province’s then-new NDP government increased the price industrial companies had to pay for emitting carbon in the province, which triggered an opt-out clause for many of those power producers, letting them cancel their contracts to purchase power in the province.

On his website, Hemstock called the price increase “a mistake” that government ought to have known would trigger the opt-out clause. Further mistakes, Hemstock alleges, include trying to deflect blame for the cancelled contracts, and specifically, going “on the offensive” by blaming him.

The government called the opt-out clause the “Enron clause,” after Enron Canada had asked for it to be added before that now-defunct company agreed to bid on power contracts.

Hemstock was in-house counsel for Enron Canada in the late 1990s when Alberta was in the midst of deregulating its electricity market and when the contracts in question were signed. He later joined Enmax as an executive.

In his defamation suit, Hemstock said he was employed by Enron Canada and “was not employed by nor did he advise (parent company) Enron Corporation in relation to any financial reporting obligations in the United States of America, at any time.”

Enron Corp. — rather than Enron Canada — collapsed amid a corporate scandal that included misleading investors and falsifying financial information.

In December 2015, Enmax became the first company to make use of the opt-out clause and handed the money-losing contracts it was holding over to an arms-length government agency called the Balancing Pool.

In the following months, other money-losing power contracts were also handed to the Balancing Pool, shifting the potential losses from the contracts from companies directly onto Albertans.

One power executive, speaking on condition of anonymity because they didn’t want to run afoul of the government or comment on the defamation case, said the case should be “a cautionary tale when it comes to political interference in the electric market” because electricity “is a complicated but essential commodity.”

The issue stirred up controversy in Alberta — though many residents don’t fully understand what happened — as the government moved to support the Balancing Pool through a loan.

“What I can’t fully grasp, and perhaps this is a failing on my part in opposition, is how it is that $2.2 billion has gone into the Balancing Pool, backstopped by Alberta taxpayers, and it isn’t the single greatest scandal that Albertans have seen,” said Greg Clark, then leader of the Alberta Party, in the province’s legislature in May 2017. “It is a scandal. It is absolutely a scandal.”

A decision was made to defame me

Industry groups have also sharply criticized how the government handled the series of cancelled contracts.

“Albertans should be concerned about the government’s $2.25-billion loan to the Balancing Pool and the mounting interest cost (about $400 million), which will need to be repaid,” the Independent Power Producers Society of Alberta said in a release.

The controversy is not a key focus in the current Alberta election, partly because it’s so complicated, but it is a point that parties have included in their platforms.

The UCP has promised that, if it forms government, it will “Ask the Auditor General of Alberta to conduct a special duty audit of the NDP-incurred financial losses on the power purchase agreements held through the Balancing Pool.”

In an emailed statement, the UCP said the NDP has not been transparent about their electricity market changes.

Hemstock’s defamation case is expected to drag on long after the April 16 election. He believes the government blamed him for the power contracts being handed over to the Balancing Pool.

In their statement of defence, the provincial government, Hoffman and Oates state they never referenced Hemstock directly and “as such, the statements cannot be defamatory or cause harm to the plaintiff, as alleged or at all.”

The defence also states that comments were made “as senior government officers in the performance of their official duties and are protected by absolute privilege” and their comments were “based on true facts about matters of public interest and are fair comment on a matter of public interest.”

The Dufferin-Caledon People’s Party of Canada Association has set April 23 as the deadline for those seeking to represent the party in next October’s federal election.

On March 22, Elections Canada formally recognized the Dufferin-Caledon-PPC Association as an official electoral district association, which will now act as the official representative of the People’s Party of Canada locally and will be selecting a candidate to represent the Party and the riding in the 2019 general election this fall.

“Constituents who are interested in learning more about the People’s Party are invited to review our website at www.ppcdufferincaledon.ca,” the association said in a news release Wednesday.

“Anyone who is interested in representing the People’s Party and defending its values and policies as our candidate in the upcoming election should contact CEO Kevin Gomez at 647-888-1434 and complete the Candidate Questionnaire at the party website at www.peoplespartyofcanada.ca. The deadline for Candidate applications is April 23.”

“We are very proud to be representing Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada in the riding of Dufferin-Caledon,” said Mr. Gomez. “Maxime’s voice and message represent the opinions and perspectives of thousands of Canadians across the country who feel like the traditional political parties have ignored them in favour of political posturing and pandering. We are dedicated to organizing locally to make sure our new Party can be successful in the fall elections.”

The picture is as bad or slightly worse in Canada as in the average OECD country, said the report, which calls for various government measures ...","With a federal election coming later this year, expect politicians to be talking non-stop about the middle class and its importance to the country.

The problem is, according to a new report, the middle class is shrinking — squeezed by high housing and education costs, displaced by automation and lacking the skills most valued in the digital economy.

And faring particularly badly are millennials, who are less likely to reach middle-income levels in their 20s than their baby-boomer parents, says the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development analysis.

The picture is as bad or slightly worse in Canada as in the average OECD country, said the report, which calls for various government measures to tackle the problems.

“Our analysis delivers a bleak picture and a call for action,” said Gabriela Ramos, the organization’s chief of staff, who oversaw the project. “The middle class is at the core of a cohesive, thriving society. We need to address their concerns regarding living costs, fairness and uncertainty.”

The report defines middle class as 75-to-200 per cent of the median income in each nation. For Canada, that means a person living alone would have an income of about $21,990 to $58,639, it says.

Across the organization’s 36 member countries, the portion of citizens considered middle class fell to 61 per cent from 64 per cent between the mid-1980s and the mid-2010s, says the report.

Middle-class shrinkage was sharper in Canada than the OECD average.

Coupled with the contracting centre was a surge in the number of upper-income earners — those making more than 200 per cent of the median — who also cornered a greater chunk of their nation’s wealth, says the report. The middle-class slice of the financial pie fell even faster than the number of people in that bracket.

And those people still classified as middle class saw their purchasing power stagnate or decrease.

Between 2008 and 2016, real median incomes grew by an average of just 0.3 per cent a year, compared to 1.6 per cent in the mid-90s to mid-2000s, the OECD review found.

At the same time, people in the top 10 per cent saw their real incomes grow at three times that rate, the report said.

To make matters worse, housing costs have risen at twice the rate of inflation, so the middle-income earners spent almost a third of their pay on accommodation in 2015 — 29 per cent in Canada — up from 25 per cent in 1995.

One result is that it appears to be getting tougher to realize the dream of middle-class status.

Just 59 per cent of Canadian millennials — born from 1983 to 2002 — made it into that sector by their 20s, compared to 67 per cent of baby boomers, defined as those born from 1942 to 1964.

“Today the middle class looks increasingly like a boat in rocky waters,” said OECD secretary-general Angel Gurria.

The report attributes some of the slippage to the rise of automation, estimating that in Canada, one in five middle-class workers is at risk of losing their job to a machine — slightly more than the OECD median.

And while having high-level skills is not as much of a guarantee of financial success as it once was, being in a high-skill job still greatly increases the chances of making more money, says the report.

The authors list a number of recommended actions, from middle-class tax relief, measures to increase incomes and help with education costs, to programs that encourage workers to improve their skills.

The task is crucial, said Ramos.

“A strong and prosperous middle class is crucial for any successful economy and cohesive society,” she wrote in a preface to the report. “Societies with a strong middle class have lower crime rates, they enjoy higher levels of trust and life satisfaction, as well as greater political stability and good performance.”

8,Business,2019-04-11T19:12:00.0000000Z,CALGARY — A lack of capital for drilling coupled with rising exploration costs make it unsurprising that fewer players are operating in Western Canada's oil and gas fields ... results from the Alberta provincial election next week.,"CALGARY — A lack of capital for drilling coupled with rising exploration costs make it unsurprising that fewer players are operating in Western Canada's oil and gas fields, analysts say.

A study from consulting firm XI Technologies of Calgary finds that almost 300 names have disappeared from a roster of all companies producing oil and gas in Western Canada since global oil prices began crashing at the end of 2014.

article continues below

A total of 1,334 active companies — privately held and foreign-owned entities as well as publicly traded firms — reported oil or gas production in Western Canada in December 2018, XI found.

That's down 282 names or 17.5 per cent from 1,616 in the same month four years earlier, a shift that XI data solutions specialist Shovik Sengupta says points to a period of significant consolidation in the industry.

""There's no capital,"" said Tom Pavic, senior vice-president with Calgary-based Sayer Energy Advisors, when asked what he thinks is causing the shrinkage.

""There's an uptick in oil prices but we're not seeing it with the producers' stock price on the exchange.... No one wants to touch Canada because of all the uncertainty as it relates to pipelines.""

Most of the missing names are likely to be small players who haven't been able to win investor backing to pay for drilling expensive oil and gas wells in trendy unconventional resource oilfields like the Montney and Duvernay, added Sayer president Alan Tambosso.

The loss of producer names is more stark among publicly traded issuers.

As of Dec. 31, 2014, a total of 108 oil and gas companies with a market capitalization of $311 billion were listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, while 229 smaller companies worth $5.1 billion resided on the TSX Venture Exchange.

Four years later, the number on the senior exchange had fallen by 31 per cent to 72 with a market cap of $214 billion, and venture listings were off by 44 per cent to 119 companies worth $3.9 billion.

The market for oil and gas corporate sales looked to be heating up last year but stalled on lower global oil prices over the summer and price discounts for western Canadian oil in the fall as production exceeded export pipeline capacity, said Stephanie Stimpson, a Calgary-based partner at law firm Torys LLP specializing in oil and gas mergers and acquisitions.

""It's really is about the access to capital here,"" she said.

""There are very few financings getting done. Certainly the junior sector is not able to raise capital now.""

She said recent transactions show even Canadian energy companies and pension funds often have a preference for putting their money in the United States oilpatch instead of investing at home.

Going forward, M&A activity will depend on investor confidence, she said, which could swing up or down based on whether the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion is re-approved for construction this spring, as well as other factors including results from the Alberta provincial election next week.

Sayer data shows total Canadian oil and gas M&A value in 2014 was $49.4 billion but it fell to $16 billion in 2015 and $12.1 billion last year.

XI says it can track the government business associate codes attached to assets or companies as consolidation has taken place.

For example, it reports Calgary-based Canadian National Resources Ltd. — the largest listed producer in both 2014 and 2018 — nearly doubled the number of codes it owns from 77 to 135 over the four years, a period when it made numerous large and small acquisitions.

In spite of the acquisitions, XI reported Canadian Natural production in Western Canada (not including mined oilsands) fell from about 741,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in December 2014 to 618,000 boe/d in the same month of 2018.

9,Politics,2019-04-11T23:40:00.0000000Z,where the party’s share of the vote fell by more than 50 per cent from the 2017 election. Join us and grow independent media in Canada The results left some inside and outside the party ...,"Over the last few weeks the three BC Green Party MLAs have been repeatedly outvoted on legislation related to liquefied natural gas development.

But the defeats in the legislature have given the Greens a chance to demonstrate how they differ from the province’s two main political parties, starting with their opposition to the $40-billion LNG Canada project in Kitimat.

“In the face of what to us looks like staggering... evidence about this being the worst possible direction to be taking, it was really important that we voice that opposition,” said Sonia Furstenau, the MLA for Cowichan Valley. “All of the evidence right now is telling us the last thing the world needs is a massive new point-source emitter of greenhouse gases.”

The LNG debate was the latest chapter in the ongoing story of the Green MLAs’ attempts to navigate their relationship with the NDP, which since 2017 has relied on their support on key votes to stay in power.

It comes following a poor showing in a January byelection in Nanaimo, where the party’s share of the vote fell by more than 50 per cent from the 2017 election.

The results left some inside and outside the party wondering whether the Greens were being overshadowed by their partners in power-sharing and in danger of losing relevancy. There were questions about whether the party could keep building momentum, or if it had peaked with three MLAs.

Green leader Andrew Weaver has emphasized the party’s different vision for the future of the province, but the opposition to LNG development has made that vision most visible.

Besides the greenhouse gas emissions, Furstenau said, supplying gas for the LNG Canada site will mean more fracking in the northeast of the province. A recent government report found there’s not enough data to understand fracking’s environmental impacts, though it is conclusively linked to an increase in seismic activity.

“I’m quite shocked,” Furstenau said. “Fundamentally the vast majority of British Columbians want to see governments making decisions that will move us away from increasing our emissions and will move us towards climate action.”

Nor would most British Columbians support providing what amounts to a $6-billion subsidy to the fossil fuel industry, she said.

Yet in the legislature, only the three Green MLAs made the case against the government’s direction.

NDP-Liberal agreement

Premier John Horgan has argued that the LNG Canada proposal fits with the CleanBC plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and that the provincial government stands to gain $23 billion from the project over its lifetime.

It will see thousands of jobs created in a part of the province that badly needs them, he’s argued.

In doing so, he’s contributed to the conclusion among many environmentalists that despite the Green role in the government, it values jobs over anything else.

An April 6 Globe and Mail article found there was little difference between the NDP minority government and the former BC Liberal government in policies on forestry, mining, LNG and Site C.

Longtime activist and Order of Canada recipient Vicky Husband offered a blunt assessment in an interview: “They haven’t changed a damn thing ... there doesn’t appear to be an environmental bone in their body.”

The message from Horgan’s office to his ministers is clear, she said. “If it’s a choice between jobs and the environment, jobs just win.”

That means it’s extremely important that the Greens keep building on their success, she added. “We have two major parties in B.C. who don’t care about the environment, no matter what they’re saying.”

Warren Bell, a Salmon Arm doctor and Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment board member, said the Greens are taking the right position given the threat of climate change.

“It’s not surprising this rift has developed,” he said. “What is surprising is the BC Liberals and the NDP are finding common cause around this particular matter... It’s turning the NDP and the Liberals into Tweedledee and Tweedledum on this particular policy area.”

The Greens have long argued that the BC Liberals and NDP have many policies in common.

“We were clear about this in the 2017 election campaign, that the other two parties were offering a pretty similar vision, and I think the Greens, what really sets us apart, is we have a very different vision for the future of B.C. than either of the other two parties,” Furstenau said.

“Both of them have a very, as far as we’re concerned, backward-looking approach to the economy and to the future of B.C.”

Stark contrast

Evan Pivnick, the chief of staff for the BC Green caucus, said the debate of the past few weeks was about climate change, the biggest challenge facing the world, and choosing how to build the provincial economy.

“I think it’s safe to say the LNG debate is absolutely the starkest difference that has come before the legislative assembly,” Pivnick said. “Our folks used every single tool they had at their disposal.”

While the LNG debate has been a defining moment for the Greens, it comes within a couple months of a Nanimo byelection where the party’s candidate finished a distant third.

Final results showed the NDP’s Sheila Malcolmson received almost 50 per cent of the vote and wasn’t far off the total number of votes Leonard Krog got in the 2017 general election. Krog stepped down as MLA to run successfully for Nanaimo mayor. Tony Harris, the BC Liberal candidate, increased his party’s vote count by almost 800 votes over 2017.

But the Green vote dropped to 1,783 for Michelle Ney, down from the 5,454 the previous Green candidate got in the general election.

In a mid-February interview, Weaver said the Green vote had collapsed in the byelection.

“Michelle’s vote was Michelle’s friends and family. We lost our Green vote. The Green vote did not exist. The Green vote went to the NDP.”

He attributed that collapse to voters’ fear that if the BC Liberals captured the seat, the NDP government would fall and the Liberals would return to power.

Weaver said the party knew from its own polling that the main question on voters’ minds in Nanaimo was whether they wanted to send the province into another general election.

Green donors and members were voting NDP because they liked the direction of the NDP government, with Green support, over the past two years, he said.

“The number of times I got hugged on the doorstep by people saying, ‘We like what we’re seeing, but we’re voting for Sheila.’ Very frustrating for me,” he said.

Weaver’s interpretation of the byelection is backed up by pollster Barb Justason with Justason Market Intelligence. “Much of the collapse in Nanaimo’s Green support can be explained by 2017 Green supporters’ strategic voting, largely to the benefit of the BC NDP,” she wrote at the time.

“But BC Liberals can thank right-leaning 2017 BC Green supporters for some of their support bump. As our poll illustrates, party support is mobile — increasingly so when strategic voting factors in a race empowered to take down the government.”

For every 10 people who voted Green in 2017, she said, four stayed with the party in the byelection, four voted NDP and two voted Liberal.

‘Work to do’: Weaver

One of the things Weaver took from the byelection was that many people don’t understand how the political system works or the role that an opposition party like the Greens play in a minority government. “Clearly we have some work to do to articulate what our role is,” he said.

“On top of that a lot of people didn’t know our contributions,” he said. The Greens had been influential in shaping of the CleanBC plan to reduce carbon emissions while growing the economy, as well as in reviews of the environmental assessment process and the professional reliance model for assessing resource projects, but failed to get credit, he said.

“We have not been good at telling our story, and I can tell you we’re going to be a lot better at that going forward.”

The Nanaimo result should have been sobering for Greens, said Matt Toner. A former NDP candidate, the Vancouver tech entrepreneur joined the Green Party in 2015 and served as deputy leader until the end of 2017. He was part of the backroom negotiating team when the Greens reached an agreement with the NDP that allowed the latter to form government.

The Nanaimo byelection was likely a preview of the dynamic that will shape the next general election, Toner said. “People were backed into a strategic voting corner, and we got clobbered,” he said.

“If I’m the Green Party, I’m looking at the byelection and I’m freaking out. It says something in a riding that seemed friendly to us exactly how people do the math internally when it comes to these decisions. It’s not in our favour.”

Success in the electoral reform referendum would have changed everything for the Greens, and it was a mistake not to be more closely involved in the process all the way through, Toner said.

“Now we’re forced back into playing the old game, and not one we’ve not been historically especially good at,” he said. It will make it harder to attract candidates and find support than it would have been. “It’s a pretty strong headwind in my opinion.”

Old dynamic remains

Pivnick said if there was a message in the Nanaimo byelection it was one that party has heard before.

“I don’t view it as anything particularly new,” he said. “The dynamic in the next election is going to be the NDP saying, ‘Vote for us, we’ll continue this agenda and we’re the only ones that can actually earn a place to do this, and we can do more of this with a majority.’”

“And the Liberals say, ‘If you don’t like that direction, we’re the only ones who can earn a majority and go the other direction.’ That’s nothing new. That’s what both parties have relied on for a long time.”

The NDP has always been strong in Nanaimo, and it was unsurprising that voters there agreed to keep the party in government, he said. “It was always going to be a fairly persuasive argument.”

The dynamic can benefit the Greens, Pivnick said. “Our view is that’s also kind of what people are sick of in this province. This dichotomy between two large parties that define so much of their identities based on being against what the other person is for and vice versa.”

For example, he said, the Liberals are now criticizing the NDP on the carbon tax, a tax that the Liberals introduced a decade ago and that the NDP then opposed.

It’s the Greens’ job to bring grey into what’s often been a black-and-white debate in the province, he said. “I think there is a real space there, and I think that’s what is different in a general election.”

“We’ve taken stock of this moment, and we’re very hyper-aware of the fact there’s two years left in this minority government,” he said.

‘Love ‘em to death’

Toner recalled a Georgia Straight article from 2017 that suggested the NDP might deal with the Greens the same way Vision Vancouver dealt with COPE on city council. The article quoted a senior official in the then-mayor’s office saying, “We’re going to love ’em to death.”

He worried that’s exactly what’s happening to the Greens provincially. “You can be a constructive partner,” he said. “You can also be a partner that should make the NDP kind of sweat through these decisions. I honestly think right now they kind of figure they’ve got things where they need to be and the Greens won’t risk overturning the apple cart.”

It’s great to be vocal on topics like LNG, and it was a good step to leave the legislative chamber on the final LNG vote last week, but the party’s MLAs should have been more adversarial from day one and need to do more to press Horgan and the NDP, he said. “The challenge for the Green Party is they haven’t really effectively exercised their veto in Victoria.”

The Greens need to ratchet up pressure on the NDP so that if they do bring the government down, the public will understand why, Toner said.

He referred to a recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report that found there are as few as 12 years to act to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. “If you really think we have 12 years to turn this around, then every minute counts,” he said.

“Maybe now is the time for the Green Party to say, ‘If this government goes down on this issue, that’s OK. We’ll risk a new election because we think the situation is serious enough to warrant it.’ People value authenticity in politics. They value courage.”

Adam Olsen, who represents Saanich North and the Islands for the Greens, said the party needs to keep highlighting areas the other parties would rather not touch, such as launching a public inquiry into money laundering.

“Our job over the next number of months is to continue to tell our story about our role in this parliamentary session,” he said. “We need to continue to define ourselves as being in large respect an alternative to the establishment.”

At the same time, the Greens need to take their role seriously and demonstrate that minority governments can be stable, Olsen said.

“People don’t need to inherently fear minority governments,” he said, adding he hears calls from advocacy groups wanting the Greens to bring down the government. “There is a balance we need to strike to be responsible in this place.”

It’s possible to achieve things without bringing the government down, Olsen said, pointing to success he had raising concerns about the survival of wild salmon that led to the appointment of an advisory committee on the issue.

“We have taken great steps forward,” he said. “There is no question the Greens have been influential... We have to continue to talk about the things that concern British Columbians and need to be relevant. We have a responsibility for our own fate.”

Different voices needed

In a general election, strategic voting will be a factor, but not to the same degree that it was in Nanaimo, said Sonia Theroux, a former political strategist who worked on election campaigns for Green candidates, including Furstenau and Jo-Ann Roberts.

“It was such a high stakes byelection,” she said. “There’s more complexity in a general election, and it’s not so pointy.” That leaves more room for people to make a “hopeful” vote, she said.

She said the Greens did well during the LNG debate. “It was the right move for them from a values perspective,” she said. “Why have Greens at all if they’re going to cave to things like an LNG tax break?”

On any given issue the Green MLAs have to decide where they stand, and also whether to support the government, she said. They need to be vocal in their opposition to LNG and to building the Site C dam, but on a pragmatic level they need to be looking ahead to what happens if the government falls.

In the wake of the Site C decision, for example, Weaver argued that bringing the government down over the issue would have led to an election that almost certainly would have been won by one of the two parties that support building the dam.

Theroux said that when the Greens appear to prop up the government, people don’t see the many hard conversations that are happening behind closed doors.

Fursteneau said there are a number of issues where Greens have brought a voice that would otherwise have been lacking in the legislature. She cited her work to address the overrepresentation of Indigenous children in government foster care, reforms to rules around lobbying and calls for a public inquiry into money laundering, plus all the constituency work MLAs do.

“We’ve been the only three on a number of files that have moved forward in the last two years, and without us there I would say that a lot of those files wouldn’t be moving forward, much less be on the radar,” she said.

“We are demonstrating the value of having a third party, of having different voices and the value of having MLAs that are going to work quite relentlessly on a number of files,” she said. “It’s not like there’s one thing and that’s the only thing that matters. There are dozens of things that we are collectively working on and making a difference on, and we’ll continue to do that.”

Furstenau said it’s positive for British Columbians to see that politicians don’t always have to be in a state of conflict.

“If you put first and foremost public service as your guiding principle, then evidence as your guiding decision-making principle, you can achieve a lot more,” she said. “Even if you don’t win every battle.”",Can BC’s Greens Avoid Disaster in the Next Election?,The Tyee,https://thetyee.ca/News/2019/04/09/Can-BC-Greens-Avoid-Disaster-Next-Election/

The implication, they'd cry, is that those risking their lives to seek refuge in Canada are simply economic migrants — not families desperate to find a safe place to call home.

The reality, of course, is that while many migrants might genuinely see Canada as the only safe place for them in North America — and perhaps that's true — many who have crossed into Canada at unofficial entry points have not met the criteria for refugee protection, for various reasons. Slightly more than half of finalized refugee claims from these applicants were rejected in the last quarter of 2018.

The situation is hardly straightforward; Canada has been forced to balance its humanitarian commitment to refugee resettlement with the practical limitations of a system unprepared for the recent wave of migrants.

The system has been under enormous strain, with asylum-seekers waiting up to two years for just a hearing. And the integrity of the process itself has been under intense pressure, based partly on the impression that migrants crossing into Canada illegally are using a ""loophole"" in the Safe Third Country agreement to qualify for a hearing, when they otherwise would have just been sent back to the U.S.

The situation is thus a fraught and messy one, which unquestionably makes it deserving of criticism and careful analysis. Yet that is something the Liberals have been fiercely intolerant of the past three and a half years.

Border Security Minister Bill Blair has defended the government's sudden overhaul of asylum laws as a measure to prevent ""asylum-shopping."" (Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press)

Back in July, Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen called the Ontario government's concerns about so-called queue-jumping ""un-Canadian."" During an end-of-year interview, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the Conservatives were trying to stoke fears over refugee claimants. In late January, the prime minister responded to a town hall question about Canada's migration policies with a diatribe lamenting ""the politics of division.""

And yet now, a few months later, Border Security Minister Bill Blair has defended the government's sudden overhaul of asylum laws as a measure to prevent ""asylum-shopping."" This language, apparently, is now tolerable.

Buried in this year's omnibus budget implementation bill is a series of amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act that essentially disqualify asylum-seekers who have made a claim for refugee protection in any other country. Once the bill receives royal assent, an asylum-seeker can be deported without a hearing, which would seem to violate the Charter as affirmed by Singh v. Canada, where the Supreme Court determined that Charter rights extend to everyone physically on Canadian soil.

Many Canadians will nevertheless welcome the Liberals' unexpected about-face on asylum-seekers. Two-thirds of respondents to an Angus Reid poll published back in August thought the border situation had reached a crisis point. More than half said that Canada was too generous toward asylum-seekers who cross into Canada illegally. A more recent Ipsos poll found that 47 per cent of respondents believe most migrants aren't actual refugees — they just want to come to Canada for its economic benefits. Perhaps Blair has that summary on his desk.

What's noteworthy about the timing of the planned changes is that the number of asylum-seekers crossing into Canada at unofficial points of entry is actually on the decline. In 2018, 1,517 people were intercepted by the RCMP crossing into Canada during the month of January. A year later, that number dropped to 888 for the same month. In 2018, 1,565 people crossed illegally into Canada in February. A year later, for the same month, the total was 808. Numbers haven't been that low since June 2017.

The number of asylum-seekers crossing into Canada at unofficial points of entry is on the decline: the RCMP intercepted 888 people during the month of January 2019, and 808 in February 2019, compared to 1,517 and 1,565, respectively, the previous year. (Charles Krupa/The Associated Press)

This is all to say — as if there was any doubt — that the Trudeau government's decision to enact sweeping changes to Canada's asylum provisions is just a crass political move; it will come into force months before an election, when illegal border crossing is actually on the decline, and right onside with public opinion in favour of toughening up asylum laws.

Tabling a stand-alone bill on changes to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act — as one would reasonably expect of policy changes of such enormous importance as Canada's treatment of vulnerable people fleeing persecution — would take too long, and be subject to debate and revisions and multiple readings and so forth.

By using an omnibus bill (something the Liberals vowed they would never do), these changes can go into effect right away, eliminating a potentially defining wedge issue. Sure, it is potentially unconstitutional, but that can and will be sorted out later.

Three and a half years is not a long time to go from ""Sunny Ways"" and 25,000 Syrian refugees to deportations without hearings and unconstitutional amendments. This type of realpolitik (on the backs of refugees, of all people) is the sort of soulless strategizing we're supposed to expect of the other guys — the ones who talk about ""queue-jumpers"" and Canadian values and shopping around for places to seek asylum. But without the sun lighting the way, it's hard to tell everyone apart.

The May government's attempts to follow through on its pledge to break from the EU have been fraught with frustration, delays and no end of drama.

The extension was reached in Thursday's early morning hours in Brussels between May and EU leaders. She was back in London later Thursday and told Parliament she wanted to strike a compromise as soon as possible.

That won't be easy because the House of Commons has rejected her Brexit plan three times.

May said if her own divided Conservatives and the opposition Labour Party can't find a way forward soon, Britain will have to take part in the European Parliament election late next month.

May told reporters before leaving Brussels that she was hopeful the departure could take place before June 30 and if possible, before the European election.

""It's quite an ambitious objective on her part because she will have seen how difficult it has been to get anything through parliament recently,"" said le Jeune d'Allegeershecque.

U.S. President Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday to complain that the European Union was being unfair to Britain.

Trump wrote it was ""too bad that the European Union is being so tough"" and said the EU is ""likewise a brutal trading partner with the United States,"" something he said he would change.

Le Jeune d'Allegeershecque had no comment on Trump's tweet, but said the EU has not been tough on her country.

""I think they have legitimate concerns about such things as the European parliamentary elections. I think what came out was a very decent compromise, which gives us both what we wanted,"" she said.

12,Business,2019-04-12T00:04:00.0000000Z,"It is the second largest pension fund in Canada. CDPQ has investments in 75 countries."" The state finance minister Thomas Issac said that the Congress has reached a stage where they need the name of Lavalin during every election even though the people had ...","Whenever elections approach, whether it is Parliament, Legislative Assembly or local body elections, the Congress-led United Democratic Front in Kerala has always been rattling the old SNC Lavalin case, even though it has already been found that the case had nothing to do with the current chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and his party - Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)]. This time, the Congress has “connected” the SNC Lavalin with the masala bonds that had been floated by the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB).

Last week, the KIIFB concluded its debut international issue with masala bonds of Rs 2,150 crore attaining the title of first government agency to make an entry in the international debt market. It is said to be the second largest mobilisation in the masala bond market by any public sector company in the country. KIIFB has already resourced Rs 7,527 crore and confirmed bank loans worth Rs 2,600 crore.

Masala bonds are simply those bonds which are issued outside the country but it would be denominated in Indian Rupees.

The Congress, which has been targetting the KIIFB for a long, on Sunday, asked Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to break his silence over the involvement of a company that has stakes in 'tainted' Canadian firm SNC Lavalin in an infrastructure bond floated by the state government. Both the BJP and the Congress alleged that one of the main investors in masala bonds was Canada's CDPQ, that has invested in SNC-Lavalin, black-listed in Kerala. KIIFB CEO K.M. Abraham, however, said that CDPQ is a government body in Canada and had been created in 1965 by an act of the Quebec National Assembly. ‘‘From the annual report of SNC-Lavalin, it is seen that the CDPQ has business transactions with SNC-Lavalin. But SNC-Lavalin or none of the other institutions in which CDPQ has invested can have any ownership in the CDPQ as it is a government body. Hence it will be illogical to connect any of the investments of the CDPQ as part of its total portfolio of $220 billion, whether SNC-Lavalin or any other body, to the masala bond deal of KIIFB,’’ Abraham said in a press release.

The press release further stated, ""It is a public sector body whose entire beneficial interest is held by the Government of Canada. The CDPQ is an institutional investor which manages pension funds and insurance programmes, and has its headquarters in Quebec. It is the second largest pension fund in Canada. CDPQ has investments in 75 countries."" The state finance minister Thomas Issac said that the Congress has reached a stage where they need the name of Lavalin during every election even though the people had already discarded it during the 2016 Assembly polls. ""Until this money was raised, Ramesh Chennithala, time and again, called the KIIFB a bluff and when this money came in last week through bonds, they have turned to use the name of Lavalin. What they fail to realise is these bonds have been cleared by the Reserve Bank of India and other regulatory bodies. The Congress is short on issues and hence they fall back on these,"" Issac said in a Facebook post.

CDPQ has investments worth $220 billion across 75 countries including India. It has investments worth $4.5 billion (Rs 31,500 crore) in India, and the central government’s National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) has been cooperating with the CDPQ for various projects. Isaac further added that the opposition leader “Chennithala can ask Nandan Nilekani to get a clear figure on CDPQ investments in India”.

SNC Lavalin was blacklisted by the Kerala government after allegations over an agreement in 1997 for the renovation and modernisation of Pallivasal, Sengulam and Panniar hydroelectric projects in Idukki district. Just before the 2006 Assembly polls, CAG had tabled the report saying “the expenditure of Rs 374.05 crore incurred for renovation did not yield commensurate gains due to various technical defects in the equipment...”

Though all the allegations were against the then power minister Pinarayi Vijayan, the initial procedures were under the UDF government and negotiations were made by the power minister CV Padmarajan. In August 1995, the then power minister G Karthikeyan in the UDF government signed the memorandum of undertaking with SNC Lavalin.

Later in 2006, the Oommen Chandy-led Congress government had called for a Central Bureau of Investigation probe into the entire agreement. Even though the CBI charge sheeted Vijayan along with six others, they were cleared of charges by a CBI special court as the charges could not be proved. Again, CBI moved the Kerala High court, but in 2017, the court observed that the allegations against them were baseless.

The masala bonds, which will be listed in the London Stock Exchange and Singapore Exchange now, have a five year tenure with 9.723% interest rate. At London Stock Exchange’s International Securities Market, the bond is going to be launched on May 17, the first time it is happening for an Indian state's bond, and Chief Minister Vijayan has been invited on the occasion.

While responding to the allegations over the high rate of interest, Abraham said the rates at which the KIIFB had raised funds were much lower than what any such institution had raised in the domestic market over the last one year. Also, KIIFB had obtained a BB rating (bond credit rating).

‘‘In comparison to the KIIFB’s masala bond rate of 9.723%, the rates obtained by bond issuers rated similar to the KIIFB in the domestic market for the last one year are significantly higher. The lowest rate at which an A+ rated entity has been able to raise fund in domestic market has been at 9.87%. A government entity such as the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority (APCRDA) had raised funds in the domestic market at 10.32%. Rates at which other institutions banks such as the Central Bank (10.8%), Indian Overseas Bank (11.7%) and the South Indian Bank (11.75%) have raised funds during the period are much higher,” he said.

Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) came into existence on November 11, 1999, under the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Act 1999. The main focus of the Board was to provide investment for critical and large infrastructure projects in Kerala. Comprehensive modification of the Act and Scheme has been made through an amendment Ordinance in August 2016. With new strategy and structure, KIIFB aims to dynamically mobilise funds for the infrastructure development of Kerala.

13,,2019-04-11T23:46:00.0000000Z,A runoff election in a few weeks will decide whether Volodymyr Zelensky ... The Liberal government recently renewed Canada's military commitment of 200 training soldiers in western Ukraine until 2022. Leroux said there's no shortage of work for them ...,"It's a long way from the killing fields of Kandahar to the laneways of Lviv, Ukraine — but for Lt.-Col. Pierre Leroux, the newer conflict carries some echoes of the older one.

When Leroux arrived in Afghanistan in the fall of 2010, the Canadian army was helping to train Afghan forces to fight in the middle of a shooting war with the insurgent Taliban.

In 2019, Leroux leads the Canadian task force training Ukrainian soldiers to fight an equally deadly, hot-and-cold conventional war with Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine's eastern regions.

There are important differences between the two wars — for starters, Canadians were on the frontlines in Kandahar and are not in Lviv — but in both conflicts Leroux arrived on the scene at a watershed moment, just as the war was about to evolve into something different.

His tour of Afghanistan as a company commander in the 1st Battalion Royal 22e Regiment came just after an American military surge had tamed the wildly dangerous Kandahar province, giving the Canadians an opening to finally help establish some semblance of governance.

Lt.-Col. Pierre Leroux, left, speaks with an unidentified American soldier in Zangabad, Afghanistan. At the time, Leroux was a major leading a combat company. He is now the commander of Canada's training mission in Ukraine. (Murray Brewster/CBC News)

Ukraine is on the cusp of a transformation of its own, with the possible election of a new president whose opaque platform has some international analysts worried that he is pro-Russian.

A runoff election in a few weeks will decide whether Volodymyr Zelensky unseats Petro Poroshenko, whose pro-Western outlook and dogged military campaign in two restive districts (known as 'oblasts') has worn thin with ordinary Ukrainian voters.

The Liberal government recently renewed Canada's military commitment of 200 training soldiers in western Ukraine until 2022.

Leroux said there's no shortage of work for them to do.

""There are so many things that we can improve,"" Leroux told the CBC in a telephone interview from the military training centre in Yavoriv, near Lviv. ""It's pretty incredible. There's still a lot of doors open.""

Canadian troops first deployed to help train Ukrainian army units in advanced combat skills — including the detection and defusing of roadside bombs and booby traps, which presented a major problem in the early stages of the conflict.

Leroux said the Ukrainians have advanced to the point where they can train their own bomb disposal troops. The Canadians are now helping them with what's known as 'sapper' training: breaching fortifications, demolition and bridge-building under fire. They're also providing advanced courses to train snipers.

One of Canada's biggest contributions, however, has been in the field of advanced combat medical training.

When the Canadians arrived in September 2015, Ukrainian soldiers were only being given short, basic combat medic training by U.S. troops. In Canadian hands, that training has been expanded into a three-month course that delivers advanced life-saving skills.

A better chance of survival

It's important knowledge, given the Ukranian army's high attrition rate, Leroux said. Knowing the wounded have a better chance of survival has boosted the confidence levels of frontline troops.

Leroux said the politics of Ukraine is far removed from the work he and his troops are doing, but he's convinced the work has value.

""So I see this mission can keep on going for a while,"" he said.

The commander of HMCS Toronto, which is currently cruising the Black Sea off Ukraine and taking part in exercises with other NATO warships, expressed similar optimism in a ship-to-shore interview on Friday.

Commander Martin Fluet said that — unlike previous patrols, when his frigate and other allied ships faced low-flying Russian warplanes buzzing them — this latest foray into the region has been quiet.

Shadowed by the Russians

According to reports published in Moscow, two Russian warships — one of them an intelligence-gathering vessel — are shadowing the NATO task force.

Fluet confirmed those reports, but said it's all part of the routine.

""It is a very standoff approach, where they are following from a distance,"" he said. ""There was nothing hostile directed towards us.""

The U.S. has proposed sending even more ships into the Black Sea and stepped-up port visits along the coast in eastern Europe — partly in response to the capture of small Ukrainian naval vessels by the Russians in the disputed Kerch Strait last November.

After a meeting with alliance foreign ministers in Washington this week, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he hopes allies ""agree on new measures to improve our knowledge of the situation in the [Black Sea] region.""

I suspect she’d an inkling this was coming. After all, every time she turns on the TV, watch a movie, read the paper or browse some social media chat room the message is unmistakable. It’s all the fault of those Russians.

She being born and bred in Moscow, though for years a proud Canadian, it’s a tad annoying to constantly see your native land being blamed for every problem on earth.

For comparison, let’s recall those old John Wayne movies where Indians — as they were then called — were portrayed as such needless, nasty critters they could be shown getting mown down like dithering ducks in some early-morning November sky. The movie audiences of the time ate it up.

Thankfully, that storyline doesn’t play well today. But such cultural and political correctness isn’t universal. Now the only bunch left you can impugn without fear of societal vilification are those nasty Ruskies.

Now, truth be told, I’ve always had a fondness for Russia: some of the greatest literature, dance, art, engineering and science has emanated from what is by far and away the biggest slice of national landmass on our planet. Oh, and having the world’s most beautiful women didn’t hurt, either.

Of course, if I actually lived and worked there, it wouldn’t last long — pondering in print why Vladimir Putin insists on being photographed with his shirt off more often than Kim Kardashian would likely guarantee I’d soon be slipping whilst giving some ninth-storey windows a quick clean. (I love Canada — it puts up with me.)

But what’s the latest dirty deed those Russians are involved in? For an answer, who better to turn to than the man standing bravely and resolutely on guard for Canada: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Yes, in a much-needed (for him, anyhow) time out from insulting Indigenous women protesting mercury poisoning or booting former ministers out of caucus because they think the rule of law worth defending, Trudeau was in fine fettle, speaking about something he undoubtedly is an expert in: malign actors.

“We have seen over the past number of years an increase in the interference or the implication of foreign actors in democratic processes,” he said. “We saw very clearly that countries like Russia are behind a lot of the divisive campaigns, a lot of the divisive social media.

“The election that’s coming up in six months will be decided by Canadians. We’re going to work very hard with all the intelligence communities and our partners around the world to ensure that our democracies stay strong for all the different voices that express themselves within it.”

Wow. He certainly wasn’t talking about his own Liberal caucus and how it stands up for different voices within it.

That’s not all. Apparently, we need a group of five senior civil servants who might be forced to go public if they find a malign act of interference in the October campaign.

What a bunch of tosh. We’ve witnessed a bigger threat to the values this country holds dear emanating out of Trudeau’s own government than could ever be envisaged by some nebulous Moscow-based bunch intent on placing some daft ads on Facebook.

But this is just a smokescreen. The only threat this man is concerned about is the free-fall his personal approval ratings are taking at the polls. Or maybe that too is some fiendish Russian-inspired plot.

No, this is simply another lame attempt to derail the SNC-Lavalin scandal, to make himself look statesman-like when in reality Trudeau appears increasingly as a thin-skinned, bully boy.

Still, he might have reason to worry about those Russians after all. I know a fair number here in Calgary, mostly engineers in the energy industry.

Yes, they will be interfering in the federal election all right. It’s called voting and like the majority of their fellow Calgarians, they won’t be marking an X anywhere near Trudeau’s party.

And after battling both internally and at the ballot box for decades to play more than a token role on the provincial political stage, the surprise move leaves Lamont and the party scrambling on the eve of a possible election; Premier Brian Pallister has hinted recently he may send Manitobans to the polls before the scheduled Oct. 6, 2020 vote.

If Klassen is successful in her bid to run under the Liberal banner in the federal riding of Churchill Keewatinook-Aski, Manitoba Liberal Leader Dougald Lamont and MLAs Cindy Lamoureux and former leader Jon Gerrard will be without the necessary fourth seat in the house required to maintain official status.

Her decision could significantly weaken the provincial party, which gained official status in the legislature last summer after 23 years without the funding, research staff and guaranteed participation in question period and on committees that accompany it.

Grit MLA Judy Klassen is prepared to sacrifice the gains it has taken Manitoba Liberals more than two decades to achieve in order to pursue her dream of running for Justin Trudeau in this fall's federal election.

Klassen was elected as MLA for Keewatinook in 2016, snagging an upset victory against NDP incumbent and former cabinet minister Eric Robinson.

She served as interim party leader after Rana Bokhari stepped down following the 2016 election and then fought for control of the party — eventually dropping out and throwing her support behind Lamoureux — at the October 2017 leadership convention.

Lamont acknowledged that Klassen's pending departure could put the Liberals in a bind, but told reporters he'd support her decision. In March he told the Free Press that he and his three MLAs would be seeking nominations in advance of Manitobans heading to the polls.

The prospect of an early election may be more of an immediate concern, he said.

""We’re all in an odd position because the premier seems intent on breaking his fixed election date… so because of that everything’s up in the air, so we’re trying to cover all our bases and so is (Klassen),"" he said.

Klassen, who filed her federal nomination papers Wednesday, said she plans to hold onto her provincial Liberal nomination, but would abandon it in order to legally campaign as a federal candidate.

If nominated federally, she would square off against NDP incumbent Niki Ashton, who has represented the riding since 2015 when it was established and Churchill before that, from 2008 until 2015.

""The investments that the federal government has made in the North have really greatly impacted my communities and I want to make sure that continues,"" Klassen said, adding said she's confident the Liberals will keep her seat, no matter who the candidate is.

""I’m very confident. The Manitoba Liberals have never been stronger and we will not lose that seat,"" she said.

Lamont was similarly optimistic.

""We’re going to have official party status going into this election — because I think there’s going to be an election this summer — and we’re going to come out of it with much more than official party status,"" he said.

Yet according to the latest Probe Research quarterly poll, Manitoba Liberal support is dwindling outside Winnipeg, hovering around 18 per cent in March. Within city limits, the Grits sat around 23 per cent support.

University of Winnipeg political science professor Shannon Sampert said she wasn't surprised to see Klassen seek a federal nod, but described the move as ""opportunist.""

""Holding both positions at the same time... it doesn’t do much for her constituency; while she’s out door-knocking federally, does she have her head in the game provincially?"" Sampert said.

""For First Nations however, it’s true that federal politics has more resonance and thus it is likely why she wanted to make the leap... to have more ability to help people in her area.""

Klassen is from St. Theresa Point First Nation, an isolated northern reserve that's home to about 4,500 people. The community is part of the Island Lake region, which also includes Garden Hill, Red Sucker Lake and Wasagamach.

The Churchill Keewatinook-Aski riding is one of the largest in Canada and its population is largely Indigenous. Klassen acknowledged taking on Ashton federally would be challenging. Klassen said Ashton hasn't worked hard enough to help those in the North.

""The North has been opening up and we just need that continued investment and it happened under Justin Trudeau. Whereas the incumbent was there for a long time and we’re still struggling with poverty, still struggling with so many issues,"" she said.

""Had we had proper representation for my people, I believe that we wouldn’t have had to bury so many people unnecessarily these past decades.""

Ashton's office declined a request for comment.

16,World,2019-04-11T16:02:00.0000000Z,"Canada’s canola exporters are stuck with $ ... The committee’s report is expected to be released before the October federal election, but it won’t be focused on the foreign cyber threats ...","When it comes to defending Canada from the menace posed by the People’s Republic of China, it is now a matter of public record, and should be a matter of some embarrassment to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, if not shame, that the course his government embarked upon almost four years ago was dangerously naïve, if not recklessly thoughtless.

It’s a tragedy that it took the Chinese Ministry of State Security’s kidnapping of former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and cultural entrepreneur Michael Spavor to prove that the Beijing regime was not the “win-win, golden-decade” friend and trade partner Trudeau had incessantly harped about. Robert Schellenberg, dubiously convicted on drug-smuggling charges in the first place, had his 15-year jail sentence upgraded to a cell on death row. Canada’s canola exporters are stuck with $2.7 billion in export contracts that Beijing has ripped up. Threats of further punishment hang in the air.

It’s all because Canada detained Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou last December on a U.S. Justice Department extradition warrant. Meng is sought by the U.S. to face charges of fraud and dodging sanctions on Iran. Beijing needed to throw somebody up against a wall and slap him around, so President Xi Jinping chose Justin Trudeau.

Beijing needed to throw somebody up against a wall and slap him around, so President Xi Jinping chose Justin Trudeau.

Beijing’s complex campaigns of subversion, threats, influence-buying, bullying and espionage in Canada stretch back much farther than last December, of course. So does the sleazy tendency of Canadian politicians to look the other way, or rush to Beijing’s defence whenever anyone in the intelligence community publicly notices the obvious, or throw the director of the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service under the bus for pointing it out.

When CSIS director Richard Fadden had the temerity to point out nearly a decade ago that there were provincial cabinet ministers and other elected officials in Canada who had fallen under Beijing’s general influence, several Liberal and NDP MPs demanded his resignation.

So it was refreshing to see that Tuesday’s first-ever annual report from the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP) made no bones about it. China is a threat to Canada’s national security, the committee found. Terrorism, espionage and foreign influence, cyber threats, major organized crime and weapons of mass destruction were all listed in the NSICOP report among the top threats to Canada. China figures in the report’s findings under espionage and foreign influence, and under cyber threats as well.

Russia is right up there, too, and although the report is redacted in several places, other unnamed governments were reported to be busy with the same dirty work. But it was the novelty of China being singled out for once, in a high-level federal government intelligence report, that’s worth noticing. Usually, the federal government lets China get away with anything.

“China is known globally for its efforts to influence Chinese communities and the politics of other countries. The Chinese government has a number of official organizations that try to influence Chinese communities and politicians to adopt pro-China positions, most prominently the United Front Work Department,” the report states, referring directly to Fadden’s whistle-blowing in 2010.

The report also notes a 2017 warning from David Mulroney, a former ambassador to China, about Beijing’s influence-peddling efforts in Canada. To get what it wants, Beijing mobilizes student groups, diaspora groups, “and people who have an economic stake in China, to work behind the scenes.” The report also notes the unsavoury business of lavish political donations on offer from Chinese businessmen with close links to China’s Communist Party leadership.

Two years ago, the Financial Times obtained the United Front Work Department’s training manual, which boasts about the electoral successes of 10 pro-Beijing politicians in Ontario. “We should aim to work with those individuals and groups that are at a relatively high level, operate within the mainstream of society and have prospects for advancement,” the manual states.

The reason for the public’s relative inattention to influence-and-espionage threats posed by foreign powers like China and Russia is that the federal government tends to avoid addressing the issue publicly. “As it stands now, an interested Canadian would have to search a number of government websites to understand the most significant threats to Canada,” the committee found.

“For some threats, such as terrorism, information is readily available and regularly updated … For other threats, such as organized crime or interference in Canadian politics, information is often limited, scattered among different sources or incomplete. The Committee believes that Canadians would be equally well served if more information about threats were readily available.”

That information is available, of course. It just hasn’t been coming from the federal government. In his just-published book, Claws of the Panda: Beijing’s Campaign of Influence and Intimidation in Canada, veteran foreign affairs reporter Jonathan Manthorpe painstakingly enumerates the breadth and scope of the United Front Work Department’s organizations in Canada, and Beijing’s intimate links throughout Canada’s business class. Manthorpe relied solely on the public record, showing that Beijing’s strong-arming, its inducements and its subtle and not-so-subtle intimidation have been carried out in plain sight for years.

Last year, a coalition of diaspora groups led by Amnesty International provided CSIS, Canada’s spy agency, with an exhaustive account of Beijing’s intensive campaign of bullying, threats and harassment targeting Canadian diaspora organizations devoted to Chinese democracy, the Falun Gong spiritual movement, Tibetan sovereignty, and the Uighurs. A Muslim ethnic minority in Xinjiang, the Uighur people are currently being subjected to an overwhelming tyranny of concentration camps, religious persecution, “re-education,” family separation and ’round-the-clock, pervasive surveillance. “Canada has become a battleground on which the Chinese Communist Party seeks to terrorize, humiliate and neuter its opponents,” says Manthorpe.

That kind of subversion usually occurs behind the scenes. But for years, Confucius Institutes have operated openly in dozens of Canadian universities, colleges and high schools. “In most cases,” Manthorpe contends, “they are espionage outstations for Chinese embassies and consulates through which they control Chinese students, gather information on perceived enemies and intimidate dissidents.”

Because its mandate covers more than a dozen institutions and agencies, NSICOP – first proposed 15 years ago, but only now getting off the ground – had a lot of ground to cover. More than half of the report’s 121 pages are devoted to a review of the intelligence functions of the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces. But it’s subversion by foreign governments that seems to have caught the parliamentary committee’s attention: CSIS told NSICOP the foreign-influence threat is becoming more acute, and countering it will call for “a more significant response” in the coming years.

With that in mind, the committee is already working on a follow-up review of the mandate, priority and resources the federal government provides Canada’s intelligence community to monitor and counter the foreign-influence threat. The committee’s report is expected to be released before the October federal election, but it won’t be focused on the foreign cyber threats the government is already preparing to monitor and expose during the election campaign.

“We’re going to outline the primary-threat actors, we’re going to be examining the threat those actors pose to our institutions and, to a certain extent, our ethno-cultural communities,” NSICOP chair David McGuinty told reporters Tuesday. “We’re working feverishly to get it done.”

About time, too.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP, Dmitri Lovetsky

A House of Commons committee is urging the government to work with NATO to determine Russia’s military intentions in the North and get help to protect the country’s Arctic sovereignty.

That was the top recommendation of a report tabled Wednesday by the Commons foreign-affairs committee based on a study it began last June.

It arrived one day after Russian President Vladimir Putin outlined an ambitious plan to increase Russia’s Arctic presence, including expanding its fleet of nuclear-powered icebreakers and building new ports and other infrastructure.

With Arctic sea ice melting, Putin said he plans to dramatically increase Russian cargo-ship traffic in northern shipping lanes.

Russia, the U.S., Canada, Denmark and Norway are trying to settle jurisdictions in the vast territory as disappearing polar ice opens new and lucrative possibilities for oil and gas exploration as well as shipping.

The Russian leader invited foreign companies to invest in projects at both ends of the Arctic shipping route, from Murmansk in Russia’s northwest to the Kamchatka Peninsula in the east.

In contrast, Wednesday’s report says that the “Canadian Arctic continues to suffer from an infrastructure deficit” and that “vigilant foreign and defence policies are not, on their own, enough.”

“There is also the national imperative of ensuring vibrant communities,” the report says. It says a “direct line” can be drawn “between Northern and Indigenous empowerment and the assertion of Arctic sovereignty.”

The report urges Canada to work with its partners in NATO’s governing body, the North Atlantic Council, to better understand Russia’s military intentions in the Arctic and to consider the most appropriate and “measured response.”

It makes clear this is about “deterring and defending against any threat to the members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.”

“Russia has been rebuilding and modernizing its military capabilities and has demonstrated a willingness to challenge the international rules-based order. Perhaps most alarming, with new missile technology, Russian aircraft and submarines can now strike targets at great distances, including from launch points well outside of North American airspace and waters,” the report says. “There is a need for deterrence through the collective will of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.”

Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland’s office said Canada’s sovereignty in the Arctic is “well-established” and the government will respond to the report in detail in due course.

“Canada co-operates with all Arctic Council members, including Russia, to advance shared interests such as sustainable development and environmental protection, the role of Indigenous peoples, oceans, climate change adaptation and scientific research,” said spokesperson Adam Austen. “Canada is firmly asserting its presence in the North, ensuring we have the capability and capacity to protect and patrol the land, sea and sky in our sovereign Arctic territory. We remain firm and steadfast in defending Canada’s interests in the Arctic.”

The Arctic Council is a bloc of eight northern countries that also includes the United States.

On Tuesday, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan said he “can’t talk about Russia’s actions and reasons” for its Arctic behaviour but he said the North forms a significant part of the Liberal government’s new defence policy.

Six Arctic patrol vessels will be undergoing trials shortly and the Canadian Forces have done Arctic exercises with NATO partners, including the United States, he noted.

“We are taking our Arctic sovereignty very seriously,” he said. “We’re sending a very strong message.”

In the past, the Liberals have tried to work with Russia within the Arctic Council. But Russia’s aggressive posture elsewhere — its annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014, fomenting of separatism in eastern Ukraine, and allegations of cybermeddling and foreign election interference — have strained co-operation on the Arctic.

Alison LeClaire, the senior Arctic official at Global Affairs Canada, told the Commons foreign-affairs committee last June that Russia’s contributions at the Arctic Council were “important and worthwhile” but she said its behaviour elsewhere in the world hasn’t helped.

“With respect to co-operation with Russia, one need only look at a map of the circumpolar north to understand why working with them is in our interest. Together we share 75 per cent of the Arctic area,” she said.

Canada is well aware of Russia’s increased military activities in the North, including military drills, the reopening of bases, investments in its northern fleet and increased surveillance capabilities, said LeClaire.

“However, Russia’s military presence in the Arctic is still much more modest than it was in the 1980s,” she testified. ”Canada sees no immediate military threat in the Arctic, but we remain vigilant and are working with our allies and partners to keep the Arctic as a zone of peace and co-operation, a goal we share with Russia.”

Minister Vic Fedeli told a media briefing. Canada's most populous province and industrial powerhouse ...","By Fergal Smith

TORONTO (Reuters) - Ontario's Conservative government, presenting its first budget on Thursday, forecast a smaller deficit for the Canadian province in the current fiscal year and a return to balance by 2023-24 as it disclosed plans to reverse the growth in spending.

The Progressive Conservative Party, led by populist Doug Ford, won a majority of seats in last June's provincial election, promising greater fiscal prudence than the Liberal Party, which had held power for 15 years.

The budget ""sends a message to the world that we are serious about fiscal sustainability,"" Finance Minister Vic Fedeli told a media briefing.

Canada's most populous province and industrial powerhouse is projected to run a deficit of C$10.3 billion ($7.7 billion) in fiscal 2019-20, which began on April 1, including a C$1 billion reserve. That compares with an estimated deficit of C$11.7 billion in 2018-19.

The 2018-19 deficit was much more than the C$6.7 billion deficit projected by the Liberals in last year's budget, due mostly to accounting adjustments and the cancellation of a cap- and-trade carbon tax by the Conservatives.

But it was smaller than the C$13.5 billion deficit projected in February in a third-quarter update, while the 2023-24 projected timeline to eliminate the deficit was one year ahead of the Liberals' target.

That could soothe bond investors, who had been looking for evidence the Conservatives would tackle the province's heavy debt load. At about C$368 billion, estimated in 2018-19, Ontario has one of the largest sub-sovereign debts in the world.

The province, which has run deficits every year since 2008-09, pays more to borrow than some other major Canadian provinces, such as Quebec and British Columbia, that are running balanced budgets.

""I think it is positive from a market perspective,"" said Derek Burleton, deputy chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank. ""The deficit implementation plan is reasonable, provided it can meet its targets. They are clearly ambitious on spending.""

SLOWER SPENDING GROWTH

The budget, which looked to expand the sale of alcohol and allow tailgating for sporting events, limited overall spending growth to an average annual rate of 1 percent between 2018-19 and 2023-24, much less than inflation.

It included lower spending on children's and social services even as the Conservatives proposed a new dental program for low-income seniors and a new refundable tax credit for childcare costs that would provide up to C$6,000 per child under the age of 7, and a lesser amount for older children.

Like the federal government, Ontario has favored faster write-offs of capital investments rather than corporate tax cuts to bolster competitiveness with the United States.

But a slowdown in the once red-hot housing market and global economic headwinds could increase the fiscal challenges for the province, which accounts for about 40 percent of Canada's economy and is a major exporter of cars and other manufactured products.

The budget projected growth to slow to 1.4 percent in 2019 from 2.2 percent in 2018, while net debt-to-GDP, a key measure of fiscal health, was estimated at 40.2 percent in 2018-19, the second highest among Canada's 10 provinces. It is projected to rise to 40.7 percent in 2019-20, before dipping to 38.6 percent in 2023-24.

Putting the housing law into the budget bill is a tacit acknowledgment ...","OTTAWA — The federal Liberals are using their omnibus budget bill to legislate a ""right to housing"" in Canada, a pledge advocates worry could fall short of being the historic step the government wants without a few parliamentary tweaks before summer.

The budget bill would set into law rules for the Liberals' 10-year national housing strategy, now valued at more than $55 billion, impose those rules on future governments and create two new oversight bodies meant to make sure the spending reduces homelessness.

A national housing council is to advise the government on the effects of the strategy and a new housing advocate, tied to the Canadian Human Rights Commission, is to report annually on systemic issues preventing Canadians from finding affordable and safe places to live.

Reports would also be required every three years on how well the strategy is meeting national goals and furthering ""the progressive realization of the right to adequate housing"" — wording that mirrors international standards.

Watch: Trudeau touts home-buying measures in budget

In each case, the minister in charge of the strategy would have to ""reply and act"" on the reports, said Social Development Minister Jean-Yves Duclos, ""which will ensure there is sufficient pressure on the federal government to meet the legislated right to housing.""

Characterizing housing as a human right is meant to provide recourse, usually through tribunals, to anyone wrongfully denied a home for reasons such as ethnicity, religion, or gender identity, and put pressure on the federal government to help make the right a reality.

""The federal government has admitted to having an obligation when it comes to protecting the most vulnerable of Canadians,"" Duclos said in an interview Wednesday. ""There will always need to be a continuing conversation (and) that's exactly what the bill says — the national housing strategy will need to evolve, but I think we've made major steps in very little time.""

The United Nations special rapporteur on the right to housing said wording in the budget bill is a big step forward and addresses a long-running concern from the international body.

But Leilani Farha said her chief concern is that having an advocate ""hot-desking"" at the human-rights commission and filing annual reports ""doesn't amount to human-rights accountability by any measure.""

""The government needs to strengthen the role of the advocate so that they can appoint panels to hear systemic housing-related claims and recommend remedies,"" said the Canadian-based Farha.

""And the government can't be allowed to just ignore recommendations. If the legislation is strengthened in this way, then Canada would not just be in compliance with its international human rights obligations, it might also be a model for other countries.""

The Liberals have been looking into setting the right to housing into law since early in their mandate, when they met with housing advocates about ways to pump more money into affordable housing.

What followed, though, was a debate among officials in Duclos's Department of Employment and Social Development Canada and their counterparts in the Finance and Justice departments over how far the government could go in its wording, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.

The federal government has admitted to having an obligation when it comes to protecting the most vulnerable of Canadians. Jean-Yves Duclos

As time wore on, housing advocates became concerned about whether the government would have time to pass a law before the next election.

Putting the housing law into the budget bill is a tacit acknowledgment that time was running short. Inside the budget bill, it is practically assured passage by the summer.

Now, groups plan to lobby MPs for amendments to give the new housing council greater powers to critique government progress on the strategy and allow the advocate to refer issues to the human-rights tribunal for public hearings.

In a post to members, the Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness said ""the government got a lot right"" on housing in the budget bill, but the legislation lacks ""important elements of a workable, rights-based accountability framework that would ensure that the housing strategy is effective.""

United Conservative Party has vowed to kill the order if it wins the provincial election this week.,"Trans Mountain expansion and Keystone XL pipeline projects in court limbo trigger new ideas to get oil to market

News that permitting issues in the U.S. would delay Enbridge Inc.’s Line 3 replacement pipeline project until the middle of 2020 instead of late this year means that yet another boost in oil export capacity has been kicked down the road.

With both the Trans Mountain expansion and Keystone XL pipeline projects in court limbo, attention is turning to alternative ideas to expand Canada’s ability to continue to get its oil to market.

In a report to Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi last month, the National Energy Board said current pipeline capacity is fully utilized and crude-by-rail infrastructure is operating at or near capacity.

But it also identified potential long-term market access solutions that could include more oilsands bitumen upgrading and reversing existing import pipelines.

Unfortunately, none of those ideas works as a meaningful short-term alternative to new pipelines — and they face many of the same speed bumps — says NEB chief economist Jean-Denis Charlebois.

“Fundamentally, what this would require is regulatory approvals and significant capital investments because those things cannot occur overnight,” he said in an interview.

“First the economics have to be there … then those alternatives need to go through a regulatory process.”

A dearth of investment dollars for traditional drilling in Western Canada means there are also fewer dollars available for developing creative options, said Kevin Birn, a vice-president with IHS Energy in Calgary.

“I think you will have some creativity but if you really want creativity, they’ve got to see a future for investment in Western Canada,” he said.

Here’s a closer look at some pipeline alternative solutions.

The diluent dilemma

Raw bitumen at room temperature has the consistency of peanut butter. Below freezing, it’s as hard as a hockey puck.

To make it flow in a pipeline, producers mix as many as three barrels of light oil “diluent” for every seven barrels of bitumen — if one can eliminate or reduce the diluent, it frees up room in the pipeline.

In January, the Alberta government announced a $440-million loan guarantee to help Value Creation Inc. build a $2-billion upgrader that would convert diluted bitumen into medium synthetic crude and diesel, both capable of flowing undiluted in a pipeline.

The facility is the first in line for up to $1 billion in provincial incentives for partial upgraders, but it isn’t expected to be operating until at least 2022.

A report prepared for the province in 2017 suggested that a 100,000-barrel-per-day partial upgrading facility could add $10 to $15 of value to each barrel of bitumen. The report listed 10 pre-commercial technologies that have been tested or proposed for deployment in Alberta.

Any plan to reduce diluent must consider the impact on U.S. customers, who have configured their refineries to use diluted bitumen, said Birn.

He added diluent will still be needed to deliver the bitumen from the field to the partial upgrader, which means diluent recovery units likely also will need to be built.

New technology

No diluent at all would be required with a new technology to mix and coat bitumen with recycled plastic and form it into solid pucks for shipping in ordinary railcars or shipping containers.

An oil company affiliated with the tiny Heart Lake First Nation in northern Alberta is building a $50-million pilot plant to test the “CanaPux” product developed by Canadian National Railway Co.

But it’s not known when a commercial facility would follow.

Pipeline efficiency

Reducing the demand for diluent in Canada could help Enbridge decide on the option to convert its Southern Lights pipeline — used to import U.S. condensate diluent into Canada — into a crude oil export pipeline with capacity of about 150,000 bpd, possibly by 2023.

Meanwhile, the operator of the biggest oil export pipeline network in Canada is getting creative as it looks at using drag reducing agents inside the pipe and redirecting some downstream U.S. injections to open up long-haul capacity for Western Canada, along with low-cost pipeline and pumping station upgrades.

It thinks it could add another 50,000 to 100,000 bpd of incremental export space by mid-year and is studying a potential 450,000 bpd of throughput optimization initiatives.

Crude-by-rail

Rail exports rose to a record of over 350,000 bpd in December before falling in January and February after Alberta imposed production cuts to reduce storage and open up space on pipelines.

They are on the rise again as Alberta loosens its production quotas and Imperial Oil Ltd. restarts rail shipments it stopped in February.

Crude shipped by rail often contains diluent but the NEB notes more oil can be put in each car if the oil isn’t diluted — although that requires the use of cars that can be heated at the destination dock to drain the bitumen.

Meanwhile, Alberta’s NDP government is pressing ahead with plans to add locomotives and railcars to move 120,000 barrels per day of crude, starting at the end of the year — although the opposition United Conservative Party has vowed to kill the order if it wins the provincial election this week.

But when it comes to Canada’s review of whether or not to ban China’s Huawei from future 5G networks, the ISED Minister did not have much to say, still. According to Bloomberg, Bains provided an update on the status of Canada’s potential ban of Huawei for 5G networks.

“We’re still doing our due diligence, we’re still examining the relevant facts and information,” said Bains, adding, “I want to make sure we do our homework and have an informed decision.”

Back in January, the government said a decision on a Huawei ban was still ‘beyond weeks’ away. It’s unclear whether a decision will be made before this fall’s federal election.







Recently, Huawei’s security engineering was criticized by the United Kingdom’s GCHQ director, calling it ‘shoddy’.

Huawei is currently banned by the United States, along with Australia and New Zealand, over espionage fears. Canada and China have been embroiled in a diplomatic rift, ever since Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Vancouver last December. She currently faces extradition to the U.S. over allegations of fraud and violating U.S. sanctions against Iran.

Despite numerous countries blocking Huawei, the company recently told a handful of select Canadian media invited to its headquarters in Shenzhen, China, it should be trusted.

The coalition government goes into the contest as the underdog, with its six years in power tainted by policy stagnation and infighting that’s seen it twice switch leaders. While the center-right coalition has presided over an unprecedented hiring boom and is forecasting the nation’s first budget surplus in more than a decade, stagnant wages and spiraling power bills have eroded living standards for many voters.

“It’s taken us more than five years to turn around Labor’s budget mess,” Morrison said. “Now is not the time to turn back.”

Since the 2016 federal election, the government has lost its majority in the lower house after a defeat in a special ballot, compounding its challenge to win another term. Since replacing Malcolm Turnbull as prime minister in August, Morrison has struggled to close Labor’s lead in the polls. The party led by former union leader Bill Shorten, 51, was ahead by four points in the latest Newspoll.

Morrison is trumpeting proposals to flatten tax brackets so more than 90 percent of Australians pay 30 percent or less income tax. He’s also fast-tracking cuts for small and medium-sized companies. The government also plans to continue safeguarding Australia’s borders after halting the tide of asylum seekers smuggled to the nation by boat since the coalition won office in 2013.

Labor is targeting its income tax cuts at the lowest paid, earning less than A$48,000 a year. It’s also proposing a “living wage” to replace the national minimum wage, and is pledging to scale back tax perks for property investors after a five-year housing boom priced many young Australians out of the market.

“Australians face a real and vital choice at this election,” Shorten told reporters in Melbourne on Thursday. “Do you want Labor’s energy, versus the government’s tiredness? Labor’s focus on the future, versus being stuck in the past? Labor’s positive plan for all Australians or a negative fear campaign from the other side?”

Labor’s policies on wages and housing have prompted concern in business circles and handed the government ammunition.

“To Labor’s credit, they have released key policy well in advance of an election,” said Su-Lin Ong, head of Australian economic and fixed-income strategy at Royal Bank of Canada in Sydney and a former Australian Treasury official. “But there is a view that a number of those measures will be negative for the economy at a time when clearly growth is disappointing and underwhelming.”

She highlighted concerns that wage growth isn’t being linked to productivity gains, and the potential for the housing market slump to deepen further.

The biggest divide is around energy and climate change. Partisan politics and policy missteps over the past decade have left consumers and manufacturers facing escalating electricity bills amid a bungled transition from fossil fuel to wind and solar power.

The ruling coalition has been torn on the issue for years, with a right-wing faction demanding subsidies for new coal-fired power plants and hindering greater support for renewables. Morrison has championed coal, rejected legislating emissions cuts and said the sole focus of energy policy is to lower voters’ electricity bills through strengthening the power grid.

In contrast, Labor is pledging to reduce the nation’s greenhouse gases by 45 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. It also wants to toughen emissions caps and has promised a A$10 billion funding boost for renewable energy projects.

A Lowy Institute poll released in July showed 59 percent of Australians believe global warming is a serious problem that needs to be combated even if it involves significant costs -- up from 36 percent in 2012. The survey also found 84 percent of respondents want the government to focus on developing more renewable energy sources.

Ben Spurr talks to officials with the Toronto Transit Commission every day and can tell just by looking at a streetcar when it went into service.

He’s been the transportation reporter at the Toronto Star for nearly three years and says he can’t help that his beat changes the way he views Toronto, but he still tries to keep a balance.

“I try to remain a bit removed from it so that I’m not too absorbed, so that I can still speak in plain language (for readers),” Spurr said.

The public is at the forefront of why journalists do their work and Spurr said he also keeps readers in mind when coming up with story ideas. For example, he noticed a lot of talk on social media and among advocacy groups about road safety being a concern, so he made a point to explore those issues.

Spurr said while he’s passionate about his beat, he’s more passionate about journalism.

“All the things that apply to the regular field of journalism – holding people powerful to account, giving a voice to people who might not otherwise have a voice – those are the stories that I find the most fulfilling and that I’m most passionate about.”

He doesn’t get tired of writing about the same topic because he feels there’s enough variety within it and said there’s an upside in the repetition: bringing insight and context from knowledge a non-beat reporter may not have.

Spurr’s March 2019 investigation into TTC officers using controversial forms to collect users’ private information prompted the TTC to stop using them. The investigation uncovered they were the same forms the police had previously used for carding, the street check system previous Star investigations had found police were using for racial profiling.

He said he’s most proud of his work that was first published in 2017 that uncovered how Ontario’s former transportation minister intervened in getting GO Transit stations approved, including one in his own riding.

“It was quite a fulfilling story to see play out,” Spurr said.

His editor, Irene Gentle, said Spurr checks of all the boxes of a great beat reporter: he breaks stories, handles breaking news well and is a “beautiful” feature writer. But a journalist like Spurr is becoming an anomaly in some newsrooms as the number of beat reporters shrinks.

J-Source spoke with Gentle and two others, one at the helm of the Whitehorse Star and the other at CTV Saskatoon. While all three editors manage differently sized offices, and approach beat reporting distinctively, they each stressed its value.

They said focusing on the same subject matter allows reporters to develop strong and trusting relationships with sources, ask the right questions, provide unique context and insight, break stories and write in-depth pieces.

But it’s a time of shrinking newsrooms, journalists having to navigate the proverbial “do more with less” and a digital landscape that outlets are still trying to master. Specialized beats emerged in the 1920s and have been on the decline for at least a decade, likely longer, according to a 2013 article from the Ryerson Review of Journalism.

The detriments of a lack of beat reporting are felt by both the public and journalists: reporters with a surface understanding of a topic, despite their best efforts, may not be as critical or ask the right questions, therefore providing audiences with less.

An editor of a large newspaper, the long-time editor of a small paper and a broadcast news director from a medium-sized market share what beat reporting looks like in their newsrooms:

The Toronto Star – reversing a trend

Virtually all newsrooms in Canada have experienced downsizing in recent years and the Toronto Star is no exception. But while other organizations cut beats, the Toronto Star did the opposite.

“In a way, I guess we may have kind of reversed a trend,” Toronto Star editor Irene Gentle said.

The Star cut general assignment reporters, rather than beat reporters. The majority of reporters at the paper are assigned to a beat, which allows for more specific and unique ones like work and wealth, the Toronto Blue Jays and affordable housing.

“If we can’t do everything, then let’s pick areas that we think are really important, that we think people will think are really important, and focus our energies there,” Gentle said, adding the paper also chooses less covered topics.

There are still beats she’d like to add to the newsroom, but said if she had unlimited staff, she still wouldn’t want every reporter assigned to a specific file.

General assignment reporters bring a “real flexibility and a real freshness” to journalism and file stories and bring ideas that just don’t fall into a beat, Gentle said.

While she feels very strongly about beat reporting, Gentle said she values all types of journalism.

“They all fit into the mix that’s important to help people be informed and to be a responsible journalistic outlet,” she says.

The Whitehorse Daily Star – informal collaboration

There are four reporters at the Whitehorse Daily Star and each is assigned to a beat: municipal affairs, legislature, courts and RCMP, and one reporter handles mining, Indigenous affairs, wildlife and the environment. Those beats have been defined at the paper for decades.

“It’s a system that’s been in use in the paper since the 1970s and we find it continues to work and we haven’t made any major changes to them,” long-time editor Jim Butler said.

He said he’s open to changing the beats but rarely gets asked, plus having the same beats for decades has served the paper well. Butler pointed to a story the paper broke in 2002 when the then-political reporter’s source divulged that the premier would be calling a territorial election. The paper had the scoop and ran a front-page story before the election date was announced.

“It caused a lot of anger and turmoil within senior government levels and amazed our competitors,” Butler said, adding it wouldn’t have been possible without the time dedicated to the beat.

Reporters have generally always stuck to a beat at the Whitehorse Star, except for a short period when the paper went down to two reporters during a recession from 1982 to 1985.

“During those three years, the beats kind of dissolved and people just did what had to be done,” Butler said.

As soon as the paper was fully staffed again, so were the beats.

General assignment and breaking news stories are divvied up among the reporters, who receive help from Butler if needed. He has been with the paper for nearly 40 years and has been editor for 31. Two of the current reporters have been there since 1985 and 2000, while the other two started last year.

The institutional knowledge benefits the new reporters. He said a smaller newsroom allows for collaboration to help with general assignments.

“We have the advantage of being a lot more informal,” Butler said.

CTV Saskatoon – areas of focus

There are two main challenges standing in the way of beats in the medium-sized market of CTV Saskatoon: staffing levels and turnover, according to news director Jill Smith.

“You see the beats disappearing all the time,” she said.

Medium-sized markets see more turnover and can be a training ground for some journalists. Young journalists can grow and develop at CTV Saskatoon. They often find their voice, learn an area of focus, then leave for a bigger market before they can become strong beat reporters, Smith said.

For reporters that do stay in the medium markets, and in the business, they often move on to more senior roles, leaving reporter positions open for less experienced journalists looking to hone their skills.

“It’s rare to see a person who has been a reporter for 20 years. They move to become producers or they’re running newsrooms,” Smith said.

There are advantages to less beat reporters, including having a group of well-rounded reporters that are flexible and can tackle any type of story.

“When breaking news happens, when a big story happens, you need the ability to be able to send any of them to that story. Especially when you’re in a smaller market.”

CTV Saskatoon has a roster of general assignment reporters, some of who have an area of focus. Smith said that comes to be organically by reporters taking an interest in a topic and being tenacious about learning it.

She helps develop this by noticing a trend with reporters’ pitches, giving feedback and asking reporters: What stories are missing that you want to do?",How beat reporting in 2019 works at 3 different-sized outlets across Canada,J-Source,http://j-source.ca/article/how-beat-reporting-in-2019-works-in-3-different-sized-newsrooms-across-canada/

While many upcoming polls will focus on the share of power that each political party may receive, the Forum for Millennial Leaders (FML) took a different look at the data and broke down Canada’s current governments by age demographic.

What they found was that, while Millennials (officially classified by FML as those who were born between 1980 and 2000) make up a higher percentage of the voting population than Baby Boomers or Generation Xers, they are significantly underrepresented in elected government positions.

“[FML] undertook a unique study of the generational and gender breakdown of the 1,100 elected officials in Canada’s federal, provincial, and territorial governments,” states the report.

“The bottom line: Millennials are the largest generation of potential voters in Canada, but are drastically underrepresented at every level of government.”

Looking at Canada’s Federal Parliament found that only 13% of the 338 seats were occupied by Canadians aged 39-years-old or younger, while Generation Xers (those born between 1961 and 1979, making up 32% of the Canada’s voting population) occupied 51% of the total seats.

Baby Boomers fell right in between at 36% in the Federal Parliament, a representation premium of +37%. Gen X was at +60%, while Millennials saw a -62% representation deficit.

Unfortunately for the 7% of the voting population belonging to the Silent Generation (born 1920 to 1940), they do not have a single representative at the federal level — though seeing as the youngest their age would be is 80-years-old, we don’t blame them for enjoying their retirements instead.

There is one member of the Silent Generation elected at the provincial level, however, with a BC MLA belonging to the demographic.

BC’s entire legislative assembly appears to be a bit older than its provincial neighbours, at that, as it only has a millennial representation of 3%, while Gen X and Baby Boomers account for 49% and 46%, respectively.

A trip across the Rocky Mountains to Alberta finds the sweet(er) spot for Millennial leaders, as a full 23% of their legislative assembly is made up of Canadians aged 20 to 39-years-old.

However, Alberta’s millennials are facing a -43% representation deficit, as they account for 40% of the province’s voting population.

Quebec and Ontario both fell somewhere between their western counterparts, with 17% and 20% of legislative seats being filled with millennials, respectively.

Of the political parties that make up the parliament, Bloc Quebecois saw the highest representation of millennials, tying Baby Boomers at 30% apiece.

The NDP was the next youngest at 17%, followed by the Conservative Party of Canada at 13%.

And while Justin Trudeau’s Liberals may have the second highest representation of women (29% of elected members, falling behind the NDP’s 41%) the majority party had the lowest percentage of millennials, with only 11%.

The remaining 54% and 35% of the party are made up of Generation X and Baby Boomers.

FML noted that, due to the disclosure of birthdates of elected officials not actually being required in Canada, so data had to be found from multiple sources to determine the ages of the seated members.

Hard data could not be confirmed in 19% of cases, according to the report, so generational estimates were used based on the information that FML did have.

Canada, a G7 economy, has suffered in recent years from low productivity growth, lackluster foreign direct investment and difficulty in bringing oil, one of its major exports, to market due to a lack of pipeline capacity.

When I travel overseas, I often hear concerns from investors about Canada's falling position in the world RBC Chief Executive Dave McKay

The Liberal government, which faces a general election in October, has committed to major infrastructure investment and has allowed businesses to write off additional capital investments to make them more competitive, but has opted not to match aggressive tax cuts by the United States.

“Our competitiveness is challenged. Our capacity to grow and advance our economy is stalling,” said RBC Chief Executive Dave McKay, in prepared remarks for shareholders at the company’s 150th annual meeting, in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

“When I travel overseas, I often hear concerns from investors about Canada’s falling position in the world,” McKay said.

RBC has a market capitalization of about $149 billion, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.

Data last month for the fourth quarter showed that Canada’s economy barely grew due to plunging Canadian crude oil export prices and that the labour productivity of Canadian businesses fell by 0.4 per cent.

Steps that Canada can take to improve its competitiveness include building digital and physical infrastructure, such as energy pipelines, McKay said.

Due to a lack of pipeline capacity, the price of Canadian heavy crude fell last October to a discount of more than US$50 a barrel below the benchmark for U.S. oil.

A Canadian court last August overturned approval of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion. The government has since bought the pipeline in an effort to save the project.

Amnesty International releases 2019 Human Rights Agenda for Canada, ahead of federal election

Amnesty International released the organization’s 2019 Human Rights Agenda for Canada and called on all governments in the country to take a serious stance against human rights abuses, domestically and abroad. The report, Building Hope, Addressing Injustice, is being released with less than six months to go before the 2019 federal election, against an international backdrop of conflict, strife, and continued rise of political agendas fueling hate and demonization; and amidst a domestic context of growing divisive political rhetoric about refugees, violence against Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people, systemic discrimination against racialized communities, and failure to uphold the land rights of Indigenous peoples.

Building Hope, Addressing Injustice, notes several positive steps taken by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government to advance human rights nationally and internationally. These include supporting a legislative framework for the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples domestically and showing global leadership with respect to jailed women human rights defenders in Saudi Arabia, the UN’s Global Compact on Refugees and the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar.

However, the report highlights deepening concern that Canada has failed to meet its international human rights obligations here at home. Despite several governments making welcome commitments towards reconciliation with First Nations, Métis and Inuit peoples, there remains a wide gulf between these promises and the frequent violation of the rights of communities living on the frontlines of resource development. Similarly, Amnesty expresses concerns over the federal government’s failure to live up to its promises to implement known solutions to violence against Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit persons in advance of the forthcoming report of the National Inquiry, which will be delivered to government on April 30.

Also, for the first time this year, the Human Rights Agenda is drawing attention to Canada’s long history of anti-Black racism and violent discrimination in the criminal justice system, with a particular focus on concerns in Toronto, and is calling for a ban on racial profiling and random police street checks.

“The federal government has advanced commendable human rights positions globally and various governments in the country have pursued domestic reforms that strengthen rights protection. But it has become clear that progress has slowed, challenging files have bogged down, and once again politics too frequently take precedence over the country’s international human rights obligations,” said Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada’s English Branch. “The harsh reality is that Canada has been slow to act on violence against Indigenous women, including forced and coerced sterilization; is stalled on its commitment to establish an Ombudsperson for Canadian business overseas; and still refuses to end glaring human rights failings such as the continued construction of the Site C dam, the Safe Third Country Agreement and the sale of light armoured vehicles to Saudi Arabia.”

In this year’s Human Rights Agenda, Amnesty International assesses progress with respect to 32 recommendations made to the federal government last year, in 2018. That Report Card highlights the federal government’s welcome support for Bill C-262, a private member’s bill to implement the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples that is now before the Senate. Six recommendations are found to be well underway but incomplete and 14 others to be facing serious concerns or uncertainty. A troubling 11 recommendations are given a failing grade reflecting no notable progress.

This year, apart from the federal recommendations, Amnesty International is also making recommendations aimed at specific provincial governments, namely those in British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec, as well as others directed collectively to all provincial and territorial governments in the country. This is due to the fact that Amnesty has increasingly responded to a number of international human rights concerns that fall under provincial jurisdiction. It also recognizes that, at the end of the day, all levels of government are responsible for upholding Canada’s international human rights obligations.

In this year’s report, Amnesty International is offering 38 recommendations for action in six areas, including:

• Halting construction of the Site C dam, as per the United Nations Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination’s recommendation. In fact, as of this agenda release, the federal and BC governments have less than one week to respond to the committee’s urgent deadline to stop building this destructive dam.



• Implementing a ban on racial profiling that will include putting an immediate stop to all random police street checks.



• Taking concrete steps towards a “progressive” trade agenda that upholds Canada’s human rights obligations, including consistent human rights impact assessments of trade deals.



• Establishing the Canadian Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise, as promised by the federal government over 14 months ago but now inexplicably delayed.



• Addressing health and human rights concerns from the Mount Polley mine disaster in British Columbia and mercury poisoning at Grassy Narrows First Nation in Ontario.



• Taking concrete action to end the harmful practice of sterilizing Indigenous women without their consent.



• Adopting recommendations to address concerns associated with policing the 2018 G7 Summit.



• Withdrawing proposed legislation in Quebec regulating religious dress and symbols.



• Ending gender-based violence, including by developing a National Action Plan and taking comprehensive action to address violence against First Nations, Inuit, and Métis women, girls, and two-spirit people.



• Articulating a clear and comprehensive feminist foreign policy, something the federal government has touted, but not elaborated on.



• Ensuring equal access to essential health care, regardless of immigration status.



• Suspending the Canada-U.S. Safe Third Country Agreement.



“As Canada vies for a coveted seat on the United Nations Security Council, the whole world will be watching our commitment to upholding our international human rights responsibilities,” said France-Isabelle Langlois, Executive Director of Amnesty International Canada’s Francophone Branch. “That is why, with the federal election on the horizon, it is particularly important that Parliament passes crucial pieces of legislation which can help advance human rights protections in Canada before this session ends. Those include Bill C-262, the federal framework for implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; Bill C-69, reforms to federal impact assessment legislation; Bill C-91, Indigenous languages legislation; and Bill C-92, the Indigenous child and family services bill.”

This election year, Amnesty International will be looking to all political parties and candidates to commit to the recommendations in this Human Rights Agenda as part of their electoral platforms.

(Mick Tsikas/AAP Image via AP)

CANBERRA, Australia – Australia’s prime minister on Thursday called a May 18 election that will be fought on issues including climate change, asylum seekers and economic management.

“We live in the best country in the world,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters after advising the governor-general to authorize the election.

“But to secure your future, the road ahead depends on a strong economy. And that’s why there is so much at stake at this election,” he added.

Morrison’s conservative coalition is seeking a third three-year term. But Morrison is the third prime minister to lead a divided government in that time and only took the helm in late August.

Opinion polls suggest his reign will become one of the shortest in the 118-year history of Australian prime ministers on election day. The polls suggest centre-left opposition leader Bill Shorten will become the eighth prime minister since the country plunged into an extraordinary period of political instability in 2007.

The election pits Shorten, a former labour union leader who has presented himself as the alternative prime minister for the past six years, and Morrison, a leader who the Australian public is still getting to know.

Morrison is seen as the architect of Australia’s tough refugee policy that has all but stopped the people-smuggling traffic of boats from Southeast Asian ports since 2014. The policy has been condemned by human rights groups as an abrogation of Australia’s responsibilities as a signatory to the United Nations Refugee Convention.

Morrison’s first job in Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s newly elected coalition government in 2013 was as minister for immigration and border protection. He oversaw the secretive military-run Operation Sovereign Borders.

Asylum seekers from the Middle East, Africa and Asia would typically disable or sink their boats when intercepted by patrol ships in waters north of Australia so that the Australian crews would have to rescue them rather than turn the boats away. Under the new regime, the asylum seekers were placed in motorized life boats that were towed back to Indonesia. The life boats had just enough fuel to reach the Indonesian coast. The Indonesian government complained the policy was an affront to Indonesian sovereignty.

The government has also maintained a policy adopted in the final months of a Labor government in 2013 of sending boat arrivals to camps on the Pacific island nations of Papua New Guinea and Nauru. Those who attempt to reach Australia by boat are told they will never be allowed to settle there.

Morrison remains proud of virtually stopping people-smuggler boat traffic. He has a trophy shaped like a people-smuggler’s boat in his office inscribed with “I Stopped These.”

Labor has promised to maintain the policy of banishing boat arrivals to the islands. But Labor says it would give priority to finding permanent homes for the asylum seekers who have languished in island camps for years.

The conservative coalition argues that the boats would start coming again because a Labor government would soften the regime. The government introduced temporary protection visas for boat arrivals so that refugees face potential deportation every three years if the circumstances that they fled in their homelands improve. Labor would give refugees permanent visas so that they have the certainty to plan their lives.

Climate change policy is a political battlefield in a country that is the world’s largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas and has been one of the world’s worst greenhouse gas emitters on a per capita basis because of its heavily reliance on coal-fired power generation.

Disagreement over energy policy has been a factor in the last six changes of prime minister.

Labour Prime Minister Julia Gillard introduced a carbon tax in 2012. Conservative Prime Minister Tony Abbott scrapped it two years later.

The coalition is torn between lawmakers who want polluters to pay for their greenhouse gas emissions and those who reject any measures that would increase household power bills.

The government aims to reduce Australian greenhouse gas emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2030.

Labour has promised a more ambitious target of a 45% reduction in the same time frame.

Action on climate change was a major priority for votes when conservative Prime Minister John Howard’s reign ended after more than 11 years at an election in 2007.

Labour Prime Minister Kevin Rudd immediately signed up to the U.N.’s 1997 Kyoto Protocol on reducing emissions. Australia and the United States had been the only industrialized countries to hold out.

Climate change dropped down the list of Australian priorities after the global financial crisis hit.

But after Australians sweltered through a record hot summer and grappled with devastating drought, global warming has become a high-priority issue for voters again.

The government warns that Labor’s emissions reduction plan would wreck the economy.

The coalition also argues that Labor would further damage the economy with its policy of reducing tax breaks for landlords as real estate prices fall in Australia’s largest cities, Sydney and Melbourne.

Morrison boasts that the conservative administration Prime Minister Howard led delivered 10 annual surplus budgets and paid off all federal government debt before the government changed at the 2007 election.

Rudd had planned a budget surplus in his government’s first fiscal year, but the global financial crisis struck.

Many economists congratulate Rudd for keeping the Australian economy out of recession through stimulus spending. The coalition has accused Labor of spending too much and sinking Australia too deep in debt,

But debt has continued to mount since the conservatives regained the reins in 2013. But opinion polls suggest voters consider the conservatives to be better economic managers.

The government brought forward its annual budget blueprint by a month to April 2 and revealed a plan to balance Australia’s books in the next fiscal year for the first time in 12 years.

Labour also promised to deliver a surplus budget in the year starting July 1, but it has yet to detail how it will achieve this goal.

Labour has also promised to spend an additional AU$2.3 billion ($1.6 billion) over four years on covering treatment costs of cancer patients. It’s an attractive offer with half Australia’s population expected to be diagnosed with some form of the disease in their lifetimes.

The conservatives have largely taken credit for Australia’s remarkable run of 28 years of economic growth since its last recession under Labor’s rule.

Morrison hopes that voters will look to him to deliver a sequel to the Howard years when a mining boom delivered ever-increasing budget surpluses.

Four women currently serving as members of Intact’s board include Carol Stephenson (former CEO of Lucent Technologies Canada), Eileen Mercier (former chief financial officer of Abitibi-Price Inc.), Janet De Silva (president and CEO of the Toronto Region Board of Trade) and Sylvie Paquette (pictured), a former president of Desjardins General Insurance Group.

Intact has a policy requiring 30% representation from each gender on its board of directors.

Kinney is currently vice chair of banking advisory for Deloitte Canada. If she is elected by shareholders, women will make up 41.6% of the board of Intact, which led the Canadian P&C market in 2017 with 17% market share and $7.9 billion in net premiums written.

Robert Crispin, a director since 2004, is not standing for re-election to the board. Although he will step down from the board as of May 8, he will serve on Intact’s U.S. advisory board, and on the board of one of Intact’s international operating subsidiaries, the Toronto-based property and casualty insurer noted a management proxy circular released on Apr. 5.

Intact acquired commercial carrier OneBeacon Insurance Group Ltd. of Plymouth, Minn. in 2017.

“Mr. Crispin has been instrumental in building and growing the Company into what it is today through his continued commitment and dedication especially through his leadership of our Audit, Risk and Investment committees as well as his service on our Compliance Review and Corporate Governance committee,” Intact said in a management information circular released Mar. 29.

The other 11 Intact directors are standing for re-election to the board of Intact, which is traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The other Intact directors who plan to stand for re-election are CEO Charles Brindamour, chairman Claude Dussault, Magna International chair William Young, Robert Leary (former CEO of ING Insurance U.S.), Timothy Penner (former president of Proctor and Gamble Canada), Frederick Singer (CEO of educational software maker Echo360) and Stephen Snyder, former CEO of TransAlta Corp.

The five-week campaign will be dominated by the stark policy differences between Labor and his Liberal-National coalition, which is vying for a third straight term. They include everything from cutting taxes to boosting wages to reducing emissions in one of the world’s worst per-capita polluters.

“To secure your future, the road ahead depends on a strong economy,” Morrison, 50, told reporters in Canberra Thursday, after asking Governor-General Peter Cosgrove to dissolve both houses of parliament. “And that’s why there is so much at stake at this election.”

The coalition government goes into the contest as the underdog, with its six years in power tainted by policy stagnation and infighting that’s seen it twice switch leaders. While the center-right coalition has presided over an unprecedented hiring boom and is forecasting the nation’s first budget surplus in more than a decade, stagnant wages and spiraling power bills have eroded living standards for many voters.

“It’s taken us more than five years to turn around Labor’s budget mess,” Morrison said. “Now is not the time to turn back.”

Since the 2016 federal election, the government has lost its majority in the lower house after a defeat in a special ballot, compounding its challenge to win another term. Since replacing Malcolm Turnbull as prime minister in August, Morrison has struggled to close Labor’s lead in the polls. The party led by former union leader Bill Shorten, 51, was ahead by four points in the latest Newspoll.

Morrison is trumpeting proposals to flatten tax brackets so more than 90 percent of Australians pay 30 percent or less income tax. He’s also fast-tracking cuts for small and medium-sized companies. The government also plans to continue safeguarding Australia’s borders after halting the tide of asylum seekers smuggled to the nation by boat since the coalition won office in 2013.

Labor is targeting its income tax cuts at the lowest paid, earning less than A$48,000 a year. It’s also proposing a “living wage” to replace the national minimum wage, and is pledging to scale back tax perks for property investors after a five-year housing boom priced many young Australians out of the market.

“Australians face a real and vital choice at this election,” Shorten told reporters in Melbourne on Thursday. “Do you want Labor’s energy, versus the government’s tiredness? Labor’s focus on the future, versus being stuck in the past? Labor’s positive plan for all Australians or a negative fear campaign from the other side?”

Labor’s policies on wages and housing have prompted concern in business circles and handed the government ammunition.

“To Labor’s credit, they have released key policy well in advance of an election,” said Su-Lin Ong, head of Australian economic and fixed-income strategy at Royal Bank of Canada in Sydney and a former Australian Treasury official. “But there is a view that a number of those measures will be negative for the economy at a time when clearly growth is disappointing and underwhelming.”

She highlighted concerns that wage growth isn’t being linked to productivity gains, and the potential for the housing market slump to deepen further.

The biggest divide is around energy and climate change. Partisan politics and policy missteps over the past decade have left consumers and manufacturers facing escalating electricity bills amid a bungled transition from fossil fuel to wind and solar power.

The ruling coalition has been torn on the issue for years, with a right-wing faction demanding subsidies for new coal-fired power plants and hindering greater support for renewables. Morrison has championed coal, rejected legislating emissions cuts and said the sole focus of energy policy is to lower voters’ electricity bills through strengthening the power grid.

In contrast, Labor is pledging to reduce the nation’s greenhouse gases by 45 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. It also wants to toughen emissions caps and has promised a A$10 billion funding boost for renewable energy projects.

A Lowy Institute poll released in July showed 59 percent of Australians believe global warming is a serious problem that needs to be combated even if it involves significant costs -- up from 36 percent in 2012. The survey also found 84 percent of respondents want the government to focus on developing more renewable energy sources.

Metro Vancouver mayors are calling on Canada’s national political parties to commit funding to ease traffic congestion in the region, ahead of the federal election this fall.

The mayors’ council on regional transportation said Tuesday that one million more commuters are expected on public transit in the next 20 years, and so it needs permanent federal funding to allow TransLink to complete existing and new projects.

The council joins the Federation of Canadian Municipalities in asking to create a congestion relief fund, which would deliver an estimated $375 million annually to TransLink, starting in 2028.

“Metro Vancouver consistently ranks as one of the best regions in the world for quality of life, but residents and businesses continue to be frustrated by congestion on our roads and overcrowding on our transit system,” said Surrey Mayor Doug McCallum.

With less than a week to go before Albertans head to the polls, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is making an early exit from the capital to hit the campaign trail with his former federal caucus colleague turned United Conservative Leader, Jason Kenney, who, barring a sudden — but not, in the case of this particular province, entirely unprecedented — shift in the polls, seems all but certain to oust Rachel Notley’s New Democrats from the premier’s office.

According to the advisory, Scheer will join Kenney at a “family friendly” UCP-organized event on the baseball diamond at a Calgary grade school, where the pair will “send a message by rallying together” for the “fight to get our province, and our nation, back on track!”

Scheer can also take comfort in knowing that he likely won’t be missing out on the chance to continue his cross-examination of his chief political rival, as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is also expected to skip question period this afternoon.

As per his official itinerary, Trudeau will spend the day ensconced in “private meetings,” including a mid-morning sit-down with Stelco chair Alan Kestenbaum, during which they’ll almost certainly go over the latest developments in the government’s ongoing efforts to support the steel and aluminum sectors amid the current cross-border trade tensions.

Also on the Hill agenda today: Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould teams up with senior officials from the Communications Security Establishment and the Privy Council Office to brief the House procedure committee on the plan to “safeguard” the next federal election, as well as provide MPs with a status report on the interagency task force charged with monitoring “covert, clandestine or criminal activities” that aim to “interfere with,or influence electoral processes in Canada.”

Gould’s appearance comes just days after CSE officials issued an update on the risk of foreign meddling in the upcoming federal vote, which, they warn, is virtually certain to be the target of cyber saboteurs, although not likely of the same intensity or severity as the 2016 US presidential campaign.

Elsewhere on the committee circuit, opposition members have teamed up to force a special session of the House justice committee to discuss launching a probe into what they describe as the “unprecedented breaches of confidentiality” that resulted in a series of media reports alleging a running dispute between Trudeau and then-justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould during last year’s ostensibly closed-door process of choosing a new Supreme Court justice to replace retiring chief justice Beverley McLachlin.

With Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s Progressive Conservatives set to unveil their inaugural budget this afternoon, it’s likely not a coincidence that a full contingent of federal cabinet ministers is being dispatched to various venues across the province, where they will, naturally, be only too happy to share their concerns over Ford’s fiscal roadmap— and, of course, tout their own government’s planned initiatives — both before and after the full details are released.

Out and about in the Greater Toronto region today: Indigenous Services Minister Seamus O’Regan and Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains, both of whom are booked in for panel discussions at the Public Policy Forum’s annual Canada Growth Summit, where they will focus on “Indigenous innovation” and industry renewal, respectively.

Meanwhile, Science and Sport Minister Kirsty Duncan drops by the Ontario Lacrosse Hall of Fame in St. Catharines with news on the 2021 Canada Games as Tourism Minister Mélanie Joly has back-to-back events in Timmins, where she’ll outline new federal funding “to strengthen, diversify and grow the regional economy,” as well as cash to boost “cultural and community space projects” at the Timmins Museum.

Finally, Green Party Leader Elizabeth May is in Victoria to “challenge” Canadians to “become empowered into action to protect the future” as the next guest in the St. Mary’s Lenten Speaker series.

In today’s world, many politicians have reached celebrity status, always surrounded by security and staff members, on the other side of an unseen brick wall to the public.

But one MP from Oshawa was truly someone that could be called “a man of the people.”

Born Michael Starchewsky on Nov. 14, 1910, Michael Starr is one of Oshawa’s most well-known public figures.

His parents were Ukrainian immigrants who came to Canada seeking a better life. Growing up in the city, Starr dropped out of high school after Grade 10 and eventually began working with Pedlar People Limited.

According to biographer Myron Momryk, it was while working in the Pedlar People office Starr turned his sights towards politics.

He was an influential figure in the local Ukrainian community.

“There was a rather large Ukrainian population. Bloor Street was almost like a little Ukrainian village,” Momryk says.

Momryk explains Starr used his “personal popularity” to earn the vote as an Alderman for Oshawa City Council from 1944 to 1949.

He would later serve as mayor from 1949 to 1952, also running an unsuccessful bid for the Ontario Legislature in 1951.

He soon set his sights on higher aspirations.

The management and staff of Pedlar People were highly conservatively-minded, Momryk explains, and would support Starr in his political aspirations.

These became fruitful as Starr was elected to the House of Commons in 1952 as a Progressive Conservative.

He later made headlines when he became the first Canadian cabinet minister of Ukrainian descent in 1957 as Minister of Labour.

Momryk says it was a different time, and the media “kept emphasizing [Starr’s] Ukrainian descent.”

“He was a political pioneer.”

Even as his political status grew, Starr remained very accessible to the community.

“Saturday morning, there was a line up of people at his door. People would even come to him with their marital problems,” Momryk states. “He was very much a person-to-person fellow.”

Momryk says he found it particularly interesting that despite only having a Grade 10 education, Starr found himself as Labour Minister.

At the time, unemployment was a serious problem in Canada.

To combat this, Starr initiated what was called the “Winter Works” program.

Up until that time, most trade industries involving outdoor work would shut down for the winter.

“That was a very serious problem, and a real drain on the country’s finances and resources,” Momryk explains. “He was pushing so people work in trades all year round.”

Momryk says this is just one example of Starr trying “his damndest to fight

unemployment.”

Starr also worked to create a more compassionate approach for the unemployed, including extending unemployment benefits to women and seasonal workers, and increasing federal funding to provinces for vocational training.

“He was very worried about the unemployment. He saw what that did in the 1930s as he was an adult during the Great Depression,” he says.

Even after leaving politics, workers’ issues remained important to Starr, as he served as chairman of the Workers’ Compensation Board of Ontario from 1973 to 1980.

On the political front, he would serve as Opposition House Leader from 1965 to 1968.

Starr was a candidate for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party in 1967 but was eliminated on the second ballot.

However, Momryk doesn’t believe it was something Starr was really engrossed in.

“I don’t think he had any serious ideas about being chosen as the leader of the Conservative Party,” he said.

In the interim, he would serve as Leader of the Opposition for two months before Robert Stanfield won his seat in a by-election.

Although Starr had been a conservative since the 1930s, Momryk says some would argue he was in the wrong party.

However, he remarks “there is a distinction between conservatives and progressive conservatives”, and his view, Starr was the latter, even having a “tinge of a Red Tory.”

“He believed using the government for the people’s benefit.”

While progressively minded, Starr was staunchly anti-Communist.

“That’s one thread that runs through most of his career,” Momryk says.

He notes a number of Starr’s opponents when running for Oshawa city council were “strongly left,” and it was something he spoke out against.

“He continued that up almost until he retired.”

After achieving re-election six times, Starr faced his biggest challenge during the 1968 election in the form of 32-year-old NDP candidate Ed Broadbent.

The end result saw Starr lose by a mere 15 votes, a result that Momryk says lingered with him for a long time.

“When he lost to Broadbent, that bothered him,” Momryk states, adding a lot of liberals who had previously voted for Starr were swept up in Trudeaumania.

“A lot of the young people began looking for a change rather than having these older politicians. Starr fitted into that category,” he said.

While Momryk says there wasn’t necessarily personal animosity against Broadbent from Starr, he “did not appreciate people mentioning Broadbent in his presence.”

Starr would run for office a few more times afterward, but Momryk said campaigning was much more challenging with his older age.

“After a while, it’s not easy,” he said.

Momryk notes Staff became a campaign manager for other candidates and encouraged people from ethnic groups to run for office.

There was plenty to keep him busy after politics, as he served as a citizenship court judge in Toronto, and then his run at the Workers’ Compensation Board, a position he really enjoyed, Momryk says.

“He was very happy. He dealt with unemployed workers and people who had difficulty getting jobs.”

In 1983, the Oshawa’s provincial government building was named in Starr’s honour. The seven-floor tower still dominates the city’s downtown sightline to this day.

“He was proud of that. It was a monument to his career,” Momryk says.

Also around that time, he served a four-year term as Honorary Colonel of the Ontario Regiment (RCAC) in Oshawa.

Over the years, he also awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal, Canadian Centennial Medal, and the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal.

In researching for his biography on Starr, Momyrk says a common occurrence was that almost no one had a bad word to speak of the man.

“Everyone kept saying the same thing, ‘He was a nice fellow”,” he states with a laugh.

Momryk notes while often a speaker at community events, he didn’t think Starr was always comfortable dealing with the media.

“I know when he was interviewed by the press or on television, he was a bit hesitant. He was not really a good TV performer,” he said.

However, there may have been a good reason for this.

Shortly after his defeat to Broadbent in 1968, a Toronto Star reporter interviewed him, and later wrote a story alleging the former politician was extremely despondent about the loss.

“That really, really hurt him. When he had future contact with reporters, he was a bit hesitant. It took a lot of work to draw him out,” Momryk says.

“He was a very modest man and didn’t like to talk about himself a lot.”

One other challenge for Momryk was Starr’s apparent lack of an archiving system.

“When he was defeated in 1968, he had an office full of files, dealing with labour, immigration and all types of issues,” he says. “He didn’t know about the Public Archives of Canada, and basically everything went into the dumpster.”

Therefore, when Momryk was trying to write Starr’s biography, “he had very little to show me.”

Momryk says he relied greatly on debates in the House of Commons and newspaper reports instead of interviews with Starr himself.

Fast forward to his later years, Starr remained a constant in the Oshawa community, often being invited to weddings and other events.

According to Momryk, he worked hard on creating joint projects between Canada and Ukraine after the latter’s independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.

He also pushed vigorously for the creation of a university in Oshawa.

Michael Starr passed away on March 16, 2000, at the age of 89, predeceased by his wife Anne Zaritsky, and his son Dr. Robert Starr.

His daughter, Joan, passed away only a few months later.

In addition to the Michael Starr Building, there is also a recreational trail named after him in Oshawa.

So what was Starr like behind the scenes?

“Very ordinary,” Momryk says, noting Starr was a fan of watching John Wayne movies, and a proud member of the Rotary Club.

In the end, many politicians disappear from the public’s view after retiring, but Momryk is glad Starr’s contributions are still very much apparent in the City of Oshawa.

“They remember the name [of Michael Starr],” he said.

Momryk will be sharing stories from Starr’s life as part of The Oshawa Historical Society’s April Speaker Series on Tuesday, April 16 at 7 p.m.

The Speaker Series will be held at the Arts Resource Centre, located at 45 Queen Street, Oshawa. Admission is $3 or free for members of the Oshawa Historical Society.

BEHIND THE WRITING

I’ve driven by the Michael Starr Building in Oshawa likely hundreds, maybe thousands of times.

Every time I did this, I thought to myself – just who is Michael Starr?

I knew that to have your name on a building you must have done something notable.

So when I was brainstorming ideas for the Fourth Estate, the name Michael Starr again popped into my head.

Later that week, I saw that author Myron Momryk was coming to Oshawa for a speaking engagement to discuss his biography on Starr.

It was clear to me that it wasn’t just a coincidence, I needed to do some research.

I searched Mr. Momryk’s name on Google (welcome to 2019), and found his contact information.

One phone call later, and I was much more aware of who Michael Starr was.

Michael Starr was a community leader.

Michael Starr was a voice in support of the unemployed.

Michael Starr was Canada’s first Cabinet Minister of Ukrainian descent.

Having learned over the last year I too have some Ukrainian blood in my veins, I found this particularly interesting.

Through my conversation with Myron, and my own research, I learned a great deal more about an important figure in the city’s history.

Starr seems like he was a true “man of the people” politician, starting off as an alderman, then mayor, then a federal MP.

Apparently people would line up in front of his house to speak with him about their problems and concerns.

Starr passed away in 2000, when I was still in high school. I wish I had the opportunity to meet him, but I’m honoured to be able to share some of his story with our readers.

Among the group is Portage-Lisgar MP Candice Bergen who is running for re-election in the riding. She says Canadians are tired of what's happening under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's leadership and says the Conservatives will use these forums to show a strong alternative in leader Andrew Scheer.

""I know last election it seemed like it was scheduled a bit late and so sometimes it's hard to get those plans in place when the dates come up very last-minute,"" she noted. ""It would be great to get those dates set, let's start planning.""

Bergen added she looks forward to debating the Liberal candidate for the riding, as well as answering any questions related to her party. She feels it is important for candidates to publicly defend their record as well as their policies going forward, and to tell Canadians why they want their vote.

""I don't take any vote for granted. I feel it's important that I present my ideas, present myself to the constituents of Portage-Lisgar as not only their sitting MP but someone who wants to continue being their Member of Parliament,"" said Bergen.

Last July 1 Canada announced it was slapping $16.6 billion worth of tariffs on many U.S. imports ranging from kitchen appliances, boats and lawnmowers to ketchup, pickles, Jack Daniels whisky and toilet paper, in retaliation to U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to hit imported steel and aluminum with 25 and 10 per cent tariffs.

Canada’s Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said then and now that the tariffs, launched under section 232 of the U.S. Trade Expansion Act of 1962 — legislation which allows the president to restrict imports seen as threatening national security — are illegal.

“We will not escalate and we will not back down,” Freeland told reporters in Hamilton June 29.

Since announcing its tariffs last year, Canada removed some on U.S. steel and aluminum because the metals were part of integrated supply chain.

“(W)e didn’t want to harm both sides of the border so we’re looking at releasing a new list… within the next week I would say would be most probable,” MacNaughton said.

“A significant number of (U.S.) agricultural products” will likely to added to the new products tariffs list, MacNaughton was reported as saying in the online publication AgInsider. Apples, pork and ethanol have been mentioned, and wine is a possibility too.

Since Canada, the U.S. and Mexico have ratified a new free trade agreement, Canada says the U.S. should end its tariffs on imported Canadian steel and aluminum.

Freeland has said repeatedly the tariffs must end before the new Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement (USMCA) is ratified.

AgInsider reported MacNaughton as saying if the tariffs aren’t gone before Canada’s federal election this fall they will become part of the debate and “it won’t be pleasant…”

AgInsider reports Trump administration officials as saying the tariffs could be replaced by quotas — something Canada also opposes.

AgInsider also reported that MacNaughton expressed dismay at the possibility the U.S. would resolve its trade war with China with Beijing promising larger purchases of U.S. products, including farm exports.

China has stopped importing Canadian canola seed. It’s widely believed the ban followed from Canada’s arrest of the chief financial officer of Huawei at the request of the U.S., which accuses her of fraud.

“We would expect the United States… to be a strong ally of ours,” AgInsider reported MacNaughton as saying.

Dale Moore, executive vice-president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, said he expects Congress will vote on USMCA ratification this year but did not suggest a date, AgInsider reported. The tariffs “need to be addressed,” Moore is quoted as saying.

U.S. farm groups support the trade pact and repeatedly have said the tariffs should end.

“I am convinced and confident we will get USMCA done,” AgInsider reported Moore as saying.

Senate finance committee chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa directly asked Trump to remove the tariffs a few weeks ago and got a flat rejection, AgInsider reported.

To train his political pugilist for the 1992 US Presidential primary and subsequent election campaigns Democratic strategist and cornerman James Carville famously told his contender from Arkansas: “It’s the economy stupid!” Apparently he wrote it on a note and ensured it was ever present in Bill Clinton’s pocket.

His fighter never forgot. Clinton with the help of a Ross Perot-gifted vote split rode the advice and that note to an unanimous decision win.

Truth is, the words on that note are not just a good political device. Their wisdom is the foundational bearing behind any effective government plan.

It is after all the economy that pays for everything. It provides the tax revenue upon which every single public service entirely depends. It provides the fiscal room for tax competitiveness, responsible budgeting; yes even balanced budgeting.

So in this Alberta election the most important question for voters, the illusive ballot question – if you will – is: ‘who has the best plan for the economy?

I admit to a bias here but the answer is Kenney and the UCP and the evidence is objectively clear and on display in their respective platforms and in the existing record of the NDP.

The NDP bought into the social license theory that some self-immolating, indulgence like a carbon tax imposed on its own people and its own economy would swing support Alberta’s way from those who have manifestly opposed the continued existence of the Canadian fossil fuel energy sector.

It was folly from the beginning. What’s more, the decision seemed to give an agreeing nod to those who attack Alberta’s energy sector that they might have been right after all. Premier Notley also supported the feds capitulation on Northern Gateway, was nowhere to be heard or seen as a few of us were fighting for KXL and whose comments on the feds killing of Energy East, C-69 and the tanker ban on Alberta oil C-48 were whispered if said at all.

While I have a great deal of respect for Premier Notley these instances were, in my opinion, fundamental failures in leadership. More seriously, the cumulative effect of policies from Ottawa and Edmonton including the NDP’s failure to defend Alberta’s economic interests have left the oil and gas economy of Alberta trailing the energy economies of Texas, North Dakota, and yes, Saskatchewan.

Here are the latest reported unemployment rates in each of those places.

Alberta: 6.9%

Saskatchewan: 4.9%

Texas: 3.8%

North Dakota: 2.4%

Granted each of these economies is different, some more diversified than others. It’s worth noting however that there is only one of them that self-imposed the largest tax hike – a carbon tax hike no less- whose leadership allied with a federal government that isn’t sure it wants Canada to have an energy sector, who gave up on pipelines and whose fiscal improbity reached near to Biblically proportioned levels.

Policies matter. Economic policies matter most.

Albertans have to wade through the muck that has been raked in this campaign and there’s been no small amount of it and ask themselves. Who does have the best plan for the economy? Who will fight for our province’s economic interests? Who will place Alberta jobs at the very top of every meeting agenda?

Voting decisions are never easy. They shouldn’t be. But James Carville’s cajun accented admonishment of his old boss can help sort things out.

It’s the economy, stupid.

That would also reduce the tyranny of Ontario and Quebec unfairly ...,"Over the years I have proposed many ideas to deal with agriculture industry issues and ways to expand the ag industry. To my amazement the NDP government chose to ignore all of them. To my pleasant surprise, by accident or design, some of them have been incorporated into UCP ag policies. Now, if only the other parties could show some vision for the agriculture industry in the coming election.

Here’s my partial list of ag policy suggestions for this election:

• Restructure the Agriculture Department by changing its role to a buyer and overseer of services rather than a provider. To do that, move Forestry to another ministry; do only what the department is legally required to do by regulatory statute; ascertain the value of being in market analysis and extension; turn over research funding and responsibility to producer groups. Those ideas alone could reduce department administration costs by half. Better yet, ask the ag industry what they actually need from the ag department – I expect that will be unwelcome news for senior bureaucrats.

• Provide funding to ag industry sectors to develop a vision of how they could expand, and increase profitability. Terminate the Alberta Local Food Council and end support of provincial organic regulations. Let the organic industry run their own regulations and marketing. Treat them as any other sector by encouraging them to become more commercialized with real economic plans. To receive government support the organic industry must be required to commit to honest promotion, and not demonize the commercial ag and food industry that produce most of the safe local food we consume.

• Take bold steps to restructure supply management to guarantee that Alberta dairy, poultry and egg producers will always supply 100% of our provincial demand for their products. Initiate changes to the national supply management agreement that would allow quota to be transferred to provinces where production can be highly commercialized at economic levels. That would clearly favour more production in Alberta and reduce uneconomic production in less favourable parts of Canada. That would also reduce the tyranny of Ontario and Quebec unfairly controlling 70% of dairy production in this country.

• Expand the agricultural land base of Alberta by selling suitable public land in northcentral Alberta for clearing and crop development. That area will become more viable as the climate changes. Create a long-term strategy to significantly increase available land for irrigation. Production from irrigated land is the most reliable avenue for diversification and increased overall crop and livestock production. Stop treating landowners as the enemy regarding endangered species issues – instead of onerous regulations, provide landowners with financial incentives to increase the population of endangered species on their property.

• Make a commitment that all government departments, agencies and any other entity receiving government funding must purchase food/beverage products grown/produced/processed in Alberta first. The BC government has a similar buy BC program for its public entities and clients. Not only does BC not want our oil, they don’t want our ag and food products either – we should reciprocate their position.

• Create new farmworker rights legislation that is more balanced and takes into account the competitive level with other provinces. Allow employers a choice between private and government insurance coverage (a choice I recommended four years ago). Mandate that optional, voluntary, workplace death and disability insurance be available to farm owners, operators and their families. They are the forgotten workers on farms and ranches whose injury or death can have catastrophic economic consequences on their farming operations and families.

• Create incentives to increase greenhouse development and production in Alberta. This province has the sunshine, water, and natural gas advantages; by instituting regulatory and tax advantages over other jurisdictions this industry should be doubling in size every 5 years and should be a pillar of diversification.

• Initiate a formal enquiry into the proliferation of windmill and solar factory farms (okay I can’t stand those eyesores). There has been too much political correctness protecting the development of these dubious sources of energy. They are neither cheap nor reliable – they are only 30% efficient for wind and 8% for solar and require costly natural gas back-up facilities. They also inflict untold carnage on birds, bats and raptors. All renewable energy developments should be required to have extensive environmental and wildlife impact assessments and honest evaluations of their economic costs. Their dependency on government grants and subsidies needs to be exposed and ended.

JERUSALEM — In view of the high birthrate and the closeness of its communities, we shouldn’t be surprised that the Orthodox sector did better in the Israeli elections than before. I hope that the following “report” isn’t true, but it reflects Jewish humor that makes you laugh with one eye and cry with the other: A man sitting shivah for his father called his rabbi to ask if it’s OK for him to leave his home for a short while to go to vote. The rabbi gave his permission and added: “Your father voted an hour ago.”

–Prime Minister Netanyahu’s campaign was extremely effective. His various pronouncements, actions and foreign trips were evidence of a skilled politician. It brought to mind a reflection by Israel’s first president Chaim Weitzman. Speaking about Nahum Goldman, the Zionist leader, he was reported to have said about him, “The man is capable, very capable. Capable of anything.”

–I came to think of it when I read that workers for Netanyahu’s Likud party had placed cameras outside voting stations in Arab towns and villages which may have persuaded potential Arab voters to stay away. In the last election, Netanyahu warned that the Arabs would come out “in droves” to vote against him. They didn’t then and they didn’t now.

–The low vote among the Arabs doesn’t serve them well. Had all of them voted for the Arab parties that serve their interests, they’d now have some two dozen Members of Knesset, almost three times as many they actually got. By all accounts, some Arabs have this time voted for “Jewish” parties. The left-wing Meretz may have been one of the beneficiaries.

–Though the next Netanyahu government will perhaps be even more right-wing that its predecessors, at least the party led by Naftali Bennett, the former education minister, and Ayelet Shaked, the former justice minister, didn’t get in, though they may appeal (and win?). The prime minister is probably overjoyed if they lose: they were a thorn in his flesh in the previous government.

–He’ll have plenty of thorns in the next one, too. Some of the new parties may make us come to regard Bennett and Shaked as liberals. Though several hotheads have been kept out by the electorate, too many have got in.

–Not all of that is necessarily bad for Netanyahu. Speculations have it that his political supporters will try to pass a law, based on one in France, that gives the prime minister immunity from prosecution. They may want to keep him out of prison, despite possible indictments, not necessarily because they love him, but because they fear that another election may not return them to power.

–On one level, the elections were yet another illustration of Israel’s vibrant democracy. But on another, there’re reasons for concern as some of those elected seem to believe more in their own power than in democracy. And the Blue and White coalition which will become the Opposition may not be very different from the government. The traditional alternative to Israeli right-wing politics – Labour – has been brutally defeated and its sidekick on the left, Meretz, has remained on the margin.

–In one of the post-election broadcasts I heard a respected journalist say something to the effect that pessimists are usually right but invariably very sorry about being right. Please read the above in that context.

In our city of Calgary (from what I can figure out), we have lost an estimated 80,000 jobs and well over 150,000 jobs in our province and Ottawa and the socialist Liberal government wasn’t concerned at all. Trudeau keeps saying he is protecting Canadian jobs (but only in Quebec — our favourite welfare province). His best line in the article was, and I quote, “But his mistakes were made with the best of intentions, which is more than I can say for anyone else involved in this mess.” I have a question for Mr Warren: Where have you been?

Big money’s campaign to block pharmacare: First, buy influence

Since the government announced the federal Advisory Council on the Implementation of National Pharmacare in the 2018 budget, the pharmaceutical and insurance industries have embarked on a lobbying frenzy in Ottawa.

No one knows exactly how much money Big Pharma, Big Insurance and billionaires are funnelling into the anti-pharmacare campaigns. No mechanism exists in Canada to ensure that level of transparency. However, it is possible to gather fragments of evidence that suggest a complex tapestry of lobbying and advertising activity being deployed by these actors to protect their interests.

Shortly after the House of Commons Standing Committee on Health issued its report endorsing publicly funded pharmacare in April 2018, members of Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association challenged the committee’s recommendations at a lobby day event on Parliament Hill. A press release stated that the Standing Committee’s recommendations could “reduce the quality of health benefit plans for millions of people.”

This was followed by a series of three half-page ads in the Hill Times in May, June and November 2018. With the headline “Better Health Benefits for Everyone,” the industry association ads reiterated its key position: that a program which preserves the private insurance industry’s market share is the best policy option for Canada. Any government changes to coverage ought simply to add another layer of targeted public coverage to the existing public-private mix, the ads suggested.

The association also turned to Twitter to spread its core message from July 18 to 20, when provincial premiers met for their annual summit in St. Andrew’s by-the-Sea, New Brunswick. During the days of the premiers’ summit, Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association-promoted ads appeared regularly on Twitter feeds geo-located to that hamlet with a population of 1,500 people.

The clear objective of the ads was to target Canada’s premiers and senior staff with a message opposing universal single-payer pharmacare.

Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association lobbying efforts also rose considerably with the launch of the advisory council. From 2017 to 2018, the association’s non-trade-related lobbying activity rose by roughly 61 per cent, according to data from the Office of the Commissioner of Lobbying. The evidence suggests a ramping-up of efforts by Big Insurance to stop pharmacare from being delivered to Canadians.

Considering the growing potential profits on the horizon from high-cost medications, the pharmaceutical industry has a lot to lose from a national pharmacare program, with the government able to negotiate prices as the strong single-payer bargainer.

According to the latest report from the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, within a decade the number of patented medicines in Canada with an annual cost of at least $10,000 more than tripled. They now account for over 40 per cent of patented medicine sales, rising from 7.6 per cent in 2006. The number of people using these medicines is less than one per cent of the population. This high-priced pharmaceutical market is, to a large degree, preserved by Canada’s current multi-payer system of drug coverage.

In 2018, Innovative Medicines Canada, a major industry association, increased its lobbying and advertising efforts substantially. It bought 15 full-colour ads in the Hill Times in 2018 alone. The ads included claims that pharmacare could result in patients being forced to go without medications. “Far-reaching changes to Canada’s patented drug regime will lead to job losses, a cutback in R&D investment and reduced access to the latest therapies,” stated one ad.

In fact, since 2000 industry revenues have soared while R&D investments have stagnated. The industry’s research investments in Canada fell in 2017 to a paltry 4.1 per cent of Canadian sales from 4.4 per cent in 2016 (4.6 per cent for members of Innovative Medicines Canada, down from 4.9 per cent in 2016). Merck, AstraZeneca, Sanofi-Aventis and Johnson & Johnson have either closed or scaled down their Canadian research facilities, laying off staff.

Innovative Medicines Canada and Canada’s pharmaceutical giants also increased lobbying efforts in 2018. In fact, IMC’s non-trade-related lobbying meetings rose from 18 in 2017 to 104 in 2018 — a 500-per-cent increase in lobbying activity in one year. The pharmaceutical industry sees the implementation of pharmacare as worthy of the deployment of unprecedented lobbying resources.

In the past two decades, drug companies in Canada and abroad have poured millions of dollars into funding patient advocacy groups, which now have a formal role in many drug policy structures. Many of these patient groups are tiny organizations that valiantly fight for the well-being of their often vulnerable patients, yet they are hamstrung by a lack of funding sources.

As one Canadian patient group recently discovered to its dismay, funding arrangements with patient groups often come with strings attached.

In October 2018, the Globe and Mail broke a story illustrating this phenomenon. In 2016 the president of the Canadian Spondylitis Association, which represents patients with a type of arthritis, attended a focus group project which ended with groups being asked to sign a report (destined for Health Canada) that said patients were “strongly opposed” to switching from their brand name drug to a cheaper biosimilar drug.

The two companies that paid for the report, Janssen and AbbVie, are two with a lot to lose from biosimilar competition. Feeling manipulated, the patient group’s president emailed members of his board and recommended the association take its name off the report. Board members agreed, despite the fact that Janssen and AbbVie had provided 90 per cent of the group’s budget the previous year. Janssen then rejected the group’s requests for funding in 2017 and 2018. (AbbVie continued its funding.)

With few other funding options available to them, cases like this suggest that many patient groups are given little choice but to take the conditions placed on them by Big Pharma funders, or face closure.

It is not easy to know the scale of pharmaceutical funding of patient groups, since few companies publicly disclose such contributions. To their credit, GlaxoSmithKline is a rare example of a company that effectively discloses its patient group funding to the public. Above is their data for 2017, likely only a drop in the bucket of all funding for patient groups.

There is also evidence that certain pharma-funded patient groups toe a similar line to the industry on the issue of a single-payer universal pharmacare plan for Canada.

One coalition of 24 patient organizations with pharmaceutical funding recently argued for “a full array of approved medicines... including more recently approved advancements” and warned that “access delayed is access denied.” Another coalition of patient advocacy groups, focused on rare disorders, told the Hill Times in 2018 that a national pharmacare program could slow or limit access to new drugs for some patients, such as those with rare diseases, who are much more likely to get access to the latest therapies under private drug plans than those who rely solely on a public plan. Innovative Medicines Canada bought a Hill Times ad two months earlier with a similar message.

These examples suggest that pharmaceutical giants are sometimes able to buy additional lobbying influence through their conditional funding of under-resourced patient groups.

Second, create echo chambers to promote your position

The second prong in the strategy to stop pharmacare is the creation of echo chambers of information designed to convince the public and media to favour policies that ultimately serve commercial interests. Information is generated and disseminated to the public via think tanks and other policy outfits funded by wealthy donors and corporations with a vested interest in stopping pharmacare from emerging in Canada. A revolving door connects the cast of characters at the Canadian think tanks to the pharmaceutical industry and larger U.S.-based conservative and business-friendly institutions. What emerges is a media campaign involving many industry-linked organizations singing from the same songbook.

Think tanks that oppose pharmacare draw funds from the ultra-rich and large corporations both from Canada and abroad. Due to murky public disclosure practices, it is challenging to uncover who the donors are and how much they contribute. Nevertheless, some examples can be traced that show part of the overall picture.

One deep-pocketed Canadian funder is the Aurea Foundation, a registered charitable organization founded by the late Canadian billionaire Peter Munk. From 2011 to 2017, Aurea gave $1.7 million to the Fraser Institute, $1.3 million to the Macdonald-Laurier Institute and $968,000 to the Montreal Economic Institute, three think tanks that oppose pharmacare. Additional funding included $5 million in donations by the Munk family in 2016 to establish the Peter Munk Centre for Free Enterprise Education at the Fraser Institute.

One of Canada’s wealthiest families, the Westons, who own Shoppers Drug Mart — Canada’s largest pharmacy chain — also frequently supports the Fraser Institute. Their charitable family foundation has a history of collaboration with the institute.

Foreign billionaires and Big Pharma lobbies are also generous donors to Canadian think tanks that oppose pharmacare.

In 2004, the U.S. pharmaceutical industry’s lobbying arm, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, known as PhRMA, ramped up its lobbying budget to US$150 million to support a series of projects that would target American legislators and also foreign governments, including Canada. The plan was dedicated to funding a standing network of economists, “thought leaders” and think tanks to act as an intellectual echo chamber sympathetic to the industry, and to develop strategic alliances with doctors, patients, universities and influential members of minority groups. The PhRMA budget included $1 million “to change the Canadian health-care system.”

One objective of PhRMA was to keep global drug prices high, including those north of the border, where our lower drug prices and public health-care system constantly remind Americans of the level of dysfunction in their system. Price control efforts in Canada were seen as particularly problematic because they created “politically unsustainable cross-border pricing differences...”

The Fraser Institute received $4.3 million in foreign funding over 10 years from billionaire U.S. donors, beginning in the early 2000s. More than half (approximately $2.7 million) of the total foreign funding came from the Eli Lilly and Co. Foundation, a charitable arm of pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly. According to the U.S.-based Center for Media and Democracy — an organization that tracks corporations’ PR campaigns and identifies corporate front groups — between 1995 and 2014 the Fraser Institute received over $1 million from the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation, and $400,000 from the Searle Freedom Trust, a private foundation founded with wealth from G.D. Searle pharmaceuticals (now part of Pfizer, another pharma giant).

Canadian think tanks also receive funding from the U.S.-based Atlas Network, which is funded by billionaires such as the Koch brothers. Founded and initially bankrolled by British billionaire Antony Fisher, Atlas Network was an extension of Fisher’s mission to “litter the world with free-market think tanks.” Among the 13 organizations listed as Canadian global partners of the Atlas Network are the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, the Fraser Institute, the Montreal Economic Institute and the MacDonald-Laurier Institute for Public Policy.

The Atlas Network also is actively supporting the creation of new think tanks that support its mission in Canada and abroad.

According to the Atlas Network’s Annual Report for 2016, Canadian partner organizations received over $200,000 in grant funding, though it is unclear which organizations in particular benefited.

The people who work for these industry-funded think tanks often have deep ties to the pharmaceutical sector and larger U.S.-based think tanks. Although numerous examples exist, here are three.

The Canadian Health Policy Institute is another think tank that opposes pharmacare with ties to deep-pocketed donors. Its founder is a former CEO and director of health policy studies at the Fraser Institute, and was executive director of health and economic policy at Innovative Medicines Canada for four years. Despite a staff of three, the CHPI bills itself as an “evidence-based activist think tank.”

A former federal director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation for six years subsequently moved on to Rx&D (the precursor to Innovative Medicines Canada) and now works as a senior director for government relations with Purdue Pharma.

The media offensive

The Fraser Institute in Vancouver is one of the most established conservative think tanks in Canada. Founded in 1974, it has maintained a long-standing campaign to oppose public single-payer health care. As interest in pharmacare picked up in recent years, the Fraser Institute began contributing to the echo chamber of opposition. In 2018 alone, the Fraser Institute published six articles opposing universal single-payer pharmacare. Articles included titles such as “Pharmacare is the wrong solution at the wrong time” and “Before implementing national pharmacare, look at what provinces already offer.”

The institute also pitches opinion pieces in local newspapers in order to access new audiences across Canada. For example, in an effort to sway public opinion in just one small province, the Fraser Institute has published opinion pieces with titles such as “Prescription Drugs in Canada — target those who need help,” in the Moncton Times, and “Pharmacare — be careful what you wish for” in the New Brunswick Telegraph-Journal.

Adding to the echo chamber, the billionaire-funded Macdonald-Laurier Institute also published five articles in 2018, opposing universal single-payer pharmacare. Titles include “Fill in the gaps to strengthen pharmacare” and “Single-payer pharmacare is a cure worse than the system,” the latter published in the Hill Times in November.

As well, the Macdonald-Laurier Institute secured publication of three opinion pieces in the Financial Post in 2018 on pharmacare, with titles such as “Canadians are being fooled into thinking we’ll like pharmacare: we really, really won’t,” “Turns out nearly all Canadians already have drug coverage, despite the pharmacare myths” and “We can make medicine affordable without the damage pharmacare will cause Canadians.”

As recently as Jan. 23, the Canadian Health Policy Institute secured the publication of another opinion piece in the Financial Post, entitled “Trudeau spreads the Big Pharmacare myth that scores of Canadians can’t afford medicine.”

The Montreal Economic Institute, an Atlas partner and recipient of funding from the Aurea Foundation, adds yet another voice to the anti-public pharmacare echo chamber. One MEI-based economist has written articles with the titles “The risks that come with a national pharmacare program” in the Globe and Mail and “National pharmacare plan not the answer” in the Ottawa Citizen.

The Canadian Taxpayers Federation has also put pharmacare in its crosshairs. The CTF published a piece against pharmacare on CBC’s Opinion website in October 2018, titled “There will be no such thing as painless national pharmacare.” In other publications, CTF parrots the lines of big-moneyed interests, declaring that “there should never be a national pharmacare program” and that rather “more participation by the private sector” is the best path forward. Armed with its base of 140,000 supporters across Canada, the CTF has a powerful capacity to bolster the Big Money echo chamber in Canada.

Domestic and foreign billionaires and pharmaceutical giants have long targeted Canada’s public health system and now want to prevent Canada from implementing a universal single-payer pharmacare plan that Canadians so badly need. In an effort to head off public antipathy towards them, these deep-pocketed interests have deployed a campaign of mass public persuasion, using echo chambers to achieve their goal.

Canadians and the powerful Big Money Club

Though seemingly diverse, virtually all the opposition to pharmacare can be traced back to a network of well-funded interests exerting their influence largely in secret. This Big Money Club — made up of pharmaceutical companies, the health insurance industry, and both Canadian and foreign free-market billionaires — are the only players who stand to lose from pharmacare. For the rest of Canadians, pharmacare would be a substantial gain.

Big Pharma Created the Opioid Epidemic; We Can Stop It read more

With deep pockets and considerable resources, the Big Money Club is employing an expansive strategy to stop the delivery of pharmacare to Canadians. Tapping into a deep well of resources and overlapping networks, they are influencing politicians and policymakers through lobbying and inflammatory advertising. They are creating echo chambers to distort the information available to the public and the media, and to promote a fear of change. Finally, they are calling for backup from the Trump Administration to exert international commercial pressure on Canada to maintain the status quo and reconsider reforms.

As Canadians look to the federal election in the fall of 2019, we cannot let the big-moneyed interests distort health policy in Canada to the exclusive benefit of their profit margins.

Canadians must demand our elected officials choose policies that defend the interests of all Canadians over Big Money. It’s time Canadians enjoyed a common sense pharmacare plan built to provide coverage for everyone, control costs and keep prices down.

Hello Students at HWDSB! My name is Ahona Mehdi and next year I will be a grade 12 student. In 200 words or less, tell the student body of HWDSB why they should vote for you as one of the two Student Trustees for 2019- 2020. Through this opportunity, I would love to represent the collective HWDSB student voice through open-mindedness and diligence. Having been a HWDSB student throughout my educational journey so far, I have seen the direct biases within various school environments, and these issues are certainly present and prominent now, especially amongst the marginalized youth within our society. In order to implement practices of acceptance regardless of individual differences, advocating for all of the creative and diverse minds within the HWDSB community is truly important to me. As a performer in various music groups, a leader in supporting and fundraising for the underprivileged, newcomers, indigenous peoples, and environmental causes, I am a well-rounded student who has always remained committed to equity, wellbeing and positive culture. Through these experiences (including participating in the HWDSB Human Rights and Equity Advisory Committee and Mental Health Advisory Committee), I truly understand that the cohesive mental well-being of diverse people is the most crucial foundation regarding the implementation of positive practices within schools. I know I would bring a lot of passion to this role and I would be truly privileged to serve as one of the HWDSB student trustees in my final year as a HWDSB student.

Hello Students at HWDSB! My name is Aiden McIlvaney and next year I will be a grade 12 student. In 200 words or less, tell the student body of HWDSB why they should vote for you as one of the two Student Trustees for 2019- 2020. When I talk to students throughout Hamilton, there is one key thing that I hear in every conversation: students want change. This is why I am running for student trustee. It’s well known that, as temperatures rise, people in become exhausted and lose energy to work. This leads to lower test scores, a decrease in memory and ability to focus. This needs to stop. I would work with the provincial government to bring air conditioning into schools across Hamilton. I have spoken to Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) Marit Stiles, who plans to introduce legislation to bring air conditioning into schools, which is something I fully support. As a student trustee, I would oppose the proposed cell phone ban. Students should also be allowed work on their phones within the classroom, something students are more familiar with when compared to iPads. I know very well that these ideas can be achieved, because I have spent a lot of time working with government. I have witnessed bold change like this first hand, so I know it can be done. I hope I can count on your vote for student trustee; a vote for positive change to benefit all students across Hamilton.

In 200 words or less, tell the student body of HWDSB why they should vote for you as one of the two Student Trustees for 2019- 2020. There have been many events in my life that have played a major role in making me the person I am today, most importantly my role in youth leadership during my school career. From a very young age I developed a passion for promoting youth voice in my community. As a former member of the Federation of Canadian Secondary Students (FCSS-FESC), I was able to explore my passion and gained experience working with students and administrators. At FCSS-FESC, I worked with students from around Ontario in making the student experience better. I think that a key part of this job is to connect with the HWDSB community to make decisions that benefit the all schools in Hamilton. Personally, I believe that I would be able to perform this task well since I had a similar role at FCSS-FESC, I helped write publications discussing recent issues in schools all around Ontario. From this experience I was able gain a better understanding of various students as well as administrators and the reasoning behind their decisions and opinions. Overall, I believe that my previous work, as well as my current skills, will help me connect with my peers as well as the administration to ensure that student voice is well represented throughout Hamilton.

In 200 words or less, tell the student body of HWDSB why they should vote for you as one of the two Student Trustees for 2019- 2020. This past year I’ve been happy to serve as your student trustee and I’m also hoping to serve as it again! Throughout this year Tara and I have started many initiatives that I intend on continuing through to next year. I’ve learned so much in this role and this knowledge I’ve gained will help me represent your voice, and the voice of all HWDSB students better. One of the key points in my plan this year is to increase awareness of the student trustee role by continuing our high school visits initiative, as well as expanding out to elementary schools. I also hope to continue to expand the role student senate plays within the HWDSB, as well as expanding the opportunity for participation in Senate discussions to all HWDSB students. If I am re-elected, I also plan to take student voice to the provincial level to advocate for all Ontario students by running for an executive position in the Ontario Student Trustees’ Association. I also hope to support students speaking up at their own schools about their passions as well. After all, running schools without student’s voice is like running a business without the customers, it just doesn’t work.

In 200 words or less, tell the student body of HWDSB why they should vote for you as one of the two Student Trustees for 2019- 2020. I am honored for the opportunity to apply for the HWDSB student trustee role. After reviewing the role description, I am confident that I possess the necessary skills, and values to fulfill this role adeptly. I am a grade 11 student currently enrolled in the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program and have consistently maintained high academic standing while also keeping a diverse extracurricular profile. An effective student trustee must be confident and possess strong leadership, teamwork, and communication skills- all of which I have developed through years of participating in sports and extracurricular involvement and hope to leverage in my student trustee role. My extracurricular profile also demonstrates my ability to manage time- an important skill given the responsibility and demands of the student trustee role. I not only value but embrace the voices and opinions of all students and will make it my mission to ensure that all of them are heard. As a student trustee, it is my role to portray the ideas of the student population regardless of whose voice it is. After considering my skills, and values for this role, I hope you will agree that I am the competent and competitive candidate you are looking for.

In 200 words or less, tell the student body of HWDSB why they should vote for you as one of the two Student Trustees for 2019- 2020. The student body of HWDSB should vote for me as one of the two Student Trustees for 2019 – 2020 for several reasons. To begin, I will bring positive and needed change guided by my fellow peers throughout HWDSB. I will discuss and communicate the changes that the student body wishes to see within schools. Secondly, as one of the Student Trustees I will strive to create and improve opportunities for fellow students to grow and build on their personal passions and skills in order to be successful in all areas of their life. Furthermore, I will effectively advocate for social issues that students face and will highlight concerns and problems raised by students. Due to my experience in a diverse group of students and activities, I will be able to understand all students’ interests such as athletics, Music, the Arts, English, Business, among many others which I can then strongly represent at the board. In addition, I will ensure that the information which has been discussed is communicated and reported back to students, so they are aware of what is going on. In conclusion, through my leadership skills I will make sure that student voices are heard.

I am a great candidate for Student Trustee due to my well-rounded skills, leadership experience, and work ethic. I believe student advocacy within our education system is crucial. At school, I am the grade eleven student council representative, co-president of the Music and Arts Association as well as a junior football coach. In grade ten, I won the French, history and music repertoire awards, finishing with a 96% average. Some other accomplishments include earning 2nd place at the Western Ivey Case Competition and 3rd place at Hamilton’s Model City Hall. This semester, I have had the pleasure of doing a co-op program at Scarfone Hawkins, one of Hamilton’s most reputable law firms with over 90 employees downtown. I have learned many skills there that could apply to this position. As Student Trustee, I would ensure that student’s voices are heard. I can relate to many students whether you enjoy sports, the arts, French, or just making your school a better place. Through my strong work ethic, collaboration skills and determination, I am ready to represent the students of HWDSB.

A mere drop in the bucket compared to reducing consumption, it shifts the responsibility to individual people. Environment Defence states that 91% of plastic is not recycled in Canada. As opposed to piecing together a broken system, individual citizens should fight together for changes within institutional and corporate consumption, shaping future generations. Those that know me know that I have always fought for the environment, from the Westmount EcoNinjas to the formation of an environmental non-profit. With each initiative it becomes more apparent: bringing students together, spreading awareness, and allowing students to shape their future is where our focus should lie, particularly as an educational institution. For the Student Trustee position, I run as this philosophy can be applied everywhere. To create better schools for students, we must stop laying the responsibility on the individual, but rather the individual as part of a whole. I am uncertain of changes I may bring, as I lack 2020 vision. However, my strategy is rooted in banding all 50 000 students together, to promote a self-sustaining cycle of leadership amongst the student body, allowing them to inspire each other and to spark change they see fit, shaping a better world for each other.

In 200 words or less, tell the student body of HWDSB why they should vote for you as one of the two Student Trustees for 2019- 2020. As a student of the HWDSB who has attended two of our high schools, I understand that every school is different. As a former student senator, I also know that we students share many concerns which must be addressed, such as positive school climate, student support and student well-being. To me, student voice should be genuine and always considered in decisions made at our school board. However, sometimes student voice is forgotten or ignored. We feel dismissed or forgotten, and important decisions are made for us. Therefore, in this role, I will work closely with administration and student trustee resources like OSTA-AECO, the Ontario Student Trustees Association, to not only make your voices heard but listened to! As your advocate, I’m looking for your true opinions on issues at our schools and how you think they should be solved through surveying, and by starting a discussion at HWDSB programs and schools. With your voice, my mission is to empower you through leadership development perhaps in the form of conferences with students across all our schools.

The steering committee overseeing the leadership race has declared Vickers the only approved candidate in the contest, which was to culminate with a vote by party members and a convention in June.

Joel Reed, the party's president, said in a statement on Thursday the committee is recommending to the party's board of directors that Vickers be appointed leader by acclamation.

He will replace former premier Brian Gallant as Liberal leader. Gallant resigned after his government lost its majority in the legislature in last September's election and then lost a confidence vote in November.

The Liberal party board will meet next Tuesday to vote on the committee's recommendation.

Hailed as a hero for helping to end the 2014 attack on Parliament Hill, Vickers was the first candidate to officially enter the race two weeks ago.

The only other declared candidate, Rene Ephestion, leader of the party’s Multicultural Inclusion Commission, announced earlier this week that he is withdrawing from the race.

“I wish good luck to Kevin Vickers,” Ephestion said on Facebook.

Vickers, a political neophyte in his early 60s, issued a statement last month saying he is looking forward to speaking with Liberals “about a new path forward.”

He has drafted a five-point plan that calls for growing the province’s economy and population, improving health care, “transforming” education, ensuring environmental protection and making sure provincial finances are well managed.

Vickers, who also served as Canada’s ambassador to Ireland, has acknowledged spending many years away from the province, but he has also focused on his deep roots in New Brunswick.

Vickers had a long career of public service, including 29 years in the RCMP. He also served as aide-de-camp for the lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick. He served as sergeant-at-arms for the House of Commons between 2006 and 2015.

49,Politics,2019-04-11T22:00:00.0000000Z,"OTTAWA — Liberal MPs have spiked a motion that would have seen the Commons justice committee hold hearings on the leak of information about the last selection process for the Supreme Court of Canada ... the Conservative Party,” he said.","OTTAWA — Liberal MPs have spiked a motion that would have seen the Commons justice committee hold hearings on the leak of information about the last selection process for the Supreme Court of Canada — a leak widely viewed as a political attack on former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould.

In an hour-long meeting that consisted mostly of partisan bickering, the Liberals used their 5-4 majority on the committee to reject the motion, backed by both Conservatives and New Democrats. The motion did not give a list of potential witnesses, but called for the committee to sit additional hours to study the matter and report back by May 31.

“Is this the perfect venue to investigate this matter? No it isn’t,” said Conservative MP Michael Cooper during the meeting. “But seeing as the Prime Minister is seeming to take no action, and given that the attorney general has shown no interest in pursuing the matter, we’re left with where we are today.”

In late March, while the SNC-Lavalin affair was at full boil, CTV News and The Canadian Press both reported — citing anonymous sources — that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had disagreed with Wilson-Raybould’s choice to replace chief justice Beverley McLachlin on the court in 2017. Wilson-Raybould had preferred Manitoba Chief Justice Glenn Joyal, the reports said, but Trudeau rejected that choice because he saw Joyal as too critical of how courts apply the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Trudeau eventually chose to appoint Alberta Judge Sheilah Martin to the top court and promoted sitting Justice Richard Wagner to the role of chief justice. The reports said the episode led Trudeau to doubt Wilson-Raybould’s judgment, and it soured their relationship long before the SNC-Lavalin affair came up.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the leak did not come from him or his office.

The leak was widely condemned by organizations representing lawyers and judges, who described it as a threat to the integrity of a selection process that is supposed to be highly confidential. At the time, Wilson-Raybould herself also condemned the leak, said she was not the source of it, and called for “some sort of investigation as to the source of this information.”

Joyal also issued a statement, saying he feared that “someone is using my previous candidacy to the Supreme Court of Canada to further an agenda unrelated to the appointment process. This is wrong.”

At Wednesday’s committee meeting, opposition members argued that this appeared to be the only real chance to get to the bottom of the matter.

“The integrity of how we appoint people to the highest court of our land is at issue,” said the NDP’s justice critic Murray Rankin during the meeting.

He added that it’s personal for him, as he was one of the two opposition members, along with Conservative MP Rob Nicholson, who sat on the nomination advisory committee on the agreement they keep the information secret.

“I am under a cloud of suspicion, as is my colleague from the Conservative Party,” he said. “I was prepared to go to my grave with the information as to who were the finalists in the process.”

He also rebutted Liberal accusations that they were trying to haul journalists before the committee, saying he’s focused on who leaked the information, not on journalists for doing their job in publishing it.

“I want to hear from people in the Department of Justice,” Rankin said. “I want to hear from people in Prime Minister’s Office. Somebody leaked it. It was either my Conservative friend, myself, or an official.”

Liberal MPs said they were rejecting the motion because the committee is a poor venue for investigating the leak, and pointed out there were also leaks of information over the botched 2013 Supreme Court nomination of Marc Nadon at a time when a Conservative government was in power.

The Liberals accused the opposition of just trying to play politics and keep the SNC-Lavalin affair alive in the news.

“This is really becoming an abuse of process, when we’re trying to politicize everything and trying to make sure that we don’t get around to dealing with all of the issues that Canadians expect us to deal with,” Liberal MP Ali Ehsassi said.

Rankin argued that the Liberals have condemned leaks in much stronger terms in the past. He pointed to Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale calling it “very, very serious” in 2017 when the Omar Khadr $10.5-million settlement payment was leaked. The Privy Council Office went on to investigate that leak, though it won’t say if the hunt was successful.

In 2015, the government referred an investigation to the RCMP into who leaked information about a $700-million shipbuilding project; it eventually resulted in a criminal charge against Vice-Admiral Mark Norman, who has a trial scheduled for August.

Rankin told reporters that he thinks decisions over which leaks to investigate “get made on political grounds, sadly, and the administration of justice, and Canadians, deserve better.”

In your opinion, which of Canada’s major political parties is most favoured by the ...","Andrew Scheer’s Conservative Party is setting itself up to run against a familiar foe in the upcoming election: the media.

In recent weeks the party mailed a survey to Tory donors, signed by the party’s campaign director Hamish Marshall, asking them to rank major Canadian newspapers and TV stations — the Globe & Mail, Toronto Star, the Sun papers, Global, City, CTV, CBC and the National Post — based on the outlets’ perceived ideological leanings: “left of centre,” “neutral/balanced,” or “right of centre.”

The mail-out, sent to supporters as a pitch to kick in monthly donations to the party, further asks: “In your opinion, which of Canada’s major political parties is most favoured by the mainstream news media?”

A party spokesman confirmed the authenticity of the questionnaire.

“It was about raising funds for our campaign, and gathering supporters feedback on where and how they consume media, and their personal perceptions,” said party communications director Cory Hann. He added that the appeal for donations was spurred by the Liberal Party’s proposed support program for Canadian media outlets — a program that would be administered by an arms-length body, to avoid possible political favouritism.

Beyond surveying supporters’ news diet, the mail-out asks whether the party should “bypass” the news media and instead hone “an aggressive social media strategy to communicate with people directly in their homes or on their mobile devices” and whether the party “should focus on direct voter contact … that will allow us to take our message to voters unfiltered.”

It also asks whether the campaign should prioritize local and community media outlets, and invest more in advertising and a “sophisticated ground game” in order to “counter the efforts of pro-media news organizations.”

In your opinion, which of Canada’s major political parties is most favoured by the mainstream news media?

The direct-mail appeal to donors included a letter from Marshall, but the party refused to provide it to the Post.

While the Conservative Party is no stranger to taking aim at perceived bias in the media, the proliferation of hyper-partisan, conspiratorial and outright hateful online news outlets has made such tactics a riskier proposition.

As he pummelled the New York Times and CNN, Donald Trump enjoyed almost relentlessly flattering coverage from alt-right websites like Breitbart, Infowars, and the Gateway Pundit — and he, in turn, used them to relay his message to his base. He hired Breitbart co-founder Steve Bannon to apply his sharp-elbowed media tactics to the Republican presidential campaign. In so doing, though, he may have emboldened the likes of Infowars, which promotes baseless conspiracy theories including that the American government carried out the 9/11 attacks and that a 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School that killed 20 children and six adults was a hoax. Infowars has been removed from numerous platforms, including YouTube and Twitter, for promulgating hate speech.

Scheer appointed Marshall as his campaign director for the upcoming election despite controversy over Marshall’s connections to Rebel Media, an ideological cousin of Breitbart.

Marshall ran a digital strategy company, Torch Agency, from Rebel’s Toronto office, where he also ran Scheer’s leadership campaign. While with Rebel, where he was a corporate director, Marshall and Torch helped design its outreach strategies, which included aggressively microtargeting possible supporters and donors with issue-specific campaigns — a tactic he appears to have made use of in the Conservative Party as well. Often, that outreach involved attacking the mainstream media as untrustworthy.

Though a longtime Conservative strategist, Marshall’s close association with Rebel Media prompted questions, including over Scheer’s own involvement with the media organization.

Scheer made several appearances on The Rebel, but in August 2017 he announced he would no longer grant interviews to the outlet after Rebel host Faith Goldy appeared on a neo-Nazi podcast while in Virginia to cover a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, at which one person was killed. Rebel fired Goldy amid the ensuing controversy.

Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet in the wake of allegations that as attorney general she had been subject to inappropriate pressure to intervene in the criminal prosecution of Montreal-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin. In the subsequent days Philpott also resigned her position as Treasury Board President over the government’s handling of the matter. Roughly an hour after Trudeau announced his decision, the following statement was posted on Philpott’s Facebook page:

Tonight I was expelled from the caucus of the Liberal Party of Canada. Sadly the decision was made without me being provided any opportunity to speak to national caucus. This is profoundly disheartening for me, my staff and my family – and I know people in Markham-Stouffville will also be disappointed.

I was accused publicly by people in caucus of not being loyal, of trying to bring down the Prime Minister, of being politically motivated, and of being motivated by my friendship with Jody Wilson-Raybould. These accusations were coupled with public suggestions that I should be forced out of caucus.

These attacks were based on inaccuracies and falsehoods. I did not initiate the crisis now facing the party or the Prime Minister. Nor did Jody Wilson-Raybould.

Rather than acknowledge the obvious — that a range of individuals had inappropriately attempted to pressure the former Attorney General in relation to a prosecutorial decision — and apologize for what occurred, a decision was made to attempt to deny the obvious — to attack Jody Wilson-Raybould’s credibility and attempt to blame her. That approach now appears to be focused on whether Jody Wilson-Raybould should have audiotaped the Clerk instead of the circumstances that prompted Jody Wilson-Raybould to feel compelled to do so.

I was not able to support the recommended response to deny these allegations. My constitutional obligations including Cabinet solidarity and collective responsibility compelled me to resign as a Cabinet member under these circumstances.

This isn’t about a lack of loyalty. On the contrary, I recommended that the government acknowledge what happened in order to move forward. This was an expression of loyalty, not disloyalty — in the same way that Jody Wilson-Raybould attempted to protect the Prime Minister from the obvious short-term and long-term consequences of attempts to interfere with prosecutorial independence — but to no avail.

This also isn’t about political advantage or strategy. It is frankly absurd to suggest that I would leave one of the most senior portfolios in government for personal advancement or merely out of friendship with Jody Wilson-Raybould.

I have also been criticized for not telling my complete story in Parliament because I would be shielded by Parliamentary immunity. Much of the story has now been told by Jody Wilson-Raybould as a result of the additional information she provided to the Justice Committee. Anything else is covered by Cabinet privilege that has not been waived. It would be irresponsible for me to breach Cabinet privilege simply because I could do so without being prosecuted for the breach. Parliamentary privilege is not designed as a licence for breaching your constitutional and ethical obligations.

Throughout these events, I have continued to support Liberal policies and the commitments we made. As a member of Cabinet, I would have been compelled to support in Question Period and in the media the government’s response to the SNC-Lavalin case and speak in support of that response. I could not do this and as a result, I was compelled to resign. I thought there should be scope within the caucus and the party for a range of views on the SNC-Lavalin case including the views I expressed directly to the Prime Minister. Indeed, the need has never been greater for a measured re-evaluation of how the government should respond to this issue. What I have heard from Canadians is that they want to know the truth.

That being said, it appears that the caucus is intent on staying the current course, regardless of its short-term and long-term consequences to the party and to the country, and it has been decided that there is no place for me in the caucus.

I regret that relationships have been so fractured. I have nothing but good wishes for my former Liberal colleagues and all those who commit themselves to public service.

I ran to be a Member of Parliament for the purpose of improving people’s lives. Nothing will stop me from continuing in that pursuit.

Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press

House of Commons Speaker Geoff Regan says he doesn't have the authority to rule on whether the law was violated or rights were breached when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expelled former cabinet ministers Jane Philpott and Jody Wilson-Raybould from caucus.

Mr. Regan’s decision, delivered on Thursday, came in response to a question of privilege raised by Ms. Philpott in the House earlier this week. The former president of the Treasury Board said on Tuesday that her privileges were breached and the Liberals broke federal law in the process that led to the removal of herself and Ms. Wilson-Raybould, the former attorney-general and justice minister, from the party caucus last week.

At the heart of Ms. Philpott’s argument is that, after the 2015 federal election, the Liberal caucus did not conduct a recorded vote, as required under the Parliament of Canada Act, to decide whether to adopt a set of rules governing the expulsion of caucus members and other matters. Liberal MP John McKay has said “there was no vote” when the Liberal caucus met after the 2015 election to decide how to proceed with the rules.

Mr. Regan said in his decision that the authority of the Speaker is “limited to the internal affairs of the House, its own proceedings” and “does not extend to caucus matters.”

He said the law only requires he be informed of whether a party caucus has decided to adopt rules that give rank-and-file MPs more say in matters such as the removal of caucus members.

“The only role of the Speaker is to be advised of the caucus decision. … The Speaker’s role stops there. It does not, in any way, extend to interpreting the results of the votes, how the votes were taken or interpreting any other relevant provisions,” Mr. Regan said.

Opinion: Justin Trudeau, a Prime Minister of symbols, falls to Earth

Ms. Philpott said the absence of a caucus vote in November, 2015, after the federal election, meant the caucus never voted to adopt the rules, including one that said 20 per cent of a caucus must submit written notice to review an MP’s membership, and that MPs can be ejected only if a majority of all caucus members vote to do so in a secret ballot. Ms. Philpott also noted no caucus vote took place before Mr. Trudeau expelled her and Ms. Wilson-Raybould last week. Mr. Trudeau has said he consulted caucus before his decision.

The Liberals say they decided as a caucus not to adopt the rules in November, 2015, and communicated that decision to the Commons Speaker at that time.

“For these reasons, the chair is unable to conclude that the member for Markham-Stouffville has been obstructed in the fulfillment of her parliamentary functions,” Mr. Regan said in his ruling.

On Feb. 27, Ms. Wilson-Raybould told the Commons justice committee that as attorney-general she faced “consistent and sustained” pressure from Mr. Trudeau and top officials, including “veiled threats,” on the need to shelve the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott quit cabinet over the government’s handling of the matter.

Meanwhile on Thursday, the Liberals used their majority on a House of Commons committee to defeat a Conservative motion calling for an investigation into the leak of confidential information about applicants for a seat on the Supreme Court of Canada.

The Canadian Press and CTV reported on March 25 that Ms. Wilson-Raybould recommended Glenn Joyal, Chief Justice of Manitoba’s Court of Queen’s Bench, to become chief justice. According to sources, Mr. Trudeau was concerned about her choice because he believed Justice Joyal favoured a conservative, restrictive approach to interpreting the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Mr. Trudeau ultimately named sitting Supreme Court Justice Richard Wagner to replace retiring chief justice Beverley McLachlin. He also appointed Alberta judge Sheilah Martin to fill Western Canada’s seat on the bench (Ms. McLachlin was born and raised in Alberta and rose through the judicial ranks in British Columbia).

Conservative MP Michael Cooper, who introduced the motion, said the “shocking and unprecedented” leaks smeared respected judges and undermined the independence of the judiciary by publicizing what was supposed to be confidential information about the selection process for Supreme Court appointments.

But Liberals countered that the motion was entirely political, aimed at further dragging out the SNC-Lavalin affair, which has been plaguing the Trudeau government for more than two months.

The committee should take Mr. Trudeau at his word that neither he nor his staffers had anything to do with the leaks, Liberal MP Ali Ehsassi said.

The Globe and Mail reported on March 26, citing an unnamed source, that Ms. Wilson-Raybould wanted to elevate Justice Joyal to the Supreme Court to make way for an Indigenous judge to take his place at the head of the Manitoba court. The source also said Ms. Wilson-Raybould believed Justice Wagner was more conservative in his approach to the charter than Justice Joyal.

“What we have as a result of this leak is an undermining of the integrity of the appointment process,” Mr. Cooper told the committee, adding that Justice Joyal, Justice Wagner and Justice Martin have all had a “cloud” put over them. “Quite frankly, this goes to the heart of the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary, which has been undermined as a result of this leak.”

New Democrat MP Murray Rankin said he and Conservative MP Rob Nicholson are also under a cloud since, as their parties’ justice critics at the time, they had access to all the confidential information about the finalists recommended by an independent panel for appointment to the top court.

Liberals take Mr. Rankin and Mr. Nicholson at their words that they didn’t leak anything about the appointments, either, Mr. Ehsassi said.

He agreed the leaks were “regrettable,” but said they were not unprecedented. He noted that information about the selection process was leaked in 2014, when the Conservative government of the day named Marc Nadon to the top court – an appointment that was later struck down by the Supreme Court because Justice Nadon did not meet technical eligibility requirements. There was no investigation into that leak.

Nutson said that the board members chose to resign independently and did not offer their resignations as ""a protest"" against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The volunteers simply ""don't have the energy"" to support another candidate, she said.

Turfed from caucus

Philpott — widely considered to be one of the most competent and respected ministers in the Trudeau government — stepped down from cabinet on March 4, saying she had lost ""confidence"" in the Liberals' handling of the SNC-Lavalin file.

The SNC-Lavalin affair has engulfed the Liberal government in the weeks since former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould claimed she'd been placed under inappropriate pressure by senior people in the government to allow SNC-Lavalin a special sentencing arrangement that would allow the Quebec-based engineering firm to avoid a trial on bribery charges.

At the time, she remained in the Liberal caucus and said she intended to run in the fall election under the Liberal Party banner.

Nearly a month later, Trudeau booted her from caucus, saying that trust had been irreparably broken.

Philpott was expelled along with former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould. Both are now back-corner independents.

The fact that Michelle Rempel could now be the Liberal spokesperson on immigration wasn’t a ...,"Andrew MacDougall is a London (UK) based columnist, commentator and consultant. He was formerly Director of Communications to Stephen Harper.

Hark! Word comes from Ottawa of the vaunted channel change from SNC-Lavalin!

With everyone busy rubbernecking the multi-car, highway-closing SNC-Lavalin pile up, Finance Minister Bill Morneau went ahead and tabled his budget implementation bill. And buried in that 392-page (!) behemoth was a change to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act that would make it harder to claim refugee status in Canada.

To take things in order: 1) yes, there was a federal budget this year; 2) yes, it is being jammed through the House via an omnibus bill (which the Liberals promised never to do); 3) yes, omnibus legislation is how Liberals tucked deferred prosecution agreements into the criminal code for SNC last year; and 4) the Liberals are now massive hypocrites.

Trudeau’s vaunted “Welcome to Canada” poster is now festooned with giant brand-damaging caveats: If you, dear asylum seeker, have opened a claim for refugee protection in another country, have already made an unsuccessful claim in Canada, been deemed inadmissible because of your criminal record, or been granted refugee protection elsewhere, your claim is now ineligible for consideration.

And if all of that sounds like common sense to you, welcome to where federal and provincial Conservatives have been for the past three years. Or, as the Liberals used to call it: being un-Canadian.

The budget bill sleight of hand on asylum claims follows the Liberals’ earlier fold on the Safe Third Country Agreement, which they are now looking to revise in negotiations with the United States, another step the Conservatives have been urging for the better part of two years.

“I can tell you we’ve been working very hard over the past several months to significantly reduce the number of people who are crossing our borders irregularly,” Conservative Minister Bill Blair told reporters. “There’s a right way to come to the country to seek asylum and/or to seek to immigrate to this country, and we’re trying to encourage people to use the appropriate channels and to disincentivize people from doing it improperly,” Blair added.

Blair is, of course, a Liberal. He just sounds like a Conservative, based on the volte-face evidence; 40,000+ “irregular” asylum claims from the United States will do that to you. The Liberals have been thoroughly mugged by the reality of this year’s election.

And what of the mountains of prior Liberal talk of principles, compassion and openness? One presumes they’re buried in the backlog of asylum claims Trudeau said the system was equipped to handle.

The step change in direction on entry to Canada has certainly upset the cast of immigration and asylum advocates who threw themselves at Trudeau’s feet after Trudeau threw open Canada’s doors in the midst of the 2015 refugee crisis in Europe.

Janet Dench, executive director of the Canadian Council for Refugees, anticipates a Charter challenge to Trudeau’s proposed reforms, while Maureen Silcoff, chair of the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers’ litigation committee, bemoaned the “degraded” nature of the system being proposed. “This is really a devastating attack on refugee rights,” Dench concluded.

These criticisms—to say nothing of the changes themselves—should terrify the Liberals who, as they never fail to tell us, are the party of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. One wonders whether the lemmings on the Grit backbench were even made aware of them. It certainly explains why the changes were buried in a budget bill and not debated in the harsh light of day. Opaque ways, my friends.

Refugee advocates will now add their names to the rather long and distinguished list of disappointed Liberal stakeholders: electoral reform advocates, transparency gurus, balanced-budget believers, sticklers for the rule of law, Indigenous rights groups and environmentalists, to name a few.

But the criticism from the asylum crowd is of a different calibre, one that will leave a mark. The Liberals are sawing at a pillar of their core identity, to say nothing of their brand promise. Liberals of the Trudeau vintage didn’t get into politics to be a Tory on asylum and immigration.

Now that the media have spotted the change we shouldn’t be surprised if Trudeau kicks Jody Wilson-Raybould out of caucus again to change the channel. Or, barring that, give another $12 million climate gift to a wealthy grocery retailer with a history of price-fixing a food staple. The point being, the longer the discussion stays on the asylum about-face the more Trudeau will sink.

And with Liberal support continuing to bleed every which way, Trudeau could yet have further to fall. Indeed, bar the carbon tax, it’s not clear what the Liberals propose to stand on in the next election. Well, other than power for power’s sake, which has always been the Liberal proposition.

But it wasn’t Trudeau’s; he promised a different Liberal Party. The fact that Michelle Rempel could now be the Liberal spokesperson on immigration wasn’t a part of the vision he sold to Canadians.

But on asylum, as with Trudeau’s other disappointments, it turns out that #WelcomeToCanada was #OnlyAMarketingSlogan.

House of Commons Speaker Geoff Regan ruled Thursday that he has no role or responsibility to police how political party caucuses conduct themselves even if Philpott and Wilson-Raybould now feel “rudderless.”

House of Commons Speaker Geoff Regan said Jane Philpott’s rights as an MP and those of Jody Wilson-Raybould were not violated. ( Sean Kilpatrick / The Canadian Press )

A new law “leaves caucuses alone with the authority to govern their internal operations,” Regan said. He said the law that Philpott was now citing explicitly stated even courts cannot review caucus decisions. “With the full authority given to caucuses themselves in such unequivocal terms, it is clear that the chair has no role in the interpretation or enforcement of this statute, even when members feel rudderless without what they feel would be clearly stated and understood rules.” The Speaker did not specifically investigate or conclude whether the Liberal caucus failed to follow proper procedures in 2015.

That’s when the Reform Act, which modified the Parliament of Canada Act, took effect and required official party caucuses to take four votes in a “recorded” manner after a general election. Those votes decide whether the caucus will adopt new powers for caucuses to have a greater say in decisions related to caucus discipline, leadership review or interim party leader. In asking Regan to intervene on Tuesday, Philpott had cited a Star report that revealed the Liberal caucus did not vote in a recorded manner in 2015. Instead the Liberal caucus came to a “consensus,” according to Liberal MP John McKay, to leave the power to decide on caucus expulsions or readmissions with the prime minister. The government and caucus chair have refused to confirm or deny how the caucus reached that consensus. Philpott said it was a breach of her privileges as an MP, and those of the former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould who backed her request to the Speaker. But Regan ruled only political party caucuses have the responsibility for ensuring proper voting procedures were followed, and their privileges were not violated even if the Liberal caucus had not done so. Trudeau had insisted the decision to eject them “was mine to make,” lawful, and backed by a united caucus.

He ejected Philpott and Wilson-Raybould last week saying they repeatedly refused to express confidence in his government and his leadership. Philpott fired back in the House of Commons.

“Expulsion should not be his decision to take unilaterally,” Philpott said Tuesday, calling it a question of fairness, due process, and the rule of law. Regan, who is an elected Liberal MP, said his only role as Speaker is to receive a letter from the caucus advising whether it made a determination on the questions. “The Speaker’s role stops there. It does not, in any way, extend to interpreting the results of the votes, how the votes were taken, or interpreting any other relevant provisions.” Philpott sits as an independent MP for Markham-Stouffville. Wilson-Raybould is the MP for Vancouver Granville. Neither has committed to running again in the fall federal election. They quit Trudeau’s cabinet over the prime minister’s handling of Wilson-Raybould’s allegations that Trudeau and his team tried to politically pressure Wilson-Raybould to overrule the public prosecutor and mediate a settlement in the corruption trial of Quebec’s SNC-Lavalin firm.

Stephen Harper and Peter MacKay created the Conservative Party of Canada in the ...","Given the current morass of Brexit, it’s hard to remember that Theresa May was once an agent of change inside the British Conservative Party.

First elected in the Labour landslide of 1997, May took over as chair of her party in the summer of 2002, in the wake of a second electoral drubbing by Labour’s Tony Blair, the then-young and clued-in purveyor of “Cool Britannia.”

Staring a generation of political wilderness in the face, May took a look at her twice-battered rump of a party and spoke a few home truths at its annual convention.

“There’s a lot we need to do in this party of ours,” May urged. “Our base is too narrow and so, occasionally, are our sympathies. You know what some people call us – the Nasty Party.”

And while May’s analysis went down like a cup of cold sick in the room, the message was eventually taken to heart. David Cameron’s leadership largely succeeded in repositioning the party as pro-environment, pro-minority and pro-moderate. Well, until Brexit anyway.

Which brings us to the question at hand: Who is the Conservative Party of Canada’s Theresa May? Who will bravely pipe up about the need to widen a base that, while uber-reliable, isn’t exactly trending in the direction of modern Canada?

The answer should be Andrew Scheer, but the Tory leader has been slow off his mark on questions of nastiness since becoming leader. Every time Scheer can’t say “Muslim” in the wake of a slaughter, or finds himself at the same events as Faith Goldy, or leads the charge against meaningless UN migration compacts, a little piece of the accessible vote dies. The Tory leader always looks like he would rather be somewhere else when placed in the middle of a difficult conversation.

This discomfort is what happens when the primary concern is keeping your natives from getting restless. At some point, however, Scheer will have to treat his party membership as a foundation instead of a roof. There are only 250,000 or so CPC members, compared with the roughly 5.5 million people who voted Conservative in 2015, which itself is still a long way from the nearly seven million who voted for Justin Trudeau. Speaking to that delta population of 1.5 million ought to be a priority.

Who will bravely pipe up about the Tories’ need to widen a base that, while uber-reliable, isn’t exactly trending in the direction of modern Canada?

But how to broaden the coalition is the discussion the Conservative Party ducked in its last leadership race by limiting the contest to the slim and unrepresentative segment of society already in possession of a party membership card. And it’s the discussion the Conservative Party will want to avoid at the very moment Justin Trudeau is running the gauntlet on SNC-Lavalin. But the party needs to tackle the question head-on before the country goes to the polls this autumn.

The pressures are two-fold.

On the one hand, we have Maxime Bernier – i.e. the man who lost to Scheer by a margin so thin Trudeau would feel comfortable hanging his latest SNC defence on it – courting the nativist elements of the Conservative Party’s support. And on the other, we have a wounded and desperate Trudeau and his Liberal Party who will be searching for every bit of white nationalist hate they can scrape off the internet to affix to Scheer. The Tory leader needs to move before they can tar him.

Yes, Bernier will be condescending and shameless in response. And yes, the Liberal tactics will be pathetic and desperate. But their criticism will be pushing on an open door.

Stephen Harper and Peter MacKay created the Conservative Party of Canada in the wake of Theresa May’s “nasty party” speech and quickly set about their own plan to make sure the label didn’t stick in Canada.

Harper quickly ruled out revisiting abortion. A gay marriage vote was brought forward when it was certain to lose. Immigrant communities were courted and celebrated. The government then did its job so well it received two more mandates. The nastiness label was traded in for competence.

But by the end of the third go-round, the nastiness had soaked back in and become the narrative. Snitch lines, burqa bans and relentless political attacks were then rebuffed by sunny ways. There’s a reason Trudeau still uses Harper as his favourite curse word: it sells.

The proxy issues for nastiness at the moment are white nationalism and climate. Scheer needs to be unequivocal in his condemnation of the former and much more detailed in his policy toward the latter. He needs to tell people like Ezra Levant to jog on and tell people like Michael Chong to come forward. And, while he’s at it, he should ban his MPs from calling people a piece of poo emoji on Twitter.

Because SNC is the gift that forces Trudeau into nasty. Scheer should counter with his own version of sunny ways.

Conservatives and New Democrats wanted the Commons justice committee to find out who leaked information about a dispute between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould over who should be named chief justice of the top court.

But a motion to launch an investigation has been defeated by a vote of 5-4.

The Canadian Press and CTV reported last month that Wilson-Raybould recommended Glenn Joyal, chief justice of Manitoba's Court of Queen's Bench, to become chief justice.

According to sources, Trudeau was concerned about her choice because he believed Joyal favoured a conservative, restrictive approach to interpreting the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Trudeau ultimately named sitting Supreme Court Justice Richard Wagner to replace retiring chief justice Beverley McLachlin.

She pointed to the carbon tax rebates being sent to people in provinces where the levy was imposed this month, which the government says will outweigh the expected extra costs of gasoline and other products for 80 per cent of residents. In Ontario, where the Progressive Conservative government has railed against what it calls a ""job-killing carbon tax,"" a household of four will get a $307 carbon tax rebate this year.

Loblaw is also one of 54 recipients chosen by officials at the environment department for the federal government's ""low carbon economy challenge."" The initiative includes $450 million for businesses, municipalities, Indigenous groups, not-for-profits and provinces and territories that apply for federal help with climate change initiatives. The idea is to ""leverage"" federal support with initiatives that reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change.

""We want to create incentives for people to do more, not less,"" McKenna said. ""We're going to continue to move forward on a plan that is going seriously reduce our emissions, doing it in an effective and affordable way.""

In an emailed statement, Loblaw Companies Ltd. spokesperson Catherine Thomas said the grocery chain plans to spend $36 million to reduce emissions from its fridges, and repeated McKenna's claim that this will be akin to taking 50,000 cars off the road. ""Our range of carbon-reduction investments is over $100 million as we work to reduce our carbon footprint by 30 [per cent] by 2030,"" she wrote.

The NDP and Conservatives have criticized the Liberals' climate change plan for favouring corporations before. Leaders from both parties have focused on how the carbon price applies to heavy industries like cement production, where firms are effectively exempt from paying the price for a portion of their emissions. The government has justified this as necessary to protect sectors that can't easily change their systems of production to reduce emissions, and those that compete with firms in other countries where a carbon tax doesn't exist.

The NDP has also accused the Liberals of stalling on a commitment to eliminate at least some federal subsidies to oil and gas companies, which a 2018 report from an environmental organization pegged at $3.3 billion per year.

Neither major opposition party has released the full details of their plans to fight climate change ahead of the federal election this fall.

Canada has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions to 30 per cent below their 2005 level by 2030 — a target that most environmentalists deem inadequate given the stark warnings from the United Nations and federal government scientists about the possible consequences of climate change in the coming decades. Canada is also on track to miss its reduction target, according to the government's own projections, though McKenna has argued future advances in green technology will make up for the projected shortfall.

Last week, federal scientists published a report that concluded Canada has warmed twice as fast as the world average because of climate change, and that efforts to reduce emissions can only now mitigate how much damage will be done. Among the consequences cited in their report was the ongoing disappearance of Arctic sea ice, rising sea levels, and an expectation that summertime water shortages and extreme weather like floods and forest fires will be more likely to occur because of climate change.

And after battling both internally and at the ballot box for decades to play more than a token role on the provincial political stage, the surprise move leaves Lamont and the party scrambling on the eve of a possible election; Premier Brian Pallister has hinted recently he may send Manitobans to the polls before the scheduled Oct. 6, 2020 vote.

If Klassen is successful in her bid to run under the Liberal banner in the federal riding of Churchill Keewatinook-Aski, Manitoba Liberal Leader Dougald Lamont and MLAs Cindy Lamoureux and former leader Jon Gerrard will be without the necessary fourth seat in the house required to maintain official status.

Her decision could significantly weaken the provincial party, which gained official status in the legislature last summer after 23 years without the funding, research staff and guaranteed participation in question period and on committees that accompany it.

Grit MLA Judy Klassen is prepared to sacrifice the gains it has taken Manitoba Liberals more than two decades to achieve in order to pursue her dream of running for Justin Trudeau in this fall's federal election.

Klassen was elected as MLA for Keewatinook in 2016, snagging an upset victory against NDP incumbent and former cabinet minister Eric Robinson.

She served as interim party leader after Rana Bokhari stepped down following the 2016 election and then fought for control of the party — eventually dropping out and throwing her support behind Lamoureux — at the October 2017 leadership convention.

Lamont acknowledged that Klassen's pending departure could put the Liberals in a bind, but told reporters he'd support her decision. In March he told the Free Press that he and his three MLAs would be seeking nominations in advance of Manitobans heading to the polls.

The prospect of an early election may be more of an immediate concern, he said.

""We’re all in an odd position because the premier seems intent on breaking his fixed election date… so because of that everything’s up in the air, so we’re trying to cover all our bases and so is (Klassen),"" he said.

Klassen, who filed her federal nomination papers Wednesday, said she plans to hold onto her provincial Liberal nomination, but would abandon it in order to legally campaign as a federal candidate.

If nominated federally, she would square off against NDP incumbent Niki Ashton, who has represented the riding since 2015 when it was established and Churchill before that, from 2008 until 2015.

""The investments that the federal government has made in the North have really greatly impacted my communities and I want to make sure that continues,"" Klassen said, adding said she's confident the Liberals will keep her seat, no matter who the candidate is.

""I’m very confident. The Manitoba Liberals have never been stronger and we will not lose that seat,"" she said.

Lamont was similarly optimistic.

""We’re going to have official party status going into this election — because I think there’s going to be an election this summer — and we’re going to come out of it with much more than official party status,"" he said.

Yet according to the latest Probe Research quarterly poll, Manitoba Liberal support is dwindling outside Winnipeg, hovering around 18 per cent in March. Within city limits, the Grits sat around 23 per cent support.

University of Winnipeg political science professor Shannon Sampert said she wasn't surprised to see Klassen seek a federal nod, but described the move as ""opportunist.""

""Holding both positions at the same time... it doesn’t do much for her constituency; while she’s out door-knocking federally, does she have her head in the game provincially?"" Sampert said.

""For First Nations however, it’s true that federal politics has more resonance and thus it is likely why she wanted to make the leap... to have more ability to help people in her area.""

Klassen is from St. Theresa Point First Nation, an isolated northern reserve that's home to about 4,500 people. The community is part of the Island Lake region, which also includes Garden Hill, Red Sucker Lake and Wasagamach.

The Churchill Keewatinook-Aski riding is one of the largest in Canada and its population is largely Indigenous. Klassen acknowledged taking on Ashton federally would be challenging. Klassen said Ashton hasn't worked hard enough to help those in the North.

""The North has been opening up and we just need that continued investment and it happened under Justin Trudeau. Whereas the incumbent was there for a long time and we’re still struggling with poverty, still struggling with so many issues,"" she said.

""Had we had proper representation for my people, I believe that we wouldn’t have had to bury so many people unnecessarily these past decades.""

Ashton's office declined a request for comment.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

House Speaker says he can’t rule on whether Liberal caucus expulsions broke federal law

Story continues below advertisement

House of Commons Speaker Geoff Regan says he doesn’t have the authority to rule on whether federal law was violated or rights were breached when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expelled former cabinet ministers Jane Philpott and Jody Wilson-Raybould from Liberal caucus.

On Tuesday, the former Treasury Board president said there should have been a secret ballot among caucus members before the two were ousted, asked Mr. Regan to rule on the matter.

Today he said that the Speaker’s authority is “limited to the internal affairs of the House, its own proceedings” and “does not extend to caucus matters.”

Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott resigned their cabinet positions over the handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair by the Prime Minister and top aides. Read the background to the story here (for subscribers).

Here’s what you need to know about Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s first budget

Story continues below advertisement

Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s first budget has fewer cuts than expected, raises spending overall and won’t balance the books for five years. Some highlights:

While program spending for health and education will increase slightly, the budget also outlines cuts: The Ministry of Children’s and Social Services - which includes income assistance and the autism program - will see $1-billion in cuts by 2021-22.

The budget revealed significant funding changes for universities and colleges: The government is planning to tie more than half to performance outcomes, though it has not stated what those metrics would be.

There are new regulations for alcohol consumption: extending service hours to start at 9 a.m.; allowing bars to advertise “happy hour” discounts and legalizing tailgate parties.

Other budget item include a new child care tax credit and a dental care program for low-income seniors.

Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir is ousted from power as military council takes control of country

Sudan’s Defence Minister has announced the arrest of President Omar al-Bashir and the creation of a military council to govern the country for the next two years. The move ends the 30-year rule of one of Africa’s longest-surviving autocrats after four months of daily street protests against him (for subscribers).

General Awad Ibn Auf said a nightly curfew would be imposed for the next three months under a renewed state of emergency. He added the deposed president was being kept “in a safe place” and promised the release of arrested protesters.

Analysis: Sudan, for now, appears to have merely swapped one strongman for another, Mark Mackinnon writes. Sudan’s opposition said it would keep up their protests

Opinion: “While Algerians and Sudanese protesters may have the hindsight of Egypt’s and Libya’s failed revolutions, they sadly face an international community that will give little support or apply little pressure to see through genuine, civil-society driven regime change.” - Bessma Momani, professor at the University of Waterloo

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange arrested in London after Ecuador withdraws asylum

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been arrested in London after Ecuador dropped his diplomatic protection. He could face extradition to the United States and up to five years in jail over alleged “computer intrusion” and another 12 months in Britain for breaching bail.

Mr. Assange had been holed up in the Ecuador embassy in London for nearly seven years.

In a statement today, the U.S. justice department says its indictment includes allegations that Mr. Assange worked with Chelsea Manning in 2010 to assist her “in cracking a password stored on U.S. Department of Defense computers.""

Justin Trudeau, a Prime Minister of symbols, falls to Earth

LONG READS FOR A LONG COMMUTE

What I learned about life I learned the hard way: Stay true to your path

""There is a boon given to those who are faithful to their path. With the collapse of every dream, the breaking of every illusion, I found myself becoming more vulnerable, more open. And out of this transformation came an awakening of what I believe is the most human of all virtues, compassion. Having suffered, been hurt, failed at so many attempts to gain ‘success,’ I find myself able to reach out to others in a way I never thought possible – with compassion.

""How to describe compassion? For me it is an awareness that others, too, share the regret of mistakes made, failures endured, loves lost. That’s what happens as we become human. Realizing that we all suffer helps us accept others we meet along the way. And perhaps that is why my life unfolded as it did.

“But there is something more that makes age worth the struggle. Recently, I have found myself able to love. Not the romantic love of youth, but one that can embrace all who share this planet.” Read Austin Repath’s first-person essay here.

Magic wears off for LeBron James as shambolic Los Angeles Lakers miss the playoffs

Hours after Magic Johnson abruptly resigned as the Los Angeles Lakers’ president of basketball operations and mere minutes after his first season as the franchise cornerstone ended with a buzzer-beating loss, LeBron James left Staples Center on Tuesday night without speaking to reporters, trailed only by security officers and questions about the team’s future.

It was not the season anyone envisioned for the Lakers, who had upended the NBA by signing James last summer with the hype and expectation of returning the franchise to its glory years. One of the most storied teams in the league, the Lakers have not won a championship in nine years, and Los Angeles is frustrated, hungry and impatient.

Instead, the team collected nearly as many injuries as losses. James, who will miss the NBA playoffs beginning Saturday for the first time in 14 years, watched the final six games of the season from the bench as the team looked to preserve him for next season. Both he and Johnson left Staples Center with a losing record and a team in chaos. In some ways, it was the perfect finale to a season that trafficked in dysfunction. Read the full story here.

As an opposition party, we have Shadow Ministers, not a cabinet, and referencing them as anything else ...","OTTAWA – Liberal MPs have penned a letter to Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer imploring him to cancel a Greater Toronto Area candidate's $250-a-ticket fundraising event billed as a discussion of ""the business of healthcare.""

The Liberals say they're concerned about the framing of the event, but also say it's ""quite clearly an attempt to sell access to power,"" in the letter obtained by CTV News.

The event, scheduled in North York, Ont. next week, includes the tagline: ""healthcare reimagined, it’s time for change."" Based on the wording of the event website it appears geared towards people who work in the health-care field.

The fundraiser is being hosted by the Conservative candidate for Don Valley West, Ont. Yvonne Robertson, and was initially described as a policy forum and cocktail reception with Conservative MPs Pierre Poilievre, or ""our next finance minister"" as the event describes, and Marilyn Gladu, ""our next health minister.""

However, the reference to the two MPs as potential future ministers was removed after CTV News approached Robertson's campaign for comment.

""There is only one person that decides cabinet, and that’s the Prime Minister of Canada. As an opposition party, we have Shadow Ministers, not a cabinet, and referencing them as anything else is not representative of their actual position. That has been changed,"" Robertson's campaign said in an email.

The letter to Scheer—sent before the event webpage was amended—said that it’s ""alarming"" that the party is promoting attendees' ability to be able to bend the ears of Poilievre and Gladu, who are described as future ministers.

""That was one of the least offensive parts,"" Rob Oliphant, the Liberal MP who currently represents the riding, told CTV News after learning that the event description had been amended. He said regardless, the event is still troubling and should be cancelled. ""It's still cash for access,"" Oliphant said, because it is inviting people to donate to the Conservative Party to be able to help shape their policy.

He was one of the seven MPs—who all are either doctors, or represent GTA ridings—who signed the letter.

The event also lists deputy Conservative Party leader Lisa Raitt, MP Peter Kent, and senators Linda Frum and Nicole Eaton, as well as others who will be there to hear ideas about improving the Canadian health-care system related to small businesses and modernizing the Canada Health Act.

""Let us know how the current healthcare system affects your practice and which policy changes you think would have the greatest positive impact on you and your patients,"" the event page reads.

Nowhere in the event listing is privatizing health care stated, though the Liberals are calling on Scheer to ""prove you support public health care, by immediately cancelling this event.""

Oliphant said he found it ""worrisome"" that the event description states that health policy should be ""shaped heavily"" by ""dedicated practitioners."" Oliphant said that while doctors and nurses should be involved, so too should patients and public health officials.

In an effort to counter the event, he's planned an open townhall earlier in the week, featuring Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor.

""The concept that the business of health care comes over the patient outcomes… that's what worries me,"" Oliphant said. ""Health care is not a business, health care is about life and death.""

In response to the Liberals’ concerns about privatization and framing of health care as a business, Robertson's campaign spokesperson Matthew Poon said that the event was designed ""to bring together small business owners like doctors who were unfairly targeted by Justin Trudeau’s small business tax hikes and discuss ways to help them better deliver health services within the principles of the Canada Health Act.""

""Conservatives have always and will always support the principles of the Canada Health Act,"" the statement said.

After coming under fire, largely from the Conservatives, for holding ""cash for access"" events — where for sizeable donations, guests could rub shoulders with the prime minister or members of his cabinet—the Liberals changed the rules to set up more transparency around these events.

The new political fundraising laws came into effect at the end of 2018, requiring parties to advertise fundraisers in advance, and report back afterwards, if they're charging $200 or more per ticket and featuring the prime minister, cabinet ministers, party leaders, or party leadership candidates. Under these rules, there are no requirements for advertising or reporting fundraising events where MPs are the featured guests.

CTVNews.ca has also reached out to Scheer's office for comment.

The budget ""sends a message to the world that we are serious about fiscal sustainability,"" Finance Minister Vic Fedeli told a media briefing. Canada's most ...","By Fergal Smith

TORONTO (Reuters) - Ontario's Conservative government, presenting its first budget on Thursday, forecast a smaller deficit for the Canadian province in the current fiscal year and a return to balance by 2023-24 as it disclosed plans to reverse the growth in spending.

The Progressive Conservative Party, led by populist Doug Ford, won a majority of seats in last June's provincial election, promising greater fiscal prudence than the Liberal Party, which had held power for 15 years.

The budget ""sends a message to the world that we are serious about fiscal sustainability,"" Finance Minister Vic Fedeli told a media briefing.

Canada's most populous province and industrial powerhouse is projected to run a deficit of C$10.3 billion ($7.7 billion) in fiscal 2019-20, which began on April 1, including a C$1 billion reserve. That compares with an estimated deficit of C$11.7 billion in 2018-19.

The 2018-19 deficit was much more than the C$6.7 billion deficit projected by the Liberals in last year's budget, due mostly to accounting adjustments and the cancellation of a cap- and-trade carbon tax by the Conservatives.

But it was smaller than the C$13.5 billion deficit projected in February in a third-quarter update, while the 2023-24 projected timeline to eliminate the deficit was one year ahead of the Liberals' target.

That could soothe bond investors, who had been looking for evidence the Conservatives would tackle the province's heavy debt load. At about C$368 billion, estimated in 2018-19, Ontario has one of the largest sub-sovereign debts in the world.

The province, which has run deficits every year since 2008-09, pays more to borrow than some other major Canadian provinces, such as Quebec and British Columbia, that are running balanced budgets.

""I think it is positive from a market perspective,"" said Derek Burleton, deputy chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank. ""The deficit implementation plan is reasonable, provided it can meet its targets. They are clearly ambitious on spending.""

SLOWER SPENDING GROWTH

The budget, which looked to expand the sale of alcohol and allow tailgating for sporting events, limited overall spending growth to an average annual rate of 1 percent between 2018-19 and 2023-24, much less than inflation.

It included lower spending on children's and social services even as the Conservatives proposed a new dental program for low-income seniors and a new refundable tax credit for childcare costs that would provide up to C$6,000 per child under the age of 7, and a lesser amount for older children.

Like the federal government, Ontario has favored faster write-offs of capital investments rather than corporate tax cuts to bolster competitiveness with the United States.

But a slowdown in the once red-hot housing market and global economic headwinds could increase the fiscal challenges for the province, which accounts for about 40 percent of Canada's economy and is a major exporter of cars and other manufactured products.

The budget projected growth to slow to 1.4 percent in 2019 from 2.2 percent in 2018, while net debt-to-GDP, a key measure of fiscal health, was estimated at 40.2 percent in 2018-19, the second highest among Canada's 10 provinces. It is projected to rise to 40.7 percent in 2019-20, before dipping to 38.6 percent in 2023-24.

She appealed to Speaker Geoff Regan to rule that their rights had been denied and their privileges as members of Parliament breached on the basis of the 2015 Reform Act, which set rules around the administration of party caucuses.

“This matter is urgent. … Procedural fairness and the rule of law demand this. Secret in-camera meetings or private notices should not be a shield to prevent the upholding of the law and members’ rights,” Philpott told the Commons.

“This is very concerning. It speaks to the rule of law at the heart of our democracy,” Conservative MP Michael Chong, who authored the Reform Act, told the National Post in an interview shortly after she made her arguments. So what exactly is this latest foofaraw all about?

How did the ouster from caucus go down last week?

In a brief speech last Tuesday Trudeau announced his decision to remove Philpott and Wilson-Raybould from caucus after both resigned from cabinet in the wake of the SNC-Lavalin scandal. Wilson-Raybould testified that Trudeau and his top officials tried pressuring her, for political reasons, to cut a deal for Montreal engineering firm SNC-Lavalin so it could avoid criminal prosecution for fraud and bribery.

Both initially stayed members of the Liberal caucus, citing their faith in the party’s policies despite a lack of confidence in the prime minister’s handling of the affair.

But Trudeau said last week the caucus has lost “trust” in the two former ministers. “We’ve taken every effort to address their concerns but ultimately if they can’t honestly say that they have confidence in this team despite weeks of testimony, face-to-face conversations and phone calls with myself and other members of caucus, then they cannot be part of this team.”

Trudeau announced the decision as his own, and Philpott argued Tuesday Liberal MPs never had a chance to have their say — even though the Parliament of Canada Act was amended in 2015, with Chong’s Reform Act, so that these types of situations could be avoided.

What exactly does the Reform Act say about this?

The Reform Act, which amended the Canada Elections Act and the Parliament of Canada Act, spells out rules around expulsions and readmissions of caucus members, the election or removal of caucus chairs, leadership reviews and the election of interim leaders.

The act requires caucuses, after each general election, to hold four votes on whether or not a majority of MPs in each party wants to abide by the rules it sets out on its four topics. If they reject the rules, then they do not need to follow them.

On expulsions, here are the rules that parties can opt in to, or not: A member of caucus can only be expelled, according to the Reform Act, if “the caucus chair has received a written notice signed by at least 20 per cent of the members of the caucus requesting that the member’s membership be reviewed” and if “the expulsion of the member is approved by secret ballot by a majority of all caucus members.”

Neither of those things happened in this case. Philpott said if the Reform Act rules were followed, it would have taken a recorded vote in which 90 Liberal MPs voted to expel her and Wilson-Raybould — yet no such vote took place. “We were expelled prior to the commencement of the Liberal caucus meeting,” she argued in the House Tuesday.

Did Liberals ever vote on the provisions in the Reform Act?

The answer to this question would go a long way to settling whether Liberals did anything to violate the law.

If Liberal MPs never had a chance to vote on opting into the Reform Act rules, as Philpott alleged in the House, that would inherently be an “illegal act,” argued Chong. “I’ve been concerned about it for three-and-a-half years,” he said, since the Liberals reportedly held their first caucus meeting without recording votes and reporting results to the Speaker, which the law required them to do. “It’s now come to fruition with the two questionable expulsions last week.”

But Liberals said on Tuesday that they had followed the rules. Kevin Lamoureux, the parliamentary secretary to the government House leader, told the Commons that “over three years ago,” the chair of the national Liberal caucus, Francis Scarpaleggia, sent a letter to the speaker outlining the caucus’s decisions not to have the Reform Act provisions apply.

“Given the fact that the Liberal caucus did not adopt these provisions, the points raised by the honourable Member on this issue are moot,” said Lamoureux.

Lamoureux said the only requirement, which the caucus met, was for Liberals to inform the speaker of “the results of the caucus decisions.” But the law actually stipulates that they communicate “the outcome of each vote.”

Lamoureux did not address whether individual, recorded votes were held on each element of the Reform Act, nor whether the votes occurred at the Liberals’ first caucus meeting after the election, both required under the law. Philpott is alleging that neither happened.

The House leader’s office referred questions about whether votes were actually held to Scarpaleggia, who told the Post caucus confidentiality means he can’t discuss whether individual votes occurred.

So, does Philpott have a point?

What she’s arguing is that Trudeau breached the privileges of his Liberal MPs by not allowing them to vote on the administration of their own caucus back in November 2015, after the federal election, in accordance with the law. As a result, she is arguing, Philpott’s and Wilson-Raybould’s privileges were breached when Trudeau made a unilateral decision to remove them. And the rights of the entire Liberal caucus were breached because they didn’t have an opportunity to vote on that decision by secret ballot.

Chong said Philpott spoke with him about the topic before going ahead with her arguments on Tuesday morning, and he told the Post he is fully on board with them.

“This point of privilege she has raised is vitally important because if there is no recourse here to enforce the rights of members, there is no other place,” he said. Courts have repeatedly ruled they do not have jurisdiction over matters of parliamentary administration, so he believes this is the only way for it to be enforced. The Reform Act also specifically states that caucus decisions aren’t subject to judicial review.

“The only recourse we have to uphold the rule of law and to ensure that the law is followed in the House of Commons, its parliamentary parties and committees, is in the House of Commons and by appealing to the speaker,” Chong said.

But Philippe Lagassé, a procedure expert at the University of Ottawa, said the whole thing seems more like a question around the legal interpretation of the Parliament of Canada Act rather than a matter of parliamentary privilege.

“I don’t see how this is a point of privilege in the traditional sense,” he said. If Liberal MPs didn’t vote in favour of opting in to the Reform Act rules, then they wouldn’t be bound to them, “and since the courts can’t review, I’m not sure who would enforce this,” he added.

What has the speaker said about this?

Two weeks ago, a Conservative MP raised similar issues when he complained that it seemed MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes had resigned from the Liberal caucus because she was forced out. Had the Reform Act rules been in place, he argued, there would’ve had to have been a vote.

“If you, Mr. Speaker, decline to exercise jurisdiction to entertain breaches of the statute here, then members of caucuses, like the Liberal caucus who flagrantly ignore the law, have no protection and no recourse when their rights are trampled. Because of the lack of judicial recourse, general restraint on speakers interpreting the law and the House’s privilege to manage internal affairs, I respectfully submit that the way forward, indeed the only way forward, is to allow the House to deal with this matter,” John Nater argued.

Caesar-Chavannes ultimately confirmed that she had left of her own accord. And the speaker had come back on Monday, the day before Philpott made her arguments, with a ruling that he didn’t have the jurisdiction anyway.

As relayed by Deputy Speaker Bruce Stanton, Regan’s ruling said asking the House to deal with an expulsion from caucus was “not a proper subject for a question of privilege.” Further, “I as speaker have no role in the interpretation of statute nor in the conduct of these 2015 provisions.”

Philpott acknowledged that ruling on Tuesday morning. “But with respect it is our view that this does not relieve you of your responsibility to ensure that all members are aware of their rights in this place. This is our privilege. Accordingly, a remedy is required for our situation,” she said. Regan responded: “While I am left with the difficulty, as I said in my ruling yesterday, that the speaker does not have power to enforce statutes, I will certainly consider her argument and come back to the House.”

So now what happens?

The House will have to wait for Regan to come back with an opinion on the issue. If he does find a prima facie breach of privilege, which Lagassé found unlikely, Philpott will be able to move that the matter be referred to a parliamentary committee.

Liberals have a majority in the House and on committees — including the two committees that recently decided not to pursue any further investigation of the SNC-Lavalin issue.

Asked whether he’s hopeful that some of them will vote to look at what happened here, Chong said, “We have to try. We can’t give up. … I hope that our House of Commons is strong enough to adjudicate this and to seek justice.”

Education levels produced the largest split on whether or not a referendum should be held.

Sixty-two per cent of people with high-school education or below said the province should hold a referendum, and 70 per cent of those with college or trade school education agreed. But while still a majority, the number of university-education respondents who agreed dropped significantly, to just 51 per cent.

(Vote Compass)

Sixty-two per cent of men said they agree with holding a referendum, as did 51 per cent of women.

How does equalization work?

The program is intended to address fiscal disparities between provinces, and was entrenched in Canada's Constitution in 1982.

""Parliament and the government of Canada are committed to the principle of making equalization payments to ensure that provincial governments have sufficient revenues to provide reasonably comparable levels of public services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation,"" the Constitution reads.

It's a myth that Alberta sends money directly to Ottawa for the program. All Canadians pay income tax to the federal government, and then that money is paid out to provinces based on each region's ability to raise revenues compared with the average.

The formula that calculates how much each province gets has been controversial due to how it accounts for natural resource revenues.

For decades, Alberta has received no federal support through equalization payments, while Quebec, for example, is set to receive $13.1 billion in 2019-20.

The payments are unconditional — meaning each province can spend the money it receives as it wishes.

A survey of 1,200 Albertans undertaken by pollster Janet Brown for CBC last spring found 70 per cent think the current equalization payment system is unfair. Half strongly felt it was unfair while, while 20 per cent ""somewhat"" agreed.

Where Alberta's political parties stand

UCP Leader Jason Kenney said he plans to hold a referendum on equalization as a way to hold Ottawa's feet to the fire over getting a coastal pipeline built.

Vote Compass found a whopping 82 per cent of UCP supporters agreed with that policy.

The NDP said in a press release in March that Kenney mischaracterizes how equalization works, and pointed out that Kenney was part of the Conservative government that brought in the current equalization formula in the 2007 budget. Only 32 per cent of NDP supporters said they wanted a referendum.

The party said it supports looking at the formula but believes a referendum would be a dead-end, and also suggested that one of the UCP's equalization proposals could make the Canada Health Act unenforceable in the province.

In June 2018, the federal government announced it would extend the current payment formula until 2024 without negotiating with the provinces, several politicians said. At the time, Alberta's finance minister stated the province's opposition to the decision.

The Liberal platform states that while the equalization formula isn't fair, a ""referendum"" would not give the province power to amend the Constitution.

Instead, the party says it will demand the formula be changed to treat provinces' hydro revenue the same as Alberta oil and gas, and that if those demands aren't met, a Crown corporation will be established to remove energy royalties from equalization formula calculations.

(Vote Compass)

Alberta Party Leader Stephen Mandel has also said he plans to push for changes to what he called an ""unfair equalization program.""

And the Freedom Conservative Party plans to demand an end to equalization and replace all federal transfers with ""tax points.""

Thirty-eight per cent of Liberal supporters agreed with the idea of holding a referendum, as did 58 per cent of Alberta Party supporters. FCP supporters were not included in the Vote Compass data.

Geoff Regan said he has no role in deciding how caucuses should conduct themselves.

Moreover, he said the Parliament of Canada Act expressly bars the courts from intervening in such matters.

""This leaves caucuses alone with the authority to govern their internal operations,"" Regan told the Commons.

""With the full authority given to caucuses themselves in such unequivocal terms, it is clear that the chair has no role in the interpretation or enforcement of the statute, even when members feel rudderless without what they feel would be clearly stated and understood rules.""

Philpott argued Tuesday that Trudeau did not follow reforms made to the Parliament of Canada Act in 2015 that were supposed to give MPs more power over caucus decisions — including whether to expel members — rather than leave them entirely up to party leaders.

The reforms required each party caucus to hold recorded votes at their first meeting following an election on whether to adopt the new rules.

The Liberals never had such a vote, deciding in 2015 to defer the matter to a party convention instead. But they ultimately informed the Speaker that they had implicitly chosen not to use the new rules.

Trudeau has said he made the decision to turf Philpott and Wilson-Raybould only after extensive consultations showed overwhelming caucus support for kicking the pair out of the Liberal fold.

The two former ministers have been at the centre of a political storm that has engulfed the Trudeau government for more than two months.

Wilson-Raybould alleges she was improperly pressured last fall by the Prime Minister's Office and others to intervene to stop the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. She believes she was moved out of the prestigious justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs in a mid-January cabinet shuffle as punishment for refusing to override the director of public prosecutions, who had decided not to invite the Montreal engineering giant to negotiate a remediation agreement, a kind of plea bargain in corporate corruption cases.

Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet in mid-February. Philpott followed suit a few weeks later, saying she had lost confidence in the government's handling of the SNC-Lavalin case.

The last straw for Liberal MPs was the revelation that Wilson-Raybould surreptitiously recorded a December phone conversation with Michael Wernick, the clerk of the Privy Council, to bolster her claim of improper pressure. Many said they no longer felt they could trust the former ministers.

The pair now sit as independents in the Commons and will not be allowed to run as Liberals in this fall's election.

During a question on ...","Decision '19.

CHARLOTTETOWN, P.E.I. - There was minimal mudslinging among P.E.I.’s party leaders during a debate that focused on Islanders who make a living from the province’s soil.

Wednesday’s debate, hosted by the P.E.I. Federation of Agriculture, was largely cordial as the four leaders shared common ground in wanting to support the province’s major industry.

One of the few instances of direct criticism came when Green Leader Peter Bevan-Baker challenged PC Leader Dennis King on his party’s plan to address climate change after King pledged earlier in the day to extend the province’s marked fuel program to all farm-plated vehicles.

During a question on Canada’s carbon tax, Bevan-Baker said when combined with rebates, it’s the most “effective, efficient and fair” emission-reduction method and pointed to P.E.I.’s poor growing season last year as an example of climate change’s impact on farmers.

“Denny talks about how important it is that we look at climate change … I’d love to hear what plans he has,” said Bevan-Baker. “We have a huge choice and a huge responsibility coming up. We don’t need some sort of haphazard grab bag of random choices, we need a coherent plan.”

Bevan-Baker listed a number of policies, including precision agriculture (using drones to pinpoint crops needing treatment), import substitution, customized buffer zones and clean energy rebates as ways to help farmers mitigate and adapt.

“There is no single solution here,” he said.

Due to the format of the debate, King did not have a chance to respond directly.

However, earlier he said the carbon tax had an unfair burden on Islanders and that P.E.I. farmers do not have transit or trails to bring produce to market.

“(It’s) having a solution for all of Canada that doesn’t make sense for independent jurisdictions such as P.E.I.,” said King. “We’re not sticking our heads in the sand … we realize we want to reduce carbon, we want to help achieve those goals. But adding to our costs without achieving the goal, I don’t think it’s a very fair solution.”

King said he was perplexed by governments who seem “more interested in catching a farmer doing something wrong” to fine them and pledged to work with industry on environmental challenges.

“It must be ironic for all of you, to find four people who don’t farm telling you the options of what you should do as a farmer. I’d rather ask you what you need from government,” said King.

Liberal Leader Wade MacLauchlan was also hesitant on increasing the marked fuel program because he said it could lead to unintended consequences in other industries.

He instead preferred to invest in new export markets and product development while also praising Island farmers for their innovation.

“If we didn’t have farming in Prince Edward Island, I don’t think we’d have bioscience,” said MacLauchlan. “And we wouldn’t have the growth we’ve seen in manufacturing.”

MacLauchlan pointed to investments in the energy cable, reforestation, the alternate land use program and increased crop insurance funds as helping farmers deal with climate challenges.

NDP Leader Joe Byrne questioned the effectiveness of carbon tax rebates, instead preferring to see more investment into new farming technology.

“Because the same capitalist market that has left farmers struggling so much, is frankly incapable of getting us out of global warming,” said Byrne.

Carbon pricing and climate change effects were just two of the issues discussed during the debate, which was hosted by former managing editor of The Guardian, Gary MacDougall.

Candidates also touched on trade agreements, soil health, labour shortages and other topics related to the industry.",Party leaders address climate challenges facing P.E.I. farmers,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.pe.ca/news/pei-election/party-leaders-address-climate-challenges-facing-pei-farmers-300520/

It can’t tolerate any truth-telling either. The province ...,"Oil, a commodity that nurtures dependency, has so coddled the Alberta mind that it has fostered a provincial culture of victimization as poisonous as the identity politics unsettling university campuses.

If oil were a young university student, Alberta’s politicians would now play the role of paranoid helicopter parents or politically correct campus administrators.

Every day the province’s oil-obsessed politicos warn Albertans that Canada is a dangerous place full of self-righteous climate activists (and some are indeed self-righteous), anti-pipeline protestors, dumb courts, stubborn First Nations, and nasty liberals.

Moreover the province’s potential for offence-taking has become as grand as Justin Trudeau’s vindictive Liberal Party of Canada. It can’t tolerate any truth-telling either.

The province’s allergy to criticism has grown so formidable that United Conservative Party leader Jason Kenney proposes to set up a Saudi-like war room in the energy ministry to respond to any micro-aggressions and offensive material. Should it be called Snowflake Central?

Albertans have become such a fragile, oil-reliant people, reasons Kenney, that the province now needs the equivalent of university Bias Response Teams, in this case to foster “a safe and inclusive environment” for its petroleum exporters who have now claimed Alberta’s identity as their own.

(The rulers of Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and Russia, we should remember, don’t much like oil critics, either. The political records show that oil relishes conflict and breeds political aggression like no other commodity, except cocaine.)

Kenney, a belligerent proponent of oil-safetyism, would much rather play the blame game than accept the truth that the rapid development of bitumen mining in Fort McMurray violated two fundamental principles of risk mitigation: go slow and save the money.

Over many years, Alberta’s Tories repeatedly gambled that the price of bitumen, a garbage crude that requires upgrading and complex refining, could only go higher, and they bet wrong.

So did the NDP, another oil-coddled entity. (And yes, Albertans should be very angry about the gross mismanagement of their gas and oil resources by their elected politicians.)

According to former Encana CEO Gwyn Morgan, another whiner of the highest order, Alberta’s most important industry has been stomped on by bad people.

(As every adherent of identity politics knows, life is a constant battle between good and evil people. God forbid that Canadians see each other as brothers and sisters.)

Morgan, who chaired SNC-Lavalin during the Libya scandal and boldly took no responsibility for that fiasco, recently argued in the Financial Post that the “drastic decline” of Canada’s oil industry is due to “a combination of ideological antagonism to fossil fuels and tunnel vision.”

Apparently, ideology caused oil prices to crash in 2014, and the overproduction of bitumen and tight oil had nothing to do with that bitter event, which left 40,000 Albertans jobless.

Art Berman, a respected Houston oil analyst and no greenie, has a much higher respect for the truth.

He recently documented how combined Canadian and U.S. unconventional oil production from the tar sands and Permian Basin “surged in 2014 and caused oil prices to collapse.” As prices fell, producers — including OPEC — rejected any production cuts.

Yet to this day you’ll never hear an Alberta or federal politician, let alone Morgan, acknowledge how Canadian oilsands production helped precipitate the global oil price crash of 2014. (Delusion appears to be a reliable Canadian political trait for both the left and the right.)

Alberta’s political elites would never let the facts spoil the celebration of Alberta’s victimhood or the province’s politically correct view of petroleum as the Walt Disney of resources.

In Morgan’s pity analysis, 44 years of one-party rule in Alberta by the Tories played no role in Alberta’s current predicament.

But the facts show that the Conservative governments foolishly eschewed any value-added policy for the province’s junk crude, and instead promoted a low royalty regime, which encouraged the export of raw bitumen — a dismal strategy that has enriched U.S. refineries and the Koch brothers.

No matter. Those damn oil-hating and U.S.-funded tar sands campaigners are to blame for Alberta’s bad oil rap, argues Mark Scholz, president of the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors in the Calgary Herald.

According to Scholz, a bunch of celebrities and “a glorious campaign of Houdini-like misdirection” are somehow responsible for the cancelling of two bitumen export pipelines, carbon taxes, and everything else that has gone wrong in Alberta.

Of course the high carbon content of bitumen and its extreme price volatility have nothing to do with declining investment in the oil sands.

The facts also tell a different story about the two cancelled pipelines. A federal court cancelled Northern Gateway’s permit (and the Harper government choose not to revive that proposal) while market conditions claimed the Energy East pipeline.

Although proponents of Energy East claimed it would end the import of Saudi oil into eastern Canada, David Hughes, a well-known Canadian energy analyst notes that eastern refineries in New Brunswick aren’t designed to process much heavy oil.

So an Energy East pipeline, if ever built, could not really put a dent in U.S. or Saudi oil imports.

Tim McMillan, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, the industry’s powerful lobby group, also claims victimhood. “We have been the victims of a very well-orchestrated, well-planned foreign-funded attack on Canadian infrastructure,” he recently tweeted.

But Hughes notes oil sands production has grown by 376 per cent since 2000. If there was a “foreign-funded attack” it’s been grossly ineffective, he says.

Hughes adds that “the reason that there is a pipeline bottleneck is that the industry has been so successful in growing production.”

NDP Premier Rachel Notley also presents Alberta as fragile player unfairly dumped upon by bad actors in British Columbia and elsewhere.

Her vocabulary consists of pipelines, pipelines and pipelines.

Alberta can’t get full value for its bitumen “because we can’t move the product to market.”

And dastardly environmentalists have created a situation where “we are leaving world oil markets — and in some cases Eastern Canadian markets — to the Russians and the Saudis — countries that don’t care a whit about climate change or the environment.”

Yet research done for Alberta Innovates, a taxpayer-funded nonprofit, revealed that no real price advantage for bitumen exists in Asia.

The best and most lucrative market remains U.S. Gulf Coast refineries because they can handle complex heavy oil.

And what oil-exporting nation, other than Norway, truly gives a damn about climate change or the environment? They simply don’t exist.

Coddling a mind is a terrible thing, but coddling a province is a social disaster.

In the current election campaign, no politician wants to pony up and tell the truth.

It wasn’t foreigners or bad actors who created Alberta’s failings; it was Albertans and their damn greed and lack of strategic planning.

Albertans share the blame for the 2014 oil price collapse with U.S. tight oil producers (price discounts and lack of pipelines clobbered Permian producers too), and Albertans share blame for the province’s collective failure to add value to bitumen. (The more value you add, the fewer pipelines you need.)

Albertans, and only Albertans, share the blame for not collecting their fair share and saving for a rainy day.

So stop your whining and end the blame game. Cowboy up and own your oil-based problems, and recognize that the Alberta government has not responded competently to structural changes in oil and gas markets.

Recognize you’ve got both revenue and spending problems that could be a death spiral for the province.

Admit that exporting carbon-rich oil comes with high risks and that exporting more oil and building more pipelines will increase those risks.

And stop pretending that business as usual will dig Alberta out of the hole it has dug for itself.

Morgan, Kenney, Notley and the rest of Alberta-Is-Only-Oil gang might want to start with some cognitive behavioural therapy, or better still, sit down and read Butcher’s Crossing.

It’s a great novel about a buffalo hunt by the Texas writer John Williams. Some say it is probably the best western ever written — even better than True Grit — and I agree.

It tells the story of a couple of buffalo hunters who journey to Colorado for a grand slaughter with visions of prosperity.

But once the hunters locate their prey, they grow so obsessed with greed and bloodletting that winter overtakes them and traps them in the mountains.

The killers emerge from a gruelling snowy ordeal months later, only to discover that the markets for buffalo hides have crashed.

A dejected hide-buyer explains the ruinous facts. “The bottom’s dropped out of the whole market. The hide business is finished. For good.”

Oil is not finished yet, and the prospects for heavy oil remain solid in the U.S. Gulf Coast. The oil sands will shrink, but they will not disappear for decades.

But Alberta’s twisted identity politics uphold the politically correct illusion that there are more buffalo to kill, and the future doesn’t matter.

But the issue hasn’t taken centre stage in the 2019 provincial election — something that may be surprising for a place where devastating natural disasters, like the 2013 southern Alberta floods and the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfires, are becoming more frequent as global temperatures rise.

“We’re not having very much of a public discourse, we’re just getting distracted by (the carbon) tax,” said Shawn Marshall, a climatology professor at the University of Calgary. “This is really happening. We need to prepare.” Albertans are the least likely in Canada to believe in climate change — last year, a poll by Canada’s Ecofiscal Commission, an independent economics organization, found 52 per cent of Albertans see conclusive or solid evidence that the Earth is warming. Sixteen per cent said there’s little or no proof, the highest rate of any province, the poll found.

As well, several United Conservative Party candidates have come under fire for climate change denial. (Leader Jason Kenney has said he believes in climate change but won’t boot candidates who disagree.) “So many livelihoods in Alberta are tied to fossil fuels,” said Marshall. “Anything that threatens that industry is going to be really controversial.”

Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is one climate change-related goal, but it’s also past time to begin preparing for the impacts to come, Marshall added. For Alberta, that means projects aimed at mitigating future droughts, floods and wildfires — especially as Canada is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the world, according to an Environment Canada report released earlier this month. “The writing’s on the wall,” said Marshall.

Very few discussions about climate change-related infrastructure have happened during this election campaign. One notable exception is flood mitigation in Calgary — and more specifically, the Springbank dam. The NDP has consistently supported the dam, which would divert water from the Elbow River 15 kilometres west of Calgary into a dry reservoir that would store water during a flood. (The NDP has also pledged to spend $1 billion on other mitigation along the Bow River.) The Alberta Party has also supported the Springbank dam. Less clear is the UCP’s stance — though Kenney has promised to support it if elected, the party’s candidate for the area, Miranda Rosin of Banff-Kananaskis, has opposed it. The NDP has also proposed to build a second highway into Fort McMurray. It could serve as another escape route in the case of a catastrophic wildfire, allowing the city to avoid the clogged roads that hampered evacuation efforts in 2016. But in terms of policy aimed at saving Albertans from climate change-related disaster, that’s about it. “Responsible policy and governance (for climate change) involves thinking long-term,” said Marshall, adding that governments must look ahead as far as 2080. “I feel like we don’t see very much of that because politics and governance are really a fist fight for the current time.” And so, the centrepieces of the four major parties’ climate change plans have been their takes on the carbon tax, a policy the governing NDP introduced in 2017. Right now, Albertans pay $30 per tonne of carbon used, an added cost, for example, of about seven cents per litre on gasoline.

Carbon taxes are a global best practice for tackling climate change, said Brendan Boyd, an assistant professor at MacEwan University who studies climate change policy. But they can also be quite unpopular, requiring politicians to balance stringent rules with the need to make them publicly acceptable. “Support for the carbon tax is definitely low in Alberta compared to the rest of the country,” Boyd said. “Even though it might never be a really, really popular policy, there are different ways that you can design it to make it more politically palatable.” One of those ways would be making it revenue-neutral, meaning all of the money generated is returned to taxpayers through rebates or other tax cuts, Boyd said. The Alberta Liberal Party has proposed a plan along those lines. Another way could be narrowing the pool of people who have to pay the carbon levy — the Alberta Party, for example, has proposed exempting homes, businesses, farms, and non-profits. Though, of course, the fewer people who have to pay the tax, the smaller the reduction in emissions. The United Conservatives, meanwhile, have pledged to scrap the carbon tax entirely if elected. Though that would likely mean Albertans would have to pay a federally imposed carbon tax, the UCP has also promised it would take that fight to court. Alberta also has a program targeting large industrial emitters — it has existed in some form since 2007, but a stronger version took effect under the NDP in 2018.

The UCP has proposed replacing the carbon tax with a weaker version of the large emitters program called TIER, the Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction fund. As with the current NDP plan, a portion of the revenues would fund research aimed at reducing emissions — though the NDP plan allocates more money for that purpose. But such a plan might not reduce overall emissions and is “less stringent” than the current version, Boyd said. The UCP plan only requires companies to reduce emissions compared to their overall production, so as long as they’re getting more efficient, their emissions could actually increase. “Environmental groups have typically been opposed to that because it doesn’t actually set an absolute cap on emissions,” said Boyd. “Industry likes it, because that means they can continue to produce without having to worry about limiting their production.” When the large emitters program was first introduced, it was a progressive, incremental step toward broader carbon pricing, Boyd said. And for a province like Alberta, where a significant chunk of greenhouse gas emissions come from large, industrial polluters, it can make a dent. However, research has advanced since then. We now know that carbon taxes don’t have a hugely negative economic impact when done right, and most jurisdictions that are trying to address climate change have gone that route instead, Boyd said. “In a lot of people’s opinions, (the UCP plan) will be seen as a step back,” said Boyd. None of the parties’ plans are stringent enough to help Alberta meet its international climate targets, Boyd said. However, the targets matter less than figuring out how to reduce emissions in a way that’s both effective and popular enough for governments to enact it. “We sometimes get hung up, I think, a little bit too much on the specific targets,” Boyd said. “(Policy is) not useful if no one’s willing to accept it and no government will put it in place.”

Carbon pricing isn’t the only factor in regulating emissions. The UCP has also pledged to get rid of an NDP cap on emissions from the oilsands, and to allow coal-fired plants to keep operating past 2023 (the NDP had planned to phase them out). When it comes to renewable energy, the UCP has promised to cut NDP subsidies on solar power, saying it believes the market can support solar projects on its own. Though ending the subsidies wouldn’t exactly support the transition to renewable energy, Boyd said such a move probably wouldn’t hamper it either. “Part of that is market-driven, so as long as the price comes down and it becomes an effective, competitive fuel source for electricity, it may continue on regardless of what government is in power.” Marshall said Alberta has a lot of potential to become a future centre for renewable fuel production, if people are willing to speed up the transition away from fossil fuels. But that can’t happen if climate change threatens our water supply, or if our province is choked by wildfire smoke — things everyone in Alberta should want to avoid, he said. “It’d be nice if we started thinking about opportunity instead of entrenching in what made us wealthy,” Marshall said. “There’s so much opportunity here ... I’m sad that it’s such a partisan issue.” Emma McIntosh is an environment, justice and investigative reporter with Star Calgary. Follow her on Twitter at @EmmaMci

That kind of subversion usually occurs behind ...","When it comes to defending Canada from the menace posed by the People’s Republic of China, it is now a matter of public record, and should be a matter of some embarrassment to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, if not shame, that the course his government embarked upon almost four years ago was dangerously naïve, if not recklessly thoughtless.

It’s a tragedy that it took the Chinese Ministry of State Security’s kidnapping of former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and cultural entrepreneur Michael Spavor to prove that the Beijing regime was not the “win-win, golden-decade” friend and trade partner Trudeau had incessantly harped about. Robert Schellenberg, dubiously convicted on drug-smuggling charges in the first place, had his 15-year jail sentence upgraded to a cell on death row. Canada’s canola exporters are stuck with $2.7 billion in export contracts that Beijing has ripped up. Threats of further punishment hang in the air.

It’s all because Canada detained Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou last December on a U.S. Justice Department extradition warrant. Meng is sought by the U.S. to face charges of fraud and dodging sanctions on Iran. Beijing needed to throw somebody up against a wall and slap him around, so President Xi Jinping chose Justin Trudeau.

Beijing needed to throw somebody up against a wall and slap him around, so President Xi Jinping chose Justin Trudeau.

Beijing’s complex campaigns of subversion, threats, influence-buying, bullying and espionage in Canada stretch back much farther than last December, of course. So does the sleazy tendency of Canadian politicians to look the other way, or rush to Beijing’s defence whenever anyone in the intelligence community publicly notices the obvious, or throw the director of the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service under the bus for pointing it out.

When CSIS director Richard Fadden had the temerity to point out nearly a decade ago that there were provincial cabinet ministers and other elected officials in Canada who had fallen under Beijing’s general influence, several Liberal and NDP MPs demanded his resignation.

So it was refreshing to see that Tuesday’s first-ever annual report from the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP) made no bones about it. China is a threat to Canada’s national security, the committee found. Terrorism, espionage and foreign influence, cyber threats, major organized crime and weapons of mass destruction were all listed in the NSICOP report among the top threats to Canada. China figures in the report’s findings under espionage and foreign influence, and under cyber threats as well.

Russia is right up there, too, and although the report is redacted in several places, other unnamed governments were reported to be busy with the same dirty work. But it was the novelty of China being singled out for once, in a high-level federal government intelligence report, that’s worth noticing. Usually, the federal government lets China get away with anything.

“China is known globally for its efforts to influence Chinese communities and the politics of other countries. The Chinese government has a number of official organizations that try to influence Chinese communities and politicians to adopt pro-China positions, most prominently the United Front Work Department,” the report states, referring directly to Fadden’s whistle-blowing in 2010.

The report also notes a 2017 warning from David Mulroney, a former ambassador to China, about Beijing’s influence-peddling efforts in Canada. To get what it wants, Beijing mobilizes student groups, diaspora groups, “and people who have an economic stake in China, to work behind the scenes.” The report also notes the unsavoury business of lavish political donations on offer from Chinese businessmen with close links to China’s Communist Party leadership.

Two years ago, the Financial Times obtained the United Front Work Department’s training manual, which boasts about the electoral successes of 10 pro-Beijing politicians in Ontario. “We should aim to work with those individuals and groups that are at a relatively high level, operate within the mainstream of society and have prospects for advancement,” the manual states.

The reason for the public’s relative inattention to influence-and-espionage threats posed by foreign powers like China and Russia is that the federal government tends to avoid addressing the issue publicly. “As it stands now, an interested Canadian would have to search a number of government websites to understand the most significant threats to Canada,” the committee found.

“For some threats, such as terrorism, information is readily available and regularly updated … For other threats, such as organized crime or interference in Canadian politics, information is often limited, scattered among different sources or incomplete. The Committee believes that Canadians would be equally well served if more information about threats were readily available.”

That information is available, of course. It just hasn’t been coming from the federal government. In his just-published book, Claws of the Panda: Beijing’s Campaign of Influence and Intimidation in Canada, veteran foreign affairs reporter Jonathan Manthorpe painstakingly enumerates the breadth and scope of the United Front Work Department’s organizations in Canada, and Beijing’s intimate links throughout Canada’s business class. Manthorpe relied solely on the public record, showing that Beijing’s strong-arming, its inducements and its subtle and not-so-subtle intimidation have been carried out in plain sight for years.

Last year, a coalition of diaspora groups led by Amnesty International provided CSIS, Canada’s spy agency, with an exhaustive account of Beijing’s intensive campaign of bullying, threats and harassment targeting Canadian diaspora organizations devoted to Chinese democracy, the Falun Gong spiritual movement, Tibetan sovereignty, and the Uighurs. A Muslim ethnic minority in Xinjiang, the Uighur people are currently being subjected to an overwhelming tyranny of concentration camps, religious persecution, “re-education,” family separation and ’round-the-clock, pervasive surveillance. “Canada has become a battleground on which the Chinese Communist Party seeks to terrorize, humiliate and neuter its opponents,” says Manthorpe.

That kind of subversion usually occurs behind the scenes. But for years, Confucius Institutes have operated openly in dozens of Canadian universities, colleges and high schools. “In most cases,” Manthorpe contends, “they are espionage outstations for Chinese embassies and consulates through which they control Chinese students, gather information on perceived enemies and intimidate dissidents.”

Because its mandate covers more than a dozen institutions and agencies, NSICOP – first proposed 15 years ago, but only now getting off the ground – had a lot of ground to cover. More than half of the report’s 121 pages are devoted to a review of the intelligence functions of the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces. But it’s subversion by foreign governments that seems to have caught the parliamentary committee’s attention: CSIS told NSICOP the foreign-influence threat is becoming more acute, and countering it will call for “a more significant response” in the coming years.

With that in mind, the committee is already working on a follow-up review of the mandate, priority and resources the federal government provides Canada’s intelligence community to monitor and counter the foreign-influence threat. The committee’s report is expected to be released before the October federal election, but it won’t be focused on the foreign cyber threats the government is already preparing to monitor and expose during the election campaign.

“We’re going to outline the primary-threat actors, we’re going to be examining the threat those actors pose to our institutions and, to a certain extent, our ethno-cultural communities,” NSICOP chair David McGuinty told reporters Tuesday. “We’re working feverishly to get it done.”

About time, too.

I suspect she’d an inkling this was coming. After all, every time she turns on the TV, watch a movie, read the paper or browse some social media chat room the message is unmistakable. It’s all the fault of those Russians.

She being born and bred in Moscow, though for years a proud Canadian, it’s a tad annoying to constantly see your native land being blamed for every problem on earth.

For comparison, let’s recall those old John Wayne movies where Indians — as they were then called — were portrayed as such needless, nasty critters they could be shown getting mown down like dithering ducks in some early-morning November sky. The movie audiences of the time ate it up.

Thankfully, that storyline doesn’t play well today. But such cultural and political correctness isn’t universal. Now the only bunch left you can impugn without fear of societal vilification are those nasty Ruskies.

Now, truth be told, I’ve always had a fondness for Russia: some of the greatest literature, dance, art, engineering and science has emanated from what is by far and away the biggest slice of national landmass on our planet. Oh, and having the world’s most beautiful women didn’t hurt, either.

Of course, if I actually lived and worked there, it wouldn’t last long — pondering in print why Vladimir Putin insists on being photographed with his shirt off more often than Kim Kardashian would likely guarantee I’d soon be slipping whilst giving some ninth-storey windows a quick clean. (I love Canada — it puts up with me.)

But what’s the latest dirty deed those Russians are involved in? For an answer, who better to turn to than the man standing bravely and resolutely on guard for Canada: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Yes, in a much-needed (for him, anyhow) time out from insulting Indigenous women protesting mercury poisoning or booting former ministers out of caucus because they think the rule of law worth defending, Trudeau was in fine fettle, speaking about something he undoubtedly is an expert in: malign actors.

“We have seen over the past number of years an increase in the interference or the implication of foreign actors in democratic processes,” he said. “We saw very clearly that countries like Russia are behind a lot of the divisive campaigns, a lot of the divisive social media.

“The election that’s coming up in six months will be decided by Canadians. We’re going to work very hard with all the intelligence communities and our partners around the world to ensure that our democracies stay strong for all the different voices that express themselves within it.”

Wow. He certainly wasn’t talking about his own Liberal caucus and how it stands up for different voices within it.

That’s not all. Apparently, we need a group of five senior civil servants who might be forced to go public if they find a malign act of interference in the October campaign.

What a bunch of tosh. We’ve witnessed a bigger threat to the values this country holds dear emanating out of Trudeau’s own government than could ever be envisaged by some nebulous Moscow-based bunch intent on placing some daft ads on Facebook.

But this is just a smokescreen. The only threat this man is concerned about is the free-fall his personal approval ratings are taking at the polls. Or maybe that too is some fiendish Russian-inspired plot.

No, this is simply another lame attempt to derail the SNC-Lavalin scandal, to make himself look statesman-like when in reality Trudeau appears increasingly as a thin-skinned, bully boy.

Still, he might have reason to worry about those Russians after all. I know a fair number here in Calgary, mostly engineers in the energy industry.

Yes, they will be interfering in the federal election all right. It’s called voting and like the majority of their fellow Calgarians, they won’t be marking an X anywhere near Trudeau’s party.

MONTREAL — A former Canadian junior hockey standout will run for the federal Conservatives in a suburban Montreal riding.

Angelo Esposito's candidacy in the election scheduled for October was confirmed by Josee Morissette, a Quebec spokeswoman for the party.

Esposito, 30, is a former National Hockey League first-round pick who starred in junior for the Quebec Remparts and the Montreal Junior Hockey Club.

He won a Memorial Cup with the Remparts in 2006 and also played for the Team Canada squad that won gold at the World Junior Hockey Championships in 2009.

Drafted by the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2007, Esposito never played in the NHL but carved out a professional career in the minors and Europe, which ended in 2016.

Esposito, who now works in real estate investment, will face off against incumbent Liberal MP Angelo Iacono in the riding of Alfred-Pellan in Laval, Que.

The Liberal government has insisted it ...","Ottawa, ON — Canola farmers whose livelihoods have been targeted by China in its feud with Canada say it’s time for the federal government to be aggressive at the political level in its fight against a growing number of agricultural trade barriers around the world.

Several producers told two parliamentary committees Tuesday that China’s recent rejection of Canadian canola-seed shipments is only the latest trade disruption that’s hurt the country’s agriculture sector.

They reminded MPs in Ottawa about a number of major trade obstacles faced by Canadian agricultural exporters in faraway markets like India, Italy, Vietnam and Saudi Arabia.

“Canada can feed the world but not if our government does not act strongly on our behalf, removing non-tariff trade barriers, enforcing existing trade agreements and removing political roadblocks,” Alberta canola farmer Stephen Vandervalk told the House of Commons agriculture committee.

Citing concerns about pests, China has rejected canola-seed imports from Canada and has suspended the licences of two major Canadian exporters.

The moves to cut off the critical Canadian export have been widely viewed as China applying economic pressure on Canada in response to the December arrest of senior Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver at the behest of the United States.

Any extended canola dispute with China, which imported $2.7 billion worth of canola seed from Canada last year, would deliver a painful economic blow to producers, the supply chain and the wider Canadian economy.

The price of canola has fallen since the dispute started last month. The late-winter timing of the disruption has been particularly difficult because it’s forced many farmers to suddenly rethink the planting decisions vital to their businesses.

On Tuesday, producers made it clear to MPs at the committees that even with the urgency around the China conflict, the pain is not only about canola. Canadian farmers, they said, are staring at other big trade hurdles in world markets.

Several of the witnesses mentioned issues that have affected Canada’s durum wheat exports to Italy, wheat sales to Vietnam, pulse exports to India and feed-barley shipments to Saudi Arabia.

Saskatchewan grain farmer Mehgin Reynolds (who is seeking a Conservative party nomination) told MPs that, for instance, her four-year crop rotation includes lentils, barley, canola and durum wheat — all products that face obstacles on foreign markets.

“The frightening reality is that almost every crop being grown in Canada is currently struggling with one trade barrier or another,” Reynolds said.

The Liberal government has insisted it wants to find a scientific solution to the canola dispute, in keeping with China’s insistence that the problem is tainted seeds.

The Liberals have established a working group that includes officials from Richardson International Ltd. and Viterra Inc. — the two exporters that have had their licences to sell canola revoked by China — and representatives from the governments of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau has requested to send a delegation of experts to China to examine the issue. She’s said officials are exploring options to support farmers by expanding existing programs.

Canola producer Mark Kaun told the committee it’s time for the Canadian government to start playing “hardball.”

“There’s a pile of imports that come into this country from China — and maybe some of their ships should sit and wait in the water,” Kaun said. “Canadian canola is contaminated — it’s contaminated with political dirt and bureaucracy.”

“This is a political issue plain and simple. Political problems need political solutions,” agreed Vandervalk, who’s also vice-president representing Alberta with the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association.

But in the meantime Canadian grain farmers are the ones paying the price for the political failings.”",Farmers demand strong political response to expanding trade obstacles for Canada,canadianshipper.com,https://www.canadianshipper.com/transportation-and-logistics/farmers-demand-strong-political-response-expanding-trade-obstacles-canada/1003379685/

New Democratic Party (NDP) voters – who can point to these findings as proof of their long-standing assertion that Canada’s two major parties are ...","Earlier this year, a Research Co. survey found that almost two-thirds of Canadians (64%) witnessed someone swearing in public. The poll was an early effort to look at the state of manners in our country and pinpoint some regional and generational differences.

There are many reasons that compel Canadians to swear. There is a difference in the words that we might use or hear when someone cuts us off the road while driving, or to describe the disappointing actions of a co-worker to a supervisor.

article continues below

This time, we asked Canadians about the words they hear and the words they use in four different types of conversations that may happen throughout the course of a regular day. The results show that there are situations where familiarity enables us to curse, and others where manners seem to prevail.

For starters, more than half of Canadians say they hear swear words “frequently” or “occasionally” when they are talking with friends (68%), strangers (55%), relatives (53%) and co-workers (52%).

While more than one in four Canadians (27%) say they never hear curse words in the workplace, the proportion drops when it comes to listening to relatives (15%), strangers (14%) and friends (10%).

In three provinces – British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Manitoba – seven in 10 residents (70%) report hearing swears from their friends “frequently” or “occasionally.” The most bleepable workplaces appear to be located in Ontario, where 54% of residents say their co-workers swear.

The first question deals with what we remember hearing. When it comes to our own choice of words, most Canadians (52%) admit to uttering swears “frequently” or “occasionally” when they are having a conversation with friends, but fewer say they rely on curse words when chatting with relatives (40%), co-workers (34%) and strangers (23%).

There is an elevated sense of caution in specific circumstances. Half of Canadians (49%) say they never swear when talking to strangers and two in five (41%) say they never swear when talking to co-workers.

British Columbians lead the entire country in relying on swear words “frequently” or “occasionally” when talking with friends (56%). Residents of Manitoba and Saskatchewan are first on personal swearing with relatives (45%), co-workers (41%) and strangers (26%).

Age is a factor in what we say, more than in what we hear. Canadians aged 18 to 34 are decidedly more likely to swear when chatting with friends (73%), relatives (55%), co-workers (47%) and even strangers (33%) than their older counterparts.

There is no definitive rule on when and how it is acceptable to swear. Almost half of Canadians (48%) admit that they sometimes alter the way they speak so as not to swear in front of certain people. The proportion of “conditional” swearers is highest among the youngest adult age group (57%) as well as residents of Saskatchewan and Manitoba (52%), Ontario (50%) and British Columbia (50%).

Just under two in five Canadians (38%) say they always modify the way they speak to make sure they do not swear in public. This very polite group encompasses 40% of women, 42% of baby boomers and 43% of Quebecers.

This leaves a small proportion of Canadians (14%) who claim to never alter the way they speak, and who simply do not worry about it if a swear word comes out.

On a political basis, there is no difference in the public behaviour of Liberal and Conservative voters when it comes to swearing. Equal proportions of supporters of either party in the last federal election “always” (43%), “sometimes” (43%) or “never” (14%) change the way they speak.

New Democratic Party (NDP) voters – who can point to these findings as proof of their long-standing assertion that Canada’s two major parties are the same – are less likely to “always” change their words (31%) and more likely to “sometimes” do so (58%).

Two findings leave us asking more questions. First, the gender gap is exceptionally pronounced when it comes to swearing in the workplace. While 46% of women say they never curse when chatting with co-workers, the proportion drops to 35% among men. This might point to men being more likely to get away with “locker room” talk.

Second, those in the 18-to-34 age group are the least likely to say that they never change how they speak to prevent curse words (9%), compared to 15% for baby boomers and 17% for generation X. Canada’s youngest adults have grown up in a time of looser censorship guidelines, particularly when it comes to language on television, movies and music. It is not shocking to see four-letter words in their regular thesaurus.

Conservative Party of Canada leader Andrew Scheer reacts to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's carbon pricing announcement ...","The head of a new national climate change institute says she is ""perturbed"" by a recent partisan attack from the office of Ontario Premier Doug Ford.

The new institute, called the Pan-Canadian Expert Collaboration, is meant to hold Ottawa to account on its policies to reduce carbon pollution. The eligibility requirements for the competitive process that established it were that Ottawa would play “no role” in its governance, operations, board or activities.

But on Tuesday, David Tarrant, Ford’s executive director of strategic communications said that description was all “Liberal spin.” In a tweet, Tarrant cast a skeptical eye on the institute’s independence, calling it an “elite pro-carbon tax ‘institute’” that contained “puppets.”

Ford's office declined to cite any evidence to back up its claim that the new climate change accountability institute was biased.

Now, two leaders at the new group are speaking out, saying they have no intention of being “partisan.” They pointed to guardrails they say will ensure any federal government stays out of their affairs.

“I did not join this institute and agree to initially lead it unless I was assured that this would be independent, and arms-length,” Kathy Bardswick told National Observer Wednesday.

“In terms of its independence, I’m perturbed by this tweet. Yes, it’s being funded by way of startup by the feds, but it’s independently governed, and that governance structure is robust,” she said.

“We really need to change this dialogue (on climate change), move it away from this partisan starting point to one that is well grounded, credibly supported, inclusive, representing interests from coast to coast to coast, generating the kind of positive discussion that is absolutely essential.”

'The institute is not about partisan politics'

As a sustainability and insurance expert, Bardswick is the former president and CEO of The Co-operators Group, a major Canadian insurance co-op. According to a bio at Foresters Financial, she has been underwriting supervisor and regional vice president of the general insurance company at the Co-operators, and held multiple chief operating officer roles there as well.

Bardswick also sat on the government’s North American Free Trade Agreement Council on the Environment, alongside two former premiers, the former president of Shell Canada and others. The body was formed in 2017 to advise Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna on the environmental protections Ottawa was seeking in the trade talks to replace NAFTA.

She will be joined at the institute by Nancy Olewiler, an environmental economist and the director of the School of Public Policy at Simon Fraser University. Olewiler has been an adviser to that school’s Adaptation to Climate Change Team.

“The institute is not about partisan politics, but finding viable and effective policy solutions to sustain Canada's long-term prosperity,” Olewiler told National Observer.

“The new institute consists of academics from across Canada who are experts in their respective fields with long track records of producing highly credible evidence-based research,” she said.

“We have a robust governance framework that is independent of whomever is the federal government of the day. We want to get on with dealing with the significant issues that face our country and affect our future and intend to do so.”

The eligibility requirements stated that the institute must put in place a board of directors that would be responsible for its “management, strategic direction and financial accountability” as well as reporting requirements like a corporate plan, annual reports and audited financial statements.

These details would be hammered out in a contribution agreement signed between the institute and Environment and Climate Change Canada “within 60 business days of the notification of approval.” Bardswick said that agreement is still “a work in progress.”

McKenna said the institute will be ""eligible to receive up to $20 million over five years"" to implement its vision. The details of how that funding will be transferred are also still being worked out.

The board will have “fiduciary and strategic oversight guided by three expert panels,” Bardswick said. The institute is expected to have three main areas of focus: clean growth, adaptation and mitigation.

Tories in Ottawa terminated previous watchdog

Bardswick’s former workplace, The Co-operators Group, is no stranger to climate change-driven extreme weather events. Last August, it made its storm surge insurance coverage available to homeowners in New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador and Prince Edward Island for the first time, after Atlantic Canada was hit with significant flooding.

About three-quarters of insurance companies in Canada have introduced overland flood insurance as weather patterns change, the Insurance Bureau has said. Blair Feltmate, the head of a climate adaptation centre at the University of Waterloo, who is another leader at the new institute, said flooding is the number one cost to Canada, relative to extreme weather risk driven by climate change.

A major peer-reviewed scientific report released this month showed Canada is warming at double the average rate of the planet, and that the majority of this warming is likely caused by human activities like burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas, which release heat-trapping carbon pollution. The report showed climate change is heightening the risk of extreme heat waves, wildfires, floods and declining freshwater availability in Canada.

""Scenarios with limited warming will only occur if Canada and the rest of the world reduce carbon emissions to near zero early in the second half of the century and reduce emissions of other greenhouse gases substantially,"" it stated.

The Canadian government has previously funded a non-partisan and independent research organization that tackled similar issues. The National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy was created by the Tory government of former prime minister Brian Mulroney in 1988, but later shut down through a decision by the Harper government to terminate its $5 million in annual funding in 2012.

Shortly after, former environment minister Peter Kent suggested that the then-Conservative government could get similar advice from the internet and other research organizations, while former foreign affairs minister John Baird suggested that the government had no need for more reports about a carbon tax.

Asked about the institute Tuesday, Ford's director of media relations Simon Jefferies said ""elite economists may sit in their ivory towers and lecture hard-working families about the need to make everything more expensive, but they will never understand the struggle of counting the pennies and living paycheque to paycheque.""

""Supporting a carbon tax may win you brownie points in the faculty lounge or win the praise of jet-setting Hollywood elites, but it is not the only way to fight climate change,” he said. He pointed to the provincial government’s environment plan, which he claimed will meet federal carbon pollution reduction targets “without imposing a punishing, job-killing carbon tax on already stretched taxpayers.""

Jefferies was asked twice whether he has any evidence to back up Tarrant’s claim that the institute contains puppets. “My previous statement stands,” he said Wednesday, referring to his comments on “elites.”

On Wednesday, National Observer also asked federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer on Parliament Hill what he thought of the new institute, and whether he considered it a waste of money.

But instead of addressing this question directly, Scheer pointed to the backlash the government received over a $12-million federal contribution by McKenna to Loblaws to help make refrigerators in hundreds of their stores more energy efficient. The controversy arose because the company had hundreds of millions of dollars in net earnings last year.

“When you look at what the government’s been spending money on — the $12 million to a private company that has made hundreds of millions of dollars in profit, giving $12 million to Loblaws — while at the same time, charging Canadians higher fuel costs, higher home heating costs, we disagree with this government’s approach both to taxing Canadians and to their inaction on climate change,” Scheer said.

It's not clear whether the institute could pursue its activities beyond 2019, if a new government is elected that cancels its funding.",Head of new national climate institute is 'perturbed' by tweet from Doug Ford's office,National Observer,https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/04/11/news/head-new-national-climate-institute-perturbed-tweet-doug-fords-office
76,Canada,2019-04-11T17:15:00.0000000Z,"Andrew Scheer’s Conservative Party is setting itself up to run against ... “In your opinion, which of Canada’s major political parties is most favoured by the mainstream news media?”","Andrew Scheer’s Conservative Party is setting itself up to run against a familiar foe in the upcoming election: the media.

In recent weeks the party mailed a survey to Tory donors, signed by the party’s campaign director Hamish Marshall, asking them to rank major Canadian newspapers and TV stations — the Globe & Mail, Toronto Star, the Sun papers, Global, City, CTV, CBC and the National Post — based on the outlets’ perceived ideological leanings: “left of centre,” “neutral/balanced,” or “right of centre.”

The mail-out, sent to supporters as a pitch to kick in monthly donations to the party, further asks: “In your opinion, which of Canada’s major political parties is most favoured by the mainstream news media?”

A party spokesman confirmed the authenticity of the questionnaire.

“It was about raising funds for our campaign, and gathering supporters feedback on where and how they consume media, and their personal perceptions,” said party communications director Cory Hann. He added that the appeal for donations was spurred by the Liberal Party’s proposed support program for Canadian media outlets — a program that would be administered by an arms-length body, to avoid possible political favouritism.

Beyond surveying supporters’ news diet, the mail-out asks whether the party should “bypass” the news media and instead hone “an aggressive social media strategy to communicate with people directly in their homes or on their mobile devices” and whether the party “should focus on direct voter contact … that will allow us to take our message to voters unfiltered.”

It also asks whether the campaign should prioritize local and community media outlets, and invest more in advertising and a “sophisticated ground game” in order to “counter the efforts of pro-media news organizations.”

In your opinion, which of Canada’s major political parties is most favoured by the mainstream news media?

The direct-mail appeal to donors included a letter from Marshall, but the party refused to provide it to the Post.

While the Conservative Party is no stranger to taking aim at perceived bias in the media, the proliferation of hyper-partisan, conspiratorial and outright hateful online news outlets has made such tactics a riskier proposition.

As he pummelled the New York Times and CNN, Donald Trump enjoyed almost relentlessly flattering coverage from alt-right websites like Breitbart, Infowars, and the Gateway Pundit — and he, in turn, used them to relay his message to his base. He hired Breitbart co-founder Steve Bannon to apply his sharp-elbowed media tactics to the Republican presidential campaign. In so doing, though, he may have emboldened the likes of Infowars, which promotes baseless conspiracy theories including that the American government carried out the 9/11 attacks and that a 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School that killed 20 children and six adults was a hoax. Infowars has been removed from numerous platforms, including YouTube and Twitter, for promulgating hate speech.

Scheer appointed Marshall as his campaign director for the upcoming election despite controversy over Marshall’s connections to Rebel Media, an ideological cousin of Breitbart.

Marshall ran a digital strategy company, Torch Agency, from Rebel’s Toronto office, where he also ran Scheer’s leadership campaign. While with Rebel, where he was a corporate director, Marshall and Torch helped design its outreach strategies, which included aggressively microtargeting possible supporters and donors with issue-specific campaigns — a tactic he appears to have made use of in the Conservative Party as well. Often, that outreach involved attacking the mainstream media as untrustworthy.

Though a longtime Conservative strategist, Marshall’s close association with Rebel Media prompted questions, including over Scheer’s own involvement with the media organization.

Scheer made several appearances on The Rebel, but in August 2017 he announced he would no longer grant interviews to the outlet after Rebel host Faith Goldy appeared on a neo-Nazi podcast while in Virginia to cover a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, at which one person was killed. Rebel fired Goldy amid the ensuing controversy.

The questionnaire asks supporters to what extent they agree with the statements: “The mainstream Canadian media spend too much time covering left-wing social justice issues and not enough time reporting on the economy or international affairs,” and “When union leaders who represent news media workers attack Conservatives, it creates an undeniable conflict of interest.”

The party spokesperson elaborated that the mailer was referencing Jerry Dias, the president of Unifor, who has been openly critical of the Conservative Party. Unifor represents a number of newsrooms, although they represent a small fraction of the union’s 300,000-plus members.

Who will bravely pipe up about the need to widen a base that ...","Given the current morass of Brexit, it’s hard to remember that Theresa May was once an agent of change inside the British Conservative Party.

First elected in the Labour landslide of 1997, May took over as chair of her party in the summer of 2002, in the wake of a second electoral drubbing by Labour’s Tony Blair, the then-young and clued-in purveyor of “Cool Britannia.”

Staring a generation of political wilderness in the face, May took a look at her twice-battered rump of a party and spoke a few home truths at its annual convention.

“There’s a lot we need to do in this party of ours,” May urged. “Our base is too narrow and so, occasionally, are our sympathies. You know what some people call us – the Nasty Party.”

And while May’s analysis went down like a cup of cold sick in the room, the message was eventually taken to heart. David Cameron’s leadership largely succeeded in repositioning the party as pro-environment, pro-minority and pro-moderate. Well, until Brexit anyway.

Which brings us to the question at hand: Who is the Conservative Party of Canada’s Theresa May? Who will bravely pipe up about the need to widen a base that, while uber-reliable, isn’t exactly trending in the direction of modern Canada?

The answer should be Andrew Scheer, but the Tory leader has been slow off his mark on questions of nastiness since becoming leader. Every time Scheer can’t say “Muslim” in the wake of a slaughter, or finds himself at the same events as Faith Goldy, or leads the charge against meaningless UN migration compacts, a little piece of the accessible vote dies. The Tory leader always looks like he would rather be somewhere else when placed in the middle of a difficult conversation.

This discomfort is what happens when the primary concern is keeping your natives from getting restless. At some point, however, Scheer will have to treat his party membership as a foundation instead of a roof. There are only 250,000 or so CPC members, compared with the roughly 5.5 million people who voted Conservative in 2015, which itself is still a long way from the nearly seven million who voted for Justin Trudeau. Speaking to that delta population of 1.5 million ought to be a priority.

Who will bravely pipe up about the Tories’ need to widen a base that, while uber-reliable, isn’t exactly trending in the direction of modern Canada?

But how to broaden the coalition is the discussion the Conservative Party ducked in its last leadership race by limiting the contest to the slim and unrepresentative segment of society already in possession of a party membership card. And it’s the discussion the Conservative Party will want to avoid at the very moment Justin Trudeau is running the gauntlet on SNC-Lavalin. But the party needs to tackle the question head-on before the country goes to the polls this autumn.

The pressures are two-fold.

On the one hand, we have Maxime Bernier – i.e. the man who lost to Scheer by a margin so thin Trudeau would feel comfortable hanging his latest SNC defence on it – courting the nativist elements of the Conservative Party’s support. And on the other, we have a wounded and desperate Trudeau and his Liberal Party who will be searching for every bit of white nationalist hate they can scrape off the internet to affix to Scheer. The Tory leader needs to move before they can tar him.

Yes, Bernier will be condescending and shameless in response. And yes, the Liberal tactics will be pathetic and desperate. But their criticism will be pushing on an open door.

Stephen Harper and Peter MacKay created the Conservative Party of Canada in the wake of Theresa May’s “nasty party” speech and quickly set about their own plan to make sure the label didn’t stick in Canada.

Harper quickly ruled out revisiting abortion. A gay marriage vote was brought forward when it was certain to lose. Immigrant communities were courted and celebrated. The government then did its job so well it received two more mandates. The nastiness label was traded in for competence.

But by the end of the third go-round, the nastiness had soaked back in and become the narrative. Snitch lines, burqa bans and relentless political attacks were then rebuffed by sunny ways. There’s a reason Trudeau still uses Harper as his favourite curse word: it sells.

The proxy issues for nastiness at the moment are white nationalism and climate. Scheer needs to be unequivocal in his condemnation of the former and much more detailed in his policy toward the latter. He needs to tell people like Ezra Levant to jog on and tell people like Michael Chong to come forward. And, while he’s at it, he should ban his MPs from calling people a piece of poo emoji on Twitter.

Because SNC is the gift that forces Trudeau into nasty. Scheer should counter with his own version of sunny ways.

The United Conservative Party leader, likely to become premier of Alberta in elections next week, is promising lawsuits, boycotts and tax cuts to revive an oil industry under siege. Whether he can do much to solve the sector’s intractable problems, many of which are beyond his control, remains to be seen.

Kenney’s bid to reinvigorate Alberta’s oil industry -- which has suffered from a chronic pipeline shortage that’s led to low crude prices and a dearth of international investment -- will have national and global implications. The province churns out about four-fifths of Canada’s oil, an industry that accounts for 10 percent of the nation’s economy and 20 percent of its exports. The province’s 3.7 million barrels of daily production put it roughly on par with the United Arab Emirates.

“We mean business -- we’re no longer going to roll over and apologize and accept policies that damage our economy,” Kenney, 50, a former federal cabinet minister who leads the newly formed UCP, told reporters in Calgary on Tuesday. Most polls give Kenney a comfortable lead over Premier Rachel Notley and her New Democratic Party for the April 16 vote.

Pipeline Stalled

Kenney’s biggest challenge will be to get a pipeline built to ensure the increased oil-sands production planned for the next 50 years can get to market. Though he’s lashed out at Notley for failing to make much progress on new lines, the reality is that Canada hasn’t had a major crude oil pipeline built in about a decade. Notley is hardly the only one to blame.

TransCanada’s Corp.’s Keystone XL has been stalled for a decade by environmental protests and lawsuits in the U.S., while its Energy East project to the Atlantic Coast was dropped after opposition in Quebec. Kinder Morgan Inc., meanwhile, abandoned its Trans Mountain pipeline expansion to the Pacific Coast due to protests and legal challenges in British Columbia. Justin Trudeau’s government stepped in to buy it last year, though little progress has been made.

Despite Kenney’s fiery claims to get a pipeline built for Alberta, in the end it requires federal approval through the National Energy Board, not to mention tacit approval from other provinces, cities and indigenous groups.

“The biggest thing is always pipelines, and for that you need the federal government and the provinces to cooperate,” Laura Lau, who helps manage C$1.6 billion ($1.2 billion) in assets at Brompton Corp. in Toronto, said in an interview. “That’s the No. 1 issue, and there’s only so much Alberta can do on its own.”

Kenney is counting on a new pipeline to revive investment in the sector, which plunged by almost half between 2014 and 2017, as Canadian firms curbed spending and foreign operators including Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Marathon Oil Corp. pulled out in favor of lower-cost, lower-emissions areas.

The UCP election platform released last week says a Kenney government’s first bill will scrap the C$30-a-ton carbon tax Notley implemented after her surprise victory in 2015. He estimates the repeal will amount to a C$1.4 billion tax cut that will create jobs, save families money and put Alberta’s energy sector on a level playing field with other jurisdictions.

If Trudeau’s federal government imposes a carbon tax on Alberta, as it has in other provinces that haven’t put forth their own plan, Kenney plans to sue to stop the imposition.

Carbon Moves

Even here, Kenney’s power to make changes will be limited. Other provinces in the same situation, including Ontario and Manitoba, have pledged to take the Trudeau government to court. In the meantime, consumers in those regions started paying a carbon tax on April 1.

Kenney’s platform acknowledges energy industry emissions are contributing to climate change and says his party is committed to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. His solution is to require large emitters to reduce intensity by 10 percent, purchase credits from other facilities or pay into a fund to develop emissions-reducing technologies.

Provincial Boycott

Kenney -- who served as immigration minister under Stephen Harper’s Conservative government from 2008 to 2013 -- is also threatening to have Alberta cease doing business with banks that boycott energy projects, cut oil shipments to provinces that fight pipeline development, and press Trudeau to kill Bill C-69, which overhauls the approval process for pipelines.

If the bill isn’t scrapped and if there isn’t substantial progress on the construction of a pipeline to the coast, Kenney plans to hold a referendum on removing equalization payments from the Constitution Act. Never mind that so-called equalization payments, in which the government in Ottawa transfers money to poorer provinces, is a federal program.

Kenney’s ire won’t be aimed solely at Trudeau. His C$30 million “war room” will combat misinformation about Alberta’s energy industry, and his government will challenge the charitable status of groups that campaign against the sector.

Crude-by-Rail

While most of those proposals will find easy support in the industry, he may receive push back on one idea: scrapping the current government’s plan to invest C$3.7 billion to add 120,000 barrels of crude-by-rail capacity. Kenney says the private market will invest to solve the problem and that the government shouldn’t risk taxpayer money.

Deloitte analyst Andrew Botterill said last week that scrapping the plan could cause a drop in local heavy crude prices, which have gained almost 90 percent this year to more than $55 a barrel, near the highest in almost a year.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says

“Wider spreads for Western Canada Select crude and an easing of Alberta production cuts will be needed to drive growth in Canadian crude-by-rail volume in 2019.”- -Lee Klaskow, Adam Roszkowski, transportation analysts Click here to view the piece.

Notley says Kenney’s plan imperils Alberta’s energy industry by isolating it from the rest of the country. She plans to continue pushing for changes to Bill C-69, pressing the federal government to speed construction of the Trans Mountain expansion and encouraging more local refining and upgrading.

“When you are leading a province, when you have an obligation to represent all people in the province, you need to take a determined, informed, strategic, forceful approach to advocating your position,” Notley, 54, said in Calgary on Tuesday.

Beyond the energy industry, Kenney plans to cut the business tax rate to 8 percent from 12 percent over four years. Even while cutting taxes and maintaining operating spending at current levels, he plans to balance the budget within his first term. Alberta is projected to run a C$6.93 billion deficit for the fiscal year that just ended.

Lau said most energy industry executives probably would prefer a Kenney victory because he might cut regulations and speed approvals for new oil wells. The Brompton portfolio manager is skeptical either leader can dramatically improve the situation for the sector, which has been battered by forces beyond Alberta’s borders.

“If it appears Alberta is a friendlier place to do business, that should help,” Lau said. “But even if approvals for wells are faster, there’s no point if you can’t put in a pipeline.”

Good morning. Wendy Cox here.

There has been no mention of “sunny ways” during this Alberta election campaign.

The optimistic phrase was originally used by Sir Wilfrid Laurier in 1895 and picked up again in 2015 by another Liberal leader, Justin Trudeau. It was a call for a new, more positive way of doing politics. The phrase is now being mocked, given the federal Liberals’ troubles in Ottawa around the SNC-Lavalin matter.

Story continues below advertisement

In Alberta, though, a phrase hasn’t been coined to describe the darkness of the two leading campaigns.

United Conservative Party’s Jason Kenney has hammered a message to voters of a dismal economy wrought by the provincial NDP and a scornful and neglectful betrayal of Albertans at the hands of the federal Liberals. A second term for the NDP’s Rachel Notley, he has maintained, would deepen the economic slump. Mr. Kenney has argued he is the warrior Alberta needs to reassert the province’s might.

For her part, Ms. Notley, who is trailing in the polls, has campaigned hard to cast Mr. Kenney as an intemperate social conservative with a long-standing aversion to gay rights. She has warned that her opponent’s economic plan will transfer wealth from workers to their bosses.

The week, The Globe has published profiles of the two leaders.

Justin Giovannetti paints a vivid picture of the uphill battle Ms. Notley is fighting. She is armed with popular opinion in her favour: Poll respondents consistently put her personal popularity above that of Mr. Kenney. But liking her and voting for her appear to be two different things. She is beset by economic woes, a pipeline project that remains stalled and as a result, an unfulfilled bargain with Albertans that in exchange for accepting a carbon tax to combat climate change, the NDP would ensure Alberta realized a pipeline to take more of its oil and gas to wider markets.

Mr. Giovannetti writes: “She has presented the election as a choice between helping the rich – with Mr. Kenney’s largest spending promise to cut corporate taxes by a third – and taking care of everyone else. It builds on a time in office that saw her focus her efforts on social spending, along with raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and enacting tough new labour laws.”

James Keller’s portrait of Mr. Kenney, published today, reveals a man of more nuance than his opponents might portray. Mr. Kenney, Mr. Keller writes, has been steeped in political action and conservative causes since his time at university.

Story continues below advertisement

Mr. Kenney attended the University of San Francisco, a private Jesuit school in a city he later described as “Sodom by the Sea.” He spent his time there as part of a debate club called the Philhistorians, writing for the student newspaper, The Foghorn, and as one of the school’s most vocal opponents of abortion and gay rights.

But Bernie Farber, a former CEO of the Canadian Jewish Congress, told Mr. Keller that Mr. Kenney was a study in opposites.

On the one hand, Mr. Kenney earned his respect while working on files such as an international Holocaust education project and seemed to embrace new Canadians. But he said Mr. Kenney was also responsible for some of the Harper government’s more alarming policies involving minorities, in particular refugees and Muslims.

“At one point in his career, he did and said not just the right things but the morally correct things to do in relation to human rights,” said Mr. Farber, whose Canadian Anti-Hate Network has been critical of the UCP.

“And then, at the flip of a switch, it would be like we had a different Jason Kenney.”

AROUND THE WEST

Fort Mac isn’t so sure about Kenney:

Fort McMurray should deliver some of the safest seats for Alberta’s United Conservative Party when voters head to the polls on April 16. But as Jana G. Pruden reported, despite a strong local fondness for conservative politics there’s deep apprehension in the heart of the oil sands about what kind of premier Jason Kenney would make.

Mr. Kenney’s social conservatism has rubbed some voters the wrong way, with continuing issues surrounding his party’s views on gay-straight alliances in schools. Other voters say they’re thankful for NDP Leader Rachel Notley’s support during and after the 2016 wildfires.

It’s time to talk about Red Deer:

Red Deer is Alberta’s middle child, the proud city midway on the highway between Calgary and Edmonton that is so often overlooked as its other siblings hog all the attention. Jana G. Pruden also went to Red Deer and she found a city whose citizens want politicians to focus on them and their local issues for a change.

A long-delayed hospital expansion is a ballot box issue in Alberta’s third-largest city, where serious health problems can often require transport to Calgary or Edmonton. George “Joe” Smith told Ms. Pruden about his 150-kilometre ride in an ambulance while he suffered a heart attack. “Why didn’t they do something in the last 10 years?” he said.

Money laundering:

A retired senior Mountie enlisted by the B.C. government to look into money laundering in the province has revealed that there are only five RCMP officers in British Columbia tasked with investigating the crime. Peter German’s latest report notes that their numbers are so low – there are supposed to be 25 of them – that rather than pursue criminal charges against the international criminals that have set up shop in the province, the Mounties are referring cases to the Civil Forfeiture office.

Although the office can seize the proceeds of the suspected criminals’ ill-gotten gains without laying charges, the office cannot send the accused to trial.

“Both civil forfeiture and criminal [prosecutions] have a part to play in this, but one in the absence of the other is not good,” Mr. German said in a phone interview Tuesday.

Indigenous development:

Vancouver city reporter Frances Bula exclusively writes that the Squamish First Nation has plans to develop 3,000 apartments on land at the foot of the Burrard Bridge, a main artery into the city’s downtown. It would be the largest urban development of its kind by an Indigenous group.

Although some residents in the Kitsilano neighbourhood have opposed housing developments in the past, this one will be different: The land is part of the Squamish Nation’s reserve and they are not bound by city zoning laws.

Squamish council member Khelsilem, who was authorized to talk about the Squamish project on behalf of the nation, said there have been some informal talks with city officials about the development. He said the development will provide an economic development opportunity for his nation’s 4,000 members. As well, the Squamish are considering making the development’s units rentals, which could help Vancouver with its acute shortage.

The nation has already selected the developer, although Khelsilem would not reveal the company. Nation members are being asked for their approval for the plans in a referendum.

Breaking the ice ceiling:

Politicians might be slagging each other on the airwaves, but Albertans have a refuge: The Calgary Flames have come off a fantastic season, they are in the playoffs and the Saddledome is packed. Even Edmonton Oilers fans, after watching their team fail to qualify again, have something to cheer for in Joanne Kuzoff, reports Marty Klinkenberg.

Ms. Kuzoff is one of only two women who drive a Zamboni full-time in the NHL and she will make her playoff debut Saturday as the Flames face the Colorado Avalanche. “It can be a boys club, but it doesn’t have to be,” she told Mr. Klinkenberg.

She worked her way up from small municipal arenas in Ontario, learning how to pilot four tonnes of steel blades and hot water in an ice ballet watched by tens of thousands. Now she’s in the big leagues.

Opinion:

Campbell Clark writes on how Alberta’s biggest climate change challenge isn’t Justin Trudeau, its Ontario Premier Doug Ford: “The Ford government’s position is that Canada should meets its emissions-reductions targets, but that Ontario is doing more than its fair share.

The Liberals say they're concerned about the framing of the event, but also say it's ""quite clearly an attempt to sell access to power,"" in the letter obtained by CTV News.

The event, scheduled in North York, Ont. next week, includes the tagline: ""healthcare reimagined, it’s time for change."" Based on the wording of the event website it appears geared towards people who work in the health-care field.

The fundraiser is being hosted by the Conservative candidate for Don Valley West, Ont. Yvonne Robertson, and was initially described as a policy forum and cocktail reception with Conservative MPs Pierre Poilievre, or ""our next finance minister"" as the event describes, and Marilyn Gladu, ""our next health minister.""

However, the reference to the two MPs as potential future ministers was removed after CTV News approached Robertson's campaign for comment.

""There is only one person that decides cabinet, and that’s the Prime Minister of Canada. As an opposition party, we have Shadow Ministers, not a cabinet, and referencing them as anything else is not representative of their actual position. That has been changed,"" Robertson's campaign said in an email.

The letter to Scheer—sent before the event webpage was amended—said that it’s ""alarming"" that the party is promoting attendees' ability to be able to bend the ears of Poilievre and Gladu, who are described as future ministers.

""That was one of the least offensive parts,"" Rob Oliphant, the Liberal MP who currently represents the riding, told CTV News after learning that the event description had been amended. He said regardless, the event is still troubling and should be cancelled. ""It's still cash for access,"" Oliphant said, because it is inviting people to donate to the Conservative Party to be able to help shape their policy.

He was one of the seven MPs—who all are either doctors, or represent GTA ridings—who signed the letter.

The event also lists deputy Conservative Party leader Lisa Raitt, MP Peter Kent, and senators Linda Frum and Nicole Eaton, as well as others who will be there to hear ideas about improving the Canadian health-care system related to small businesses and modernizing the Canada Health Act.

""Let us know how the current healthcare system affects your practice and which policy changes you think would have the greatest positive impact on you and your patients,"" the event page reads.

Nowhere in the event listing is privatizing health care stated, though the Liberals are calling on Scheer to ""prove you support public health care, by immediately cancelling this event.""

Oliphant said he found it ""worrisome"" that the event description states that health policy should be ""shaped heavily"" by ""dedicated practitioners."" Oliphant said that while doctors and nurses should be involved, so too should patients and public health officials.

In an effort to counter the event, he's planned an open townhall earlier in the week, featuring Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor.

""The concept that the business of health care comes over the patient outcomes… that's what worries me,"" Oliphant said. ""Health care is not a business, health care is about life and death.""

In response to the Liberals’ concerns about privatization and framing of health care as a business, Robertson's campaign spokesperson Matthew Poon said that the event was designed ""to bring together small business owners like doctors who were unfairly targeted by Justin Trudeau’s small business tax hikes and discuss ways to help them better deliver health services within the principles of the Canada Health Act.""

""Conservatives have always and will always support the principles of the Canada Health Act,"" the statement said.

After coming under fire, largely from the Conservatives, for holding ""cash for access"" events — where for sizeable donations, guests could rub shoulders with the prime minister or members of his cabinet—the Liberals changed the rules to set up more transparency around these events.

The new political fundraising laws came into effect at the end of 2018, requiring parties to advertise fundraisers in advance, and report back afterwards, if they're charging $200 or more per ticket and featuring the prime minister, cabinet ministers, party leaders, or party leadership candidates.

So at this critical juncture ...","The ghastly attacks on two mosques in New Zealand recently show that the rise of far-right extremism has not only proven itself to be a major global threat to peace and security, but also an existential threat to conservatism itself, which has come under heavy fire for breeding, or at least tolerating in its ranks, xenophobic elements.

In a way, the New Zealand attacks may prove to become a pivotal moment for the right-wing.

Though the racism of far-right extremism has long been identified as something real and dangerous, it has also, to a large extent, remained under the radar; something ugly simmering under the surface.

But after 50 people (nearly all visible minorities) were slaughtered at a house of worship, in a modern western nation deemed to be one of the safest in the world, that ugliness has boiled over for the world to see.

What’s now clear is that it’s past time for conservatives to utterly separate themselves from any notion or any segment of their membership base that ascribes even remotely to xenophobic or Islamophobic views. It should go without saying that conservatism is a movement in which racists are not welcome. Unfortunately, this is a message that must now be shouted by conservatives across the world, including here in Canada, where anti-immigrant views have, as of late, begun to stain the brand.

After the New Zealand mosque attack, the leader of the People’s Party of Canada refused to offer comment (even to denounce it). Similarly, the leader of the Conservative Party’s first statement focused on how “freedom” had come under attack (not Muslims), needing a second try to get it right. The delay left the impression that the Conservative Party feared alienating a kind of voter who may hold anti-immigrant views.

Both parties have also been skeptical of Canada’s signing of the UN’s Global Compact for Migration. The Conservatives have argued that it will erode the sovereignty of our borders, while the PPC says it will open the doors to masses of migrants from poor countries. Both claims seem geared toward stoking fear among anti-immigration voters, and contrary to the reality of the massive value of immigration.

Of course, south of the border, the president of the United States has openly fraternized with far right and white supremacists while routinely raising fears about immigrants, whether it’s about building a wall to keep out Mexicans or imposing a travel ban to keep out Muslims.

It’s as if an element of the right has forgotten, or perhaps has simply not truly understood, that there is a huge difference between “nationalism” and “nation building”.

“Nationalism” as we understand it today, is increasingly a movement based on bigotry and fear-based racism—one that’s often associated with populist far right movements in Europe that have ridden a wave of anti-migrant sentiment. “Nation building” however, is a very different and noble cause; one that is about wanting to make your country great—it is not to be associated with the pettiness of racism, bigotry or Islamophobia at all.

There needs to be a refocus on positive conservatism, a movement that embraces immigration and minorities. After all, immigration is what made the U.S. the dominant power in the world, by welcoming and nurturing the best minds to fuel technology and ingenuity. (Immigrants contribute 10 per cent of America’s annual GDP and are, according to the Brookings Institution, more likely to become Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, and physiology or medicine.)

We’ve seen the immense benefits of immigration here as well, but there’s a lot more potential we have yet to tap into. And conservative thinking should be obsessed with wanting to build Canada up to reach its true greatness.

Conservatism at its best is a movement that champions individual liberties and fiscal responsibility; small government and social values. Campassionate conservatives also believe in helping others, be they refugees or fellow citizens. It’s also important to remember that in the Conservative Party of Canada’s recent past, during the time of Stephen Harper, Canada recorded record high immigration and was focused on winning over immigrant communities.

So at this critical juncture, what is stopping Canadian conservatives from building a party that embraces open doors and offers a safe haven to the world’s most needy, while making Canada an economic powerhouse? Nothing. Because most right of centre voters in Canada are welcoming to refugees and immigrants and would welcome the economic growth and innovation they bring.

This is what the new conservatism, a positive conservatism, can look like. It’s got to be about nation building, not nationalism. It’s got to be about achieving the best for Canada, in a way that includes everybody, and cuts at the root of far-right extremism. It’s time to make a separation between racist nationalism, and the positive, inclusive patriotism of nation building.

Canada's most populous province and industrial powerhouse is projected to run a deficit of C$10.3 ...","By Fergal Smith

TORONTO (Reuters) - Ontario's Conservative government, presenting its first budget on Thursday, forecast a smaller deficit for the Canadian province in the current fiscal year and a return to balance by 2023-24 as it disclosed plans to reverse the growth in spending.

The Progressive Conservative Party, led by populist Doug Ford, won a majority of seats in last June's provincial election, promising greater fiscal prudence than the Liberal Party, which had held power for 15 years.

The budget ""sends a message to the world that we are serious about fiscal sustainability,"" Finance Minister Vic Fedeli told a media briefing.

Canada's most populous province and industrial powerhouse is projected to run a deficit of C$10.3 billion ($7.7 billion) in fiscal 2019-20, which began on April 1, including a C$1 billion reserve. That compares with an estimated deficit of C$11.7 billion in 2018-19.

The 2018-19 deficit was much more than the C$6.7 billion deficit projected by the Liberals in last year's budget, due mostly to accounting adjustments and the cancellation of a cap- and-trade carbon tax by the Conservatives.

But it was smaller than the C$13.5 billion deficit projected in February in a third-quarter update, while the 2023-24 projected timeline to eliminate the deficit was one year ahead of the Liberals' target.

That could soothe bond investors, who had been looking for evidence the Conservatives would tackle the province's heavy debt load. At about C$368 billion, estimated in 2018-19, Ontario has one of the largest sub-sovereign debts in the world.

The province, which has run deficits every year since 2008-09, pays more to borrow than some other major Canadian provinces, such as Quebec and British Columbia, that are running balanced budgets.

""I think it is positive from a market perspective,"" said Derek Burleton, deputy chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank. ""The deficit implementation plan is reasonable, provided it can meet its targets. They are clearly ambitious on spending.""

SLOWER SPENDING GROWTH

The budget, which looked to expand the sale of alcohol and allow tailgating for sporting events, limited overall spending growth to an average annual rate of 1 percent between 2018-19 and 2023-24, much less than inflation.

It included lower spending on children's and social services even as the Conservatives proposed a new dental program for low-income seniors and a new refundable tax credit for childcare costs that would provide up to C$6,000 per child under the age of 7, and a lesser amount for older children.

Like the federal government, Ontario has favored faster write-offs of capital investments rather than corporate tax cuts to bolster competitiveness with the United States.

But a slowdown in the once red-hot housing market and global economic headwinds could increase the fiscal challenges for the province, which accounts for about 40 percent of Canada's economy and is a major exporter of cars and other manufactured products.

The budget projected growth to slow to 1.4 percent in 2019 from 2.2 percent in 2018, while net debt-to-GDP, a key measure of fiscal health, was estimated at 40.2 percent in 2018-19, the second highest among Canada's 10 provinces. It is projected to rise to 40.7 percent in 2019-20, before dipping to 38.6 percent in 2023-24.

CTVNews.ca Staff, with a report from CTV's Alberta Bureau Chief Janet Dirks





Six days before Albertans are set to vote in their provincial election, voter fraud allegations are being levelled against UCP Leader Jason Kenney over his party’s 2017 leadership race.

The RCMP is looking into whether fake email addresses were linked to the names of real people to boost votes in a race that Kenney ultimately won.

Police investigators say they received the information from former UCP MLA Prab Gill. Now, the Office of the Alberta Election Commissioner is also looking into the allegations.

Gill alleges that the fake email addresses were used to intercept PIN codes needed for members to vote in the leadership race.

“(Some) people were signed up and were saying they weren't even members,” Gill alleges.

Kenney has always denied any wrongdoing in that leadership race.

Documents show two pages of names with allegedly fake email addresses attached. Among those names are Albertans Gurwinder Athwal and his wife Sarbjit. Although Athwal confirmed he voted online, his email address is different than the one on the list.

He told CTV News: “I don't know what's going on … nobody wants any trouble.”

Gill himself resigned from the party’s caucus after an internal investigation over allegations of ballot stuffing at that same leadership race.

In a portion of a written statement from the UCP executive, the party's executive director Janice Harrington dismissed the allegations, earlier reported by CBC News. She stressed the party was confident in the integrity of the results.

“We are not going to let allegations from discredited individuals like Happy Mann and Prab Gill distract us from our task of replacing the NDP with a government that will create jobs and get Albertans back to work,” she wrote.

“The entire leadership election process was monitored by the Leadership Election Committee, to which each leadership contestant had representation on, the party's contracted vote service provider, and an independent auditor. No irregularities were identified,” Harrington stated.

She also said the leadership contest “followed the most stringent security protocols of any leadership race conducted in Canada.”

Political scientist Duane Bratttold told CTV News that the allegations of voter fraud would continue long after the election.

“It will have an impact in the long run because there remains Elections Alberta investigation and RCMP investigation -- so I think this story is not going to end on April 16th,” he said. “Those investigations are going to continue.”

Statement from UCP Executive Director Janice Harrington:

The 2017 United Conservative party Leadership contest followed the most stringent security protocols of any leadership race conducted in Canada.

In order to be eligible to register to vote a person had to hold a valid membership on or before September 29, 2017.

Those members then had to register to vote on or before October 13, 2017.

The registration process required that every eligible member provide photo identification with a valid address that matched the address on their membership in order to obtain a PIN. A PIN was not issued unless the member provided the required photo identification.

PINs were delivered in the manner specified by each member at the time they provided their photo ID during the registration process.

The entire leadership election process was monitored by the Leadership Election Committee, to which each leadership contestant had representation on, the Party’s contracted vote service provider, and an independent auditor. No irregularities were identified.

Jason Kenney won the leadership of the United Conservative Party by a margin of 17,287 votes. The United Conservative Party is confident in the integrity of these results.

More than 58,000 votes were cast. Of the 49 allegedly irregular emails identified by the CBC, only 31 are reported to have cast a ballot. The party cannot verify the CBC’s allegations without knowing the identity of the 31 individuals allegedly affected.

An individual who did not provide photo identification would not have been able to vote.

The UCP has been specifically advised by the RCMP that it is not under investigation. We are not in a position to advise what private citizens have been told by the RCMP but we do know that Whitney Issik has been told, like the Party, that she is not the subject of any investigation.

Fifty-seven per cent either somewhat agreed or strongly agreed that a referendum should be held, according to data provided by Vote Compass, a tool designed by Vox Pop Labs for CBC News.

Just nine per cent said they didn't know, 14 per cent remained neutral, and 20 per cent either somewhat or strongly disagreed.

Education levels produced the largest split on whether or not a referendum should be held.

Sixty-two per cent of people with high-school education or below said the province should hold a referendum, and 70 per cent of those with college or trade school education agreed. But while still a majority, the number of university-education respondents who agreed dropped significantly, to just 51 per cent.

(Vote Compass)

Sixty-two per cent of men said they agree with holding a referendum, as did 51 per cent of women.

How does equalization work?

The program is intended to address fiscal disparities between provinces, and was entrenched in Canada's Constitution in 1982.

""Parliament and the government of Canada are committed to the principle of making equalization payments to ensure that provincial governments have sufficient revenues to provide reasonably comparable levels of public services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation,"" the Constitution reads.

It's a myth that Alberta sends money directly to Ottawa for the program. All Canadians pay income tax to the federal government, and then that money is paid out to provinces based on each region's ability to raise revenues compared with the average.

The formula that calculates how much each province gets has been controversial due to how it accounts for natural resource revenues.

For decades, Alberta has received no federal support through equalization payments, while Quebec, for example, is set to receive $13.1 billion in 2019-20.

The payments are unconditional — meaning each province can spend the money it receives as it wishes.

A survey of 1,200 Albertans undertaken by pollster Janet Brown for CBC last spring found 70 per cent think the current equalization payment system is unfair. Half strongly felt it was unfair while, while 20 per cent ""somewhat"" agreed.

Where Alberta's political parties stand

UCP Leader Jason Kenney said he plans to hold a referendum on equalization as a way to hold Ottawa's feet to the fire over getting a coastal pipeline built.

Vote Compass found a whopping 82 per cent of UCP supporters agreed with that policy.

The NDP said in a press release in March that Kenney mischaracterizes how equalization works, and pointed out that Kenney was part of the Conservative government that brought in the current equalization formula in the 2007 budget. Only 32 per cent of NDP supporters said they wanted a referendum.

The party said it supports looking at the formula but believes a referendum would be a dead-end, and also suggested that one of the UCP's equalization proposals could make the Canada Health Act unenforceable in the province.

In June 2018, the federal government announced it would extend the current payment formula until 2024 without negotiating with the provinces, several politicians said. At the time, Alberta's finance minister stated the province's opposition to the decision.

The Liberal platform states that while the equalization formula isn't fair, a ""referendum"" would not give the province power to amend the Constitution.

Instead, the party says it will demand the formula be changed to treat provinces' hydro revenue the same as Alberta oil and gas, and that if those demands aren't met, a Crown corporation will be established to remove energy royalties from equalization formula calculations.

(Vote Compass)

Alberta Party Leader Stephen Mandel has also said he plans to push for changes to what he called an ""unfair equalization program.""

And the Freedom Conservative Party plans to demand an end to equalization and replace all federal transfers with ""tax points.""

Thirty-eight per cent of Liberal supporters agreed with the idea of holding a referendum, as did 58 per cent of Alberta Party supporters. FCP supporters were not included in the Vote Compass data.

""I don't believe there's anything more important than our children and making sure they're properly educated,"" Mandel said during an announcement about the Alberta Party education platform.

The other element of the plan is to expand support for teachers in classrooms, a measure that would be in addition to a previously announced increase in educational assistants.

""We have to have teachers and they have to have support. One of the most significant things I found in dealing with, and talking with, the teachers is that the complexity of classrooms are so different today,"" Mandel said.

""That's why we need these extra supports to make it work. Otherwise it's not the kids who are challenged that aren't getting attention but it's also all the other kids in the class,"" he added.

Mandel would also like to increase the cap on education funding from age 19 to 25, so that more people can complete their high school education.

Other plans include boosting the current inclusive education budget for school boards from $460- to $690-million a year. Mandel's idea is that funding would be used to attract and train teachers from ""under-represented and non-traditional backgrounds"".

The Alberta Party would also work alongside rural school boards to review funding in light of declining enrolment and transportation issues.

Comparing commitments

The Alberta Party's commitment to K-12 education is similar to the NDP promises. Both parties intend to increase education spending to keep up with growing enrolment. If elected, the NDP would provide $1.3 billion to build or modernize 70 schools across Alberta.

NDP leader Rachel Notley has also committed to adding 1,000 new teachers and staff to schools across the province this fall.

In addition, the party would spend $5 million each year to replace 100 aging and outdated playgrounds, plus reduce tuition fees for high school upgrading and English language classes.

For its part, the United Conservative Party plans to replace the current School Act, which includes the NDP bill to strengthen protections for gay-straight alliances under the Education Act.

The UCP's new act would bring changes to the classroom including increased teacher testing, lifting the cap on the number of charter schools in Alberta, and removing principals from the ATA bargaining unit.

The UCP would also review funding for both urban and rural schools.

The party initially released their education platform in March, but since then the UCP has revised two elements of their plan — they would not bring back grade three provincial achievement tests, nor would they reinstate the 50-per-cent weighted diploma exam.","Alberta Party leader pledges to create 60,000 new school spaces for K-12",CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/alberta-party-election-education-plan-1.5094841

Good evening.

The Lead

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is criticizing the Trudeau government for introducing changes to the country’s asylum laws in its nearly 400-page long budget implementation bill without any advance notice, though stopped short of revealing where his party stands on the policy.

The proposed law would prevent asylum seekers from making claims in Canada if they have made similar ones in certain other countries, including the United States. Scheer said its inclusion in the omnibus legislation limits opportunities for study and debate.

“This is a measure that has been slipped into an omnibus bill, that will not be given the scrutiny it deserves on its own,” he told reporters Wednesday. Jolson Lim has more.

In Canada

Only days away from Alberta’s provincial election, CBC News says it has obtained documents showing email addresses fraudulently attached to United Conservative Party memberships were used to cast ballots in the party’s 2017 leadership race won by Jason Kenney.

From a list of over 100,000 UCP members, CBC News selected a sample of 49 email addresses due to “suspicious domains.” Of those, 31 were used to cast votes in the leadership vote. The email addresses were cross-referenced with a list of people registered to vote in the leadership race and a list of those who actually voted.

Former UCP MLA Prab Gill has made allegations in a letter to the RCMP that Kenney’s leadership campaign used fraudulent emails to intercept the personal identification numbers required to vote in the race and then used them to vote for Kenney.

Kenney’s lawyer Steven Dollansky, though, sent a cease and desist letter sent to Gill, calling the allegations “plainly false and defamatory.”

As if this election needed any more intrigue.

The National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls says it will release its final report at a special closing ceremony on June 3. As the Toronto Star reports, the inquiry says the report is already complete and prepared for release before the deadline of April 30 but the federal government has agreed to an extension so it can be translated.

According to a release, the inquiry said the final report will reflect the “sacred truths” of 1,484 participants and 83 experts who testified at hearings and sessions held across the country in 2017 and 2018.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford is committing $11.2 billion to expanding rapid transit services for the Toronto area, including the proposed 15-kilometre light rail “Ontario Line” that would run from Ontario Place in the city’s waterfront to the Ontario Science Centre. As the CBC reports, the Ford government is pegging the cost of the four expansion projects at $26.7 billion, meaning the federal government and the City of Toronto (and likely the neighbouring York Region) would be on the hook for the remaining $17 billion or so.

Aside from the Ontario Line, which will supplant the proposed downtown relief line, the Ford government is committing money to expanding the proposed one-stop Scarborough subway to a three-stop line ($5.5 billion), extending the Yonge-University subway line to Richmond Hill ($5.6 billion) and extending the under-construction Eglinton light-rail line to Toronto Pearson International Airport ($4.7 billion).

As the Toronto Star’s Tonda McCharles reports, the transit proposal is not sitting well with a high-profile Liberal MP who previously served as a city councillor in Toronto.

Adam Vaughan, parliamentary secretary to the Families, Children and Social Development minister (Housing and Urban Affairs), likened the plan to a Simpsons episode, saying Ford took a crayon to draw a transit “fantasy” on a map through downtown Toronto without any consideration given to cost or environmental assessments.

McCharles also reports that Finance Minister Bill Morneau and Infrastructure Minister François-Phillippe Champagne both said Ottawa has already given billions to address infrastructure needs for Ontario, with Morneau saying they need more details on Ford’s plan.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has successfully moved a motion calling on the Senate to pass legislation harmonizing Canadian laws with the UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and requiring sexual assault training for judges.

Singh rose in the House after question period Wednesday to ask his fellow MPs to support sending a message to the Upper Chamber calling for both bills to be “passed into law at the earliest opportunity.” It was unanimously adopted by the House.

The secretive government committee tasked with studying national security and intelligence issues wants to complete a report assessing the threat of foreign interference in Canadian elections before this fall’s federal vote.

The threat of foreign interference in democratic election campaigns has loomed heavily since the 2016 U.S. presidential election, with Canada’s cyber security agency releasing a report earlier this week saying it expects foreign actors to attempt to tamper in the country’s next election.

The assessment being undertaken by the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians is of generalized foreign interference and what measures are in place to counter it. Charlie Pinkerton has this story.

The parliamentary secretary to the public services and procurement minister recently released new numbers showing that nearly 75 per cent of federal public servants were overpaid at least once under the Phoenix system, reports CBC News.

Gatineau MP Steven MacKinnon released the statistics in mid-March in response to a question from Conservative public services critic Kelly McCauley. According to the figures, of the roughly 300,000 workers paid through Phoenix, 223,173 had been overpaid at least once between April 2016 and January 2019.

Long-serving Tory MP Rob Nicholson says he won’t seek re-election in this fall’s vote. The former justice minister said he wants to spend more time with his family after 24 non-consecutive years in Parliament.

“I have been truly blessed to have fulfilled my dream job of serving as a member of Parliament,” he said in a statement. Vigliotti also has this story.

Keeping on the topic of elections, a one-time star Quebec junior hockey player is taking a shot at federal politics.

Angelo Esposito, a former standout for the QMJHL’s Quebec Remparts, is running for the Conservatives in the Montreal-area riding of Alfred-Pellan this fall, reports TVA.

A first pick of the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2007, Esposito never played a game in the NHL and has worked in the real estate field since hanging up his skates at the end of the 2016-17 season. He will face off against Liberal incumbent Angelo Iacono in the riding, where the Tories finished fourth in 2015.

Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears headed for a fourth consecutive term after yesterday’s close legislative election.

Both Netanyahu, leader of the main right-wing party in Israel, and Benny Gantz, the leader of the centrist Blue and White alliance, had initially told their supporters that they won the election.

But as the New York Times reports, Gantz has conceded the race as ballots continue to be counted. He vowed to fight on “in any way I can.”

“The war is not over,” he said.

Observers are also now watching to see if Netanyahu will actually commit to some of his statements during the campaign seen as efforts to win over right-wing voters, according to Al Jazeera. It includes annexing settlements in the West Bank.

“Who says that we won’t do it? We are on the way and we are discussing it,” Netanyahu said last week.

Less than a month after the Christchurch mosque attack, New Zealand’s parliament voted 119-1 to ban military-style semi-automatic weapons.

The country’s leader, Jacinda Ardern, announced swift action in the wake of the attack that left 50 people dead last month. As the BBC reports, she held back tears speaking to Parliament.

“These weapons were designed to kill, and they were designed to maim and that is what they did on the 15th of March,” she said.

A photo of a 22-year-old woman fearlessly speaking to a crowd of protesters holding smartphones in Sudan has captured global attention. As the New York Times reports, the photo of the woman, identified as Alaa Salah, is already being called the “image of the revolution.”

Meanwhile, tens of millions of people will cast their votes in the Indian general election beginning tomorrow. The election has seven phases, spread over more than a month, that will determine who will lead the world’s largest democracy.

As the BBC reports, more than 900 million people are eligible to vote between tomorrow and May 19. Counting day is May 23.

Narendra Modi, the current prime minister and leader of the Hindu nationalist party, will face off against a resurgent left-leaning Indian Congress led by Rahul Gandhi. Unemployment and economic development are among the core issues of this election.

Lastly, the United Kingdom holds its breath as Prime Minister Theresa May awaits a decision by EU countries to delay Brexit beyond this Friday. As the BBC reports, EU leaders are expected to extend beyond May’s desired date of June 30, but with conditions.

Given some of our political and social debates, Wednesday offered a refreshing reminder that we are indeed living in the 21st century.

The National Science Foundation announced earlier today that scientists using a global network of telescopes captured the first-ever picture of a black hole. The image, which is the first direct visual evidence of the existence of black holes, shows a supermassive black hole and its shadow at the centre of a galaxy known as M87, reports CNN.

88,LifeStyle,2019-04-10T13:14:00.0000000Z,"EDMONTON — Albertan workers contribute far more to the Canada Pension Plan than its ... at a time when Jason Kenney’s United Conservative Party is planning, if it wins the election on April ...","EDMONTON — Albertan workers contribute far more to the Canada Pension Plan than its retirees take out, says a new Fraser Institute study, suggesting the rest of the country benefits greatly from the prosperity in Wild Rose Country.

The report comes at a time when Jason Kenney’s United Conservative Party is planning, if it wins the election on April 16, to pick a fight over equalization payments, another federal program to which Albertans contribute disproportionately.

Unlike equalization, though, provinces can opt out of participation in the CPP; Quebec already has.

In 2017, 16.5 per cent of all CPP contributions came from Alberta workers, while just 10.6 per cent of CPP expenditures made their way back to the province. The difference between what was paid in and paid out was $2.9 billion in 2017, the most recent year for which data are available. (Alberta paid in $8.1 billion and received $5.2 billion.) Between 2008 and 2017, Albertans have contributed $27.9 billion more to CPP than retirees in the province have received back.

“What we were trying to do is really use a case study to illustrate the disproportionate contributions Albertans make to national programs,” said Jason Clemens, one of the study’s authors, in an interview on Tuesday.

Ontario is the next highest contributing province in Canada. Over the same period, from 2008 to 2017, Ontario paid in $7.4 billion more than it received back — more than $20 billion less than the loss in Alberta, and that’s in a province with more than 14 million people, compared to Alberta’s roughly four million.

However, Ontario’s fortunes turned around in 2017. The province contributed about $24 billion, but received back about $25 billion.

British Columbia paid in $8.2 billion in 2017, and received back $8 billion.

Were Alberta to drop out of the CPP — which Clemens says they’re not recommending — other provinces would have to pick up the slack by raising individual contribution rates. Were the province to withdraw, Albertans could pay as low as 5.85 per cent into an Alberta pension plan, while the rest of the country would need to up their contributions from 9.9 per cent (the 2017 contribution rate) to 10.6 per cent, the study says. The federal government already raised the contribution rate (shared equally by employers and employees) to 10.2 per cent in January, and plan to increase it to 11.9 per cent by 2023.

There are three main reasons why Albertans pay more into CPP than what retirees get out of it. More Albertans are of working age — between 15 and 64 — compared to the province’s overall population, than in other provinces in Canada.

Among that group, there are traditionally higher employment rates in Alberta. “Which means they have a higher share of the population that’s working,” Clemens said.

And, as is a partial explanation for higher equalization contributions, Albertans simply make more money than workers in other provinces, so the province has more contributions per worker. What the study does, Clemens said, is point out to the rest of Canada the contributions Alberta makes to federal programming, and it helps explain why Albertans feel left behind by the federal government and other provinces.

“The hope would be back to the discussion of, there’s a give and take,” Clemens said. “The rising frustration in Western Canada, particularly in Alberta, is legitimate, in terms of what is the balance right now of the give and take?”

FORT MCMURRAY, Alta. – United Conservative Leader Jason Kenney took his pro-pipeline message to the heart of Alberta’s oilpatch Wednesday and promised to push back on policies he said are hollowing out Canada’s core industry.

Kenney told supporters at a rally in Fort McMurray that a UCP government would fight B.C. and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government if they continued to impede the oil sector.

Kenney has promised he would go to court to fight proposed federal legislation on how projects are assessed as both unconstitutional and as a major deterrent to future megaprojects.

He has also said he would proclaim legislation giving Alberta the power to reduce oil shipments to B.C. if that province continued to delay the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion from Alberta to the west coast.

Premier Rachel Notley has criticized Kenney’s approach as needlessly antagonistic and has said his plans could see Trans Mountain derailed just as shovels are ready to turn the ground on the pipeline.

Kenney says Notley’s failure to push back harder on Trans Mountain is the reason it remains in limbo.

“The NDP sold Alberta out to the Trudeau Liberals – and we won’t let that happen again,” Kenney said Wednesday to the cheers of supporters.

According to Global News, several fake signs mocking the United Conservative Party have popped up in Calgary, promoting candidates like ""Lake of Fire"" and ""Another Bozo.""","An Alberta Party candidate in the province's upcoming election says his recent interaction with a landlord and prospective voters was a ""slap in the face"" to democracy.

Gar Gar told HuffPost Canada he was door-knocking in Calgary's Penbrooke neighbourhood on Wednesday when he ran into a man and a woman who said they supported his campaign. The man told Gar he wanted him to meet his mother and took the candidate back to their house.

Gar said she, too, was a supporter and was interested in a lawn sign.

""Everything went fine. I installed it for her and screwed it in,"" he said.

Gar Gar/Twitter A screengrab from a video that Alberta Party candidate Gar Gar shared on Twitter shows a man forcibly removing one of his campaign signs.

""We were about to go to my car, me and my wife, and I heard somebody calling me from my back and say 'hey, you, come back',"" said Gar.

The candidate said he thought it was another voter who wanted to speak about the election, but he quickly noticed the man's body language as he approached.

""Just mad. Bursting,"" Gar said, adding that he started filming when he realized something serious could happen.

The man told Gar he was the landlord of the property and didn't want the signs on his lawn.

Wanting to de-escalate the situation, Gar said he was about to offer to remove the sign when the man decided to ""take matters into his own hands.""

""Everything just happened so fast, this guy just burst in ... took [the sign] out, ripped it and said here you go,"" he said.

Election Act outlines tenants' rights

In the video he shared on Twitter, Gar can be heard asking about the woman's rights since — as several users on the social network pointed out — Alberta's Election Act prohibits landlords or condo boards from preventing tenants from displaying election advertising material.

Gar said he could ""sense the fear"" from the renters, that they wanted to avoid any problems for their living situation.

Screengrab/Gar Gar/Facebook Gar Gar, an Alberta Party candidate in the riding of Calgary-East, says a man who tore out one of his election signs from a lawn owes Calgarians an apology.

She later came to him and said that they still supported Gar. But he said she spoke in a lower voice, as if she didn't want the landlord to hear her.

""She was saying 'I'm so sorry.' She shouldn't be the one saying sorry.""

Gar said he's running in Alberta's election to help fight what he calls a stigma between renters and homeowners. He said some voters, like the woman on that lawn, might ""fear"" casting a ballot because they believe they can't make a difference.

This isn't the first time that Gar's election material has been damaged. Last month, he found one of his posters defaced with the phrase ""vote for your future.""

In November 2016, as Kenney made his move to unite the right in Alberta by folding the Progressive Conservative party ...","Sarah Elder-Chamanara just can’t bring herself to vote for a party whose candidates make homophobic remarks and want to restrict abortions — no matter how much she agrees with its other positions.

The 35-year-old Calgary resident is a “fiscal conservative” who favours low taxes and less regulation in the economy. She is no New Democrat. In fact, she grew up in B.C. and for years worked in politics as an aide to BC Liberals like Naomi Yamamoto, Ida Chong and Moira Stilwell.

Elder-Chamanara thinks the United Conservative Party candidate in her riding would make a good MLA. But she’s worried that with UCP leader Jason Kenney as Alberta premier, progress for LGBTQ people and women’s reproductive rights could be set back decades.

“As much as I like my candidate, a vote for him is a vote for Kenney, and I can’t do that,” she told The Tyee.

Elder-Chamanara was horrified when audio clips surfaced of UCP candidate Mark Smith comparing homosexuality to paedophilia and scorning women who choose to have abortions.

And she was disgusted when star UCP candidate Caylan Ford was revealed to have compared LGBTQ pride parades to “a celebration of vice and transgression,” and lamented “the demographic replacement of white peoples in their homelands.”

Elder-Chamanara isn’t sure if Kenney truly rejects what candidates like these stand for.

In a video from 2000, Kenney bragged to Canadian Alliance supporters that during his student activist days in San Francisco he helped overturn a law allowing benefits to same-sex couples — this, at the height of the AIDS crisis.

“Sure, there are things that I’ve done and said in my life that I regret,” Kenney later said. His campaign turned down The Tyee’s request for an interview.

Though Kenney condemned Ford’s comments about white nationalism and accepted her resignation, Ford was replaced with Jeremy Wong, an ordained minister and a pastor who is accused of supporting gay conversion therapy (which Wong denies).

After Smith’s comments questioning whether “homosexual love is good love” became public, Kenney rejected pressure to remove Smith from the party. Nor, when it came to light that Smith had pushed for Christian schools to be able to fire teachers for being gay, did Kenney waver in his support. Smith has been touted to be the UCP’s education minister.

In a Global News Radio interview last week, host Charles Adler asked Kenney, “Why are so many people who bash gays, and bash women, why are so many people who bash Muslims, attracted to the United Conservative Party?”

Kenney responded, “Charles, I reject that.”

So when two UCP volunteers recently showed up at Elder-Chamanara’s door, she said she asked them directly “how they were personally able to reconcile the [hateful] things that have been said with the need in my mind for balanced budgets and fiscal pragmatism?”

The doorknockers replied that “‘we’re not allowed to talk about this, we’re only allowed to talk about economic issues,’” she said.

A UCP spokesperson wrote to The Tyee that “No, there is no truth to this.”

Tensions within Albertan conservatism

The tension that Elder-Chamanara feels between her fiscal beliefs and her social conscience appears to be common these days in Alberta. “I’ve heard that anecdote over and over,” Duane Bratt, a political science professor at Calgary’s Mount Royal University, told The Tyee.

It’s not clear whether UCP candidates’ extreme positions on social issues are hurting the party, which has made repealing Alberta’s carbon tax and boosting the province’s oil sands economy central to its messaging.

A poll released April 5 showed Kenney’s UCP leading Rachel Notley’s NDP by nine points and by slightly more in crucial Calgary. That gap halves the one found by a different poll released just two days earlier.

Still, Bratt reflects the consensus that the UCP will form a majority government. Albertans, and all Canadians, he said, should be prepared “for a much more socially conservative party than we have seen in the mainstream of Alberta for a very long time.”

He added, “There is concern in the gay community and the women’s rights community that a lot of the protections that have been built up over the years... are going to be rolled back by Jason Kenney.”

‘I’m very scared’

Dylan Chevalier thinks that he and other LGBTQ people he knows in Alberta are being used as pawns in Kenney’s election strategy. The 20-year-old executive director of the group Sexual and Gender Acceptance Edmonton last month joined hundreds of people for a demonstration outside the Alberta legislature.

They were protesting a UCP policy that Chevalier believes could put young people in danger. “I’m very scared for myself and what will happen to the LGBTQ community if this party forms government,” he told The Tyee.

The UCP platform calls for the rules around gay-straight alliances in Alberta schools to be amended. Normally, students are free to set up and join these alliances, which exist for people to socialize and be open in their sexuality, without anyone at home knowing. Kenney wants to make it so that teachers have the option of informing people’s parents.

“I think it would be very rare,” Kenney said.

To Chevalier, who ran a GSA when he attended Ross Sheppard High School in Edmonton, this undermines the entire thing. “The whole purpose of a gay-straight alliance is so you can be safe — you’re not going to be outed to anyone, you don’t have to worry,” he said. “The student could be in an unsafe environment at home if they came out.”

He suspects that the only reason Kenney is making this an election issue at all is because of pressure from within the UCP. At a party convention in 2018, delegates voted in favour of informing parents about gay-straight alliance membership. Kenney opposed it.

“Let me be absolutely stone-cold clear: a United Conservative government will not be changing law or policy to require notification of parents when kids join GSAs,” he promised at the time.

Chevalier argued Kenney reversed that position on GSAs in order “to appease hardcore social conservatives” and now LGBTQ youth in Alberta have to bear the consequences.

Those consequences, tweeted one gay Albertan, could be life and death.

If a politician or school official had outed me to my father as a youth I would not be here now. That is the reality for many queer kids. What @jkenney and the #UCP are suggesting is inhuman. #abpoli — Brad Fraser (@fraser_brad) March 26, 2019

Kenney has attempted to present a moderate face by supporting Pride events last year in Edmonton and Calgary. A conservative organization known as LGBTory last year called Kenney “an ally,” claiming “there are few politicians in this country who have done as much as he has for the Canadian and global LGBTQ+ community.”

But Chevalier isn’t buying it. “He’s very clearly still homophobic,” Chevalier said. “We have a party that stands by absolutely disgusting candidates.” If the UCP wins the election, Chevalier argues, Kenney will no longer face the same electoral pressures to condemn hateful remarks and actions within the party. “They will have four years to do whatever they want,” he said.

Investigating Kenney’s past

Taylor Lambert isn’t convinced when Kenney says his views on abortion and same-sex marriage have softened since his student days as a hard-line religious activist in San Francisco. Lambert, a freelance journalist based in Calgary, told The Tyee his scepticism is rooted in basic journalistic principles. “It’s not specific to Jason Kenney — it’s true of any leader,” he said. “You have to look at their background, where they came from, and their past words and deeds.”

In January, Lambert flew to San Francisco for an independent Calgary media outlet called the Sprawl to learn more about Kenney’s history — and what Lambert found adds important context to the story the UCP leader has been telling Albertans.

Kenney has said several times that in addition to his early religious activism he spent time helping people with HIV/AIDS, once explaining in a video that “this is a disease I first saw first-hand volunteering at a hospice in San Francisco back in the 1980s.” Kenney was referring to the Gift of Love Hospice, where Catholic missionaries provided assistance to homeless men. “I was transformed,” he has said.

Lambert learned that the Gift of Love Hospice, which no longer exists, was not well known in San Francisco’s LGBTQ community. A Los Angeles Times story from 1990 suggested that the sisters who worked there expressed “discomfort or disapproval” towards gay people. “The overall impression is of a miserable place oriented less towards the comfort and care of the dying than to a religious notion of suffering for salvation,” Lambert wrote.

In a “fact-check” issued by the UCP in response to the Sprawl’s reporting, Kenney doesn’t directly address Lambert’s characterization of the hospice. Kenney argues that looking at his past makes him “realize how much my views have changed over the decades, which I think is normal for most people as they mature.”

Lambert said it’s unclear how many people across the province accept the UCP leader’s assurances. “Do you as a voter, and do we as Albertans, believe that Jason Kenney has renounced those views, or is this a transformation of political convenience?” he said.

‘What the hell is that? That’s not conservative’

The balancing act Kenney conducts in holding together his coalition of oil patch boosters with tolerant social views, and fervent foes of abortion and LGBTQ rights, is made clear by speaking with Jack Fonseca. If Kenney has genuinely moderated his positions on social issues, that makes Fonseca angry.

Fonseca is director of political operations for Campaign Life Coalition, a national anti-abortion and social conservative advocacy group which several years ago gave Kenney a “pro-life” rating, explaining “Jason had a 100 per cent, perfect voting record on life & family issues throughout his long career in the House of Commons.”

But since then the group’s opinion of Kenney has soured. “We’ve been terribly let down,” Fonseca told The Tyee.

Campaign Life Coalition was not pleased when Kenney initially questioned the UCP resolution informing parents about teens joining gay-straight alliances. And the group didn’t it like when Kenney participated in a UCP Pride breakfast last summer. “What the hell is that?” Fonseca said. “That’s not conservative.”

Campaign Life Coalition still thinks Kenney is useful to the social conservative movement. It argued that Kenney’s announcement about parental notifications for GSAs is “a step in the right direction, but does not take the UCP nearly far enough down the road to total freedom from the gay lobby’s chokehold on Alberta families.”

Fonseca thinks the UCP should entirely repeal legislation supporting gay-straight alliances in schools. He said Campaign Life Coalition and its allies plan to keep pushing Kenney to take action on this and other issues important to his social conservative base. “This is a very important election,” Fonseca said. “Parents and families and voters in general of Alberta need to put pressure on him.”

They will be joined by the Wilberforce Project, an anti-abortion group based in Edmonton. “As it stands, if the UCP wins the upcoming election, then we will have the most pro-life legislature in decades, and maybe ever,” the group wrote on its website in February. “We now need to keep the candidates who won their nominations accountable and on track to enacting pro-life policy.”

A UCP spokesperson wrote to The Tyee that “Jason Kenney has been clear that he won’t be re-opening these contentious debates.”

‘Footsy with freaks’

And yet Kenney’s campaigning remains familiar to people who have long watched his career. He may speak publicly against bigotry and intolerance, but he does far less than he could to purge his party of such elements.

Extreme social conservatives wondering if they are welcome in the UCP, therefore, need merely note who remains in their midst as party members and candidates. They can take comfort, as well, in Kenney’s past record in Alberta.

That record makes it impossible to accept that Kenney is some recent arrival surprised to find extremist elements clinging to him. Instead, Kenney cut his political teeth in Alberta. It’s where he learned how to win by explicitly courting the most deeply social conservative voters.

In 2000, a new right-wing populist federal party, the Canadian Alliance, had evolved from the Reform Party founded and headed by Preston Manning. Now a contest to lead the party was underway, pitting Manning against the Pentecostal Stockwell Day, who as an Alberta government minister had advocated denying LGBTQ people protections under the province’s human rights code.

Kenney abandoned campaigning for his mentor Manning to drum up votes for Day. Why?

As a 2014 Walrus profile recounts, Day “had earned the allegiance of fellow social conservatives by attempting to end provincial funding for abortion... Like all leadership contests, the Alliance race came down to which candidate could sign up the most new members. Manning discovered that Kenney was trolling for Day supporters at evangelical and Catholic churches, and on the website of the anti-abortion lobby Campaign Life Coalition, a practice Manning adamantly opposed.”

Day won, and became Canada’s opposition leader. He named Kenney his finance critic.

In November 2016, as Kenney made his move to unite the right in Alberta by folding the Progressive Conservative party into the more hard-right Wild Rose party, he bussed in hundreds of male students from Christian colleges to a PC policy forum in Red Deer.

According to Alberta Views magazine:

“Immediately after the policy forum, Calgary MLA and PC leadership candidate Sandra Jansen resigned from the race, citing aggressive and sexually charged verbal and written harassment during the Red Deer convention — abuse that often focused on her support for women’s reproductive rights. ‘My presence in this race has so enraged a socially regressive element,’ she said in an email to supporters, ‘that I fear it will take away from our ability to fight what is turning out to be a very hostile takeover attempt on the party.’” The only other female among the six PC candidates resigned, too.

Four months later, Kenney was elected leader of the PC party and given a mandate to forge unity with Wild Rose, which produced the Kenney-led UCP.

Last October, Kenney was forced to expel a UCP member for his white supremacist views. Kenney said he’d had no idea, though the man had run the call centre for his leadership campaign. Kenney’s former conservative opponent for the UCP leadership implored in a tweet that Kenney “stop playing footsy with freaks.”

The #UCP and @jkenney need to kick these weirdos out of the party for the sake of decency. They should never have been there in the first place. There is no place for hate and bigotry in our society or political landscape. Stop playing footsy with freaks! #ableg — Brian Jean (@BrianJeanAB) October 30, 2018

A few days ago, I checked back with Elder-Chamanara. Since we’d last spoken, the number of Kenney’s UCP party candidates espousing bigoted or hateful views had grown and continued to mount. Elder-Chamanara sent me links to three fresh “eruptions,” including one involving UCP candidate Travis Toews.

Toews, as it turns out, is also the director of an Alberta private Christian college whose handbook explains that “all sexual activity is designed by God to be used in the context of marriage between a man and woman.” The school therefore had banned not only all other types of sexual activity, but “spell casting, sorcery or demonic association.” Also yoga.

The news about Toews was just breaking. For Elder-Chamanara, was it hard to keep track of it all?

“I think we do need to do a better job of being present, being out in the community, listening to people — battle this sort of a stereotype that somehow rural communities are more conservative, because I just don’t think that’s true,” the former political reporter told Global News.

But Thompson knows better than anyone that past election results have painted a different picture: this is his second shot to steal the seat from third-term Conservative MP Ben Lobb. And the southwestern Ontario Huron-Bruce riding, and all those that surround it, have been blue for at least a decade.

WATCH: Longtime Conservative MP Larry Miller on whether there’s a secret to winning rural votes.

Thompson also knows a lot about the mindset of those rural voters, and not just because he grew up on a farm in the riding.

In 2015, the Liberals won a sweeping majority across the country in large part due to their success in urban centres. But they didn’t fare well in more traditional Conservative territory: small-town, rural Canada.

Thompson wanted to learn why, and spearheaded a task force that produced an internal party report on how the Liberals could do better in Southwestern Ontario and beyond.

“One of the things we suggested was we should be more present. People should see their prime minister and cabinet ministers in rural settings, and we’ve seen a lot of that,” he said. (Thompson said Justin Trudeau’s visit to the International Plowing Match in 2017 was the first by a prime minister since Louis St. Laurent.)

In January, Trudeau created a new ministry with rural voters in mind, naming Nova Scotia MP Bernadette Jordan Minister for Rural Economic Development. That was another recommendation from Thompson’s report.

WATCH: PM Justin Trudeau put on his farmer hat at the International Plowing Match in Walton, Ont. (2017)

“It’s my campaign slogan but it’s also my motto — I really do think our political leadership needs to be reminded over and over and over that a quarter of Canadians live in a rural setting.” “And every time we’re making any decision, somebody has to be at the table to say, ‘OK that’s great, but what will that mean for people who live in a rural community?’” Thompson said.

The difference between rural and urban voters

Some of Thompson’s potential electors say they do feel forgotten by the Liberal government, and most told Global News they’ve long voted Conservative.

“I find that the Liberals just seem to focus more on the big city,” said Sarah Fagan in Goderich, Ont.,’s downtown.

“A lot of the issues that they deal with are Toronto issues and it’s not helpful to us. Any of the high-speed transportation systems, none of the stations ever get up here,” Fagan said.

One riding away to the north, longtime and popular Conservative MP Larry Miller said there’s no magic to winning the rural vote, but there are differences between urban and rural voters.

And transit is a good example.

“I totally get why transit is important, especially in larger cities, but not only is it not expected up in rural parts like Bruce-Grey-Owen Sound. … It’s just not practical,” Miller told Global News at his home just outside Wiarton.

“There’s no way that transit is going to work for me out here, and I don’t want it anyway, you know. So there’s a lot of those issues that, you know, we just don’t expect them. Ambulance, police — we know it’s going to take longer for them to get to our place and we’re OK with that.”

Miller said country voters are drawn to his party in part because of the Conservative focus on fiscal responsibility.

“We know government has to provide some services for us and that’s normal but outside of that, get out of our face and let us live our lives,” Miller said.

Very popular among voters and in his Conservative caucus, this will be Miller’s last term — he’s decided to retire after nearly 30 years in politics.

But he’s not worried about his riding swinging red. (He stole it from a Liberal back in 2004.)

“Not a chance,” Miller said.

“I can thank Justin Trudeau for that, because if there was any kind of doubt or chance in some people’s minds to vote Liberal, everything that he did here in the past couple months has totally taken that away.”

(Several of the people Global News stopped to chat politics with across Southwestern Ontario raised the handling of the SNC-Lavalin scandal as a concern, without being asked about it specifically.)

Allan Thompson hopes to land a seat for the first time by telling voters Conservatives aren’t actually in step with rural voters.

“Their definition of rural is somehow different. It’s got a slight anti-immigrant tinge and not as much focus on socially progressive issues,” Thompson said.

Helping others in need is a “core rural value,” Thompson said. “Somebody can show up at your door in a snowstorm and get a meal or a coffee or stay the night. That’s a core value that came from the pioneer and that corresponds pretty well with a lot of what the Liberal party advocates about looking out for people who are in need,” Thompson said.

In his campaign, he wants to counter stereotypes of the idyllic country lifestyle, and he thinks voters are ready to talk about that.

“There’s a lot of poverty in rural communities. It’s very striking when you knock on doors,” Thompson said. “Seniors in need, people who are homeless or live in substandard housing conditions, people who are dealing with addiction with mental health issues — those things can all be even more difficult to deal with when you’re in a rural setting.”

A question of relevance

Since the Liberals were able to win a majority in 2015 without winning rural voters, is their vote really necessary in 2019?

“Rural areas aren’t going to be as important as say, the 905 [vote-rich, battleground suburban area surrounding Toronto] or Toronto, and I think that’s just a function of the population shifting from rural communities to urban ones, and I think that’s just a demographic challenge,” said Earnscliffe strategist Rob Leone.

Leone understands the challenge well. He’s a former Conservative member of provincial parliament for the riding of Cambridge, which includes that city but also a wide rural area, such as Ayr, where he calls home.

“It’s a whole electoral map,” said Leone, speaking of the federal election. “And I think there is a lot of strategy that goes into who’s going to win where and where are your strengths and where are your weaknesses.”

On the flipside, for Conservatives looking to fare better in big cities, Leone said they need to tackle both policy and demographic issues.

“Certainly, younger people, more educated people, tend to live in urban areas, and right now it seems the Liberals are doing a better job of attracting those kinds of voters to their fold.”

“The Liberals are making a big play on multiculturalism and diversity. Those are the kinds of ideas that are resonating among urban voters right now, and if the Conservatives want to tie into that, they certainly have to look at how they’re going to address those policy concerns for voters,” Leone said.

Back in the countryside, Allan Thompson said thinking about the rural vote means thinking beyond the polls.

“Yes, you’re trying to win. But I think you’re also trying to make sure that you properly represent Canadians across the board. And I don’t think a government can effectively do its job if it is not hearing from the 25 per cent of Canadians who live in rural communities.”

Rural campaigning is more costly and time-consuming, with no high-rise buildings where hundreds of doors and voters can be reached much faster, for example.

“Where are most of the votes in this country? They are in big urban centres. It’s actually a lot of work and it’s a bit more expensive to get off the 401 and get out to rural communities and hear what people have to say,” Thompson said.

WATCH: Ontario does not want cities to get infrastructure funding, Trudeau says

As a result, rural concerns are not always heard “in the corridors of power,” Thompson said.

It’s an area where he and Conservative Larry Miller agree.

“Rural voters, if they’re not aware of that or not ticked off about it, they should be,” Miller said.

“They basically just take us for granted — ‘We’re not gonna win it anyways, so why would we pour money in there?’”

“And that’s another thing that divides or pounds a wedge between [rural and urban voters] — ‘So you’re not even going to give me infrastructure for highway projects or whatever, but you’re going to take my tax dollars and spend it in foreign countries and in other crazy ways that rural Canada gets absolutely no benefit from?’ — And that one there really sticks in the craw of rural people,” Miller said.

As he reflects back on nearly 30 years in politics, Miller attributes his own success to staying true to his roots.

“I’ve made a very conscious effort to make sure I never forgot where I came from. … I know that people appreciate that. You know, I love hockey, I love to hunt, I love all sports, love the outdoors. … I know lots of politicians, that if they hunted, they wouldn’t say a word about it because it may be unpolitically correct or politically unpopular or whatever. I don’t care about that.”

“What you see with me is what you get. And I’m very proud of my rural roots and what I do,” Miller said.

And that’s his outgoing advice for all politicians, of any political stripe, and whether aiming to woo voters in cities or towns: don’t forget where you came from.",IN-DEPTH: Courting country voters ahead of election 2019,Global News,https://globalnews.ca/news/5156380/rural-vs-urban-voters-canada/

But the issue hasn’t taken centre stage in the 2019 provincial election — something that may be surprising for a place where devastating natural disasters, like the 2013 southern Alberta floods and the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfires, are becoming more frequent as global temperatures rise.

A giant fireball is visible as a wildfire rips through the forest by Highway 63, 16 kilometres south of Fort McMurray, Alta., on May 7, 2016. Such mega-fires are likely to become more frequent across Western Canada as the effects of climate change set in. ( Jonathan Hayward / The Canadian Press file photo )

“We’re not having very much of a public discourse, we’re just getting distracted by (the carbon) tax,” said Shawn Marshall, a climatology professor at the University of Calgary. “This is really happening. We need to prepare.” Albertans are the least likely in Canada to believe in climate change — last year, a poll by Canada’s Ecofiscal Commission, an independent economics organization, found 52 per cent of Albertans see conclusive or solid evidence that the Earth is warming. Sixteen per cent said there’s little or no proof, the highest rate of any province, the poll found.

As well, several United Conservative Party candidates have come under fire for climate change denial. (Leader Jason Kenney has said he believes in climate change but won’t boot candidates who disagree.) “So many livelihoods in Alberta are tied to fossil fuels,” said Marshall. “Anything that threatens that industry is going to be really controversial.”

Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is one climate change-related goal, but it’s also past time to begin preparing for the impacts to come, Marshall added. For Alberta, that means projects aimed at mitigating future droughts, floods and wildfires — especially as Canada is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the world, according to an Environment Canada report released earlier this month. “The writing’s on the wall,” said Marshall.

Very few discussions about climate change-related infrastructure have happened during this election campaign. One notable exception is flood mitigation in Calgary — and more specifically, the Springbank dam. The NDP has consistently supported the dam, which would divert water from the Elbow River 15 kilometres west of Calgary into a dry reservoir that would store water during a flood. (The NDP has also pledged to spend $1 billion on other mitigation along the Bow River.) The Alberta Party has also supported the Springbank dam. Less clear is the UCP’s stance — though Kenney has promised to support it if elected, the party’s candidate for the area, Miranda Rosin of Banff-Kananaskis, has opposed it. The NDP has also proposed to build a second highway into Fort McMurray. It could serve as another escape route in the case of a catastrophic wildfire, allowing the city to avoid the clogged roads that hampered evacuation efforts in 2016. But in terms of policy aimed at saving Albertans from climate change-related disaster, that’s about it. “Responsible policy and governance (for climate change) involves thinking long-term,” said Marshall, adding that governments must look ahead as far as 2080. “I feel like we don’t see very much of that because politics and governance are really a fist fight for the current time.” And so, the centrepieces of the four major parties’ climate change plans have been their takes on the carbon tax, a policy the governing NDP introduced in 2017. Right now, Albertans pay $30 per tonne of carbon used, an added cost, for example, of about seven cents per litre on gasoline.

Carbon taxes are a global best practice for tackling climate change, said Brendan Boyd, an assistant professor at MacEwan University who studies climate change policy. But they can also be quite unpopular, requiring politicians to balance stringent rules with the need to make them publicly acceptable. “Support for the carbon tax is definitely low in Alberta compared to the rest of the country,” Boyd said. “Even though it might never be a really, really popular policy, there are different ways that you can design it to make it more politically palatable.” One of those ways would be making it revenue-neutral, meaning all of the money generated is returned to taxpayers through rebates or other tax cuts, Boyd said. The Alberta Liberal Party has proposed a plan along those lines. Another way could be narrowing the pool of people who have to pay the carbon levy — the Alberta Party, for example, has proposed exempting homes, businesses, farms, and non-profits. Though, of course, the fewer people who have to pay the tax, the smaller the reduction in emissions. The United Conservatives, meanwhile, have pledged to scrap the carbon tax entirely if elected. Though that would likely mean Albertans would have to pay a federally imposed carbon tax, the UCP has also promised it would take that fight to court. Alberta also has a program targeting large industrial emitters — it has existed in some form since 2007, but a stronger version took effect under the NDP in 2018.

The UCP has proposed replacing the carbon tax with a weaker version of the large emitters program called TIER, the Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction fund. As with the current NDP plan, a portion of the revenues would fund research aimed at reducing emissions — though the NDP plan allocates more money for that purpose. But such a plan might not reduce overall emissions and is “less stringent” than the current version, Boyd said. The UCP plan only requires companies to reduce emissions compared to their overall production, so as long as they’re getting more efficient, their emissions could actually increase. “Environmental groups have typically been opposed to that because it doesn’t actually set an absolute cap on emissions,” said Boyd. “Industry likes it, because that means they can continue to produce without having to worry about limiting their production.” When the large emitters program was first introduced, it was a progressive, incremental step toward broader carbon pricing, Boyd said. And for a province like Alberta, where a significant chunk of greenhouse gas emissions come from large, industrial polluters, it can make a dent. However, research has advanced since then. We now know that carbon taxes don’t have a hugely negative economic impact when done right, and most jurisdictions that are trying to address climate change have gone that route instead, Boyd said. “In a lot of people’s opinions, (the UCP plan) will be seen as a step back,” said Boyd. None of the parties’ plans are stringent enough to help Alberta meet its international climate targets, Boyd said. However, the targets matter less than figuring out how to reduce emissions in a way that’s both effective and popular enough for governments to enact it. “We sometimes get hung up, I think, a little bit too much on the specific targets,” Boyd said. “(Policy is) not useful if no one’s willing to accept it and no government will put it in place.”

Carbon pricing isn’t the only factor in regulating emissions. The UCP has also pledged to get rid of an NDP cap on emissions from the oilsands, and to allow coal-fired plants to keep operating past 2023 (the NDP had planned to phase them out). When it comes to renewable energy, the UCP has promised to cut NDP subsidies on solar power, saying it believes the market can support solar projects on its own. Though ending the subsidies wouldn’t exactly support the transition to renewable energy, Boyd said such a move probably wouldn’t hamper it either. “Part of that is market-driven, so as long as the price comes down and it becomes an effective, competitive fuel source for electricity, it may continue on regardless of what government is in power.” Marshall said Alberta has a lot of potential to become a future centre for renewable fuel production, if people are willing to speed up the transition away from fossil fuels. But that can’t happen if climate change threatens our water supply, or if our province is choked by wildfire smoke — things everyone in Alberta should want to avoid, he said. “It’d be nice if we started thinking about opportunity instead of entrenching in what made us wealthy,” Marshall said. “There’s so much opportunity here ... I’m sad that it’s such a partisan issue.” Emma McIntosh is an environment, justice and investigative reporter with Star Calgary. Follow her on Twitter at @EmmaMci

""You have the homophobia ...","Voters in a CBC election focus group are despairing over the divisiveness and negativity of the current election campaign, and worry Alberta may end up with MLAs from only two parties after the vote on April 16.

Uwem Okome, a 45-year-old social worker who came to Canada from Nigeria a decade ago, says political parties are playing on people's fears.

""When there's frustration, people are angry,"" she said. ""And they know that anger works. ... They're taking advantage of the fear factor that people are experiencing.""

New voter Cassie Breton, 23, said the decision-making process has been ""stressful.""

""There's four options but there's only really two, and I don't really think I like either,"" she said referring to the United Conservative Party, led by Jason Kenney, and Rachel Notley's NDP.

""You have the homophobia stuff with Jason. But then, do you want jobs or do you want to be a good person?""

Breton and Okome met with other members of an Edmonton panel on Monday to discuss the campaign. The focus group is part of a project the CBC has undertaken in Calgary and Edmonton with Janet Brown Opinion Research.

The discussion was led by Brown, who asked the group about the tone of the campaign, the leaders' debate and how — if at all — their opinions have shifted during the campaign.

The negativity of the campaign disturbed many panelists. They talked about ad hominem attacks, ""bickering"" between Notley and Kenney, and an incident where a vehicle was keyed with an anti-NDP message in Red Deer.

""People are voting for what they don't want,"" said John Campbell, 67, a retired accountant. ""They're voting against something, not for something.""

A two-party future?

Panelists also worried about another potential outcome of the province's political divide — an Alberta legislature with representation from only two parties: the NDP and the UCP.

""Nobody wants a two-party system,"" Okome said. ""What I would really wish to have is the other two parties, the Alberta Party and the Liberal Party ... so that we will have that balance.""

Dennis Blowers, who has voted for the Progressive Conservatives his entire life, challenged Breton's statement that voters only have two options.

""The sad part is that we continuously focus on these two parties,"" said Blowers, a 54-year-old owner of a home construction and renovation company.

""I just think there is a solid alternative to the negative approach that these other two parties are taking.""

For Blowers, that alternative is the Alberta Party, which he is ""90 per cent"" leaning toward supporting.

He won't vote for the UCP because he doesn't like Kenney, he said, but Alberta Party Leader Stephen Mandel made a good impression during last week's debate.

""He's not fighting everybody,"" Blowers said. ""He's not negative toward people.""

LGBT community 'terrified' of UCP

One of the main themes of the campaign has been the constant revelations of past statements made by candidates that are homophobic, racist or bigoted.

Kenney was the focus of fierce criticism last week for standing by the UCP's Drayton Valley-Devon candidate Mark Smith, over statements that Smith made in a 2013 sermon.

The former teacher questioned whether love between same-sex couples was real love and suggested that women who'd had abortions were murdering their children. Kenney condemned the comments but refused to drop Smith from the ballot.

""I'm not in the LGBT community but I know people in that community who are terrified of the UCP, because they have so many people who have been very blatantly against their community,"" said Allan Malcolmson, 30, who leans left in his political views.

Malcolmson said it would help if candidates would stop being evasive, admit they made a mistake and explain how their views have changed.

But Jonathan Schonewille, whose politics normally lean toward the right, suggested that some of these stories have been ""character assassination"" hit pieces.

""I think there has been a lot of conflation about what someone's personal views are and their ability to execute their public office,"" the 37-year-old life insurance broker said.

""Show me a person in this room who has never changed their mind on anything in their life, and I'll show you a liar.""

If oil were a young university student, Alberta’s politicians would now play the role of paranoid helicopter parents or politically correct campus administrators.

Every day the province’s oil-obsessed politicos warn Albertans that Canada is a dangerous place full of self-righteous climate activists (and some are indeed self-righteous), anti-pipeline protestors, dumb courts, stubborn First Nations, and nasty liberals.

Moreover the province’s potential for offence-taking has become as grand as Justin Trudeau’s vindictive Liberal Party of Canada. It can’t tolerate any truth-telling either.

The province’s allergy to criticism has grown so formidable that United Conservative Party leader Jason Kenney proposes to set up a Saudi-like war room in the energy ministry to respond to any micro-aggressions and offensive material. Should it be called Snowflake Central?

Albertans have become such a fragile, oil-reliant people, reasons Kenney, that the province now needs the equivalent of university Bias Response Teams, in this case to foster “a safe and inclusive environment” for its petroleum exporters who have now claimed Alberta’s identity as their own.

(The rulers of Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and Russia, we should remember, don’t much like oil critics, either. The political records show that oil relishes conflict and breeds political aggression like no other commodity, except cocaine.)

Kenney, a belligerent proponent of oil-safetyism, would much rather play the blame game than accept the truth that the rapid development of bitumen mining in Fort McMurray violated two fundamental principles of risk mitigation: go slow and save the money.

Over many years, Alberta’s Tories repeatedly gambled that the price of bitumen, a garbage crude that requires upgrading and complex refining, could only go higher, and they bet wrong.

So did the NDP, another oil-coddled entity. (And yes, Albertans should be very angry about the gross mismanagement of their gas and oil resources by their elected politicians.)

According to former Encana CEO Gwyn Morgan, another whiner of the highest order, Alberta’s most important industry has been stomped on by bad people.

(As every adherent of identity politics knows, life is a constant battle between good and evil people. God forbid that Canadians see each other as brothers and sisters.)

Morgan, who chaired SNC-Lavalin during the Libya scandal and boldly took no responsibility for that fiasco, recently argued in the Financial Post that the “drastic decline” of Canada’s oil industry is due to “a combination of ideological antagonism to fossil fuels and tunnel vision.”

Apparently, ideology caused oil prices to crash in 2014, and the overproduction of bitumen and tight oil had nothing to do with that bitter event, which left 40,000 Albertans jobless.

Art Berman, a respected Houston oil analyst and no greenie, has a much higher respect for the truth.

He recently documented how combined Canadian and U.S. unconventional oil production from the tar sands and Permian Basin “surged in 2014 and caused oil prices to collapse.” As prices fell, producers — including OPEC — rejected any production cuts.

Yet to this day you’ll never hear an Alberta or federal politician, let alone Morgan, acknowledge how Canadian oilsands production helped precipitate the global oil price crash of 2014. (Delusion appears to be a reliable Canadian political trait for both the left and the right.)

Alberta’s political elites would never let the facts spoil the celebration of Alberta’s victimhood or the province’s politically correct view of petroleum as the Walt Disney of resources.

In Morgan’s pity analysis, 44 years of one-party rule in Alberta by the Tories played no role in Alberta’s current predicament.

But the facts show that the Conservative governments foolishly eschewed any value-added policy for the province’s junk crude, and instead promoted a low royalty regime, which encouraged the export of raw bitumen — a dismal strategy that has enriched U.S. refineries and the Koch brothers.

No matter. Those damn oil-hating and U.S.-funded tar sands campaigners are to blame for Alberta’s bad oil rap, argues Mark Scholz, president of the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors in the Calgary Herald.

According to Scholz, a bunch of celebrities and “a glorious campaign of Houdini-like misdirection” are somehow responsible for the cancelling of two bitumen export pipelines, carbon taxes, and everything else that has gone wrong in Alberta.

Of course the high carbon content of bitumen and its extreme price volatility have nothing to do with declining investment in the oil sands.

The facts also tell a different story about the two cancelled pipelines. A federal court cancelled Northern Gateway’s permit (and the Harper government choose not to revive that proposal) while market conditions claimed the Energy East pipeline.

Although proponents of Energy East claimed it would end the import of Saudi oil into eastern Canada, David Hughes, a well-known Canadian energy analyst notes that eastern refineries in New Brunswick aren’t designed to process much heavy oil.

So an Energy East pipeline, if ever built, could not really put a dent in U.S. or Saudi oil imports.

Tim McMillan, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, the industry’s powerful lobby group, also claims victimhood. “We have been the victims of a very well-orchestrated, well-planned foreign-funded attack on Canadian infrastructure,” he recently tweeted.

But Hughes notes oil sands production has grown by 376 per cent since 2000. If there was a “foreign-funded attack” it’s been grossly ineffective, he says.

Hughes adds that “the reason that there is a pipeline bottleneck is that the industry has been so successful in growing production.”

NDP Premier Rachel Notley also presents Alberta as fragile player unfairly dumped upon by bad actors in British Columbia and elsewhere.

Her vocabulary consists of pipelines, pipelines and pipelines.

Alberta can’t get full value for its bitumen “because we can’t move the product to market.”

And dastardly environmentalists have created a situation where “we are leaving world oil markets — and in some cases Eastern Canadian markets — to the Russians and the Saudis — countries that don’t care a whit about climate change or the environment.”

Yet research done for Alberta Innovates, a taxpayer-funded nonprofit, revealed that no real price advantage for bitumen exists in Asia.

The best and most lucrative market remains U.S. Gulf Coast refineries because they can handle complex heavy oil.

And what oil-exporting nation, other than Norway, truly gives a damn about climate change or the environment? They simply don’t exist.

Coddling a mind is a terrible thing, but coddling a province is a social disaster.

In the current election campaign, no politician wants to pony up and tell the truth.

It wasn’t foreigners or bad actors who created Alberta’s failings; it was Albertans and their damn greed and lack of strategic planning.

Albertans share the blame for the 2014 oil price collapse with U.S. tight oil producers (price discounts and lack of pipelines clobbered Permian producers too), and Albertans share blame for the province’s collective failure to add value to bitumen. (The more value you add, the fewer pipelines you need.)

Albertans, and only Albertans, share the blame for not collecting their fair share and saving for a rainy day.

So stop your whining and end the blame game. Cowboy up and own your oil-based problems, and recognize that the Alberta government has not responded competently to structural changes in oil and gas markets.

Recognize you’ve got both revenue and spending problems that could be a death spiral for the province.

Admit that exporting carbon-rich oil comes with high risks and that exporting more oil and building more pipelines will increase those risks.

And stop pretending that business as usual will dig Alberta out of the hole it has dug for itself.

Morgan, Kenney, Notley and the rest of Alberta-Is-Only-Oil gang might want to start with some cognitive behavioural therapy, or better still, sit down and read Butcher’s Crossing.

It’s a great novel about a buffalo hunt by the Texas writer John Williams. Some say it is probably the best western ever written — even better than True Grit — and I agree.

It tells the story of a couple of buffalo hunters who journey to Colorado for a grand slaughter with visions of prosperity.

But once the hunters locate their prey, they grow so obsessed with greed and bloodletting that winter overtakes them and traps them in the mountains.

The killers emerge from a gruelling snowy ordeal months later, only to discover that the markets for buffalo hides have crashed.

A dejected hide-buyer explains the ruinous facts. “The bottom’s dropped out of the whole market. The hide business is finished. For good.”

Oil is not finished yet, and the prospects for heavy oil remain solid in the U.S. Gulf Coast. The oil sands will shrink, but they will not disappear for decades.

But Alberta’s twisted identity politics uphold the politically correct illusion that there are more buffalo to kill, and the future doesn’t matter.

Wait till you see the Liberals’ new bill Hate ...","CALGARY – New laws that would impede Alberta’s oil and gas from getting to export markets represent “a stampede of stupid,” Rachel Notley said Tuesday.

Notley, the NDP leader currently running for re-election to the Alberta premier’s office, testified before a Senate committee hearing Tuesday on Bill C-48, a federal bill that would place a moratorium on oil tankers moving crude off the northern part of British Columbia’s coastline.

“At the end of the day, this has a gargantuan impact on Alberta,” Notley said during her presentation, which blasted both the content and the spirit of the bill.

A combination of Alberta politicians, oil executives and industry groups blasted federal laws on three fronts Tuesday, arguing that Ottawa’s oil tanker moratorium, and separate plans to revamp pipeline approvals and Canada’s Clean Fuel Standard would all have an outsized impact on Alberta.

In the midst of the Alberta election, much of the province’s anger over the state of the economy is being directed at Ottawa and, with a week left before Albertans vote, both major parties are stepping up their criticism of the federal government.

“You may have noted that Albertans are not fans of Ottawa these days, which is the G-rated way to put it,” Notley said in her presentation, in which she called the bill “the horribly misguided West Coast tanker ban.”

She said it contained “a glaring double standard” that allows for massive liquefied natural gas tankers to travel off British Columbia’s coast but not oil tankers, making the bill “an Alberta ban”, not a tanker ban.

Similarly, Jason Kenney, Notley’s rival and United Conservative Party leader, sent a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warning that, if elected, a UCP government would challenge the constitutionality of another federal law called Bill C-69, which would reorganize the National Energy Board and revamp the regulatory process for pipelines.

In a release he said the new regulatory regime was “a sucker punch to an already-reeling Alberta economy” and a “full frontal attack” on provincial powers.

While Notley appeared before a Senate committee on Bill C-48, a parade of executives from large Canadian oil and gas companies were making their case in Calgary that Bill C-69 needed substantial amendments.

“The current regulatory process is being abused by entities that wish to frustrate, delay and ultimately stop the production of Canadian oil and gas,” said Al Reid, an executive vice-president and general counsel at Cenovus Energy Inc., a major oilsands producer.

“As currently drafted, Bill C-69 will make this situation worse by extending timelines and increasing the risk of litigation. We don’t believe it has to be this way,” he said.

Cenovus and other large oil and gas producers took the opportunity to both criticize the bill as it’s currently formulated, but say they would support amendments to address their concerns.

“We have been working with our industry associations to advance common sense amendments that make Bill C-69 workable for oil and natural gas projects,” said Steve Laut, executive vice-chairman of Canadian Natural Resources Ltd.

“We are concerned that Bill C-69, in its current form, will make the regulatory process more complicated, time consuming, and ultimately erode public and investor confidence,” Laut said.

Also on Tuesday, the Chemistry Industry Association of Canada held a press conference in Ottawa, criticizing the federal government’s plans to implement a Clean Fuel Standard, which, the group says, would effectively increase the price of carbon in Canada to $200 per tonne once it is fully implemented in 2023.

Bob Masterson, president and CEO of the CIAC, said the Fuel Standard would duplicate the costs of the carbon tax as companies would be forced to use expensive additives and blending agents in their fuel, and consumers would still pay the carbon tax to use that fuel.

He said it would also make the feedstock for petrochemical projects proposed in Alberta to rise by 30 per cent.

“It would definitely have a significant impact on the cost structure,” said Masterson.

He added the government is currently doing an economic analysis on how the new regulations would affect the industry, but added it’s “not very good policy” to propose new regulations before an analysis of those regulations has been carried out.

The Clean Fuel Standard would come into effect for all liquid fuels, including gasoline and diesel, by 2022 and for all gaseous fuels, including natural gas for home heating, by 2023.

“This matter is urgent. … Procedural fairness and the rule of law demand this. Secret in-camera meetings or private notices should not be a shield to prevent the upholding of the law and members’ rights,” Philpott told the Commons.

“This is very concerning. It speaks to the rule of law at the heart of our democracy,” Conservative MP Michael Chong, who authored the Reform Act, told the National Post in an interview shortly after she made her arguments. So what exactly is this latest foofaraw all about?

How did the ouster from caucus go down last week?

In a brief speech last Tuesday Trudeau announced his decision to remove Philpott and Wilson-Raybould from caucus after both resigned from cabinet in the wake of the SNC-Lavalin scandal. Wilson-Raybould testified that Trudeau and his top officials tried pressuring her, for political reasons, to cut a deal for Montreal engineering firm SNC-Lavalin so it could avoid criminal prosecution for fraud and bribery.

Both initially stayed members of the Liberal caucus, citing their faith in the party’s policies despite a lack of confidence in the prime minister’s handling of the affair.

But Trudeau said last week the caucus has lost “trust” in the two former ministers. “We’ve taken every effort to address their concerns but ultimately if they can’t honestly say that they have confidence in this team despite weeks of testimony, face-to-face conversations and phone calls with myself and other members of caucus, then they cannot be part of this team.”

Trudeau announced the decision as his own, and Philpott argued Tuesday Liberal MPs never had a chance to have their say — even though the Parliament of Canada Act was amended in 2015, with Chong’s Reform Act, so that these types of situations could be avoided.

What exactly does the Reform Act say about this?

The Reform Act, which amended the Canada Elections Act and the Parliament of Canada Act, spells out rules around expulsions and readmissions of caucus members, the election or removal of caucus chairs, leadership reviews and the election of interim leaders.

The act requires caucuses, after each general election, to hold four votes on whether or not a majority of MPs in each party wants to abide by the rules it sets out on its four topics. If they reject the rules, then they do not need to follow them.

On expulsions, here are the rules that parties can opt in to, or not: A member of caucus can only be expelled, according to the Reform Act, if “the caucus chair has received a written notice signed by at least 20 per cent of the members of the caucus requesting that the member’s membership be reviewed” and if “the expulsion of the member is approved by secret ballot by a majority of all caucus members.”

Neither of those things happened in this case. Philpott said if the Reform Act rules were followed, it would have taken a recorded vote in which 90 Liberal MPs voted to expel her and Wilson-Raybould — yet no such vote took place. “We were expelled prior to the commencement of the Liberal caucus meeting,” she argued in the House Tuesday.

Did Liberals ever vote on the provisions in the Reform Act?

The answer to this question would go a long way to settling whether Liberals did anything to violate the law.

If Liberal MPs never had a chance to vote on opting into the Reform Act rules, as Philpott alleged in the House, that would inherently be an “illegal act,” argued Chong. “I’ve been concerned about it for three-and-a-half years,” he said, since the Liberals reportedly held their first caucus meeting without recording votes and reporting results to the Speaker, which the law required them to do. “It’s now come to fruition with the two questionable expulsions last week.”

But Liberals said on Tuesday that they had followed the rules. Kevin Lamoureux, the parliamentary secretary to the government House leader, told the Commons that “over three years ago,” the chair of the national Liberal caucus, Francis Scarpaleggia, sent a letter to the speaker outlining the caucus’s decisions not to have the Reform Act provisions apply.

“Given the fact that the Liberal caucus did not adopt these provisions, the points raised by the honourable Member on this issue are moot,” said Lamoureux.

Lamoureux said the only requirement, which the caucus met, was for Liberals to inform the speaker of “the results of the caucus decisions.” But the law actually stipulates that they communicate “the outcome of each vote.”

Lamoureux did not address whether individual, recorded votes were held on each element of the Reform Act, nor whether the votes occurred at the Liberals’ first caucus meeting after the election, both required under the law. Philpott is alleging that neither happened.

The House leader’s office referred questions about whether votes were actually held to Scarpaleggia, who told the Post caucus confidentiality means he can’t discuss whether individual votes occurred.

So, does Philpott have a point?

What she’s arguing is that Trudeau breached the privileges of his Liberal MPs by not allowing them to vote on the administration of their own caucus back in November 2015, after the federal election, in accordance with the law. As a result, she is arguing, Philpott’s and Wilson-Raybould’s privileges were breached when Trudeau made a unilateral decision to remove them. And the rights of the entire Liberal caucus were breached because they didn’t have an opportunity to vote on that decision by secret ballot.

Chong said Philpott spoke with him about the topic before going ahead with her arguments on Tuesday morning, and he told the Post he is fully on board with them.

“This point of privilege she has raised is vitally important because if there is no recourse here to enforce the rights of members, there is no other place,” he said. Courts have repeatedly ruled they do not have jurisdiction over matters of parliamentary administration, so he believes this is the only way for it to be enforced. The Reform Act also specifically states that caucus decisions aren’t subject to judicial review.

“The only recourse we have to uphold the rule of law and to ensure that the law is followed in the House of Commons, its parliamentary parties and committees, is in the House of Commons and by appealing to the speaker,” Chong said.

But Philippe Lagassé, a procedure expert at the University of Ottawa, said the whole thing seems more like a question around the legal interpretation of the Parliament of Canada Act rather than a matter of parliamentary privilege.

“I don’t see how this is a point of privilege in the traditional sense,” he said. If Liberal MPs didn’t vote in favour of opting in to the Reform Act rules, then they wouldn’t be bound to them, “and since the courts can’t review, I’m not sure who would enforce this,” he added.

What has the speaker said about this?

Two weeks ago, a Conservative MP raised similar issues when he complained that it seemed MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes had resigned from the Liberal caucus because she was forced out. Had the Reform Act rules been in place, he argued, there would’ve had to have been a vote.

“If you, Mr. Speaker, decline to exercise jurisdiction to entertain breaches of the statute here, then members of caucuses, like the Liberal caucus who flagrantly ignore the law, have no protection and no recourse when their rights are trampled. Because of the lack of judicial recourse, general restraint on speakers interpreting the law and the House’s privilege to manage internal affairs, I respectfully submit that the way forward, indeed the only way forward, is to allow the House to deal with this matter,” John Nater argued.

Caesar-Chavannes ultimately confirmed that she had left of her own accord. And the speaker had come back on Monday, the day before Philpott made her arguments, with a ruling that he didn’t have the jurisdiction anyway.

As relayed by Deputy Speaker Bruce Stanton, Regan’s ruling said asking the House to deal with an expulsion from caucus was “not a proper subject for a question of privilege.” Further, “I as speaker have no role in the interpretation of statute nor in the conduct of these 2015 provisions.”

Philpott acknowledged that ruling on Tuesday morning. “But with respect it is our view that this does not relieve you of your responsibility to ensure that all members are aware of their rights in this place. This is our privilege. Accordingly, a remedy is required for our situation,” she said. Regan responded: “While I am left with the difficulty, as I said in my ruling yesterday, that the speaker does not have power to enforce statutes, I will certainly consider her argument and come back to the House.”

So now what happens?

The House will have to wait for Regan to come back with an opinion on the issue. If he does find a prima facie breach of privilege, which Lagassé found unlikely, Philpott will be able to move that the matter be referred to a parliamentary committee.

Liberals have a majority in the House and on committees — including the two committees that recently decided not to pursue any further investigation of the SNC-Lavalin issue.

Asked whether he’s hopeful that some of them will vote to look at what happened here, Chong said, “We have to try. We can’t give up. … I hope that our House of Commons is strong enough to adjudicate this and to seek justice.”

Ten days after the submission of a second appeal to the Conservative National Council alleging “several irregularities” with the Dufferin-Caledon Tory nomination process, Barb Shaughnessy, one of the three unsuccessful candidates, says she has documentation proving out-of-riding residents may have voted in the process.

Harzadan Singh Khattra emerged as the somewhat surprising winner of the nomination, which local Conservative members voted in on March 19. He beat out Kevin Weatherbee in the final round of voting, after Ms. Shaughnessy and former Orangeville Mayor Jeremy Williams had been eliminated in the ranked ballot voting system.

As reported in last week’s Citizen, Ms. Shaughnessy filed an initial appeal on March 21, two days after the nomination. In that appeal, she stressed it does not specifically contest the vote tally, but rather calls into question the eligibility of some persons who may or may not have voted. That appeal was quickly rejected.

A second appeal was then lodged with the Conservative National Council. A decision was expected to come down late last week, but as of press time on Wednesday evening (April 10), a final determination had yet to be made. Speaking to the Citizen this week, Ms. Shaughnessy confirmed that her team had submitted additional documentation to the National Council that, in her words, shows that ineligible members had voted during the local process.

“Mr. Khattra, he led an aggressive campaign that did, according to my affidavits, violate membership rules. He alone is responsible, in my opinion, for putting the Conservative Party in this difficult position,” Ms. Shaughnessy said. “I firmly believe this was about self-interest rather than what was best for Dufferin-Caledon. I believe if he had acted more ethically and followed the party rules, like the other candidates did, then we would not be in this position.”

She added, “The extra information we sent through to the National Council… It was about inconsistencies in the database. It was what I had identified previously, it was that we definitely had people from Brampton who considered their (primary) address to be in Brampton voting in Dufferin-Caledon.”

When asked if she was claiming that out-of-riding residents had been allowed to vote in this nomination process, Ms. Shaughnessy replied with a simple “yes”.

When approached by the Citizen, Mr. Khattra categorically denied the allegations, labelling them as false.

“There is nothing further that needs to be said beyond that,” Mr. Khattra stated.

When asked if he was surprised to hear of multiple appeals being launched, essentially contesting his nomination, Mr. Khattra simply maintained his belief that neither he, nor his team, had done anything wrong.

“Anyone would be surprised to hear an appeal. However, since my campaign didn’t do anything wrong, to my best belief, I’m anticipating a positive result in my favour,” Mr. Khattra said.

Reiterating why she felt it necessary to submit an appeal in the first place, Ms. Shaughnessy said she was simply following up on requests from “many, many people in the riding”.

“There was only one way for this process to be reviewed, and that was for one of the candidates to submit an official appeal. Originally, I had no plans to submit an appeal. It was only after two days of relentless emails and calls, and realizing that the other candidates (Mr. Weatherbee and Mr. Williams) wouldn’t be filing, that I decided to do it,” she explained. “I couldn’t ignore what I was hearing.”

She added, “For me, it really all comes down to democracy. I firmly believe in our democracy and I think our democracy was challenged by the actions of one of the candidates.”

On top of allegations that out-of-riding residents voted in the Dufferin-Caledon nomination, Ms. Shaughnessy last week claimed that ineligible international students “may, or may not, have voted” too during the process. During the nomination, only permanent residents and citizens of Canada were eligible to vote.

In other, more concerning, claims, Ms. Shaughnessy says she has spoken to individuals who have refused to divulge information “out of fear”.

“I want people to understand that individuals are now afraid to come forward. They are afraid of their position in their community and they are also afraid for their livelihood. Trying to garner more information has become increasingly difficult,” Ms. Shaughnessy said. “When I talk to members of the South Asian community, it’s clear they’re very divided on (Mr. Khattra). I have to say, some members have really stepped up to the plate because they do believe in our Canadian democracy and they have been willing to help.”

Asked when she expects to learn of the National Council’s decision, Ms. Shaughnessy said she really didn’t have a timeline, but noted the fact nothing had been heard yet at least showed the issue was being “strongly considered”.

“At this point, I’ve provided the National Council with everything that I can. I would love a decision. I’ve put myself out there, it would be nice to hear back, but all I can say is, if they’re taking their time, they’re taking their time because they understand the gravity of this issue. I would say they’re reviewing everything carefully. I’d rather they do that than come back quickly with a rushed decision,” she concluded.

In a further communication with the Citizen, Mr. Khattra stated he was simply moving forward in his role as Dufferin-Caledon Conservative nominee ahead of October’s federal election

“I have been meeting with residents and party members in the riding to discuss Justin Trudeau’s carbon tax, housing affordability and the challenges facing seniors. The Liberals are making life very unaffordable for middle class families in this riding,” Mr. Khattra said.

In conclusion, in referencing the appeal, Mr. Khattra said he has confidence in the system and is looking forward to the National Council making a final decision.

“Appeals are not uncommon in nomination races. The first appeal has already been rejected and I am waiting to hear back from National Council about the second appeal. I understand that some Conservative members may be disappointed that their candidate didn’t win, but we need to stay united to defeat Justin Trudeau and his failed policies in the fall,” Mr. Khattra said.

Angelo Esposito's candidacy in the election scheduled for October was confirmed by Josee Morissette, a Quebec spokeswoman for the party.

Esposito, 30, is a former National Hockey League first-round pick who starred in junior for the Quebec Remparts and the Montreal Junior Hockey Club.

He won a Memorial Cup with the Remparts in 2006 and also played for the Team Canada squad that won gold at the World Junior Hockey Championships in 2009.

Drafted by the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2007, Esposito never played in the NHL but carved out a professional career in the minors and Europe, which ended in 2016.

Esposito, who now works in real estate investment, will face off against incumbent Liberal MP Angelo Iacono in the riding of Alfred-Pellan in Laval, Que.

The riding was held by the Bloc Quebecois between 2004 and 2011 and the New Democrats between 2011 and 2015.

Notley’s party to a 44-seat majority in the 87-seat legislature, but it’s a mighty narrow map and relies on heaps of optimism, like the idea they can pick up Conservative ...","A bombshell new story by CBC Calgary has established that fraudulent email accounts were used to vote in the party leadership contest that put Jason Kenney within striking distance of the premier’s chair, and that the RCMP’s fraud investigation has called people on the United Conservative membership list about whether or not they actually voted.

It’s a terrible revelation that no political leader would want in the final week of a campaign. Electorally speaking, though, it might not amount to much.

If the Alberta economy were humming, the UCP campaign would probably collapse under the combined burden of this election fraud investigation, the “kamikaze” campaign, the party’s social conservatism and candidates exposed with intolerant and racist views. The provincial economy is not humming, however. It is not the ninth day of Christmas, with nine pipelines piping. Anxiety about the economy, jobs and pipeline have formed a hard crust atop voters’ priority list—there has been erosion, particularly with increasing negative sentiment toward Kenney himself emerging in polls, many of which have ticked upward for NDP in the cities. But the ethical morass through which Kenney seems to have won the UCP crown has rarely come up at the doorstep, sources in both parties say. Many voters appear willing to let controversies slide if they believe Kenney can scrap the carbon tax, stoke corporate investment and poke Justin Trudeau in the eye.

Even some in the NDP worry the fraud allegations are too complex or arcane to affect voters. Plus, this matter has been percolating all campaign long. One pollster suggested to Maclean’s that any negative impressions of Kenney’s leadership ethics are likely already baked into the numbers, and a deepening crisis won’t have much impact unless charges are laid (there are no indications that anything like that may occur before the April 16 election).

It’s late in the campaign for new information to add to the gusher and nasty campaign news the parties are dishing out. Much of the electorate is voting early this time—276,000 ballots were cast at advance polls in the first two days, already surpassing 2015’s levels with three more days of advance voting to go. If more damaging information emerges in the final days, it’s too late for that large swath of Albertans to make up their minds.

In saying these revelations might not matter, I’m by no means asserting they shouldn’t matter. If Kenney wins, it’s possible a police investigation into whether ID fraud was perpetrated in his 2017 leadership campaign will dog him for weeks, months or years. And what might this say about how he would govern? Here’s what I wrote when documents laid bare his sham candidate scheme:

This treachery reveals Kenney’s ruthlessly competitive streak, a keenness to pulverize competition at all costs… , it’s now fair to wonder where this impulse to crush will take him as premier. He has promised such pulverizing-the-foes zeal on what’s indisputably Alberta’s most critical file: oil pipelines. He’s promised a multi-pronged “fight back” strategy… Such aggression could win a pipeline that could have been won anyway, but Kenney would risk losing the now-stronger national public support for such projects at the same time as concern rises for climate action. He could succeed on one front, but become renowned elsewhere in Canada as a pro-oil thug.

So you’re telling me there’s a chance?

Even if it’s become a closer race than it started out, the NDP knows it’s still down. But it’s not ruling out a victory. Strategists have sketched out a map that brings Notley’s party to a 44-seat majority in the 87-seat legislature, but it’s a mighty narrow map and relies on heaps of optimism, like the idea they can pick up Conservative-held seats in Calgary. (Many Conservatives, meanwhile, believe they can win 65 or more.)

Here’s how the Notleyites think it could play out:

Starting point: The New Democrats won 54 seats last election: all 19 in Edmonton; 15 of 25 in Calgary; seven in the “donut” of bedroom communities around Edmonton; five in a clean sweep of Lethbridge, Medicine Hat and Red Deer; and eight in small-town and rural Alberta.

Edmonton: NDP would need to once again sweep Edmonton, which after redistricting has 20 seats. Polls show Notley’s party ahead in her hometown, but the UCP hopes to pick off seats in the west and in the southwest corner.

Around Edmonton: The party must regain seven, perhaps losing in Spruce Grove–Stony Plain but picking up in quasi-rural Morinville–St. Albert, which has a slice of the most progressive of Edmonton’s satellite cities. St. Albert is the party’s most probable hold in the area, along with Sherwood Park, and—they hope—Fort Saskatchewan–Vegreville and Leduc–Beaumont, where Municipal Affairs Minister Shaye Anderson is well-liked and well-bearded.

Calgary: A party source says they’re competitive in half of the city’s 26 seats (after boundary changes). If 13 are winnable, the party’s strength emanates from the core, with Finance Minister Joe Ceci (Calgary–Buffalo) and Justice Minister Kathleen Ganley (Calgary–Mountain View). The NDP is confident it can hang on to inner city seats Varsity, Currie and Klein, and finish strong in the city’s ethnic northeast, including McCall, the new North East and East—maybe add Falconridge, which the PCs won last time. Beyond that seems to involve magical thinking, as the northwest and south of city are stronger for the UCP.

Rest of Alberta: This orange-tinted-glasses view of Alberta’s map leaves the party needing four more seats for a majority. It has little hope in Medicine Hat, where the urban seat was split in two, or in Red Deer, whose incumbents had dismally little profile. Nearly all the rural northwest is a likely lost cause, including the seats held by the agriculture minister (Lac Ste. Anne–Parkland) and energy minister (Central Peace–Notley). The NDP like their chances of Environment Minister Shannon Phillips winning in Lethbridge–West, and a path back to majority likely requires Lethbridge–East. The UCP is expect Notley may keep Banff–Kananaskis. And the NDP covet two ridings with sizeable First Nations populations: Lesser Slave Lake and Maskwacis—Wetaskiwin. And, if the NDP dare to dream, they win the urban seat Grande Prairie in northwest Alberta. That’s four to six seats.

That’s the roadmap for the NDP, and officials concede they need a last-minute stampede away from Kenney for that to happen. Conservatives will laugh heartily at this scenario; some New Democrat campaigners will giggle nervously. But I’ll finish this point with an anecdote from the 2015 campaign trail.

In the afterglow of Notley’s 2015 debate performance, I asked one NDP contact how they were feeling. Great, came the reply. But that person looked at the ridings map and had no clue how the party could get past 30 seats. This individual has spent the last four years in cabinet.

Notley’s regret about her pipeline stance

Maclean’s contributing editor Jen Gerson interviewed an NDP premier fighting for her political survival, and trying to deflect Kenney’s assertions about a nefarious “Notley-Trudeau alliance” harming Alberta. “It’s not an alliance and it’s not a war,” Rachel Notley told Gerson. “It’s a mature intergovernmental relationship and, frankly, something that Albertans should expect from their leaders.”

Notley warns that Kenney’s climate stance and tough-guy approach could weaken the national case for the Trans Mountain pipeline. But she also acknowledges she could have done more for a different west-coast pipeline project.

Q: One of the criticisms that is lobbed against you is when you first came to power you opposed Northern Gateway. With the benefit of hindsight, do you regret opposing Northern Gateway? A: I would say that to some degree yes. I realize now that I have a better understanding of the takeaway capacity needs and pipeline needs of our industry, and I realize now what we’re coming up against and we see what’s happened with the differential. And the degree of uncertainty when you’re dealing with Line 3 and KXL. You’re a hostage to U.S. fortune there.

Graham Thomson on the bluster: “Alberta’s election fight has become a campaign of anger, frustration, fear and retaliation. That is a serious problem for Notley who, according to opinion polls, has a higher personal approval rating than Kenney—but that’s because she’s seen as being affable, optimistic and hopeful, things that helped her win the 2015 election. She does not do anger well. Then there’s Kenney, who is pretty much a one-man anger machine. He has spent the past two years helping stoke a sense of frustration and alienation in Alberta until it’s white hot.” (iPolitics)

Dean Bennett on Notley’s grim warning: “Asked how Kenney’s UCP would attack minorities, (Notley) said it was clear from comments made by some of Kenney’s candidates. ‘There has been a systematic problem with the UCP in terms of many of the attitudes that have been articulated by their candidates,’ she said. ‘There are many, many people within the UCP that have troubling views and I don’t believe ought to be invited into our government in Edmonton.’ The UCP has rejected or seen a number of candidates or potential candidates step down over Islamophobic or homophobic remarks. Kenney has said they represent a small number of a broad coalition and that his party believes in equality for all. He has touted its ethnically diverse slate of candidates.” (Canadian Press)

Elise von Scheel on small-town economic struggles: “Rose Klatt came to Olds, Alta., from the Philippines to fulfil a dream to open her own cafe. Her restaurant, with its bright green walls and authentic Filipino cuisine, quickly became a popular spot to catch up on local events. But the bell above her door rarely rings these days. The severe economic downturn in the province is dragging down her small community, she said, and nobody seems to have the money to eat out. A year after taking ownership of the cafe in this town an hour’s drive north of Calgary, Klatt said, she’s barely making enough to stay open.” (CBC)

Aaron Wherry on what Kenney means for Trudeau and Scheer: “There’s a dual risk here for Scheer — of being overshadowed by two premiers and of sinking his own chances by tying himself to provincial leaders courting controversy. It’s possible that, by October, many voters will be looking for a PM who is more likely to stand up to the premiers of Alberta and Ontario. The greater threat posed by Kenney and Ford is still to the prime minister’s own agenda and world view. But Kenney and Ford can at least do him the favour of clarifying the choice Trudeau wants to present to Canadians this fall.” (CBC)

Ex-NDP leader Tom Mulcair on Kenney’s Alberta-first inclinations: “It is a winning idea if that’s all you want to do, but if you realize that being connected to the rest of the country is necessary, if you do indeed want to get more access to other markets with the product that you’re making, which is of course petroleum and natural gas, you’ve got to work with the other provinces, and whatever government’s in Ottawa. Because even if Andrew Scheer were to win the next federal general election in October, there’s not question in my mind that he’d still have to work with B.C. and its current government there. Because I don’t see the army coming in and forcing the building of a pipeline.” (CTV Power Play)

Anne Francis on why Notley runs, literally: “Unlike some politicians who seem only to break out their runners for photo ops, Notley’s pretty committed. (Anyone who runs the Hypothermic Half in Edmonton in February, as Notley did in 2017, has to be.) A recent Globe and Mail story claims she credits her stamina on the campaign trail to her running, which makes sense to us. Another way you know she’s a committed runner is that, according to her campaign video (above), her best pals are her running pals… If the pundits are right, after Tuesday’s election Notley may be able to get back to training and racing with a little more frequency. And that’s never a bad thing.” (Canadian Running)","A voter-fraud scandal in Kenney’s party, but Alberta voters may be unmoved",Macleans.ca,https://www.macleans.ca/politics/a-voter-fraud-scandal-in-kenneys-party-but-alberta-voters-may-be-unmoved/
102,,2019-04-11T17:01:00.0000000Z,"The institute is expected to have three main areas of focus: clean energy, carbon pricing and adaptation. Conservative Party of Canada leader Andrew Scheer reacts to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's carbon pricing announcement in Parliament in Ottawa on Oct ...","The head of a new national climate change institute says she is ""perturbed"" by a recent partisan attack from the office of Ontario Premier Doug Ford.

The new institute, called the Pan-Canadian Expert Collaboration, is meant to hold Ottawa to account on its policies to reduce carbon pollution. The eligibility requirements for the competitive process that established it were that Ottawa would play “no role” in its governance, operations, board or activities.

But on Tuesday, David Tarrant, Ford’s executive director of strategic communications said that description was all “Liberal spin.” In a tweet, Tarrant cast a skeptical eye on the institute’s independence, calling it an “elite pro-carbon tax ‘institute’” that contained “puppets.”

Ford's office declined to cite any evidence to back up its claim that the new climate change accountability institute was biased.

Now, two leaders at the new group are speaking out, saying they have no intention of being “partisan.” They pointed to guardrails they say will ensure any federal government stays out of their affairs.

“I did not join this institute and agree to initially lead it unless I was assured that this would be independent, and arms-length,” Kathy Bardswick told National Observer Wednesday.

“In terms of its independence, I’m perturbed by this tweet. Yes, it’s being funded by way of startup by the feds, but it’s independently governed, and that governance structure is robust,” she said.

“We really need to change this dialogue (on climate change), move it away from this partisan starting point to one that is well grounded, credibly supported, inclusive, representing interests from coast to coast to coast, generating the kind of positive discussion that is absolutely essential.”

'The institute is not about partisan politics'

As a sustainability and insurance expert, Bardswick is the former president and CEO of The Co-operators Group, a major Canadian insurance co-op. According to a bio at Foresters Financial, she has been underwriting supervisor and regional vice president of the general insurance company at the Co-operators, and held multiple chief operating officer roles there as well.

Bardswick also sat on the government’s North American Free Trade Agreement Council on the Environment, alongside two former premiers, the former president of Shell Canada and others. The body was formed in 2017 to advise Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna on the environmental protections Ottawa was seeking in the trade talks to replace NAFTA.

She will be joined at the institute by Nancy Olewiler, an environmental economist and the director of the School of Public Policy at Simon Fraser University. Olewiler has been an adviser to that school’s Adaptation to Climate Change Team.

“The institute is not about partisan politics, but finding viable and effective policy solutions to sustain Canada's long-term prosperity,” Olewiler told National Observer.

“The new institute consists of academics from across Canada who are experts in their respective fields with long track records of producing highly credible evidence-based research,” she said.

“We have a robust governance framework that is independent of whomever is the federal government of the day. We want to get on with dealing with the significant issues that face our country and affect our future and intend to do so.”

The eligibility requirements stated that the institute must put in place a board of directors that would be responsible for its “management, strategic direction and financial accountability” as well as reporting requirements like a corporate plan, annual reports and audited financial statements.

These details would be hammered out in a contribution agreement signed between the institute and Environment and Climate Change Canada “within 60 business days of the notification of approval.” Bardswick said that agreement is still “a work in progress.”

McKenna said the institute will be ""eligible to receive up to $20 million over five years"" to implement its vision. The details of how that funding will be transferred are also still being worked out.

The board will have “fiduciary and strategic oversight guided by three expert panels,” Bardswick said. The institute is expected to have three main areas of focus: clean growth, adaptation and mitigation.

Tories in Ottawa terminated previous watchdog

Bardswick’s former workplace, The Co-operators Group, is no stranger to climate change-driven extreme weather events. Last August, it made its storm surge insurance coverage available to homeowners in New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador and Prince Edward Island for the first time, after Atlantic Canada was hit with significant flooding.

About three-quarters of insurance companies in Canada have introduced overland flood insurance as weather patterns change, the Insurance Bureau has said. Blair Feltmate, the head of a climate adaptation centre at the University of Waterloo, who is another leader at the new institute, said flooding is the number one cost to Canada, relative to extreme weather risk driven by climate change.

A major peer-reviewed scientific report released this month showed Canada is warming at double the average rate of the planet, and that the majority of this warming is likely caused by human activities like burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas, which release heat-trapping carbon pollution. The report showed climate change is heightening the risk of extreme heat waves, wildfires, floods and declining freshwater availability in Canada.

""Scenarios with limited warming will only occur if Canada and the rest of the world reduce carbon emissions to near zero early in the second half of the century and reduce emissions of other greenhouse gases substantially,"" it stated.

The Canadian government has previously funded a non-partisan and independent research organization that tackled similar issues. The National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy was created by the Tory government of former prime minister Brian Mulroney in 1988, but later shut down through a decision by the Harper government to terminate its $5 million in annual funding in 2012.

Shortly after, former environment minister Peter Kent suggested that the then-Conservative government could get similar advice from the internet and other research organizations, while former foreign affairs minister John Baird suggested that the government had no need for more reports about a carbon tax.

Asked about the institute Tuesday, Ford's director of media relations Simon Jefferies said ""elite economists may sit in their ivory towers and lecture hard-working families about the need to make everything more expensive, but they will never understand the struggle of counting the pennies and living paycheque to paycheque.""

""Supporting a carbon tax may win you brownie points in the faculty lounge or win the praise of jet-setting Hollywood elites, but it is not the only way to fight climate change,” he said. He pointed to the provincial government’s environment plan, which he claimed will meet federal carbon pollution reduction targets “without imposing a punishing, job-killing carbon tax on already stretched taxpayers.""

Jefferies was asked twice whether he has any evidence to back up Tarrant’s claim that the institute contains puppets. “My previous statement stands,” he said Wednesday, referring to his comments on “elites.”

On Wednesday, National Observer also asked federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer on Parliament Hill what he thought of the new institute, and whether he considered it a waste of money.

But instead of addressing this question directly, Scheer pointed to the backlash the government received over a $12-million federal contribution by McKenna to Loblaws to help make refrigerators in hundreds of their stores more energy efficient. The controversy arose because the company had hundreds of millions of dollars in net earnings last year.

“When you look at what the government’s been spending money on — the $12 million to a private company that has made hundreds of millions of dollars in profit, giving $12 million to Loblaws — while at the same time, charging Canadians higher fuel costs, higher home heating costs, we disagree with this government’s approach both to taxing Canadians and to their inaction on climate change,” Scheer said.

OTTAWA, April 9 (Reuters) - When Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took office in late 2015, he was a political golden boy who seemed destined to build on the legend of his father, who led the country for more than 15 years.

But six months ahead of an October election, polls suggest the 47-year-old politician with the broad smile and a penchant for colorful socks could become the first prime minister to lose power after a single majority mandate since the 1930s.

Trudeau is mired in a relentless scandal over alleged interference in a corporate corruption case that has led to the resignations of two Cabinet members, his top advisor and the head of the federal civil service.

The ruling Liberals have lost 6 percentage points since the start of the year, ceding the lead to the rival Conservatives, according to a Nanos Research poll published on Tuesday.

If an election were held now, the Conservatives would win 34.9 percent of the vote, the Liberals 32.8 percent and the left-leaning New Democratic Party 16.6 percent. The poll suggests the result would be deadlock or a fragile minority government.

""The Liberals have taken a hit, but they're still competitive,"" said pollster Nik Nanos. ""The most significant effect has been the negative impact on the prime minister's personal brand.""

An Ipsos poll from last month put the Conservatives at 40 percent, 10 points ahead of the Liberals.

Trudeau, the oldest son of the late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, has from the start pushed a progressive agenda in support of gender equality, the environment and aboriginal rights, all issues that appeal to his core voters, but which after more than three years sound increasingly scripted to some.

Trudeau is not helped by the optics of the scandal involving SNC-Lavalin Group Inc, a prominent Montreal-based engineering and construction firm that has been accused of bribing Libyan officials to get contracts between 2001 and 2011.

The prime minister has been on the defensive over allegations government officials inappropriately pressured Canada's former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to drop a criminal case against the company in favor of a deferred prosecution agreement, or out-of-court settlement.

Wilson-Raybould, the first indigenous justice minister in Canadian history, resigned over the scandal. Former Treasury Board chief Jane Philpott also quit in protest. They were two of the highest-profile women in Trudeau's Cabinet.





POLITICAL PIVOT

So far, Trudeau's strategy appears to have changed little, and people close to him say he plans ride it out without major shifts in strategy.

""Successful politicians know when to pivot, and they have a strong survival instinct,"" Nanos said, calling the scandal the ""first major test of Justin Trudeau's leadership.""

Ipsos pollster Darrell Bricker said even before the crisis erupted in early February, Trudeau's support had been softening amid complaints he had broken major commitments such as reforming the voting system and balancing the budget by 2019.

""Justin Trudeau was standing on thin ice at the end of last year, and then somebody handed him an anvil and crash, the ice broke,"" Bricker said.

""There's a credibility problem driven by a bunch of things, one of which is promises made and not kept.""

In a bid to finally put the scandal behind him, Trudeau expelled Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from the Liberal caucus last week.

Neither minister has gone quietly, and on Tuesday Philpott disputed the legitimacy of the expulsions.

On Sunday, Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer revealed that Trudeau had threatened to sue him for libel over a Facebook post about the scandal.

Saskatchewan grain farmer Mehgin Reynolds (who is seeking a Conservative party nomination) told MPs that, for instance, her four-year crop rotation includes lentils, barley, canola and durum ...","Ottawa, ON — Canola farmers whose livelihoods have been targeted by China in its feud with Canada say it’s time for the federal government to be aggressive at the political level in its fight against a growing number of agricultural trade barriers around the world.

Several producers told two parliamentary committees Tuesday that China’s recent rejection of Canadian canola-seed shipments is only the latest trade disruption that’s hurt the country’s agriculture sector.

They reminded MPs in Ottawa about a number of major trade obstacles faced by Canadian agricultural exporters in faraway markets like India, Italy, Vietnam and Saudi Arabia.

“Canada can feed the world but not if our government does not act strongly on our behalf, removing non-tariff trade barriers, enforcing existing trade agreements and removing political roadblocks,” Alberta canola farmer Stephen Vandervalk told the House of Commons agriculture committee.

Citing concerns about pests, China has rejected canola-seed imports from Canada and has suspended the licences of two major Canadian exporters.

The moves to cut off the critical Canadian export have been widely viewed as China applying economic pressure on Canada in response to the December arrest of senior Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver at the behest of the United States.

Any extended canola dispute with China, which imported $2.7 billion worth of canola seed from Canada last year, would deliver a painful economic blow to producers, the supply chain and the wider Canadian economy.

The price of canola has fallen since the dispute started last month. The late-winter timing of the disruption has been particularly difficult because it’s forced many farmers to suddenly rethink the planting decisions vital to their businesses.

On Tuesday, producers made it clear to MPs at the committees that even with the urgency around the China conflict, the pain is not only about canola. Canadian farmers, they said, are staring at other big trade hurdles in world markets.

Several of the witnesses mentioned issues that have affected Canada’s durum wheat exports to Italy, wheat sales to Vietnam, pulse exports to India and feed-barley shipments to Saudi Arabia.

Saskatchewan grain farmer Mehgin Reynolds (who is seeking a Conservative party nomination) told MPs that, for instance, her four-year crop rotation includes lentils, barley, canola and durum wheat — all products that face obstacles on foreign markets.

“The frightening reality is that almost every crop being grown in Canada is currently struggling with one trade barrier or another,” Reynolds said.

The Liberal government has insisted it wants to find a scientific solution to the canola dispute, in keeping with China’s insistence that the problem is tainted seeds.

The Liberals have established a working group that includes officials from Richardson International Ltd. and Viterra Inc. — the two exporters that have had their licences to sell canola revoked by China — and representatives from the governments of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau has requested to send a delegation of experts to China to examine the issue. She’s said officials are exploring options to support farmers by expanding existing programs.

Canola producer Mark Kaun told the committee it’s time for the Canadian government to start playing “hardball.”

“There’s a pile of imports that come into this country from China — and maybe some of their ships should sit and wait in the water,” Kaun said. “Canadian canola is contaminated — it’s contaminated with political dirt and bureaucracy.”

“This is a political issue plain and simple. Political problems need political solutions,” agreed Vandervalk, who’s also vice-president representing Alberta with the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association.

“If we must play the game of grain inspections, so be it. But in the meantime Canadian grain farmers are the ones paying the price for the political failings.”",Farmers demand strong political response to expanding trade obstacles for Canada,canadianshipper.com,https://www.canadianshipper.com/transportation-and-logistics/farmers-demand-strong-political-response-expanding-trade-obstacles-canada/1003379685/

House of Commons Speaker Geoff Regan ruled Thursday that he has no role or responsibility to police how political party caucuses conduct themselves even if Philpott and Wilson-Raybould now feel “rudderless.”

House of Commons Speaker Geoff Regan said Jane Philpott’s rights as an MP and those of Jody Wilson-Raybould were not violated. ( Sean Kilpatrick / The Canadian Press )

A new law “leaves caucuses alone with the authority to govern their internal operations,” Regan said. He said the law that Philpott was now citing explicitly stated even courts cannot review caucus decisions. “With the full authority given to caucuses themselves in such unequivocal terms, it is clear that the chair has no role in the interpretation or enforcement of this statute, even when members feel rudderless without what they feel would be clearly stated and understood rules.” The Speaker did not specifically investigate or conclude whether the Liberal caucus failed to follow proper procedures in 2015.

That’s when the Reform Act, which modified the Parliament of Canada Act, took effect and required official party caucuses to take four votes in a “recorded” manner after a general election. Those votes decide whether the caucus will adopt new powers for caucuses to have a greater say in decisions related to caucus discipline, leadership review or interim party leader. In asking Regan to intervene on Tuesday, Philpott had cited a Star report that revealed the Liberal caucus did not vote in a recorded manner in 2015. Instead the Liberal caucus came to a “consensus,” according to Liberal MP John McKay, to leave the power to decide on caucus expulsions or readmissions with the prime minister. The government and caucus chair have refused to confirm or deny how the caucus reached that consensus. Philpott said it was a breach of her privileges as an MP, and those of the former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould who backed her request to the Speaker. But Regan ruled only political party caucuses have the responsibility for ensuring proper voting procedures were followed, and their privileges were not violated even if the Liberal caucus had not done so. Trudeau had insisted the decision to eject them “was mine to make,” lawful, and backed by a united caucus.

He ejected Philpott and Wilson-Raybould last week saying they repeatedly refused to express confidence in his government and his leadership. Philpott fired back in the House of Commons.

“Expulsion should not be his decision to take unilaterally,” Philpott said Tuesday, calling it a question of fairness, due process, and the rule of law. Regan, who is an elected Liberal MP, said his only role as Speaker is to receive a letter from the caucus advising whether it made a determination on the questions. “The Speaker’s role stops there. It does not, in any way, extend to interpreting the results of the votes, how the votes were taken, or interpreting any other relevant provisions.” Philpott sits as an independent MP for Markham-Stouffville. Wilson-Raybould is the MP for Vancouver Granville. Neither has committed to running again in the fall federal election. They quit Trudeau’s cabinet over the prime minister’s handling of Wilson-Raybould’s allegations that Trudeau and his team tried to politically pressure Wilson-Raybould to overrule the public prosecutor and mediate a settlement in the corruption trial of Quebec’s SNC-Lavalin firm.

In the 13 provincial ...","Surekhas On The Snye owner Surekha Kanzig in her restaurant in Fort McMurray on Tuesday, April 2, 2019. The fine dining restaurant is the first business to open in the Snye and riverfront redevelopment area.

A spring snow falls as Fort McMurray Golf Club’s food, beverage and event director Colleen Stewart stands in front of the club’s new $9-million clubhouse in Fort McMurray on Wednesday, April 3, 2019. The original clubhouse was destroyed in the 2016 wildfire.

Fort McMurray — This city is smaller, not lesser, since the 2016 wildfire. Its businesses and people are challenged, not beaten by the federal policies and global economic turmoil that have slowed the pace of its valuable oilsands being pulled from the ground.

This region, the so-called economic engine of Canada, is idling rather than seized.

“I believe that our community has seen more headwinds in the last five years than it has in the 34 years that I’ve lived here,” said Keith McGrath, one of 10 councillors for the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, which includes Fort McMurray. “I’ve seen some spikes, I’ve seen some downturns, but this one hurts the most.”

In the four years since the last provincial election upset Alberta’s decades-old political status quo, no other part of the province has experienced as drastic a socio-economic slip-and-slide, save perhaps for Calgary, which is the head to Fort McMurray’s heart of oil production.

Now, mere days from a vote that again promises significant political change for Alberta, the most pressing needs and wants of a city and region tied inexorably to the health of the oilsands are obvious: a provincial government that can get a pipeline or two approved and built, and ensure that reasonable tanker access on the West Coast is restored. And, if it’s not too much trouble, a Costco would be nice.

Homeowners, business owners and the regional government need political help from above, and many are pinning their hopes on the right-wing United Conservative Party, in keeping with the region’s historical political leanings. In the 13 provincial elections dating back to 1971, when McMurray first appeared on a riding header, voters have elected 11 Progressive Conservatives, a Liberal in 1993, a Social Credit candidate in 1971 and two Wildrose MLAs in 2015. The 2018 byelection in Fort McMurray-Conklin sent UCP candidate Laila Goodridge to the legislature.

The city, now split between the provincial ridings of Fort McMurray-Lac La Biche and Fort McMurray-Wood Buffalo, had seen voter turnout dwindle from highs of 50 and 60 per cent in the 1970s to embarrassing lows. Just under 20 per cent of Wood Buffalo voters cast ballots in 2008, for instance. The 2015 election coincided with a slumping economy and the region’s voters were hungry for change, with 42 per cent casting ballots in Fort McMurray-Wood Buffalo, 44 per cent in Fort McMurray-Conklin. But both numbers were still well under the provincial average.

There are fewer voters here now, as the population slumped significantly after the wildfire. But those who stayed, rebuilding homes and lives against significant odds, are motivated to make this city and region stronger. The will comes from the same pioneer spirit, entrepreneurial bent and unflagging work ethic that convinced thousands to drive stakes into the ground during good times here a decade ago.

“It’s a town that a lot of us still believe in,” said Jean-Marc Guillamot, area director of the Fort McMurray Hotel Group, and a resident since 2007. “We believe to a certain degree that it’s going to get better. We don’t want it crazy again, because crazy is not really good. As long as it’s consistent and everyone makes a living, the city can hang onto that.

“A lot of people don’t want to leave because everyone still living here is making very good money. You cannot earn the wages you earn in Fort McMurray anywhere else. I cannot earn what I’m earning here anywhere else in Canada in my industry. I know I have it good. Sure, it’s not an easy life in the sense that you work a lot, but you play a lot. When you play, you play.”

Taking the bad with the good

Life in the community 450 kilometres northeast of Edmonton isn’t for everyone, and the one-two punch of an economic downturn and a wildfire that caused $3.6 billion in damage made it harder by degrees for many, financially impossible for some. The regional population dipped to 111,687 last year from 125,032 people in 2015. The so-called shadow population (those living in work camps, hotels and temporary accommodations) fell to 36,678 from 43,084, while Fort McMurray saw a drop to 75,009 from 81,948 people.

“Your house burned down and two months later you lose your job — not uncommon,” said Colleen Stewart, assistant general manager at the Fort McMurray Golf Club. “I just can’t imagine that. A lot of people (in that situation) would move back to where their families are.”

But so many who came for six months and stayed for 20 years, as they like to say up here, are still happy with their choice and willing to ride out the downturn. Stewart said her three rental condos have each lost 40 per cent in value and her primary residence is down 25 per cent.

“For the longest time we took the good. We have to take the bad with the good,” said Stewart, who has a job she loves and the will to keep going. “It’s not the best right now but you ride it out.”

Businesspeople like Justin Herman are doing what they can at the local level to mitigate the damage done at the macro level. He and a partner converted their safety company into Saskana Staffing — providing temporary workers for industry — and have seen it grow by 500 per cent in two years, he said. He’s also director of strategic products for Minestar Group, an Aboriginally-owned engineering, construction and contracting firm, and runs another management business.

“What myself and my business partners have been doing is all the right things so we’re in control of what happens,” Herman said. “That’s why we diversified our business into multiple streams of service lines, so it’s not contingent on one service line or one company or one client. I think what you’ll see is a lot stronger businesses come through this downturn.”

The goal is a stronger, larger community too. Even as local political and business leaders push for more oil export capacity, they tangle with industry over the fly in-fly out (FIFO) issue, which sees thousands of camp-based workers commute through industry-run aerodromes outside the city without spending much time or money in the local communities. In January, council voted to impose a moratorium on new camps within 75 kilometres of the urban core and won’t renew permits for existing facilities. Industry cited commute times and expressed opposition to the ban, which will reportedly affect 27,000 workers at 61 camps.

“If the status quo was maintained, we’re looking to move about 50 per cent of the camp-based population back into the community over the next 10 years,” said Chamber of Commerce president Bryce Kumka. “Ten thousand households would be fantastic. That would make the community population about 130,000 and that would give us some stability and sustainability.”

Both the real estate and rental markets could absorb those workers and hopefully their families with relative ease, as vacancy rates exceed 25 per cent. And it’s estimated that built-out infrastructure like sewer and water utilities, roads and overpasses could handle a two-fold or three-fold increase in residents.

“We like it when it’s busy, but right now I don’t have to line up at the grocery store, I don’t have to line up at the gas station,” said Kumka. “I don’t have to make reservations at Earls two weeks in advance to go for lunch.”

That’s the upside to the downside. But there has been amalgamation of oilsands companies, major cuts to capital spending by the remaining players like Suncor, CNRL and Husky, and significant downsizing. Last month, Imperial Oil cited the Alberta government’s mandatory production cuts of 325,000 barrels per day as the reason the company slowed development of its $2.6 billion Aspen in-situ project planned for north of the city.

There is a trickle-down effect in good times and collateral damage in bad; people bought $1 million residences at the height of an over-heated market, confident that significant rental income would allow them to make even more significant mortgage payments. Suddenly they’re over-extended.

“It’s disconcerting when we’re seeing people losing their homes,” continued Kumka. “That’s never a good thing and it’s amplified in a small community. We talk about seven degrees of separation. In Fort McMurray, one or two is the realistic separation of people knowing people. So when something happens to somebody here, everybody knows about it. And when it’s negative, they’re giving their house back to the bank or one of their rental properties back to the bank, that hurts.”

Building respect

The regional government is committed to downtown revitalization, riverfront development and expansion of sport and Northern Lights tourism opportunities. But even if successful, those initiatives will only be drops in a bucket.

“So what are we going to do? We’re going to make the community much better respected,” said Kevin Weidlich, president of Wood Buffalo Economic Development Corporation.

Oilsands production accounted for $44 billion in 2017, about 2.6 per cent of the country’s Gross Domestic Product, and Canadians shouldn’t take that for granted, he said. There is also an historical misunderstanding of Fort McMurray that must be corrected.

“It really is a community. It’s not just an open pit mine,” said Weidlich, who moved to the city from Edmonton in January. “There is a population here of just shy of 100,000 people that come from all walks of life. It’s a unique cosmopolitan community. It’s got that whole vibe of being an expatriate place.”

Economic development and tourism merged forces earlier this month, and their mandate is to market the region for its world-class recreational facilities, newly competitive house prices and built-out infrastructure, elevated high school graduation rate, and those long, hot summer nights.

If successful, the campaign could reduce national and international bias against the oil and gas sector and remove psychological barriers to local population growth.

“If everyone would prefer to live here, FIFO as an issue isn’t as great,” said Weidlich.

No matter the economics, plenty of people still prefer to live and invest here. The clubhouse at the 27-hole Fort McMurray Golf Club, which was reduced to ashes by the wildfire, has been replaced. An insurance payout and loan funded a majestic $9-million temple of golf that will boast the region’s nicest patio. It opened in April and stands as testament to the get-it-done attitude of people who love to work hard and play hard.

“To even bring you here, you need to have that personality,” said Stewart. “Once you’re here, you work hard or you’re on vacation. People work, work, work, work. There’s no Monday to Friday, working on your house on weekends. It’s not really like that. You’re here, there’s money to be made in working hard. And there are challenges too.”

When a barrel of Western Canadian Select soared above $90 and then $110 in 2007 and 2008, wages and house prices spiked. Advertising campaigns for restaurants and bars amounted to nothing more than opening the door, provided they could hire enough staff. The city had perhaps 1,700 hotel rooms and every one was full on a Tuesday.

In the winter of 2007, Guillamot couldn’t find enough labour for the Clearwater Suites Hotel, so guests who agreed to pluck their own toiletries and towels from a housekeeping trolley in the hall were charged $249 a night. Full service rooms went for $299. And for $79, you slept in your truck in the underground garage, ate a complimentary breakfast in the lobby restaurant and took a shower in the spa the next morning.

That was peak Fort McMurray. Times have changed.

Guillamot said his group’s 882 rooms amounts to 40 per cent of the city inventory, and the occupancy rate is a whopping 41 per cent. That’s well below the 65 per cent threshold he said is needed to maintain capital expenditure on upkeep, and provide for a healthy profit margin. So he concentrates on market retention, and hopes, like many others here, that the federal and provincial governments will lead the economic recovery or at the very least get the heck out of the way.

“People clapped their hands because we got a section of Highway 63 twinned,” recalled Coun. McGrath. “Well, that was just a small piece on an elephant’s behind for what we’ve given the province and the feds in royalties. It’s everybody’s resource, not just Fort McMurray’s resource, but the province and the federal government could have been a lot friendlier to Fort McMurray than they have been.”

Restaurateur trusts her instincts, opens European-style cafe

Surekha Kanzig’s name is on the restaurant, her life savings poured into it, her positive energy flowing through it.

Surekha’s On The Snye will celebrate its first anniversary early next month. It is the only tangible result of the regional municipality’s attempt at riverfront development, and a sign of Kanzig’s faith in her community and her own gut instinct.

At the best of times, launching a European-style café with a fine dining menu in this city would be a major risk. These are not the best of economic times. And Kanzig was well aware that many restaurants fail in the first year.

“Everything on paper and in everybody’s brain and my brain said don’t do this. Even my lawyer said don’t do this. My accountant said don’t do it. Everybody said don’t do it. My kids looked at me like I had horns growing out of my head.

“So, I don’t know, almost blind faith. You’ve got to trust your instinct and hope that things will get better. I’ve been here since 1990. This is my fourth time in a down cycle and it always comes back up. You’ve just got to make it through that until you get back up again for air.”

Her restaurant is the former Snye Amenities Building, which was a hub of activity during the Western Canada Summer Games in 2015. Kanzig was intrigued when the municipality put out a request for proposals to repurpose the place.

“I mean, a building that looks like this is pretty rare,” she said. “A building that looks like this on the waterfront in Fort McMurray is even rarer. My hope is that as we develop the waterfront there will be more matching amenities.”

Her first year in the restaurant business has seen its ups and downs.

Kanzig thinks less about her gamble now than she did in the dead of winter.

“I wouldn’t say we’re flourishing. We’re doing OK … If you had asked me two months into it, three months into it, if you had asked me when we were in the six weeks of 40 below (temperatures) and nobody wanted to come out and we’ve got staff working and an empty dining room, it was a little bit worrisome.”

Patio season is almost here, and soon there will be a more regular flow of locals and tourists through Snye Point Park. Kanzig’s restaurant has changed the dining scene here and she hopes to change the larger conversation.

“Let’s do our little bit to make our own lives better. Try to change the verbiage, the attitude. We have a lot of positive things still happening in Fort McMurray.”

With both the Trans Mountain expansion and Keystone XL pipeline projects in court limbo, attention is turning to alternative ideas to expand Canada’s ability to continue to get its oil to market.

In a report to Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi last month, the National Energy Board said current pipeline capacity is fully utilized and crude-by-rail infrastructure is operating at or near capacity.

But it also identified potential long-term market access solutions that could include more oilsands bitumen upgrading and reversing existing import pipelines.

Unfortunately, none of those ideas works as a meaningful short-term alternative to new pipelines — and they face many of the same speed bumps — says NEB chief economist Jean-Denis Charlebois.

“Fundamentally, what this would require is regulatory approvals and significant capital investments because those things cannot occur overnight,” he said in an interview.

“First the economics have to be there … then those alternatives need to go through a regulatory process.”

A dearth of investment dollars for traditional drilling in Western Canada means there are also fewer dollars available for developing creative options, said Kevin Birn, a vice-president with IHS Energy in Calgary.

“I think you will have some creativity but if you really want creativity, they’ve got to see a future for investment in Western Canada,” he said.

Here’s a closer look at some pipeline alternative solutions.

The diluent dilemma

Raw bitumen at room temperature has the consistency of peanut butter. Below freezing, it’s as hard as a hockey puck.

To make it flow in a pipeline, producers mix as many as three barrels of light oil “diluent” for every seven barrels of bitumen — if one can eliminate or reduce the diluent, it frees up room in the pipeline.

In January, the Alberta government announced a $440-million loan guarantee to help Value Creation Inc. build a $2-billion upgrader that would convert diluted bitumen into medium synthetic crude and diesel, both capable of flowing undiluted in a pipeline.

The facility is the first in line for up to $1 billion in provincial incentives for partial upgraders, but it isn’t expected to be operating until at least 2022.

A report prepared for the province in 2017 suggested that a 100,000-barrel-per-day partial upgrading facility could add $10 to $15 of value to each barrel of bitumen. The report listed 10 pre-commercial technologies that have been tested or proposed for deployment in Alberta.

Any plan to reduce diluent must consider the impact on U.S. customers, who have configured their refineries to use diluted bitumen, said Birn.

He added diluent will still be needed to deliver the bitumen from the field to the partial upgrader, which means diluent recovery units likely also will need to be built.

New technology

No diluent at all would be required with a new technology to mix and coat bitumen with recycled plastic and form it into solid pucks for shipping in ordinary railcars or shipping containers.

An oil company affiliated with the tiny Heart Lake First Nation in northern Alberta is building a $50-million pilot plant to test the “CanaPux” product developed by Canadian National Railway Co.

But it’s not known when a commercial facility would follow.

Pipeline efficiency

Reducing the demand for diluent in Canada could help Enbridge decide on the option to convert its Southern Lights pipeline — used to import U.S. condensate diluent into Canada — into a crude oil export pipeline with capacity of about 150,000 bpd, possibly by 2023.

Meanwhile, the operator of the biggest oil export pipeline network in Canada is getting creative as it looks at using drag reducing agents inside the pipe and redirecting some downstream U.S. injections to open up long-haul capacity for Western Canada, along with low-cost pipeline and pumping station upgrades.

It thinks it could add another 50,000 to 100,000 bpd of incremental export space by mid-year and is studying a potential 450,000 bpd of throughput optimization initiatives.

Crude-by-rail

Rail exports rose to a record of over 350,000 bpd in December before falling in January and February after Alberta imposed production cuts to reduce storage and open up space on pipelines.

They are on the rise again as Alberta loosens its production quotas and Imperial Oil Ltd. restarts rail shipments it stopped in February.

Crude shipped by rail often contains diluent but the NEB notes more oil can be put in each car if the oil isn’t diluted — although that requires the use of cars that can be heated at the destination dock to drain the bitumen.

Meanwhile, Alberta’s NDP government is pressing ahead with plans to add locomotives and railcars to move 120,000 barrels per day of crude, starting at the end of the year — although the opposition United Conservative Party has vowed to kill the order if it wins the provincial election this week.

The poll was an early effort to look at the state of manners in our country and pinpoint some regional and generational differences.

There are many reasons that compel Canadians to swear. There is a difference in the words that we might use or hear when someone cuts us off the road while driving, or to describe the disappointing actions of a co-worker to a supervisor.

article continues below

This time, we asked Canadians about the words they hear and the words they use in four different types of conversations that may happen throughout the course of a regular day. The results show that there are situations where familiarity enables us to curse, and others where manners seem to prevail.

For starters, more than half of Canadians say they hear swear words “frequently” or “occasionally” when they are talking with friends (68%), strangers (55%), relatives (53%) and co-workers (52%).

While more than one in four Canadians (27%) say they never hear curse words in the workplace, the proportion drops when it comes to listening to relatives (15%), strangers (14%) and friends (10%).

In three provinces – British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Manitoba – seven in 10 residents (70%) report hearing swears from their friends “frequently” or “occasionally.” The most bleepable workplaces appear to be located in Ontario, where 54% of residents say their co-workers swear.

The first question deals with what we remember hearing. When it comes to our own choice of words, most Canadians (52%) admit to uttering swears “frequently” or “occasionally” when they are having a conversation with friends, but fewer say they rely on curse words when chatting with relatives (40%), co-workers (34%) and strangers (23%).

There is an elevated sense of caution in specific circumstances. Half of Canadians (49%) say they never swear when talking to strangers and two in five (41%) say they never swear when talking to co-workers.

British Columbians lead the entire country in relying on swear words “frequently” or “occasionally” when talking with friends (56%). Residents of Manitoba and Saskatchewan are first on personal swearing with relatives (45%), co-workers (41%) and strangers (26%).

Age is a factor in what we say, more than in what we hear. Canadians aged 18 to 34 are decidedly more likely to swear when chatting with friends (73%), relatives (55%), co-workers (47%) and even strangers (33%) than their older counterparts.

There is no definitive rule on when and how it is acceptable to swear. Almost half of Canadians (48%) admit that they sometimes alter the way they speak so as not to swear in front of certain people. The proportion of “conditional” swearers is highest among the youngest adult age group (57%) as well as residents of Saskatchewan and Manitoba (52%), Ontario (50%) and British Columbia (50%).

Just under two in five Canadians (38%) say they always modify the way they speak to make sure they do not swear in public. This very polite group encompasses 40% of women, 42% of baby boomers and 43% of Quebecers.

This leaves a small proportion of Canadians (14%) who claim to never alter the way they speak, and who simply do not worry about it if a swear word comes out.

On a political basis, there is no difference in the public behaviour of Liberal and Conservative voters when it comes to swearing. Equal proportions of supporters of either party in the last federal election “always” (43%), “sometimes” (43%) or “never” (14%) change the way they speak.

New Democratic Party (NDP) voters – who can point to these findings as proof of their long-standing assertion that Canada’s two major parties are the same – are less likely to “always” change their words (31%) and more likely to “sometimes” do so (58%).

Two findings leave us asking more questions. First, the gender gap is exceptionally pronounced when it comes to swearing in the workplace. While 46% of women say they never curse when chatting with co-workers, the proportion drops to 35% among men. This might point to men being more likely to get away with “locker room” talk.

Second, those in the 18-to-34 age group are the least likely to say that they never change how they speak to prevent curse words (9%), compared to 15% for baby boomers and 17% for generation X. Canada’s youngest adults have grown up in a time of looser censorship guidelines, particularly when it comes to language on television, movies and music. It is not shocking to see four-letter words in their regular thesaurus.

Because Canadian think tanks ...","The country’s various research and policy institutes “are highly adept at getting their messages heard in today’s crowded ideas marketplace,” says one expert.

As an Anishinaabe scholar who spent much of his childhood on a reserve in Central Ontario, Hayden King says he’s always found it frustrating to hear non-Indigenous experts, many of them from think tanks with ties to big business, weighing in publicly on issues that affect Canada’s First Nations. That’s why Dr. King, a widely-published expert on Indigenous nationhood and colonialism in Canada who has held academic positions at three Ontario universities – McMaster, Carleton and Ryerson – jumped at the offer to co-found and become the first executive director of the new Yellowhead Institute.

Launched last June and housed at Ryerson, the institute bills itself as Canada’s first and only think tank rooted in First Nations community networks and devoted to Indigenous self-determination. “Our goal is to provide useful analysis and produce accessible material to help communities prepare for the speed and scope of the many critical policy changes that are happening right now in Canada,” says Dr. King, who leads a small team of mostly Indigenous researchers – a core he hopes to build on by recruiting young First Nations’ academics. “It’s time that Indigenous people were considered experts in their own lives,” he says.

By the numbers

While there is no single definition of what constitutes a think tank, they are generally seen as a grouping of scholars, academics and other professionals who conduct policy-related research, analysis and advocacy on issues linked to a specific area of interest. In Canada there are roughly 100 such organizations, according to Canada’s think tank expert, Donald Abelson. This pales in comparison to the estimated 7,000 in operation worldwide, including nearly 2,000 in the United States alone.

But what Canada lacks in think tank numbers it makes up for by the quality of their work and the influence they exert, says Dr. Abelson, who has authored numerous papers and books on the subject, including Northern Lights: Exploring Canada’s Think Tank Landscape, published in 2016 by McGill-Queen’s University Press, and Do Think Tanks Matter? Assessing the Impact of Public Policy Institutes, also published by MQUP, the third edition of which was just released in November.

Formerly a political science professor at Western University, where he also served as chair of the department, Dr. Abelson was named last August as the founding director of one of Canada’s newest think tanks, the Brian Mulroney Institute of Government at St. Francis Xavier University, where he will also hold the inaugural ECN Capital Chair in Canada-U.S. Relations.

Dr. Abelson sees a bright future for think tanks as key players in modern democratic societies – not to mention an interesting source of employment for academics young and old – provided the groups are transparent and credible with regards to funding, research and intellectual integrity. “Think tanks are highly adept at getting their messages heard in today’s crowded ideas marketplace,” he says.

Policy-relevant research

It is difficult to define think tanks because no two are alike in terms of mission, scope or funding, says Dr. Abelson. “One thing all of them share at their core is an ongoing commitment to producing timely and policy-relevant research,” he says. “What distinguishes and defines them is their sources and levels of funding.”

While some think tanks charge fees for their services, the majority rely heavily on fundraising. “The bulk of their money comes from four main sources: philanthropy, corporations, private sources and government,” says Dr. Abelson. “A very small number have endowed funding.”

Complicating the landscape further is the fact that some think tanks, including the Yellowhead Institute and the Mulroney Institute of Government, are housed on university campuses. “Campuses offer advantages because salaries and other costs get covered … and you can put on seminars and conferences,” says Dr. Abelson. “You can add layers to the cake.”

He warns, however, that the success of campus-based think tanks depends on the host university’s long-term commitment. “It’s one thing to have start-up money, but it all really boils down to having a sustainable funding model,” he says. “Many think tanks start off with a bang and quickly fizzle because they couldn’t sustain their funding.”

Canada’s most notable think tank failure, he says, was the North-South Institute. Established in 1976 as an independent policy research institute dedicated to international development (hence its motto, “Research for a Fairer World”), it ceased operations in 2014 when federal government funding, which represented more than half of its budget, dried up. “It was one of the premier think tanks in the world,” says Dr. Abelson. “But its funding wasn’t as diversified as it should have been.”

A bit of history

The 19th-century European antecedents to modern think tanks were learned societies like London’s Fabian Society, which promoted democratic socialism as a way to bring about reforms peacefully instead of through armed revolution. The think tank movement caught hold in America in the early 20th century, when philanthropist groups like the Carnegie Foundation and the Brookings Institute sought to help governments think their way through complex societal issues.

That momentum led to the later emergence of specialized groups like the Rand Corporation and the Urban Institute in the 1930s and 1940s. By the 1950s and ’60s, the emergence of a strong corporate mentality in the U.S. led to the rise of modern advocacy think tanks, which are the main focus of Dr. Abelson’s research.

“They moved away from a research model to one focused more on the marketing of ideas to influence policy makers,” he says. “It marked a watershed in the evolution of think tanks.”

According to Dr. Abelson, the new model enabled think tanks to influence government policy like never before – none more successfully than the Heritage Foundation. Created in 1973 with massive financing from big business, it assembled dozens of conservative academics and thinkers from across the U.S. who drew up the blueprint for Ronald Reagan’s presidency in the early 1980s.

Their 1,000-page report, which was hand delivered to Ed Meese, Reagan’s chief policy advisor, contained plans for both foreign and domestic policies ranging from deregulation, tax reform and privatization to what eventually became the Strategic Defence Initiative, nicknamed Star Wars. “Reagan was the poster boy for how influential think tanks can be and why they matter,” says Dr. Abelson. “They helped give structure, meaning and direction to his presidency.”

In Canada, Dr. Abelson says think tanks have been less successful in penetrating the political decision-making process. “They are not as prevalent here because ideas tend to come from the caucus and the party,” he says.

Because Canadian think tanks also have far less money at their disposal, Dr. Abelson says many of them put added value in their independence and research capabilities, and are more nuanced in their opinions. “They have to be careful not to be seen as appendages of the groups or movements they are affiliated with or their funds might dry up,” he says. “They need to be seen as doing quality work as independent bodies.”

Most Canadian think tanks, he adds, do a “very good job” of finding a niche to fill. “Their mortality rate is very low,” he says. “The most successful ones don’t alienate others.”

Two broad categories

Guillaume Lamy, a doctoral student at the Université du Québec à Montréal who has also researched think tanks, has a slightly different take, saying most of them generally fall into one of two broad categories.

“One [type] does serious, useful and good research and is not controversial,” says Mr. Lamy, who is also a host and producer with Quebec’s Canal Savoir. He points to Canada’s two wealthiest think tanks – the Conference Board of Canada, with a $40-million budget and the Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI), with a $25-million budget – as prime examples.

The other category is what Mr. Lamy calls “combat think tanks” that defend or advocate on behalf of ideologies and policies outside the political system. He includes within this category neoliberal economic organizations like the Fraser Institute and the Institut économique de Montréal, and – on the other end of the spectrum – environmental activist groups like the Suzuki Foundation. “These groups are sometimes very militant,” he says. “They are like the last stage of political ideology.”

The Fraser Institute is the only Canadian organization to rank among the top 25 non-U.S. think tanks in the 2018 Global Go To Think Tank Index, published by the University of Pennsylvania’s Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program, of which Mr. Lamy is a collaborator. CIGI just missed the top-25 list, placing 27th in the index.

Mr. Lamy says that, like in the U.S., the advent of right-wing think tanks in Canada such as the Fraser Institute led to the creation of counterbalancing left-wing think tanks like the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives and, in Quebec, the Institut de recherche et d’informations socio-économiques. He says the research being produced by both sides – work that defends the groups’ ideologies – has led to increasing polarization.

“These think tanks are taking the place of political parties in public debate,” says Mr. Lamy. “They can be, and often are, far more radicalized and singular in their research and positions than political parties because political parties need to remain attractive to a wider population base.”

He says the continuous stream of data and opinion on matters of public interest from these groups now dominate news cycles. “You can’t have a debate today without opinions and studies and facts from think tank experts,” says Mr. Lamy. “It’s very difficult to pierce the media’s membrane if you don’t have a study with data that backs up your argument.”

Andrew Parkin, director of the Mowat Centre, agrees. The centre, which calls itself “Ontario’s Voice on Public Policy,” is housed at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, where Dr. Parkin is also an associate professor. He says groups like his are adding policy capacity to important public discussions.

“Non-urgent public policy thinking has been thinned out over time through government cutbacks, and the redeployment of public servants more towards keeping the government running and dealing with daily issues,” says Dr. Parkin, who served with the Council of Ministers of Education Canada before joining the Mowat Centre in 2017.

Dr. Parkin says the arm’s-length research being done by the Mowat Centre’s small group of researchers on subjects of their choosing – but always in line with the think tank’s core mandate – provides a way for the government of the day to “almost think out loud” by exploring ideas without a partisan agenda.

“It’s not easy for governments to generate or engage in public conversations around things that haven’t happened yet but could in two, five or 10 years from now,” says Dr. Parkin. “By doing that we’re providing a valuable public service.”

Pamela Sugiman, dean of the faculty of arts at Ryerson, sees the advent of the new Yellowhead Institute in much the same light. “Now is a good time because there is so much discussion around Indigenous issues that go way beyond the academic realm,” she Dr. Sugiman, a sociologist and scholar on gender and race politics in Canada. The institute, she says, is “the university’s response to Truth and Reconciliation” and will act as a platform for the recruitment of Indigenous students from across Canada. “There’s a lot of pride in what we’re doing.”",Think tanks fill an important niche within Canada’s public policy landscape,University Affairs,https://www.universityaffairs.ca/features/feature-article/think-tanks-fill-an-important-niche-within-canadas-public-policy-landscape/

Unlike the polished, visually appealing sites the governing NDP and opposition UCP have launched to attack each other in recent weeks, this one has the black-and-white esthetic of a Windows 95 text document. However bland and antiquated its look, though, it inserts a set of damning allegations into the middle of this Alberta election campaign.

The site, not-so-artfully named after the person running it, was launched earlier this month by lawyer and former power executive Robert Hemstock, who is currently suing the Alberta government, Deputy Premier Sarah Hoffman and NDP Premier Rachel Notley’s top spokesperson Cheryl Oates for defamation. It breaks down in lawyerly detail what Hemstock considers to be a series of mistakes the NDP government made as it changed the rules governing the province’s deregulated electricity market — moves he claims cost Alberta power consumers $2 billion, a niggling scandal of the NDP’s first term.

Hemstock filed the defamation suit in July 2018, based on events dating as far back as 2015, when Notley’s New Democrats were elected. The website went live after he filed a new affidavit on March 29.

He launched the suit because he believes the government unfairly blamed him for a series of contract cancellations in the power market in 2015 and 2016, based on a clause he helped negotiate into those contracts in 2000.

He launched the website because he wants to “expose” the details of the controversial episode, and because he believes the public doesn’t understand how or why those cancelled contracts ended up saddling consumers “with an estimated $2 billion in unnecessary costs” — and how the province could have avoided those mistakes in order to save Albertans money.

Both the suit and the website also appear to be an attempt by Hemstock to clear his name.

“It’s also about how our elected representatives in the Alberta Government used their position of power and access to taxpayer funds to attempt to achieve their political objective of avoiding accountability,” the website charges.

Hemstock declined to comment on the site because his defamation suit is still before the court but the affidavit filed March 29 contains a new allegation that the government has not provided all the documents requested in the case.

“That a decision was made to defame me, by implicating me as the cause of the loss of approximately $2 billion to electricity consumers, with no records showing how that decision was arrived at discloses the defendants have not discharged their obligation to provide all relevant material records,” Hemstock states in the affidavit.

“I’m not aware of anything new being filed, but because the matter is before the courts we won’t be commenting,” said Oates, who was Notley’s communications director before the writ dropped and is working on the NDP campaign.

It is a scandal. It is absolutely a scandal

Alberta’s electricity sector is unique in Canada and is confusing even for Albertans. The province has no Crown corporation like BC Hydro, SaskPower or Hydro Quebec that produces and distributes power to its residents. Instead a jumble of private-sector companies and some city-owned utilities like Calgary’s Enmax Corp. own the power plants, transmission lines and distribution networks while multiple provincial government agencies regulate or oversee the market.

In the middle of 2015, the province’s then-new NDP government increased the price industrial companies had to pay for emitting carbon in the province, which triggered an opt-out clause for many of those power producers, letting them cancel their contracts to purchase power in the province.

On his website, Hemstock called the price increase “a mistake” that government ought to have known would trigger the opt-out clause. Further mistakes, Hemstock alleges, include trying to deflect blame for the cancelled contracts, and specifically, going “on the offensive” by blaming him.

The government called the opt-out clause the “Enron clause,” after Enron Canada had asked for it to be added before that now-defunct company agreed to bid on power contracts.

Hemstock was in-house counsel for Enron Canada in the late 1990s when Alberta was in the midst of deregulating its electricity market and when the contracts in question were signed. He later joined Enmax as an executive.

In his defamation suit, Hemstock said he was employed by Enron Canada and “was not employed by nor did he advise (parent company) Enron Corporation in relation to any financial reporting obligations in the United States of America, at any time.”

Enron Corp. — rather than Enron Canada — collapsed amid a corporate scandal that included misleading investors and falsifying financial information.

In December 2015, Enmax became the first company to make use of the opt-out clause and handed the money-losing contracts it was holding over to an arms-length government agency called the Balancing Pool.

In the following months, other money-losing power contracts were also handed to the Balancing Pool, shifting the potential losses from the contracts from companies directly onto Albertans.

One power executive, speaking on condition of anonymity because they didn’t want to run afoul of the government or comment on the defamation case, said the case should be “a cautionary tale when it comes to political interference in the electric market” because electricity “is a complicated but essential commodity.”

The issue stirred up controversy in Alberta — though many residents don’t fully understand what happened — as the government moved to support the Balancing Pool through a loan.

“What I can’t fully grasp, and perhaps this is a failing on my part in opposition, is how it is that $2.2 billion has gone into the Balancing Pool, backstopped by Alberta taxpayers, and it isn’t the single greatest scandal that Albertans have seen,” said Greg Clark, then leader of the Alberta Party, in the province’s legislature in May 2017. “It is a scandal. It is absolutely a scandal.”

A decision was made to defame me

Industry groups have also sharply criticized how the government handled the series of cancelled contracts.

“Albertans should be concerned about the government’s $2.25-billion loan to the Balancing Pool and the mounting interest cost (about $400 million), which will need to be repaid,” the Independent Power Producers Society of Alberta said in a release.

The controversy is not a key focus in the current Alberta election, partly because it’s so complicated, but it is a point that parties have included in their platforms.

The UCP has promised that, if it forms government, it will “Ask the Auditor General of Alberta to conduct a special duty audit of the NDP-incurred financial losses on the power purchase agreements held through the Balancing Pool.”

In an emailed statement, the UCP said the NDP has not been transparent about their electricity market changes.

Hemstock’s defamation case is expected to drag on long after the April 16 election. He believes the government blamed him for the power contracts being handed over to the Balancing Pool.

In their statement of defence, the provincial government, Hoffman and Oates state they never referenced Hemstock directly and “as such, the statements cannot be defamatory or cause harm to the plaintiff, as alleged or at all.”

The defence also states that comments were made “as senior government officers in the performance of their official duties and are protected by absolute privilege” and their comments were “based on true facts about matters of public interest and are fair comment on a matter of public interest.”

Then you decided to become the CEO of Biome Grow. And just because some of the audience doesn’t know about Biome Grow yet, tell me how that whole process came about, and how did Biome Grow start?

Khurram Malik: Sure. I mean, the thinking was, when we were previously investment backers and consultants in the industry and helped build some of the largest companies in the space today, you know, it took a couple of years of figuring out what worked and didn’t work. So Biome was something that came later; it’s about two years old. And we thought we could build a more efficient cannabis platform than has been built to date. So we started with a blank slate, and we take the best practices that we’ve learned over the years, helping our former clients, and how do you build a more efficient company.

Efficient means raising less money, spending less money, but also getting a better bang for your buck in terms of product going out. So I don’t have to build, for example, millions of square feet of production space; I can still do hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue still, without having to do that.

James West: Sure.

Khurram Malik: So there’s quite a few aspects to it.

James West: Okay. And what is the sort of market focus for Biome?

Khurram Malik: Indeed. So we went commercial in Canada in January of this year, after getting our license in Nova Scotia. We’re doing pretty well over there; I think our products last for about two or three days on the shelf and it’s gone, and also Newfoundland, similar situation.

James West: Oh, great.

Khurram Malik: We are building out some additional expansion of our capacity here in Canada, but what really makes the story interesting is what we’re going to be doing overseas. And sort of dovetailing into what you were previously talking about, CBD, we’re going to be primarily selling a lot of CBD overseas in jurisdictions that are just about to come online with the regulations for cannabis. And in about two years we’ll probably be doing 80 percent of our revenue overseas and maybe 20 percent here in Canada. I mean, I always hark back to the fact that there’s 36 million people in Canada, it’s a small market, and the big guys have been actively participating the sector for a while have got most of that locked down.

So we are coming a little later to the game; we’ve got to be pretty intelligent on how we sort of position ourselves. Atlantic Canada is interesting for us. What we do here, that’s a B trend in Canada, but our real cash flow is going to come from overseas.

James West: Okay, so especially where overseas do you see the greatest opportunity?

Khurram Malik: Yeah, we like to go where other people are not. So you know, in history, power guys before cannabis were regulatory specialists. So we help influence or write regs in countries that don’t have programs yet. So it’s been many years in the making, but we do like being first in the door.

James West: So, give us countries.

Khurram Malik: I can’t say countries specifically, but look at Asia and Africa.

James West: Oh, okay. Interesting. Great. So then, is the supply for your stuff in the Maritimes, does that come from – where does that come from?

Khurram Malik: Well, it’s currently being produced in our licensed facility in Nova Scotia. We have a few more under construction in the other provinces in Atlantic Canada, plus one in Ontario, but that would be primarily THC-based products. And then we’ve got a supply agreement with a related party called CBD Acres that we announced a few weeks ago, which, you know, there’s some related – you know, we’re also founders in for example, so there’s some common founders and ownership between the two, and CBD Acres will be supplying Biome with an enormous amount of biomass, already in concentrated form, that’ll allow us to ship our product ultimately overseas.

There’s a lot of proprietary technology; it’s a hemp company that produces CBD. Nine thousand acres in Ontario, and increasing beyond that – that’s more biomass than any LP in Canada can produce today. We can do for cents per gram. And the point for that is, we’re going to countries where they want affordable medicine, and you can’t do that with cannabis products based on Canadian regulations. So we produce some of the expensive cannabis in the world because we’re forced to. But with hemp, the way the Hemp Act works and the way it dovetails into the Cannabis Act when you take the flower and you turn it into something, we can produce some of the lowest cost points anywhere in the world.

So for example, you set up a hemp farm in Africa, it won’t be much cheaper than setting it up here if you know what you’re doing. So that’s actually an interesting new development which didn’t exist in the cannabis space until now.

James West: Okay. Interesting you bring up CBDs, because that’s been very thematic around here for the last couple weeks, because there is a such a sort of a gold rush going on, if you will, that so many companies are piling into the space. They’re going to be the biggest, they’re going to be the best, that we’ve started to really research it. So I want to ask you, because you’re experienced in this – so I’ve got two CBD products here, I’m not going to identify them, I’m just going to put them on this thing, and I want you to basically tell me what you think of each product in terms of, so the interesting thing with these products is, they are – oops, I just sprayed that on my computer, but, oh well, this will be nice and slippery.

Khurram Malik: Make your computer go faster.

James West: Yeah. So, okay, so here they are. They’re both 48 to 50 milligrams per millilitre of CBD, and one is, how would you describe them?

Khurram Malik: One’s clear, one looks like it’s a little less water soluble, to some degree. So that’s one thing. Could you probably know if they’re isolates or full-spectrum?

James West: They’re both full-spectrum.

Khurram Malik: They’re all full-spectrum. Okay, well this one seems like it’s a little more advanced in terms of what I can do. Typically, if it’s a water-soluble solution, it’ll absorb in your body a lot quicker, and it avoids certain parts of the liver pathways to get into your system, so that’s intriguing. The other one looks like it’s more of an older-school version of how you sort of, you know, combine cannabinoids with a liquid to get into your body.

James West: Sure. Interesting. So I mean, do you consume CBD?

Khurram Malik: Yes, I do.

James West: Okay, which of these would you prefer?

Khurram Malik: The clear one.

James West: [laughter] Okay, now here’s the interesting thing: the company that produced this CBD has a market cap of 2.7 billion. The company that produces this CBD has a market cap of 175 million.

Khurram Malik: Okay.

James West: And this one’s private, this one’s public. So that one’s up for debate.

Khurram Malik: Yeah, but you can also – that’s perfectly in line with how the entire sector’s working right now, right? If you look at the largest companies in the space and look at the product reviews on their products, the smaller guys or the black market have higher quality product.

James West: Right.

Khurram Malik: Right? So these guys will figure it out eventually, but I’m assuming these guys are more focused on CBD and tinctures and oils and extractions, and these guys are probably more flower-focused right now and everything else. They’ll get around to it eventually, but that’s sort of how the broader space and theme is currently focusing, as well.

James West: Sure. Well this is interesting. So I had an investment in this company, which I sold because it was a double, and I took all that money and put it into this company, because this one’s not public yet, and it’s about to, it’s going to go public. So, interesting. So now, in terms of your CBD partner, now, which of that kind of oil would you seek to produce?

Khurram Malik: It’ll be more like this; it’ll be more about 100 milligrams per millilitre as well, because we target certain diseases. So for example, MacGregor disease, epilepsy, you need a higher dose in there, even if it’s for children three to four years old. So it’ll be higher; it’ll also have an oil, which probably a chia seed oil, which is easier on the stomach lining than other what other people currently we have on the market. It was interesting; it’ll be produced with a nano-lipid extraction process, which is very specifically for hemp flower as opposed to, you know, because there’s a lower concentration of CBD in hemp, right, so it’s easier to process the biomass.

James West: Right. So what is the average concentration of CBD in hemp, in terms of percentage?

Khurram Malik: In Canada?

James West: Yeah.

Khurram Malik: Canada’s interesting. So you have to register a hemp variety with the authorities at the Federal level; I think they’re – don’t quote me on this, but I think there are 50, roughly, registered varieties of hemp currently, and not a single one of them is over 3 percent right now.

James West: Really?

Khurram Malik: So what’s going to be happening this year, including with CBD Acres, our related party, they’re going to be registering 15 percent, your 22 percents, and your 23 percents. We just don’t know right now how well they’ll grow outside in a Canadian climate. The 2 percent varieties are well, sort of versed, and there’s a track record how to grow. So that’s what most people are growing this year. So next year, where you get the higher varieties, we’ll see what happens, but you know, the best right now are those tiny percentages.

James West: Right. I’m growing a high-CBD strain called Dance Hall.

Khurram Malik: Nice.

James West: Yeah [laughter]

Khurram Malik: What’s the THC content?

James West: It’s 19 percent. Up to 19 percent CBD. I won’t know exactly what it ends up yielding until I harvest it and test it, of course, but I’m very curious to see.

The whole CBD craze now, it seems like, has caused a complete bifurcation of the cannabis market, because it is now two industries, really; it’s the CBD market and it’s the THC market.

Khurram Malik: I agree.

James West: And they do come together at some points in the pharmaceutical value chain, but in the current evolution of the markets, it’s like, so CBD has now taken off and is more broadly embraced than THC, which still suffers from restrictions due to its psychotropic nature.

Khurram Malik: Exactly, and we’ve been looking at that for a while, now. So when we go to a foreign jurisdiction, let’s say Asia, where societies are a little more conservative than they are in the Western world, we sort of go in there and say, Okay, right: you either convince a government to write regs for medical cannabis, or you know, go in there and hopefully tinker and make a more rationale based on our Canadian learnings. So the way we do it is, Stage 1 is let’s launch a medical program targeting diseases that only CBD treats, because it’s easier to convince clinicians and doctors and regulators. It’s non-psychoactive; well, it’s largely non-psychoactive. That’s an easy way to go.

Step 2: THC-based meds. And then Step 3, maybe recreational, way down the line at some point. So yeah, that’s a philosophy we sort of embrace for quite some time.

What’s interesting here is, our two companies, Biome and CBD Acres, we have kept them separate for that reason. The fundamentals of a hemp company and the fundamentals of an indoor cannabis company are dramatically different, right? So it didn’t make sense to put them in one; maybe one day, down the road. But Biome is the commercialization arm for medical products for CBD Acres overseas, whereas CBD Acres will make functional foods and other sort of recreational products here in Canada.

James West: Sure. How do you see your revenues scaling over the next 12, 24, 36 months?

Khurram Malik: Let me put it this way: we signed a supply deal with CBD Acres for about 20,000 kilograms of CBD concentrate. That’s concentrate; that’s the equivalent of 180,000 kilograms of dried flower; it’s the largest supply deal in the history of this planet.

James West: Really?

Khurram Malik: When it comes to cannabis. That’s 180,000 kilograms, and we’re going to need quite a bit of that for our Asian and African and potentially South American customers.

James West: Sure. Okay, so how do you deal with – how do you extract that?

Khurram Malik: That’s the key thing, right? So it’s one thing to grow hemp, and you know, we’re talking hundreds of acres of hemp fields, right? So then there’s a whole other aspect if you’ve got to figure out how to cultivate it all. Then once you cultivate it, how do you dry it? And once you dry it, how do you extract it? Once you extract it, what do you do with it? Because it’s huge volumes, right?

James West: Right.

Khurram Malik: And if you look at the extraction bottleneck on the cannabis side in Canada, those people haven’t figured out how to extract yet properly, right? So building that value chain in CBD Acres, where you know, all those different aspects are figured out – I’m find another company in North America that has all those aspects figured out.

So if you look at the US, the US has no expertise in drying hemp, with the exception of some pilot programs in Kentucky. So it’ll take a while to figure out that side of it, the upstream part of it. They can be the extraction side, because that’s, you know, they’re going to need the extraction of cannabis for a while.

In Canada, it’s the other way around. We know how to grow hemp; we’re one of the largest hemp growers in the world for decades, now, probably Number Two after China. But we suck at extraction, and we suck at downstream processing and edibles and all those sorts of products. So that’s where our sort of issue is. So those are the two different constraints. So in CBD Acres, they’ve got all that figured out with technology and know-how and proprietary sort of elements, so we’re pretty confident that they’ll be able to supply us, Biome, with some very high quality finished products, whether they’re tinctures, pills, you know, creams of various kinds, and all that.

James West: And where does CBD Acres produce their hemp?

Khurram Malik: Here in Ontario, actually. So it’s actually a very capital-efficient business model, which investors like, and some don’t, because we don’t own the farmland there. We rent it from other farmers, large farmers in Ontario. We show them how to grow, we give them the seeds, and we come and harvest using our proprietary, you know, harvesters, which have to be very uniquely made. If you take a regular combine and you run it through a hemp field, it’ll break down in two minutes; it’s a tough plant, right?

James West: Right.

Khurram Malik: So it’s a specially designed combine that just slices the flower off, makes sure it never hits the ground, so it remains organic, and it’s dried in a very proprietary way, otherwise you can waste weeks drying this stuff; we do it in two days.

James West: Cool. Well, that’s going to be quite the thing; I imagine you’re going to take a lot of video footage of this stuff being harvested this year?

Khurram Malik: Oh yeah, all the time.

James West: Okay, great. Well, Khurram, let’s leave it there for now. That’s a great update on the company; we’ll come back to you soon enough and keep following the story. Thanks for joining me.

House Democrats pulled back a vote on a budget resolution this week after progressives pushed back in favor of higher domestic spending. Party leaders should look to a similar ideological insurgency in the Republican Party to learn some lessons before it’s too late.

The conservative “tea party” burst onto the scene in 2009 with a bang. Just as high-profile victories have empowered today’s progressive caucus, no more so than that of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), so too did the tea party get its zing from a series of high-profile primary wins against incumbents or highly favored insiders. These new Republicans immediately put their stamp on the party, pushing for a government shutdown to force lower spending or to defund Obamacare. They also enthusiastically backed plans by then-House Budget Committee Chair Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) to replace Medicare with a voucher program — ahem, “premium support” — to dramatically reduce federal spending over time.

The GOP establishment never quite knew how to react. Its leaders ultimately chose a cunning but flawed approach. Rather than engage the insurgents over principle, they played a double game. The official party mantra took on tea party goals — repealing Obamacare, addressing the entitlements crisis, reducing federal spending — yet the insiders knew that moderate reluctance and Democratic resistance would prevent any of these ideas from becoming law. The result produced a false party unity that deepened resentment among the most committed tea party believers.

This, in turn, created the House Freedom Caucus and the Ted Cruz phenomenon. The happy band of conservative nihilists could wreak havoc within their respective chambers. They toppled one speaker (John A. Boehner of Ohio) and made life miserable for another (Ryan) by insisting on purist conservative ideas that could not pass both chambers. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) whipped up party loyalists to push the Senate into the ill-fated government shutdown of 2013, at one point telling his fellow GOP senators that if they did not back the shutdown, they were supporters of Obamacare. Leaders knew they were losing control and that these measures were doomed to fail, but having ceded the philosophic high ground to the insurgents to buy peace, they had no ability to defy their demands.

Democrats seem to be in denial that something similar is happening to them, but the evidence to the contrary is everywhere. Presidential candidates are leaping over themselves to be more progressive than one another. Among the most visible examples of the progressive wing pushing their priorities onto the Democratic agenda: proposing reparations for slavery, eliminating private health insurance, abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, and advocating the Green New Deal. Fealty to such positions is increasingly becoming a litmus test for party leadership.

Democratic pragmatists have so far been following their GOP counterparts’ playbook. They make appeals to unity and the ability to “show we can govern.” They contend that they have to get Republican consent to pass anything because of GOP control of the Senate. But those arguments simply egged the tea party on, suggesting that the establishment didn’t really share their goals. There’s little reason to think that Democratic ideological progressives, who have felt for decades that the party has shunted them aside for corporate favoritism and go-along, get-along Clintonism, will be any more open to their leadership’s appeals.

Democrats should instead bite the bullet and have a real argument over principle with their progressive friends. They should make a principled case for traditional Democratic ideals that seek to bring the marginalized in contact with the American Dream and distinguish it from the socialist visions of its progressive wing. In short, they should be willing to have the internal fights they had in 1948, when Democrats faced down revolts from a segregationist right and a progressive left and still won the general election.

The urge to avoid conflict is strong, and usually it is an instinct worth heeding. But take it from a Republican who was seen this play before: Deferring an inevitable conflict only makes things worse. Fight now while you still can.

Some 50 NDP ...","Alberta NDP supporters rallied Sunday, accusing Jason Kenney’s UCP of harbouring plans to unleash toll roads on the province should they form the next provincial government.

Some 50 NDP candidates, supporters and truck drivers gathered in Calgary to oppose a notion previously pitched by Kenney to consider “user-pay” mechanisms for new highway infrastructure.

Parmeet Singh, NDP candidate for Calgary-Falconridge, said road tolls would take money out of the pockets of Albertan families.

“Right across Alberta, families will suffer, we will suffer. They will be penalized for driving to work, picking up groceries, taking their kids to hockey or any other sports and these tolls will hurt businesses,” said Singh, who said many supporters in his riding are involved in taxi and trucking industries and would be negatively impacted.

The UCP platform, released last week, calls for the use of “alternative financing” for building public infrastructure, including public-private partnerships, but makes no reference to “user-pay” systems, commonly referred to as road tolls.

However, in January, UCP spokeswoman Christine Myatt told Postmedia if the party forms the government then tolls for projects, such as a road built to benefit industry, would be on the table.

The same month, Kenney said, “We’re going to have to find more creative ways of paying for modern infrastructure in the future, including more public-private partnerships, including, as I’ve said, where it makes sense, user-pay,” during a Facebook livestream video.

The UCP declined to comment Sunday on whether they’ve ruled out tolls for future infrastructure.

Instead, spokesman Matt Solberg only made reference to current infrastructure and said the UCP has “never suggested applying tolls to existing roads.”

Irfan Sabir, seeking re-election in Calgary-McCall, called on Kenney to “come clean” about his position on road tolls.

“We know that on six different occasions he has weighed in favour of tolls,” said Sabir, who shared Singh’s views that they would adversely impact small businesses and families.

“We are saying no to that. Premier Rachel Notley has made it abundantly clear that we will not (introduce) fees or tolls on these roads.”

Under a returning NDP government, Rachel Notley has promised to push ahead with a second route out of Fort McMurray so residents of the northern city would never have to live through the same circumstances of 2016 where residents evacuated down a single choked highway to escape raging wildfires.

The party has also vowed to expand the Alberta high-load corridor over the next six years to the tune of $1.35 billion.

The high-load corridor is a 6,500-kilometre network of roads across the province, which can accommodate heavy vehicles weighing up to 800 tonnes, and up to 12.8 metres tall. Notley’s plan would expand the network by 3,500 kilometres.

“We know that better schools, better hospitals, better roads, better bridges, they generate economic activity,” said Sabir. They attract investment, they attract businesses. So we will continue to make sure Alberta has the infrastructure that supports a diversified, 21st-century economy.”

He said the NDP is reflecting the views of Albertans.

“Today, on the doorsteps, everywhere — businesses, families — they are telling me that we cannot afford tolls on our roads,” said Sabir.",New Democratic Party urging opposition to 'come clean' on support for toll roads,Calgary Herald,https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/new-democratic-party-urging-opposition-to-come-clean-on-support-for-toll-roads

The vote came after the committee received a financial update from its new treasurer and learned that Executive Director Alex Cragun, one of three people on the party’s payroll, had not received a portion of a recent paycheck.

“Changes just have to be made to make sure the organization remains viable,” Sheila Srivastava, the party’s treasurer, told The Salt Lake Tribune — and the party doesn’t have the money to pay both Cragun and Thomas.

Before Srivastava came into the party in February, she said the organization didn’t have solid procedures in place for accounting records and that she has been working to “clean up” its financial reporting system and create standard operating procedures to ensure the party’s viability. She said the party has a plan in place to pay off its debts with fundraising and “other coordinated efforts.”

Documents from the executive committee meeting provided to The Salt Lake Tribune show the party has $43,312 in assets but a total $106,873 in current and long-term liabilities — a deficit of $63,561. Additionally, a profit and loss sheet from Jan. 1 to April 9 of this year shows the party generated $212,960 in income during the period but spent $229,188.58.

Personnel costs, including wages and health insurance, cost $73,588.

Eric Biggart, chair of caucuses, said Thursday that the decision to stop paying Thomas was not connected to Cragun’s missed wages but stemmed from conversations that had been ongoing since February. Before the executive committee meeting began on Tuesday, he said members knew the party hadn’t met its February and March fundraising goals and would likely to have to cut Thomas’ pay.

“[We knew] the numbers are such that if this doesn’t pick up in March, then we’re going to have to not pay the chair because the chair’s only job is set vision and raise money,"" he said. ""There’s not much else that is needed right there.”

There appeared to be confusion Wednesday afternoon among executive committee members over why Cragun wasn’t being paid, who had made that decision and how much money he was owed. Cragun did not respond to a request for comment.

But Thomas said in a written statement that Cragun had “unilaterally” reduced his most recent paycheck against her orders “in response to a temporary budget shortfall, without considering the negative labor implications in doing so. We have plans to reimburse him completely for any shortfall. The Utah Democratic Party is a worker's party and we believe all our full-time employees are entitled to a living wage.”

Several people said Thomas, who declined to offer comment on suspension of her wages, was not present for the financial discussion at Tuesday evening’s meeting

Michael Bryant, the party’s secretary and a member of the executive committee, said the committee was surprised to find out that Cragun had missed wages.

“We weren’t aware he wasn’t being paid and we don’t know why he wasn’t being paid, and there was unanimous consent to make him whole immediately,” he said.

Shortly after the meeting, Elizabeth Converse, a former Democrat who left the party over its response to allegations of sexual harassment against a former candidate for chairman, created a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for Cragun’s missed wages.

“Alex has been a community organizer for as long as I’ve known him,” she said in her post. “He genuinely cares about people — now to the point of not even getting paid for the work he has done. This is a problem. Without a healthy Alex, there is no healthy infrastructure for the community we all want to build. Invest in Alex, so he can invest in himself. If his job can’t pay, we can keep him afloat until he can find one that can.”

The campaign had earned more than $1,600 as of Wednesday afternoon from more than 20 people — one of whom said he’d “suddenly stopped” his donations to the Utah Democratic Party because of the situation.

The party has been embroiled in controversy for the past two years over its response to sexual harassment allegations from seven women against party chair candidate Rob Miller, the party’s former vice chairman and treasurer. That issue came up again at its meeting Tuesday after Miller tried to run in the upcoming race for chair. The party stated it had not received his campaign paperwork prior to the filing deadline.

The state Republican Party has also faced financial challenges due to outstanding legal debts stemming from several legal challenges — most of which were unsuccessful — against the state. Those lawsuits sought to overturn SB45, a 2014 law allowing partisan candidates to qualify for a primary election either by obtaining signatures or by winning the support of party delegates at convention.

This year, it seems, not so much.

While the 2019 speakers list was stacked with officials from President Donald Trump's administration and Republican Party grandees, most major Democratic presidential candidates for 2020 were missing from the conference altogether.

The three-day event, which ended Tuesday, included speeches from Vice-President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and House minority leader Kevin McCarthy.

And I am troubled that many of the declared Democrat presidential candidates seem to be avoiding <a href=""https://twitter.com/AIPAC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@AIPAC</a> this year. —@senatemajldr

Nine of the biggest names in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination skipped the conference this year, and not one Democratic candidate was on the speakers list.

Jewish Americans have long aligned themselves with liberal causes. About 75 per cent of Jews voted Democratic in the 2018 midterms. But some delegates at this year's conference noted with dismay recent comments by freshman Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar that they felt trafficked in stereotypes about Jewish political influence and money.

Recent polling suggests there is more willingness among younger progressive voters to criticize Israel.

Some AIPAC attendees who spoke with CBC News wondered whether the party has shifted too far to the left. Here's what some of them said.

Michael Goldberg, 49, Democrat from New York:

""It used to be that Democrats and Republicans had to fight to get a spot on the stage,"" Goldberg said.

Noting the lack of 2020 candidates on the speakers' list, he asked, ""Who's here that's running for the presidency for the Democrats?""

The attorney and father of three admitted that he feels ""a bit politically lost.""

He supported Barack Obama during his two terms in office. He and his wife have been ""lifelong Democrats,"" and are still registered with the party. But they voted for Trump in 2016 and may do so again in 2020, unless a Democrat they consider ""more centrist"" decides to run.

Asked about talk of an ""Exodus"" or ""Jexodus"" — a movement begun by conservatives to woo Jewish-Americans away from the Democrats to the Republicans — Goldberg gave a knowing nod.

""It's me and my wife. That's what happened,"" he said. ""The Democrats were friends of the Jewish people. They were friends of Israel. But it's a different party now.""

Vicki Fishman, 47, Independent from Washington, D.C.:

Indeed, AIPAC's policy is to invite presidential candidates to speak only in election years. Even so, Hillary Clinton addressed AIPAC in 2016 as well as the off-year in 2015. Obama spoke there before the 2008 election, as well as in 2011 and again in the lead-up to his re-election in 2012. In 2007, a non-election year, both Clinton and Obama competed for Jewish voters, holding big events at AIPAC.

Rep. Ilhan Omar's tweets have ""complicated"" the public discourse for the Democratic Party, Fishman said. But she considers it to be a distraction.

""We're living in a polarized country right now, and that's just adding to the general polarization, and maybe that's taking up within the party.""

""There are so many conservative politicians here. It's really concerning to me as someone who is pro-Israel, Jewish-American because it feels to me like Jewish-Americans are being used by Republicans to gain voters,"" said Draisen, a self-described liberal Democrat.

""Knowing that Mitch McConnell is here, that makes me want to throw up.""

Draisen, a student at Boston University, supports Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren's bid for the Democratic nomination, though she declined to attend the conference.

Trump's closeness with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has aroused skepticism among her Gen Z progressive friends ""who see Israel and pro-Israel Americans as villains,"" Draisen said.

Netanyahu was listed as a speaker, but skipped AIPAC after a Gaza rocket attack. Netanyahu sent in a video address from Israel on Tuesday. A few months earlier, he reportedly told an aide, ""We don't need AIPAC anymore,"" reasoning he had enough support from American evangelicals and Trump.

Dismayed as she was that major Democratic 2020 hopefuls didn't attend, Draisen also said she saw political risk for them had they showed up at AIPAC. Doing so, she said, would be ""a big turnoff to most liberal Democrats.""

""It's unfortunate because I think most people don't understand the importance of supporting Israel, supporting a two-state solution, and learning.""

Marcia Jacobs, 86, Republican from Los Angeles:

Marcia Jacobs says she likes many of U.S. President Donald Trump's policies. (Matt Kwong/CBC)

Trump wasn't Jacobs's first choice to be president, but she has come to see the commander-in-chief as a staunch ally of Israel. Among the actions that convinced her was the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, as well as its recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel by moving the embassy there.

""He supports it so strongly, and [Democrats] are so anti-Trump that they're letting it affect any other issue,"" she said.

Jacobs was appalled by reports that the liberal non-profit MoveOn.org had urged Democratic candidates not to attend AIPAC.

""That's absolutely horrific,"" she said.

She also praised Trump for his tweet last week reversing more than 50 years of U.S. foreign policy on the Golan Heights by recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the strategically important strip of rocky highlands located where the borders meet between northern Israel, southern Lebanon and Syria.

Manny Srulowitz, 18, Independent from Long Island, N.Y.:

Srulowitz, a moderate, said he was receiving emails last week from a pro-Israel organization informing him about the latest Democrats to pull out of AIPAC. He comes from a Republican household that voted for Trump in 2016.

""I wouldn't have enough knowledge to give you a confident answer about why the Democrats are all leaving,"" he said, ""but it's very evident the Democrats are not here.""

The high school senior from Long Island will be 20 years old in 2020, but doesn't see a Democratic candidate yet who would capture his vote.

""I have noticed there is a new wave of young and critical Democrats, usually the younger ones,"" he said of what he sees as declining support for Israel among people of his generation. ""I am not one of them. I am a big fan of the state of Israel.""

Ira and Susan Kapinow, 78 and 76, Independents from Potomac, Md.:

Susan and Ira Kapinow say they can't see themselves voting for Trump in 2020, but they don't like some of the things they see going on in the Democratic Party. (Matt Kwong/CBC)

As ""middle-of-the-roaders"" who try to avoid extremes in their politics, this is a fraught time for Ira and Susan Kapinow, married retirees and strong supporters of Israel.

Susan was troubled by support among at least two Democratic newcomers in Congress for the so-called BDS movement — a campaign calling for a boycott, divestment and sanctions against Israel.

""I find it offensive. Israel is a strong ally and a strong friend,"" Susan said.

The Kapinows can't see themselves happily voting for Trump in 2020. But when they look at the growing divide over Israel within the Democratic Party, they have concerns about how the progressive candidates are breaking with what they viewed as conventional pro-Israel policy.

""It's certainly a new phenomenon and it seems to be generational,"" Ira said. ""The older Democrats were more supportive of Israel, the more traditional way. The younger Democrats are moving more and more to the left on Israel. Way too far left.""

Stewart Eisenberg, 64, Democrat from Philadelphia:

Stewart Eisenberg says he wasn't concerned about the lack of big-name Democratic presidential hopefuls at the conference this year. (Matt Kwong/CBC)

A liberal Democrat who voted for Clinton in 2016, Eisenberg has attended AIPAC's annual policy conference more than 20 times.

""You would like to see some presidential candidates from both sides, but we don't have the presidential candidate from the Republican side, either,"" he said.

He wasn't concerned about the lack of big-name Democratic presidential hopefuls this year, noting that top Democrats in Congress such as Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gave speeches, as well as House majority leader Steny Hoyer.

Eisenberg balked at the idea of a ""Jexodus.""

""I think it's overblown,"" he said. ""You have certain people on the right and certain people on the left that have different views about Israel. Both parties have taken a turn to the radical side on both extremes, but in the general majority of the party on both sides, there has always been bipartisan support for Israel. That continues.""",Lack of big-name Democratic candidates at pro-Israel conference confirms for some voters the party has changed,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/aipac-democrats-jexodus-1.5072069

(Reuters) - The largest Democratic field in the modern political era is lining up to seek the party's 2020 presidential nomination - and is expected to keep growing.

The diverse group vying to challenge President Donald Trump, the likely Republican nominee, includes six U.S. senators. A record six women are running, as well as black, Hispanic and openly gay candidates who would make history if one of them became the party's nominee.

Here are the Democrats who have launched campaigns or are expected to pursue a presidential bid, listed in order of their RealClearPolitics national polling average for those who register in opinion surveys.

(For a graphic, see: tmsnrt.rs/2Ff62ZC)

JOE BIDEN

The leader in polls of Democratic presidential contenders is not even a candidate yet. But Biden, who served eight years as vice president under former President Barack Obama and 36 years in the U.S. Senate, looks poised to join the 2020 race. At 76, he will be the second oldest candidate in the Democratic nominating contests, after Senator Bernie Sanders. Biden will be a key figure in the Democratic debate over whether a liberal political newcomer or a centrist veteran is needed to win back the White House. Liberal activists criticize his Senate record, including his authorship of the 1994 crime act that led to increased incarceration rates, and his ties to the financial industry, which is prominent in his home state of Delaware. Biden, who relishes his ""Middle-Class Joe"" nickname and touts his working-class roots, made unsuccessful bids for the nomination in 1988 and 2008. Biden, recently the subject of allegations of unwanted physical contact with women, pledged in a video to be ""more mindful"" of respecting ""personal space,"" an attempt to tamp down the controversy.

BERNIE SANDERS

The senator from Vermont lost the Democratic nomination in 2016 to Hillary Clinton but has jumped in for a second try. In the 2020 race, Sanders, 77, will have to fight to stand out in a packed field of liberal progressives touting issues he brought into the Democratic Party mainstream four years ago. His proposals include free tuition at public colleges, a $15 minimum wage and universal healthcare. He benefits from strong name recognition and a robust network of small-dollar donors, helping him to raise $5.9 million during his first day in the contest. Sanders, whose father was a Jewish immigrant from Poland, has shown a more personal side in this campaign, highlighting his struggles while growing up in a working-class family. He also has tried to reach out to black and Hispanic leaders after having trouble winning over minority voters in 2016.

KAMALA HARRIS

The first-term U.S. senator from California would make history as the first black woman to gain the nomination. Harris, 54, the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India, announced her candidacy on the holiday honoring slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. She has made a quick impact in a Democratic race that will be heavily influenced by women and minority voters. She raised $1.5 million in the first 24 hours of her campaign and drew record ratings on a CNN televised town hall. She supports a middle-class tax credit, Medicare for All healthcare funding reform, the Green New Deal and the legalization of marijuana. Her track record as San Francisco’s district attorney and California’s attorney general has drawn scrutiny in a Democratic Party that has shifted in recent years on criminal justice issues.

BETO O’ROURKE

The former three-term Texas congressman jumped into the race on March 14 - and has been jumping onto store countertops ever since to deliver his optimistic message to voters in early primary states. O'Rourke, 46, gained fame last year for his record fundraising and ability to draw crowds ahead of his unexpectedly narrow loss in the U.S. Senate race against Republican incumbent Ted Cruz. O'Rourke announced a $6.1 million fundraising haul for the first 24 hours of his campaign, besting his Democratic opponents. But with progressive policies and diversity at the forefront of the party's nominating battle, O'Rourke will face a challenge as a wealthy white man who is more moderate on several key issues than many of his competitors.

ELIZABETH WARREN

The 69-year-old senator from Massachusetts is a leader of the party’s liberals and a fierce Wall Street critic who was instrumental in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. She has focused her presidential campaign on her populist economic message, promising to fight what she calls a rigged economic system that favors the wealthy. She also has proposed eliminating the Electoral College, vowed to break up Amazon, Google and Facebook if elected, and sworn off political fundraising events to collect cash for her bid. Warren apologized earlier this year to the Cherokee Nation for taking a DNA test to prove her claims to Native American ancestry, an assertion that has prompted Trump to mockingly refer to her as “Pocahontas.""

CORY BOOKER

Booker, 49, a black U.S. senator from New Jersey and former mayor of Newark, gained national prominence in the fight over Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination. He has made U.S. race relations and racial disparities a focus of his campaign, noting the impact of discrimination on his family. He embraces progressive positions on Medicare coverage for every American, the Green New Deal and other key issues, and touts his style of positivity over attacks. Booker eats a vegan diet and recently confirmed rumors he is dating actress Rosario Dawson.

AMY KLOBUCHAR

The third-term U.S. senator from Minnesota was the first moderate in the Democratic field vying to challenge Trump. Klobuchar, 58, gained national attention in 2018 when she sparred with Kavanaugh during Senate hearings for his Supreme Court nomination. On the campaign trail, the former prosecutor and corporate attorney supports an alternative to traditional Medicare healthcare funding and is taking a hard stance against rising prescription drug prices. Klobuchar's campaign reported raising more than $1 million in its first 48 hours. Her campaign announcement came amid news reports that staff in her Senate office were asked to do menial tasks, making it difficult to hire high-level campaign strategists.

PETE BUTTIGIEG

The 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is emerging from underdog status as he begins to build momentum with young voters. A Harvard University graduate and Rhodes Scholar at the University of Oxford, he speaks seven languages and served in Afghanistan with the U.S. Navy Reserve. He touts himself as representing a new generation of leadership needed to combat Trump. Buttigieg would be the first openly gay presidential nominee of a major American political party.

JULIAN CASTRO

The secretary of housing and urban development under President Barack Obama would be the first Hispanic to win a major U.S. party's presidential nomination. Castro, 44, whose grandmother was a Mexican immigrant who immigrated to Texas, has used his family’s personal story to criticize Trump's border policies. Castro advocates for a universal pre-kindergarten program, supports Medicare for All and cites his experience to push for affordable housing. He announced his bid in his hometown of San Antonio, where he once served as mayor and a city councilman. His twin brother, Joaquin Castro, is a Democratic congressman from Texas.

KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND

Gillibrand, known as a moderate when she served as a congresswoman from upstate New York, has refashioned herself into a staunch progressive, calling for strict gun laws and supporting the Green New Deal. The senator for New York, who is 52, has led efforts to address sexual assault in the military and on college campuses, and pushed for Congress to improve its own handling of sexual misconduct allegations. On the campaign trail, she has made fiery denunciations of Trump. She released her tax returns for the years 2007 through 2018, offering the most comprehensive look to date at the finances of a 2020 White House candidate, and has called on her rivals to do the same.

JAY INSLEE

The Washington state governor has made fighting climate change the central issue of his campaign. As governor, Inslee, 68, has moved to put a moratorium on capital punishment and fully implement the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, and accompanying expansion of Medicaid health coverage for the poor. He has not settled on a position on Medicare for All but does support the Green New Deal backed by progressives. Inslee spent 15 years in Congress before being elected governor in 2012.

JOHN HICKENLOOPER

The 67-year-old former Colorado governor has positioned himself as a centrist and an experienced officeholder with business experience. He is the only Democratic presidential candidate so far to oppose the Green New Deal plan to tackle climate change, saying it would give the government too much power in investment decisions. During his two terms in office, Colorado’s economy soared and the Western state expanded healthcare, passed a gun control law and legalized marijuana. The former geologist and brewpub owner is among the many candidates who have refused to take corporate money. He previously served as mayor of Denver.

JOHN DELANEY

The former U.S. representative from Maryland became the first Democrat to enter the 2020 race, declaring his candidacy in July 2017. Delaney, 55, plans to focus on advancing only bipartisan bills during the first 100 days of his presidency if elected. He is also pushing for a universal healthcare system, raising the federal minimum wage and passing gun safety legislation.

TULSI GABBARD

The Samoan-American congresswoman from Hawaii and Iraq war veteran is the first Hindu to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives. After working for her father’s anti-gay advocacy group and drafting relevant legislation, she was forced to apologize for her past views on same-sex marriage. Gabbard, 37, has been against U.S. intervention in Syria and slammed Trump for standing by Saudi Arabia after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. She endorsed Sanders during his 2016 presidential campaign.

TIM RYAN

The moderate nine-term congressman from a working-class district in the battleground state of Ohio has touted his appeal to the blue-collar voters who fled to Trump in 2016. He says Trump has turned his back on those voters and failed to live up his promise to revitalize the manufacturing industry. Ryan, 45, pledges to create jobs in new technologies and focus on public education and access to affordable healthcare. He gained national attention when he tried to unseat Nancy Pelosi as the House Democratic leader in 2016, arguing it was time for new leadership. A former college football player, he also has written books on meditation and healthy eating.

ERIC SWALWELL

The third-term congressman from a California district south of San Francisco says tackling student debt and gun violence are among the reasons he jumped into the race. Swalwell, 38, cites his work on the House Intelligence Committee and his founding of Future Forum, a group of more than 25 Democratic lawmakers that visits universities and community colleges to discuss issues important to millennial voters like student loan debt and climate change, among the reasons he would be a qualified White House candidate. In his first House campaign, Swalwell defeated a Democratic incumbent who had been in office since 1973, seven years before Swalwell was born.

ANDREW YANG

The entrepreneur and former tech executive is focusing his campaign on an ambitious universal income plan. Yang, 44, wants to guarantee all American citizens between the ages of 18 and 64 a $1,000 check every month. The son of immigrants from Taiwan, Yang also is pushing for Medicare for All and proposing a new form of capitalism that is “human-centered.” He lives in New York.

MARIANNE WILLIAMSON

The 66-year-old New York Times best-selling author, motivational speaker and Texas native believes her spirituality-focused campaign can heal America. A 1992 interview on Oprah Winfrey’s show propelled her to make a name for herself as a “spiritual guide” for Hollywood and a self-help expert. She is calling for $100 billion in reparations for slavery over 10 years, gun control, education reform and equal rights for lesbian and gay communities. In 2014, she made an unsuccessful bid for a House seat in California as an independent.

WAYNE MESSAM

Messam, 44, defeated a 16-year incumbent in 2015 to become the first black mayor of in the Miami suburb of Miramar. He was re-elected in March. The son of Jamaican immigrants, he played on Florida State University's 1993 national championship team, and then started a construction business with his wife. He has pledged to focus on reducing gun violence, mitigating climate change and reducing student loan debt and the cost of healthcare.

Harris (Calif.) held a town hall meeting at Canyon Springs High School in Nevada, the site of a fatal shooting last year. Former congressman Beto O’Rourke (Tex.) carries in his wallet a photo of a victim of gun violence and often recounts his 8-year-old’s story of hiding in a closet during an active-shooter drill. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) has faced questions about gun control at nearly a dozen events.

The 2020 Democratic presidential candidates are embracing gun control more enthusiastically than in any other campaign in recent memory, with emotional appeals against firearms violence and pledges to stand up to the National Rifle Association.

As with other issues, the change reflects the party’s accelerating shift toward voters who live in cities and suburbs and are more highly educated. And it forecasts a general-election battle that could test the party’s liberal surge against a deep attachment to gun culture in many parts of the country, including some areas that Democrats hope to wrest from President Trump.

Perhaps for that reason, the dynamic falls short of Democrats’ endorsement of such broad, novel packages as the Green New Deal and Medicare-for-all. Instead, the candidates are signing on to a patchwork of individual measures such as an assault weapons ban, universal background checks and “red flag” legislation that allows police and family members to petition for the removal of guns from those deemed a threat.

“If their strategy involves trying to bring back Trump voters — voters from moderate to conservative areas — you probably don’t want the gun issue to get in the way,” said Robert J. Spitzer, who has written several books about gun politics. “You want to talk about health care or the economy or, from Democratic perspectives, uniting issues.”

Still, the tone of this group of Democratic candidates is starkly different from those of years past, driven by a spate of school massacres, the resulting activism and a perceived weakening of the NRA’s clout. In prior campaigns, even a candidate such as Bill Clinton, who favored gun restrictions, played up his participation in duck hunts. In 2004, Democratic nominee John F. Kerry dressed in camouflage, lugged a 12-gauge double-barreled shotgun and fired at geese.

“The political calculus has changed pretty dramatically,” said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun-control group. “Just look at other presidential campaigns, with John Kerry or Hillary Clinton. Before talking about gun safety, they would talk about their bona fides as hunters and shooters. That’s just not the case anymore.”

In a survey of the 18 Democrats running, six own guns. O’Rourke inherited several from his great-uncle, a former sheriff’s deputy and sharpshooter, but he said they’re not in operating condition. Pete Buttigieg, a Navy veteran and the mayor of South Bend, Ind., owns two antique guns that he doesn’t use, and Rep. Tim Ryan (Ohio) has a Remington 12-gauge shotgun that he won in a raffle and hasn’t used (when he hunts, an aide said, he borrows a gun). Former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper owns a shotgun and a rifle, both used for bird hunting.

Former congressman John Delaney (Md.) also owns a firearm. Perhaps most notably, so does Harris, a former prosecutor who, unlike the other gun owners in the race, has staked out a liberal identity rather than a centrist one.

Four years ago, when Republicans had a sprawling presidential field, The Washington Post found that 15 of the 17 contenders owned at least 40 guns among them.

Most of the Democrats have fired a weapon in one way or another — Warren while growing up in Oklahoma; Buttigieg while serving in Afghanistan and hunting with his father-in-law; Julián Castro while visiting police training facilities as San Antonio mayor — but most did not grow up in a gun culture. Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) fired a gun once while at a Boy Scout camp as a child, his campaign said, but he has never owned one.

But in a significant shift, several candidates made gun control part of their campaign rollouts.

Ryan’s announcement video featured him wearing a black shirt saying, “We Can End Gun Violence,” while Rep. Eric Swalwell (Calif.), who announced his bid Monday, plans to make gun violence a centerpiece of his campaign. One of his first events was holding a “Town Hall to End Gun Violence” on Tuesday night in Sunrise, Fla., with Cameron Kasky, who became a gun-control activist after 17 students and staff members were killed at his high school in Parkland, Fla.

Gun control still trails other issues in polls of what is important to left-leaning voters, but its profile has risen. The asymmetry is less pronounced than in previous years, when the voting bloc of conservatives deeply focused on gun rights was not matched by a similar intensity on the left.

Many Democrats blamed losses in the 1994 midterm elections and the 2000 presidential race largely on gun issues and for years after were wary of supporting even modest gun-control measures.

That began to change after the 2012 massacre of 20 students and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., and shifted even further after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland in February 2018, which spawned a wave of gun-control activism by teenagers.

Before the 2018 midterm elections, 69 percent of registered voters said gun policy was “very important” to them, according to a survey by the Pew Research Center; Democrats recaptured the House in that cycle. The issue ranked ahead of taxes and immigration but behind Supreme Court appointments, health care and the economy.

In individual races, gun control played a bigger role. A Democrat won the New Mexico governor’s mansion in a race in which gun issues were prominent. In Nevada, Democrats won top statewide elections campaigning for universal background checks.

In Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer won on a platform of universal background checks, banning bump stocks and prohibiting gun possession for those guilty of violent crimes.

Rep. Lucy McBath (Ga.), who ran after her son was fatally shot, made gun control a centerpiece of her campaign, defeating a Republican incumbent in an Atlanta suburban district where Democrats hadn’t won since 1979.

A significant factor in the changed landscape is a perceived weakening of the NRA, which for years was considered a near-invincible political force. The group has faced accusations that Russia sought to infiltrate it to gain political influence, while figures such as former New York mayor Michael R. Bloomberg have spent significant sums to back gun-control candidates.

A spokeswoman for the NRA did not return messages seeking comment.

Other gun rights activists, however, warned that the Democrats may be overestimating the support for firearms curbs, and they say that 2020 — with the presidency at stake — will not be the same as 2018.

Michael Hammond, legislative counsel for the Gun Owners of America, said gun-control activists have believed the tide was shifting their way before, only to be disappointed later.

“We’re in the same situation now as following Newtown, following Columbine — a lot of Sturm und Drang but no shift in the fundamental political dynamics,” he said. “Guns are, in many parts of the country, an animating issue that will fundamentally make a difference if they believe — and I don’t think they believed in 2018 — that their gun ownership rights are actually in danger.”

In a focus group of building trade union members, held in Washington on Wednesday, several local leaders said that the Democrats need to assure voters that their hunting and hobbies will be safe.

“I want to hear them say, ‘I’m not going to take your guns,’ ” said Patrick J. Corrigan of the Cleveland-based Heat and Frost Insulators and Allied Workers Local 3. “That’s a big issue for my members.”

Democrats are betting that the atmosphere has in fact changed. When the House passed legislation last month to expand background checks, only two Democrats voted against it. Every senator running for president backs legislation that would enhance background checks.

“What’s striking on gun violence prevention is how much they’re aligned,” said Peter Ambler, executive director of Giffords, a group created by former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) and her husband, Mark Kelly, after she survived a 2011 assassination attempt. “Even with all these candidates and this fragmented field, not a single candidate is pointed at some kind of libertarian approach on guns. This is not where our politics was even in 2008.”

More cracks could show as the candidates are pressed for specifics. Everytown for Gun Safety is preparing a candidate questionnaire that will address, for example, a proposed repeal of the Tiahrt Amendment, which restricts the dissemination of federal information about gun tracing.

For now, the candidates are pressing ahead. Warren’s campaign asked for a member of a group called Moms Demand Action to introduce her in Nevada. Numerous candidates — including Buttigieg, Harris and Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.) — have asked for gun-control activists to attend events.

Other Democrats are repudiating previous positions.

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) earned an “A” rating from the NRA when she was a congresswoman representing a rural Upstate district. She told Newsday in 2009 that she stored two rifles under her bed. “If I want to protect my family, if I want to have a weapon in the home, that should be my right,” she said.

After some noted the potential safety hazard of storing guns under the bed — she had an infant and a 5-year-old at the time — she said the ammunition was kept separate from the guns. She also announced that she had started storing the rifles elsewhere.

A campaign spokeswoman said that Gillibrand no longer owns firearms, but it is unclear when or how she got rid of them. Gillibrand has also shifted her views on guns, saying she was “embarrassed” by her past positions, which changed when she became a senator.

“After I got appointed, I went down to Brooklyn to meet with families who had suffered from gun violence in their communities,” she told CBS’s “60 Minutes” last year. “And you immediately experience the feeling that ‘I couldn’t have been more wrong.’ You know, I only had the lens of Upstate New York.”

Sanders, who represents a state where hunting is part of the culture, faced scrutiny during his first presidential campaign in 2016 for at times opposing gun restrictions. He has since spoken about the need to pass legislation.

For the moment, the Democrats’ views have largely converged. Booker has framed the debate — as Democrats depict many issues these days — as a conflict between corporations and people.

“I am tired of going to funerals where parents are burying their children,” Booker, who lives in downtown Newark, said at a CNN town hall event. “We are going to bring a fight like the NRA has never seen, if they’re going to defend corporate gun manufacturers more than the American people.”",Democratic candidates embrace gun control in notable shift,The Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democratic-candidates-embrace-gun-control-in-notable-shift/2019/04/10/c2ba9bce-5a0f-11e9-842d-7d3ed7eb3957_story.html

Photo: Agence France Presse/Getty Images

The emergence of a record-large (with 18 candidates and counting) Democratic presidential field, the absence of a dominant front-runner, and the Democratic Party’s proportional delegate award system have led many observers to suggest that the presidential nomination may not be decided until late in the process. Indeed, there’s talk of the possible reappearance of that presumed-to-be-extinct beast, the contested convention.

It could all play out that way, but as Kyle Kondik points out, there’s an alternative scenario that stems from the heavy front-loading of the 2020 primary calendar:

One aspect of this year’s calendar that could speed a knockout blow is that the calendar is frontloaded. As the nominating calendar is currently constructed, almost two-thirds of the total number of pledged delegates will be awarded in the first seven weeks of the nominating season, from Feb. 3, 2020 through March 17, 2020.

Indeed, as Kondik notes, fully 60 percent of pledged delegates will be awarded during a two-week period running from March 3 (generally known as Super Tuesday) through March 17, when primaries are scheduled in fully half the states (a share that could go even higher if late-deciding states like New York move into this window). Depending on what happens in the four February contests that are “protected” from additional competition by national party rules (Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina, in that order), this huge bloc of early-to-mid-March states could either produce scattered results that make an early decision impossible, or could instead make one candidate the putative (not official, but certain) nominee.

In one entirely plausible scenario, one of the early front-runners, Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders, wins both Iowa and New Hampshire. No candidate in either party who pulled off that stunt since Iowa emerged as a major nominating-contest state in the 1970s has failed to win the nomination. Conversely, Bill Clinton in 1992 is the only candidate to lose both states and go on to win the nomination, and that anomaly deserves an asterisk because favorite son Tom Harkin took Iowa off the table that year. In another “early knockout” scenario, Kamala Harris does surprisingly well in Iowa, better in Nevada, consolidates the African-American vote to win South Carolina, and then wins big in her home state of California and in southern states with South Carolina–like demographics (six states of the former Confederacy are holding primaries on the same day as California, March 3). Particularly since Harris has “unity candidate” characteristics, she would be hard to stop at that juncture.

However, the March primaries are sufficiently diverse — geographically, demographically, and ideologically — to enable multiple candidates to survive with skill, luck, and money. The only region significantly under-represented in the early going is the Mid-Atlantic (though again, New York could yet move its primary to March).

Whether or not there’s an early knockout, the field will almost certainly be significantly winnowed by March. While Democrats do insist generally on proportional delegate awards (i.e., they ban the kind of winner-take-all contests that helped Donald Trump nail down the GOP nomination in 2016), a major qualification is the 15 percent threshold for winning any delegates at either the statewide or congressional-district level. The same huge field that may keep down popular vote and delegate percentages for those at the top will almost certainly deny delegates to many at the bottom, which means a lot of candidates could drop out before the snows melt as the vital oxygen of money and media vanishes.

And as Kondik reminds us, the winnowing will likely begin before voters vote at all:

Some candidates who seem prominent now won’t even make it to the start of voting. That’s what happened to candidates such as former Govs. Tim Pawlenty (R-MN) and Scott Walker (R-WI) in 2012 and 2016, respectively. The primary process is an unforgiving, and expensive, crucible. That’s why focusing on fundraising is worthwhile: Candidates who build themselves expensive operations need the money to sustain them, and invariably some candidates’ coffers will run dry months before the first votes are cast.

By late this year, candidates who are struggling in the February 2020 states will probably look ahead to that vast and insanely expensive array of March states and despair. That’s one reason the June and July debates may be such a big deal: It’s a rare and cost-effective opportunity for candidates caught in the scrum to put a bullet next to their names (as Beto O’Rourke briefly did late last year and Pete Buttigieg seems to be doing right now) and achieve an otherwise unlikely viability. The period in which they can all dream of claiming victory in Milwaukee in July 2020, however, won’t last much longer.","Despite Huge Field, There Could Be an Early Knockout in 2020 Democratic Race",New York Magazine,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/04/there-could-be-an-early-decision-in-2020-democratic-race.html

MALE (Reuters) - Maldives former president Mohamed Nasheed, whose party won a landslide in the archipelago's parliamentary election, on Tuesday pledged to conduct a thorough probe into deals with China.

Nasheed's Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) is set to secure 65 seats in the 87-member parliament, giving it a clear majority to push for reforms including imposing the country's first income tax and instituting a minimum wage for the first time.

President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, who is also from the MDP and unseated pro-China leader Abdulla Yameen in September, had urged voters to back his call for an investigation the scale of debts to China, which the party fears could run as high as $3 billion and risks sinking the economy.

The Indian Ocean island chain has been caught in a battle for influence between India and China, which invested millions of dollars during Yameen's rule as part of its Belt and Road plan, designed to improve Beijing's global trade reach.

Yameen denies any wrongdoing in relation to the Chinese debt.

Nasheed, the country's first democratically elected leader between 2008 and 2011 before being forced to step down in a police mutiny, said the result was ""a clear mandate to implement"" the party's pledges.

""Some of the first bills that the new parliament must consider is the pending legislation to fully empower the presidential commission on stolen assets, and deaths and disappearances,"" MDP leader Nasheed told Reuters in the capital Male.

""The government continues to scrutinize the deals signed by the previous government, many of which, we fear, were subject to large scale corruption. We must allow the government to examine these deals with forensic detail.""

Final provisional results for the election will officially be confirmed on Wednesday, an Elections Commission official told Reuters.

The MDP is just one seat shy of the three-quarters quorum required to amend the constitution in the People Majlis or parliament. This is the first time a party has had such a majority since the first multi-party elections in 2008. The MDP previously ruled in coalition.

The new parliament is expected to be inaugurated in May.

Last month, Yameen spent more than a month in police custody over a graft scandal aimed at siphoning money from the islands' tourism board. He was released on bail on March 28 in time for the last week of campaigning, and denies the charges.

Former Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, of Vermont, are also leading the pack among the 2020 Democratic White House hopefuls.

Although Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are still leading the field of Democratic White House hopefuls, a new poll shows Pete Buttigieg is an ""emerging dark horse"" candidate among New Hampshire primary voters.

The South Bend, Indiana, mayor has nearly 11 percent support from Granite State Democrats, according to Saint Anselm College's poll. Former Vice President Biden topped the list at 23 percent support, followed by Vermont's U.S. senator at 16 percent. U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, hailing from New Hampshire's neighbor to the south, came in fourth place with 9 percent. California's U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris had the fifth-most amount of support from New Hampshire Democratic primary voters with nearly 7 percent.

""The early battle in [New Hampshire] seems to be between two familiar faces that represent different wings of the Democratic Party,"" said Neil Levesque, New Hampshire Institute of Politics' executive director.

However, the poll found that Buttigieg is enjoying a 33 percent increase in name recognition in the Granite State, and that he even had a slight lead over Sanders in New Hampshire's Merrimack Valley area, which includes Concord, Manchester and Nashua.

AG Barr: ‘I Think Spying Did Occur’ on 2016 Trump Campaign

Attorney General William Barr was asked why he has a team looking into why the FBI opened an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. He said he thought that “spying did occur” on the Trump campaign. “The question was whether it was adequately predicated,” he said. (Published Wednesday, April 10, 2019)

""He's hit a skyrocket 33 percent increase in his favorability in just the last two months,"" said Levesque.

The poll also found that Biden's favorability numbers have decreased to 70 percent since February 2019, which was the last time Saint Anselm conducted a poll. Biden, who has not formally announced his candidacy for the 2020 race, has been under fire recently for how he interacts with women.

""Interestingly about Joe Biden, he ranks highest among women. He almost has a little bit of a gender gap with men,"" said LeVesque. ""It's kind of an opposite problem of what you would think.""

Meanwhile, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, New York's U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Hawaii's U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard all came in with less than 1 percent of support from New Hampshire Democratic primary voters.

""There are a few others that are barely even registering and at this point, that would seem to be a red flag for their campaigns,"" said LeVesque.

Polling took place between April 3 and April 8, and has an sampling error of 3.7 percent.

Guest Opinion

Canadian provincial politics has a rich history of come-from-behind parties emerging from the margins to occupy the epicentre of power. The Greens are poised to show the rest of Canada that it can happen in P.E.I. as well.

And while the Greens may appear to lack any experience in governing, this, history shows, is not always a disqualification for office.

New, untested parties have formed effective governments. A look back into the history of provincial politics in Canada shows that the seemingly improbable can become fairly mainstream and practical.

Take Alberta, for example. A rural revolt formed the United Farmers of Alberta party, which, as the name implies, was composed of a lot of actual farmers. They won the 1921 provincial election. The result? After some initial struggles to find their footing, the party eventually caught its groove and was able to govern effectively. They were even re-elected in subsequent elections and held on to power until 1935, only to lose to Social Credit, another “new” party that emerged amid the populist rage of the Great Depression (and remained in power for four decades).

In all cases, these new parties formed what can arguably be described as effective governments. Alberta is not the exception. Other provinces have formed successful governments out of movements external to mainstream politics. British Columbia, for example, elected Social Credit to office in 1952, and the party held on until 1972.

The Co-Operative Commonwealth Federation (renamed the New Democratic Party) upset the Liberal/Conservative alteration of government in Saskatchewan by winning the 1944 election, and quite a few more afterwards.

Moving a little further east, the Parti Québécois in 1976 undermined the otherwise back-and-forth alteration between Liberal and Union Nationals governments. Interesting to note that while the PQ now appears to be in decline, another relatively new party has taken over Quebec politics, this time upsetting the PQ-Liberal alteration.

With few exceptions, these “new” parties are not entirely new. They have histories of mostly failed election campaigns. And they almost all belong to some national network. There were United Farmers parties elsewhere, as there were Social Credit and NDP/CCF chapters all over Canada.

The Green Party of P.E.I. is similar in that it, too, is part of a national, and even international, umbrella movement of parties and other organizations with a shared focus on addressing environmental concerns.

These alliances are important. It is often through these associations that parties gain a source of research and knowledge needed to develop and support policy ideas. A new party elected to office may be new to governing (which itself is not necessarily a bad thing), but their ideas are not necessarily improvised on the spot. New parties that get elected to office bring with them sophisticated and well considered ideas that emerged from their knowledge networks. And the Greens certainly belong to a vast network of researchers, policy experts, activists, and even economists.

Another common feature of such come-from-behind new parties is that they don’t necessarily spell disaster and dysfunction. They actually can deliver good government, even if at first it seems like a long shot. However, they are often challenged by how they are perceived by voters. When minor parties become more prominent, their image is still mainly defined by a narrow set views of such parties.

The UFA, the NDP, even the PQ all originally had a brand focused on a small set of issues, be it support for farmers, eradicate income inequality, or to establish a sovereign state. But when these parties get in government, they show an ability to run schools, pave roads, manage finances, promote economic growth, and so forth. They may not be perfect, but arguably, they weren’t incompetent, either.

For sure, those unaccustomed to governing, parliamentary procedure, or the sausage-making aspects of policy have to learn quickly. But that’s true of anyone who new to politics, be they a farmer, factory worker or lawyer. If a party is serious about governing, then history shows there is nothing about its “newness” that renders it unfit to govern.

The party, running for re-election, plans to work with post-secondary ...","With the provincial election on April 16 looming, and parties announcing their platforms, The Gateway compiled a summary of post-secondary education promises.

Below is a summary of what four major parties running in the general election have to say about post-secondary education in Alberta and how they envision to make it better.



United Conservative Party: more international students, better IP laws, and freedom of speech policies on campuses

The UCP had four policy goals surrounding post-secondary education in Alberta.



If elected, the UCP said they would create an international student entrepreneur plan where foreign students would be recruited to study in Alberta and relocate to the province permanently to use their newly learned skills within the labour market.



Their policy also details plans to strengthen intellectual property frameworks to create a more robust system encouraging commercialization of research and ideas from Alberta post-secondary institutions.



The UCP would also require all universities to develop and comply with freedom of speech laws that conform to the University of Chicago Statement on Principles of Free Expression. Released in 2014, the Chicago principles include maintaining a climate of civility and mutual respect while restricting speech that violates the law or defames a person.

Additionally, the party plans to monitor the success of academic programs offered at the post-secondary level by measuring “labour market outcomes.” According to the document, this would aid in identifying correlations between provincial subsidies and economic returns for taxpayers. Further, the UCP plans to monitor the outcomes of post-secondary institutions against leading global research and innovation hubs like California, Texas, Israel, London, and Hong Kong.



New Democratic Party: new funding formulas, free upgrading, and stable funding

The NDP’s platform includes three specific post-secondary education goals within their platform document.



The party, running for re-election, plans to work with post-secondary institutions to renew funding formulas and focus new resources on creating additional spaces for new students. The document also said they want to ensure a lack of seats does not halt qualified students from being enrolled in desired programs.



Additionally, the NDP said it would eliminate tuition fees associated with high school upgrading and English language learning programs offering everyone the opportunity to learn.



While detailing its five-year tuition freeze, the NDP document gives no indication that this will continue. Instead, their platform said they are committed to providing consistent and stable funding to post-secondary institutions in Alberta.



Alberta Liberal Party: STEM support, tackling deferred maintenance, and progressive financial support

The Alberta Liberal Party has set out five main policy goals for post-secondary education as part of their platform.



One of their policy goals is to support science, technology, engineering, and mathematical (STEM) fields so they remain competitive in Alberta and employable in the province. Their platform said many graduates within STEM programs leave the province and take their newfound skills with them. The party’s plan to combat this is to grow the number of seats available in these programs by 25 per cent within the next five years.



Another goal is addressing deferred maintenance on campuses across the province. Deferred maintenance describes when infrastructure components are scheduled to be repaired within a particular time but aren’t, which could result in costlier future repairs. The Liberal plan said it will fund university related deferred maintenance costs but details no specific monetary amounts.



Their last post-secondary goal is to provide more student financial aid to those who need it most. If elected, the Liberals will make post-secondary more affordable for low-income students through targeted financial supports. No additional details are provided.



Additionally, the Liberal platform said it is against voluntary student unionism (VSU).



Alberta Party: student loan forgiveness, increasing capacity, and expanding STEP

The Alberta Party has set out five main policy points with a post-secondary education focus.



Part of their platform will establish a student loan forgiveness program if a student who graduates decides to work within the province. Additional loan forgiveness will be granted to students who decide to reside and work in rural and remote areas of Alberta.



Another of their goals is to increase the post-secondary system’s capacity. The Alberta Party wants to have 45,000 more seats available for students to study at universities, colleges, and technical institutes in the province. Of these, 3,000 will be exclusively for Indigenous-led programming. The document said this would help accommodate a predicted growth within the system of 40,265 students by 2026.



The party also wants to expand employment opportunities for students in the province. Part of this would be to expand the Summer Temporary Employment Program (STEP) into a year-long initiative. Additionally, people who have graduated within 12 months will still be able to access the program.



The Alberta Party also plans to eliminate tuition fees associated with high school upgrading and English language learning programs.



If elected, the Alberta Party will continue the current level of capped tuition at all post-secondaries across the province. The party also plans to improve intellectual properties models to allow business spin-offs to be started from research or innovation programs.

He also praised the leaders for ...,"Mayor Naheed Nenshi offered a bleak assessment of the major party platforms Friday when it comes to one of the most pressing issues facing the city.

“One out of four office buildings in downtown Calgary are empty; small businesses across Calgary are struggling; 15,000 Albertans have declared personal bankruptcy,” Nenshi said. “And I was really, really disappointed to see that none of the parties, none of them, had a real plan for economic growth in Calgary.”

Prospective provincial leaders ignore Calgary’s serious financial straits at their peril, Nenshi said. Calgary accounts for approximately a third of the province’s GDP, while unemployment remains higher here than in any comparable Canadian city, including Edmonton.

The city has now published responses from all four major parties to the yycmatters.ca survey. The survey was launched to give Calgary voters a better idea where parties stand on municipal priorities.

Nenshi praised the New Democratic Party and United Conservative Party at a press conference Friday for committing to the city’s long-term capital project plan.

He also praised the leaders for promising to honour commitments to the Springbank dry dam and the Green Line — with mild admonishment to the UCP for leaving “loopholes” in its platform when it comes to flood mitigation. The UCP has said it will expedite Springbank, so long as it receives the necessary approvals and consultations with First Nations are complete.

However, Nenshi criticized all four parties for failing to offer concrete, immediate solutions for bringing jobs and investment to Calgary or assistance for businesses on the brink. Both the UCP and NDP platforms rely on long term economic plays to spur jobs indirectly, he said, either through corporate tax cuts or new green economy opportunities.

Practical steps to grow the economy in the short term were ignored, Nenshi said, including things like matching funds through the city’s opportunity investment fund or providing a “tax holiday” for the provincial portion of property taxes for business.

Nenshi asked about racist, homophobic views percolating up in this campaign. Nenshi says it’s “not a smear job” to talk about these basic values . And policy discussions are only possible once candidates demonstrate they will respect the rights of every citizen #abvote #yyccc — Meghan Potkins (@mpotkins) April 5, 2019

And the UCP plan in particular shows a lack of comprehension about how cities operate, Nenshi said.

“When your biggest promise to municipalities is, ‘we’re going to publish a report card on you’ — that pretty much shows a real lack of respect for how local government works,” Nenshi said.

“There’s a real lack of understanding of how cities work and a real lack of understanding of Calgary in particular. I would expect anyone who wants to be premier needs to understand the city very well.”

Jason Kenney fired back Friday afternoon at a press conference where the UCP leader was reacting to the latest Alberta jobs numbers.

Kenney said a UCP government would reduce the province’s corporate tax rate to eight per cent, a move he suggested would create 55,000 jobs. Currently, the province’s corporate tax rate sits at 12 per cent.

He also defended his proposal to create a report card for municipalities, arguing it would create a healthy “competition” between cities.

“All we’re proposing is that we’re going to offer Albertans a fiscal report card on an annual basis showing how much municipalities are spending, how much they are taking in, how much their tax rates have gone up or gone down,” Kenney said. “I can’t imagine why the mayor would be opposed to transparency.”

Financial data comparing Alberta municipalities on an annual basis is already available on the municipal affairs website.

But some races are expected to be more heated than others, and come election day will be closely watched political battlegrounds. As the clock ticks down to election day on April 16, we bring you our picks for ridings to watch. EDMONTON—Candidates hoping to represent the people of Bonnyville-Cold Lake-St. Paul shouldn’t overlook the interests of Indigenous voters, as experts say a wave of First Nations and Métis people casting their ballots helped shape the outcome of the 2015 election that ultimately overthrew a government after decades in power.

The Kinosoo Totem Poles in Cold Lake, Alta., were made by former Cold Lake First Nations chief Ovide Jacko in 1967 as a symbol of unity between the Cold Lake First Nations and the town of Cold Lake. ( Google Maps )

Boundary redivisions have brought the Saddle Lake Cree Nation into Bonnyville-Cold Lake-St. Paul, joining a riding where now nearly one in five people identifies as First Nations, Inuit or Métis. During the last provincial election, many polling stations on or near First Nations communities saw a spike in voter turnout. Cold Lake First Nations Councillor Dean Janvier said people in his community were inspired to vote after hearing promises from candidates that mirrored their needs and interests, something he says has been sorely missing from Alberta’s prior elections.

A polling station on the Cold Lake First Nations saw a significant increase in voter turnout in 2015, jumping from single digits in 2008 and 2012 to nearly 30 per cent voter participation in 2015. Janvier said that was a direct result of the New Democratic Party acknowledging the importance of Indigenous people in Alberta in its platform and in promises made to protect the rights of Indigenous people.

“It was a welcome change from previous elections in Alberta. I think that the citizens of Cold Lake First Nations were looking for some support and acknowledgement that we’re part of Alberta too,” Janvier said. Brad Clark, assistant professor and chair of journalism programs at Mount Royal University, analyzed data from 80 polling stations on or near First Nations and Métis communities in Alberta after the 2015 provincial election and found multiple ridings where higher support from Indigenous people directly contributed to the election of NDP candidates. He said of the votes cast at those 80 polling stations, around 68 per cent were in support of the NDP. “What I think was significant going into the election was the New Democrats had a real platform targeting and speaking to First Nations and Métis people in the province across different groups, different nations, and the PCs had very little,” Clark said. Clark said the mobilization of Indigenous communities — especially in less densely populated ridings in more rural areas of Alberta — will be “a big story again.” Clark said the NDP has been able to maintain strengthened relationships with Indigenous communities since forming government in 2015, but it remains to be seen whether this will be enough to win a majority of hearts and minds in Bonnyville-Cold Lake-St. Paul, an area that remains a conservative stronghold. United Conservative Party candidate Dave Hanson secured a narrow 547-vote victory over NDP candidate Catherine Harder when he won his seat in the neighbouring riding of Lac La Biche-St. Paul-Two Hills for the Wildrose Party in 2015. Hanson secured the nomination over Wildrose Party Bonnyville-Cold Lake MLA Scott Cyr to represent the United Conservatives in the new riding of Bonnyville-Cold Lake-St. Paul in 2019. In Bonnyville-Cold Lake, nearly 77 per cent of the votes cast in 2015 were in favour of conservative candidates, split between the Wildrose and Progressive Conservative parties.

(CNN) - Two new polls from the states that will be the first to weigh in on the Democratic field next year show former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders continue to stand ahead of the rest of the field, and provide the best evidence yet that the small group of candidates standing just behind those two includes South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

A Monmouth University poll of likely Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa, out Thursday, finds Biden at the top of the pack with 27% support, Sanders at 16%, Buttigieg at 9%, Sens. Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren at 7%, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke at 6%, Sen. Amy Klobuchar at 4%, Sen. Cory Booker at 3%, and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro at 2%. The rest of the field stood at 1% or less in the poll, with a sizable 12% saying they are undecided among the 24 candidates tested in the poll.

In New Hampshire, site of the nation's first primary elections, a St. Anselm College poll also out Tuesday shows a similar lineup: Biden at 23%, Sanders at 16%, Buttigieg at 11%, Warren at 9%, Harris at 7%, O'Rourke at 6%, Booker at 4% and Klobuchar at 2%. The rest of the tested field landed at 1% or less. Nearly 1 in 5 said they were undecided or backing someone not named in the list of 14 candidates presented to those who took the poll.

Both surveys show Buttigieg earning broadly positive reviews as voters get to know him, with room still to grow. In Iowa, Monmouth places his favorability rating at 45% positive to 9% negative. That's a sharp improvement in both awareness and positive ratings. In early March, a CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll in Iowa found 73% of likely caucusgoers unsure of how they felt about the South Bend Mayor, while 17% had a positive view and 10% a negative one.

In New Hampshire, St. Anselm finds a similar divide to Monmouth's Iowa survey: 42% view Buttigieg favorably and 6% have an unfavorable take.

It is worth noting that the error margins for both of these polls are fairly large (plus or minus 5.2 percentage points for the Monmouth poll and 5.4 percentage points for the St. Anselm poll), so Buttigieg's standing in the surveys is not meaningfully above that of Warren, Harris or O'Rourke in either poll.

Monmouth's survey in Iowa also delved into likely caucusgoers' top issues and the importance of electability. About two-thirds (64%) said they would prefer a candidate they don't agree with on most issues if he or she would be a strong candidate against President Donald Trump over a candidate who shared their views on most issues but who would have a hard time beating Trump. About a quarter said they'd stick with the candidate who matched their views on the issues (24%).

About half (49%) said it is very important to them that the Democrats nominate a candidate who supports ""Medicare for All,"" 31% said it was that important for the party to nominate someone who supports the Green New Deal, and just 16% considered it very important to back a candidate who supports impeaching Trump.

Overall, 51% named health care in an open-ended question about the top issue in deciding whom to support, 17% named climate change or global warming, 14% each immigration and education, 13% jobs and unemployment, and 12% the environment or pollution. Rounding out the list of issues that hit double-digits: 10% said Donald Trump was their top issue.

The Monmouth poll is among those that will be considered in determining which candidates qualify for the Democratic Party primary debates beginning in June. The 1% reached by former Rep. John Delaney and businessman Andrew Yang in this poll means both have reached at least 1% in three qualifying polls on the race and will meet the polling criteria. Including these two, a total of 14 candidates have hit that mark so far.

In recent days, many leading Democrats have come out against the Netanyahu plan, with Pete Buttigieg echoing Bernie Sanders’s words of four years ago (you don’t have to agree with Netanyahu). Since Netanyahu’s reelection the warnings from Dems have become more dire.

Dianne Feinstein, surely the most principled of the old-guard Democrats, said yesterday that Israel cannot “maintain its military occupation of the West Bank in perpetuity”:

Now that Prime Minister Netanyahu will likely form the next government, I urge his coalition to exercise restraint and reject campaign promises to annex any portion of the West Bank – doing so would be a serious blow to lasting peace… For its own long-term survival, Israel must choose a different path forward. As Israel forms a new government, I urge its leaders to take no action – particularly annexing the West Bank – that would kill a two-state solution.

Before the election, pro-Israel Rep. Jan Schakowsky issued an alarm:

For years, bipartisan majorities have signed onto congressional resolutions supporting a two-state solution. Netanyahu has issued a direct threat against that vision. To my colleagues who’ve expressed their support for two states: Your voices are needed now.

Former Obama official Julian Castro is making the issue a centerpiece of his campaign to be president:

In abandoning our position as a good faith partner in the Middle East peace process, the Trump admin has enabled reckless actions like this from Netanyahu. US support for a two-state solution is on the line in November 2020.

J Street is urging all Democratic presidentials to draw the line on annexation.

Castro joins @PeteButtigieg and @BetoORourke in calling out Netanyahu’s dangerous pledge to annex the West Bank.

This is the type of principled leadership we need from 2020 hopefuls.

Senator Chris Van Hollen two days ago pressed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on the Trump administration’s view of “unilateral annexation.” Notice Van Hollen’s near desperation as he sees facts changing on the ground:

It sounds like you have already abandoned what has been a bipartisan foreign policy of opposing the annexation of any or part of the West Bank by Israel… The polls are closing right now in Israel. Things could move very quickly. And as you know the prime minister as a candidate said he would annex all or part of the West Bank. He said settlements and then he said outposts. And today you cannot tell us what US policy is on the issue…. Do you agree that Palestinians should be extended basic human rights?

Pompeo said yes, but didn’t answer the overall policy issue. Van Hollen then imagined one state with equal rights!

If you had a one state solution since you hadn’t affirmed a two-state solution would you agree that in a one state solution Palestinians should have full and equal political and legal rights with other citizens of that state?… I asked you about unilateral annexation… You can’t tell me if that’s something you support… Do you think that you can preserve a state that is Jewish and democratic and preserves the rights of all its citizens without a two-state solution?

Van Hollen on twitter:

After asking multiple times, @SecPompeo refused to tell me if the United States would oppose @Netanyahu’s plan to unilaterally annex all or large parts of the West Bank even though it would clearly sabotage any prospect for a two-state solution.

Virginia Senator Tim Kaine did the same two-step with Pompeo (Jewish Insider’s clip from C-Span).

Kaine: Would we support an annexation of the West Bank, do we oppose it, or are we indifferent to whether that happens? Pompeo: We are now working with many parties to share what our vision is for how to solve this problem. Senator, you would concede that for decades now there have been all of these wonderful experts that have tried resolve this crisis in the Middle East, the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people, and they have each failed. So the old set of ideas aren’t worth retreading, they have simply not succeeded. We are hopeful that our vision, our ideas of what this might look like, how we might proceed to do that– will create the conditions where the Israelis and the Palestinians can resolve this. Kaine: Do you think the two-state solution is an old idea whose time has gone? Pompeo: It’s certainly been an idea that’s been around a long time, Senator…I would argue that millions of man hours have been spent to try and build out a two state solution. It hasn’t worked to date. It may work this afternoon, but it hasn’t worked yet.

Pompeo did say the Palestinians have to buy in to the solution.

For there to be a peaceful resolution here, the Palestinian people are– we’ve seen intifadas, we’ve seen protests, we’ve seen what’s happening in Gaza. I think the Israelis accept the fact that what the ultimate resolution of this will be something that the Palestinian people are going to have to acknowledge makes sense.

Kaine said he was shocked.

I won’t follow up on the hypothetical of whether this administration still accepts the notion of a two-state solution. I’m kind of shocked that that can’t be stated clearly.

Martin Indyk is shaping the Democratic response to annexation, it will not bring peace.

There was no chance of Israeli-Palestinian peace before Trump recognized Israel’s Golan annexation; there’s even less than none if Bibi forms an annexationist government which now seems likely. The only peace Trump will make is between him and Bibi… It’s been three days since Netanyahu declared his intention to annex all West Bank settlements. Radio silence from the Trump Administration. Has @jdgreenblatt45 lost his twitter thumbs? Or should we assume that silence means acquiescence?

Aaron David Miller has the same view:

Trump is the most preternaturally pro-Netanyahu US President in history. If he enables Israeli Government’s annexation of West Bank and facilitates Netanyahu’s efforts to end run his indictments he may well be remembered as one of the most anti-Israeli presidents in history.

Jeremy Ben-Ami of J Street warns that annexation will alienate American Jews.

“We will see a fundamental change in the US-Israel relationship… The move to annexation, cementing Palestinian disenfranchisement, is not acceptable for a majority of the Democratic Party and most American liberal Jews”

Jane Eisner issued a similar warning about divorce between American Jews and Israel over annexation on WNYC this a.m.

Michael Koplow issued the warning at Israel Policy Forum:

If American Jewry feels marginalized now, just wait for what is coming… Any hope of amending, let alone repealing, the nation-state law is going to be a cruel joke. The dominant theme of this government is going to be hardline religious policies that erase the already barely visible line between state and religion, and it will make American Jews feel more marginalized in the Jewish state than they already do

Abe Silberstein at Israel Policy Forum hopes that Netanyahu forms a centrist government with Benny Gantz’s Blue and White that won’t attempt annexation, but that’s not the smart money. “[T]he chances of some sort of annexation on the West Bank are considerable.”

Most Israeli experts I follow are predicting a completely right-wing coalition, ranging from Likud to the extremist Union of Right-Wing Parties. This would be the worst outcome for Israelis primarily concerned about the rule of law and the country’s democratic future: not only do the number of Knesset members who support annexation vastly outnumber those favoring separation (even fewer speak explicitly of the two-state solution), but there is a predictable deal on the table to trade a limited annexation for passage of a retroactive “French Law,” which would give Netanyahu full legal immunity for offenses committed while in office. But perhaps worst of all, the strongest deterrent against annexation is effectively on the sidelines: Yesterday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo refused to say if the United States would oppose unilateral annexation.

Silberstein says that will alienate American Jews.

This puts diaspora Jews concerned about the Jewish state’s liberal democratic character in a gut-wrenching bind. There is no clear path forward to stopping annexation in the short and medium term through Israeli and American political institutions. Perhaps the European Union could provide Netanyahu the room to maneuver her needs to fend off annexationists (that is, if he still opposes annexation).

(Well, liberal Zionists could come out for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS). That would be a countermove.)

Lastly, here for the record is Beto O’Rourke’s full quote on Netanyahu being a racist, from CNN correspondent DJ Judd. Annexation figures prominently.","‘Things could move very quickly’ — Dems are now the anti-annexation party, taking on Netanyahu and Pompeo",Mondoweiss,https://mondoweiss.net/2019/04/quickly-annexation-netanyahu/comment-page-1/

The two sides ...","LOS ANGELES — Billionaire investor Ron Burkle is in talks to acquire The National Enquirer, The New York Times reported, potentially putting a high-profile Democratic Party donor in charge of a tabloid with ties to President Donald Trump.

The two sides are deep in discussions, though the talks aren’t yet final, the Times said, citing unidentified people familiar with the negotiations. When reached by Bloomberg Wednesday night, a spokesman for Burkle denied that the billionaire was buying the Enquirer.

Embattled publisher American Media LLC announced that the 93-year-old tabloid was for sale on Wednesday, following accusations of extortion by billionaire Jeff Bezos this year and an earlier flap over killing embarrassing stories about Trump. A heavy debt load has put an additional burden on the company. And despite being a staple of supermarket checkout aisles for decades, the Enquirer has suffered a decline in circulation.

Leon Cooperman, an investor in American Media, said he believes an unspecified buyer is interested in making the deal. If Burkle does ultimately agree to the purchase, it would put the publication in the hands of a Democratic fundraiser famous for his friendship with Bill Clinton.

Burkle, who controls Yucaipa Cos., made his fortune in the grocery-store industry, where the Enquirer generates much of its revenue.

A sale would help ease the pressure on American Media, Chief Executive Officer David Pecker and the company’s hedge fund backers. Chatham Asset Management is the principal owner of the publisher, and two of the firm’s executives serve on its board. Cooperman, a billionaire hedge fund manager, has said that his stake is relatively small.

Advertising

Chatham, run by Anthony Melchiorre, has grown increasingly disgusted with the reporting tactics at the Enquirer and pushed for the sale, according to The Washington Post.

‘Near Future’

American Media’s board conducted a review of its tabloid business, including the Globe and National Examiner brands, and decided to explore strategic options. That will “likely result in their sale in the near future,” the company said on Wednesday.

“We feel the future opportunities with the tabloids can be best exploited by a different ownership,” Pecker, who also serves as chairman, said in a statement.

The Enquirer and its owner have come under intense scrutiny since Bezos made his allegations in a blog post in February. Bezos accused American Media of trying to blackmail him with photos of him with a woman who wasn’t his wife. He also published emails sent to his lawyer, Marty Singer, by American Media executives.

The scrutiny extended to Chatham, which was questioned by New Jersey officials over the matter. The firm also has come under review by securities regulators.

The Bezos situation followed a separate controversy over the publisher’s ties to Trump. The company admitted that it worked with the Trump campaign to withhold stories about the candidate’s relationships with women.

Advertising

Pecker is considered a friend of Trump, but Melchiorre has been linked to the president as well. When Pecker arrived at the White House in July 2017 for a dinner with Trump, he was accompanied by the hedge fund boss.

Unloading the Enquirer would shift American Media’s focus toward fitness and lifestyle brands. In recent years, it acquired Us Weekly and Men’s Journal, as well as Bauer Media’s celebrity and teen brands.

Saudi Ties

Bezos, head of Amazon.com Inc., also has knocked American Media for its ties to Saudi Arabia. Around the time of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s visit to the U.S. a year ago, American Media produced a nearly 100-page glossy magazine celebrating the country as “The New Kingdom.”

Bezos questioned whether critical coverage of Saudi Arabia by his newspaper, The Washington Post, might have spurred the publisher to retaliate against him. American Media said in February that it “does not have, nor have we ever had, any editorial or financial ties to Saudi Arabia.”

Federal Prosecutors

Bezos is set to meet federal prosecutors in Southern District of New York as soon as this week, CNN reported Wednesday. They’re looking to get access to Bezos’s electronic devices, letting them examine his private investigator’s allegation that Saudi Arabia obtained private information from his phone.

Even before the turmoil, American Media was grappling with financial losses. The closely held company recorded a $31.5 million deficit in the six months that ended Sept. 30, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. That marked an improvement over the previous year, but nonetheless brought its total losses over the last 5 1/2 fiscal years to $256 million.

Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie, announced earlier this month that they were completing the dissolution of their marriage. The divorce is the most expensive on record, with MacKenzie Bezos receiving a 4 percent Amazon stake, worth roughly $36 billion.

I want him to grow up with opportunity. I don’t want him, or any of our children, to be forced to leave the province to find opportunity somewhere else.

I want my grandson to grow up in an Alberta that’s fair and inclusive, where he can dream. That’s why I’m running for premier.

Our case is simple: we can build a great economy and a kind society, together. We don’t have to choose between the two, despite how the other parties make it sound.

Everywhere I go, I hear from Albertans, who reject the idea they have to choose between jobs and growth, or inclusion and human rights. We should be able to provide for our families and keep their rights. In 2019, those are the table stakes.

It’s about balance. That’s what the Alberta Party is about.

Our Children First plan is better than what’s being offered by others. Thousands of middle-class families and minimum-wage earners will pay less under our plan.

According to CNN and The Hill, a call was placed to Omar’s Washington office on March 21, during which the individual on the other line identified himself as Pat Carlineo. He asked Omar’s receptionist, “Do you work for the Muslim Brotherhood? Why are you working for her, she’s a (expletive) terrorist. I’ll put a bullet in her (expletive) skull.”

Omar’s office then referred the call to the police. According to an affidavit, Carlineo provided the correct spelling of his name and his contact information to the receptionist over the call. He was interviewed by authorities, whom he told that he loved Donald Trump, that he was a U.S. patriot and “that he hates radical Muslims in our government.”

The threat from Carlineo came 10 days after Fox New Host Jeanine Pirro criticized Omar’s choice to wear a hijab. On her Twitter page, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez linked Pirro’s comments and Carlineo’s threats against Omar.

“Understand when Jeanine Pirro goes on Fox + rallies people to think hijabs are threatening, it leads to this. Folks who imply we’re “bad” for politics, the party, the country, etc. have no idea the threats we deal w/ because of that kind of language,” the tweet read.

The proposed surtax would prevent Amazon and other companies with profits exceeding $100 million from wiping out their tax liabilities altogether.

Instead of taxable corporate income as defined by the IRS, the 7% surtax would apply to profits companies report to their investors.

© Provided by CNBC LLC Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), one of several Democrats running for the party's nomination in the 2020 presidential race, speaks during a campaign event, March 8, 2019 in the Queens borough of New York City.

Elizabeth Warren, the economic policy pacesetter in the Democratic presidential primary field, wants to raise $1 trillion in government revenue from a new 7% surtax on profits of the largest corporations.

What the Massachusetts senator dubs the ""Real Corporate Profits Tax"" would apply to worldwide profits exceeding $100 million. The purpose, she says, is to bolster government coffers by preventing corporate giants from exploiting loopholes to avoid federal taxation following the large tax cut enacted by President Donald Trump and a GOP-controlled Congress in December 2017.

""It will make our biggest and most profitable corporations pay more and ensure that none of them can ever make billions and pay zero taxes again,"" Warren wrote in a Medium post published Thursday morning. ""To raise the revenue we need — and ensure every corporation pays their fair share — we need a new kind of tax that big companies can't get around.""

The Trump tax cut, following entreaties from corporations for a more globally competitive U.S. system, reduced the top corporate rate to 21% from 35%. But deductions remaining in the IRS code allow some large corporations to reduce their effective rates far below that — in some cases all the way to zero.

Warren cited two high-profile examples: Amazon has reported $10 billion in 2018 profits but

zero in U.S. corporate taxes; Occidental Petroleum has reported $4.1 billion in profits and also paid zero.

Her new surtax would prevent them, and other corporations with profits exceeding $100 million, from wiping out their tax liabilities. Instead of taxable corporate income as defined by the IRS, the 7% surtax would apply to profits companies report to their investors.

Because stock values and executive compensation turn on those public reports, Warren reasons, corporations don't obscure their real profits to shareholders with the write-offs they use for the IRS. Those include large deductions for depreciation, the value of stock options and overseas tax shelters.

The new surtax would be separate from the existing corporate tax. If applied in 2018, Warren said, Amazon would owe $698 million and Occidental Petroleum $280 million.

In a letter released by Warren aides, University of California-Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman estimated that 1,200 public companies would be subject to the tax if it took effect in 2019. Warren said she designed it to avoid hitting small businesses or even large ones that experience a subpar year.

Warren aides said they were unaware of previous attempts to enact a tax of this kind. But they pointed to polls showing strong public support for making large corporations pay more — even within a GOP increasingly dependent on blue-collar voters.

Her proposals, like the major plans of other 2020 Democratic candidates, stand no chance of enactment in the next two years. But they signal ideas that would take center stage if a Democrat wins the presidency in 2020 and the party takes control of Congress.

Warren has previously proposed a substantial increase in estate taxes to help pay for expanding the supply of affordable housing, and a wealth tax on the richest Americans.

The wealth tax would raise $2.7 trillion over 10 years, according to projections. Roughly $700 million from the wealth tax would finance her proposal for universal child care and early childhood education. That would leave her $2 trillion for either deficit reduction or additional spending plans as yet unannounced.

Warren didn't specify how she would spend the $1 trillion over 10 years that the corporate profits surtax would generate, either. That brings the total of available new revenue under her proposals to $3 trillion.",Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren wants to raise $1 trillion in revenue with a new 7% tax on corporate profits over $100 million,CNBC on MSN.ca,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/money/democratic-presidential-candidate-elizabeth-warren-wants-to-raise-1-trillion-in-revenue-with-a-new-7-tax-on-corporate-profits-over-100-million/ar-BBVQcex

The non-aligned Democrat Party, which many had thought could hold the balance of power between pro-military ...","Partial results from Sunday's election in Thailand showed a pro-military party slightly ahead of the populist party leading a ""democratic front,"" an unexpected and, for many, stunning outcome from the country's first poll since a 2014 army coup.

With 93 per cent of overall votes counted, the Election Commission reported the pro-military party Palang Pracharat, which is seeking to keep junta chief Prayuth Chan-ocha in power, was leading with 7.59 million votes.

Trailing with 7.12 million votes was Pheu Thai, a party linked to exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, whose loyalists have won every election since 2001.

The numbers were for the popular vote, but these did not reflect parliamentary constituency seats that would ultimately be won. Pheu Thai could still win the lion's share of these because of its concentrated popularity in the north and northeast of the country.

Nevertheless, there was dismay among many voters who had hoped that the poll would loosen the grip on power that traditional elites and the military have held in a country that has one of the highest measures of inequality in the world.

At Pheu Thai's headquarters in Bangkok, the mood fluctuated from cheerful to quiet disbelief.

""I didn't think this is likely. I don't think this is what the people wanted,"" said Pheu Thai supporter Polnotcha Chakphet.

A #PrayforThailand hashtag started trending on Twitter as the results trickled out, and some people tweeted that they would leave the country if Prayuth was returned to power to remain prime minister.

The Election Commission chairman said unofficial results would be announced on Monday afternoon. The commission said turnout was 66 per cent, based on 90 per cent of the vote counted.

Royal role

The royal family, which wields great influence and commands the devotion of millions of Thais, played a part in the election though how far it influenced the outcome was unclear.

On the eve of the vote, King Maha Vajiralongkorn made an unexpected and cryptic statement, recalling a comment made by his father in 1969 on the need to put ""good people"" in power and to prevent ""bad people from … creating chaos.""

His message was a departure from the approach of his late father, who died in 2016. In his latter years, the former king usually kept a distance between the monarchy and politics.

Although the king did not refer to any of the sides in the election race, there was speculation on social media that it was a coded reference to main political factions — broadly the middle class and urban establishment, who identify with the monarchy and the military, and their pro-Thaksin opponents.

King Vajiralongkorn also weighed in on electoral affairs last month after a startling turn of events when a pro-Thaksin party nominated Princess Ubolratana, the king's sister, as its prime ministerial candidate.

Within hours, the king issued a statement saying her candidacy was ""inappropriate"" and she was disqualified.

Still, the connection between the princess and Thaksin persisted in voters' minds, particularly after they were seen hugging on Friday at the wedding of his daughter in Hong Kong.

""We had a lot of drama in the last hours before the election,"" said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political analyst at Chulalongkorn University. ""Thaksin overplayed with a royal involvement and that was countered by his opponent.""

Deck stacked for military

Thailand has been racked for the past 15 years by crippling street protests both by Thaksin's opponents and supporters that destabilized governments and hamstrung business.

The country has been under direct military rule for nearly five years since then-army chief Prayuth overthrew an elected government linked to populist Thaksin, who himself was thrown out by the army in 2006.

The election will determine the makeup of parliament's 500-seat House of Representatives. The lower house and the upper house, the Senate — which is appointed entirely by the ruling junta — will together select the next prime minister.

Critics have said a new, junta-devised electoral system gives a built-in advantage to pro-military parties and appears designed to prevent Pheu Thai from returning to power.

The provision means Prayuth's Palang Pracharat Party and allies have to win only 126 seats in the House, while Pheu Thai and its potential ""democratic front"" partners would need 376.

The non-aligned Democrat Party, which many had thought could hold the balance of power between pro-military and ""democratic front"" factions, appeared to have been deserted by many voters.

But six months ahead of an October election, polls suggest the 47-year-old politician with the broad smile and a penchant for colorful socks could become the first prime minister to lose power after a single majority mandate since the 1930s.

Trudeau is mired in a relentless scandal over alleged interference in a corporate corruption case that has led to the resignations of two Cabinet members, his top advisor and the head of the federal civil service.

The ruling Liberals have lost 6 percentage points since the start of the year, ceding the lead to the rival Conservatives, according to a Nanos Research poll published on Tuesday.

If an election were held now, the Conservatives would win 34.9 percent of the vote, the Liberals 32.8 percent and the left-leaning New Democratic Party 16.6 percent. The poll suggests the result would be deadlock or a fragile minority government.

“The Liberals have taken a hit, but they’re still competitive,” said pollster Nik Nanos. “The most significant effect has been the negative impact on the prime minister’s personal brand.”

An Ipsos poll from last month put the Conservatives at 40 percent, 10 points ahead of the Liberals.

The Ipsos poll, conducted exclusively for Global News, found Trudeau’s approval rating of 40 per cent had slipped below Trump’s 43 per cent, while the Conservative Party established a double-digit lead over the Liberals.

The poll found that if an election were to be held last month, the Conservatives would have received 40 per cent of the vote among decided voters, according to the poll of 1,002 Canadians conducted between March 25 and 27.

Trudeau, the oldest son of the late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, has from the start pushed a progressive agenda in support of gender equality, the environment and aboriginal rights, all issues that appeal to his core voters, but which after more than three years sound increasingly scripted to some.

Trudeau is not helped by the optics of the scandal involving SNC-Lavalin Group Inc, a prominent Montreal-based engineering and construction firm that has been accused of bribing Libyan officials to get contracts between 2001 and 2011.

The prime minister has been on the defensive over allegations government officials inappropriately pressured Canada’s former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to drop a criminal case against the company in favor of a deferred prosecution agreement, or out-of-court settlement.

Wilson-Raybould, the first indigenous justice minister in Canadian history, resigned over the scandal. Former Treasury Board chief Jane Philpott also quit in protest. They were two of the highest-profile women in Trudeau’s Cabinet.

Political Pivot

So far, Trudeau’s strategy appears to have changed little, and people close to him say he plans to ride it out without major shifts in strategy.

“Successful politicians know when to pivot, and they have a strong survival instinct,” Nanos said, calling the scandal the “first major test of Justin Trudeau’s leadership.”

Ipsos pollster Darrell Bricker said even before the crisis erupted in early February, Trudeau’s support had been softening amid complaints he had broken major commitments such as reforming the voting system and balancing the budget by 2019.

“Justin Trudeau was standing on thin ice at the end of last year, and then somebody handed him an anvil and crash, the ice broke,” Bricker said.

“There’s a credibility problem driven by a bunch of things, one of which is promises made and not kept.”

According to Nanos, the data is based on random telephone interviews of 1,000 Canadian adults using a four week rolling average of 250 respondents each week.

By Dave Graham

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The former political party of Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador issued a blistering attack against the veteran leftist on Wednesday, accusing him of pushing the country toward authoritarianism.

In a full-page advertisement in newspaper Reforma, the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) said Lopez Obrador was dismantling 30 years of reforms aimed at checking the power of the state under Mexico's old rulers.

""We're in the process of restoring a presidential, centralizing and authoritarian system which weakens and suppresses the legislative branch and undermines the independence of the judiciary,"" the PRD said.

Once Mexico's main left-of-center group, the PRD has been reduced to a rump of its former self since Lopez Obrador split to form a new party after finishing runner-up in the 2012 presidential election.

Spokespeople for the president and the party he founded after the leaving the PRD, the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

In office since December, the president has enjoyed soaring levels of popularity while blaming Mexico's problems on old rivals and the previous six administrations.

He has dominated the political agenda with a daily morning news conference, often using it to criticize many checks and balances on his power from within civil society and the media.

The PRD's attack on him underlines the increasingly partisan flavor of politics in Mexico under Lopez Obrador.

Lopez Obrador says he is democratizing freedom of expression with his media conferences and has regularly pushed back against suggestions he aims to install an authoritarian government.

Through MORENA and its allies, Lopez Obrador has firm control of Congress, and adversaries fear that his concentration of power could soon extend to the Supreme Court.

MORENA has proposed increasing the number of judges in the court to create an anti-corruption chamber. His supporters reject criticism that the move is aimed at controlling the body.

For most of the past century, Mexico was ruled by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which melded patronage and vote-rigging with corruption and authoritarianism.

As disaffection with the party's rule grew, a group of reform-minded politicians formed the PRD in the late 1980s. Like Lopez Obrador, many of its leaders once belonged to the PRI.

Serving as PRD chairman in the late 1990s, Lopez Obrador went on to become mayor of Mexico City for the party in 2000, and narrowly failed to win the presidency six years later.

Lopez Obrador refused to accept defeat in 2006, saying he had been robbed. Relations between him and other senior PRD figures gradually broke down and he decided to leave the party behind following his 2012 election defeat.

Many former stalwarts of the PRD joined Lopez Obrador after he founded MORENA, and the remnants of the party backed a rival candidate in the 2018 presidential election.

The PRI ruled Mexico from 1929 until it was voted out in 2000. Returning to power from 2012 to 2018, the PRI suffered a record defeat at the hands of Lopez Obrador in July.

The balanced budget amendment ... such as the Green New Deal and Medicare for All, more difficult to achieve. Murphy, a refugee from Communist ...","The moderate Democratic Blue Dog Coalition, co-chaired by U.S. Rep. Stephanie Murphy of Winter Park, is endorsing a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

The bill, introduced by U.S. Rep. Ben McAdams, D-Utah, would prohibit the federal government from spending more than it receives in any given fiscal year. It’s aimed at the record $22 trillion national debt.

But it would not apply if the U.S. is engaged in military conflict, if the economy shows no growth or declines as measured by GDP during two or more consecutive quarters, or if the unemployment rate exceeds 7 percent during two or more consecutive months.

The amendment also prevents courts from enforcing this requirement by ordering cuts to Social Security or Medicare payments.

The national debt, which had been leveling off since the stimulus and bailouts from the Bush and Obama administrations were enacted in response to the 2008 recession, has increased by about $2 trillion since the beginning of the Trump administration, fueled by the Republican tax bill that lowered corporate tax rates and increased government spending.

February was set to be largest monthly budget deficit on record, the Blue Dogs said in a statement, “higher than at any point during the 2008 global financial crisis, when the economy was in peril and the Tea Party took to the streets.”

“Our national debt is skyrocketing, shackling our children and grandchildren with the burden of dealing with this unsustainable situation,” Murphy said in a statement. “A balanced budget amendment would force Congress’ hand to pass a balanced budget each and every year, and be a responsible steward of taxpayer dollars.”

The amendment has a tough road to passage. It would have to be approved by both houses of Congress and two-thirds of state legislatures to become part of the Constitution.

The bill also shows the widening divide between the moderate and progressive wings of the Democratic Party. The balanced budget amendment would make goals pushed by Democratic Socialists and several Democratic presidential candidates, such as the Green New Deal and Medicare for All, more difficult to achieve.

Murphy, a refugee from Communist Vietnam in the 1970s, told a law firm conference in Washington last week she was a “proud capitalist” and ""I am offended by this whole conversation about socialism,” according to the Washington Examiner.

“The idea that in the greatest democracy, the greatest capitalist system in the world, we’re having casual conversation about socialism, offends me,” Murphy said, according to the Examiner.

Murphy’s District 7 in Seminole and Orange counties, in which she defeated Republican U.S. Rep. John Mica 51.5% to 48.5% in 2016 and state Rep. Mike Miller 58% to 42% in 2018, had been considered a Republican-leaning district but is now listed as solidly Democratic for 2020.

Murphy defeated Chardo Richardson, one of the original members of the Justice Democrats along with U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 86% to 13% in the 2018 Democratic primary.

As those democrats cross the country from Iowa to New Hampshire and South Carolina hoping to earn voter support, Mr Trump faces his own reckoning in the form of approval ratings for the job he is doing as president.

So far in the just over two years he has been in office, Mr Trump has seen approval ratings in the low 40s — a troubling sign for a man who hopes to once again win one of the most powerful offices in the world.

Take a look below for the latest poll coverage from The Independent. We will be updating with the latest individual polls of import, as well as frequent updates on the aggregates of polls and what they mean for the 2020 election prospects.

Buttigieg coming in hot in Iowa now, too Pete Buttigieg's name was barely known just months ago, but he now comes in third place in both Iowa and New Hampshire polling — the first two states to vote in the primary season. Mr Buttigieg's polling in New Hampshire was announced on Wednesday, and a new poll from Monmouth University has placed him third in Iowa now as well. That poll has him attracting 9 per cent approval, and trailing Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. Those two politicians receive 27 per cent and 16 per cent support, respectively. The poll puts Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren both at 7 per cent, Beto O'Rourke at 6 per cent, Amy Klobuchar at 4 per cent, and Cory Booker at 3 per cent.

The survey was conducted between 4 April and 9 April, and contacted 351 likely Democratic caucus goers. There is a margin of error of plus or minus 5.2 per cent. Buttigieg surges to third place in New Hampshire Fresh off of an impressive first quarter fundraising haul, South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg has surged to third place in America's first primary state, New Hampshire. While still trailing the likes of Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, Mr Buttigieg has gained some major ground in the state, according to a Saint Anselm College poll That poll had Mr Biden coming in with 22.9 per cent of the vote, followed by Mr Sanders with 15.6 per cent, and then Mr Buttigieg with 10.7 per cent. No other candidate broke double digits. Elizabeth Warren registered with 8.7 per cent, while Kamala Harris received 6.8 pr cent. The survey contacted 698 Granite State voters between 3 April and 8 April, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 per cent. Voters think Trump has done a good job on the economy — a really good sign for his chances in 2020 Donald Trumps favorability ratings have been anything but stellar since he announced his candidacy to become president in 2015, but a new poll suggests that he has strong support when it comes to the economy. The new poll by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service found that 59 per cent of registered voters are somewhat concerned about an economic downturn, but that the president is still in the black when it comes to approval of his handling of the economy. While his approval ratings overall have stuck in the low 40s during his presidency, the new poll finds that a full 58 per cent approve of his stewardship of the US economy, according to the poll. The poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters between 31 March and 4 April, with a margin of error of 3.1 per cent. Biden emerges largely unscathed after inappropriate touching allegations — and Democratic women still support him He hasn't even declared that he is running for president yet, but Joe Biden has enjoyed a lead in Democratic primary polls so far — and that lead has remained unchanged in light of recent allegations that he touched women inappropriately on several occasions. A new Morning Consult poll shows Mr Biden as having 32 per cent support among those in the crowded field, a full 9 per cent ahead of his nearest competitor, Bernie Sanders. That represents just a 1 per cent drop from last week, and shows that the former vice president has some good staying power in the race should he decide to jump in the race. Among women in the Democratic primary, Mr Biden lost just 0.8 per cent support since the allegations surfaced. The survey was conducted between April 1 and 7, and contacted 13,664 voters. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 1 per cent. South Carolina's dark horse? Could be Stacey Abrams new poll looking into voter preference in South Carolina — an important early primary state for the Democratic nomination — shows that Joe Biden is the favorite there, but former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams is coming in hot. Neither candidate as actually announced their intention to seek the Democratic nomination, but Ms Abrams popped up on the poll after not registering during the last Change Research poll in February. Ms Abrams and South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg both showed up on the poll after not registering in February. Both got 7 per cent support. Mr Biden got 32 per cent support in the field, and is followed by Bernie Sanders, who got 14 per cent. The poll contacted 744 voters in the state, and had a margin of error of 3.2 per cent. Wall Street overwhelmingly thinks Donald Trump will win re-election in 2020. They also think Joe Biden is the most market-friendly candidate out there. A new survey published by RBC Capital Markets suggests that Wall Street insiders think Donald Trump will win re-election in 2020, and that Joe Biden is the most market friendly politician in the current field of candidates and potential candidates. The confidence in Mr Trump's re-election is pretty staggering amongst those in the group: 70 per cent say they think he is going to win in 2020. But, Wall Street doesn't necessarily have a magic crystal ball: In 2016, 80 per cent of those insiders thought that Hillary Clinton would beat Mr Trump to become president. As for the least market-friendly candidate? That designation goes to senator Elizabeth Warren. Break up Amazon and Google? Americans aren't so sure about Elizabeth Warren's idea... Senator Elizabeth Warren has been introducing policy proposal after policy proposal as she makes her case that she should be elected president — including one particularly controversial idea to break up the major tech companies that have come to control massive portions of our every day lives. A new poll shows that Americans aren't completely sold on the idea, at least not yet. The NBC News/WSJ poll found that 50 per cent of Americans do not think that the government should come in and break up massive tech firms with a worth of at least $25b. Meanwhile, 47 per cent said that the companies should be broken up a bit. When asked if the free market should be doing the breaking up, Americans are a bit more decisive. The poll found that 68 per cent feel that the free market should make decisions surrounding the breaking up of big tech firms. That's compared to 28 per cent who felt otherwise. The survey was conducted between March 23 and 27, and 1,000 voters were surveyed.There was a margin of error of 3.1 per cent. One year from the first votes, polls are already an important marker for the Dems With just over a year until the first votes are cast in primary and caucus states, the prospect of following polls at this point may seem ridiculous to some — but performance in these surveys can have a major impact on the burgeoning field. The Democratic National Committee is preparing for a contentious debate season ahead of those votes, and candidates need to receive at least 1 per cent in three DNC-approved polls in order to qualify. Here are the two ways the DNC has identified for candidates to qualify for the debates, which start in June: ""Register 1% or more support in three polls (which may be national polls, or polls in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and/or Nevada) publicly released between January 1, 2019, and 14 days prior to the date of the Organization Debate."" Naturally, there are restrictions on which polls qualify for consideration.

""Candidates may qualify for the debate by demonstrating that the campaign has received donations from at least (1) 65,000 unique donors; and (2) a minimum of 200 unique donors per state in at least 20 U.S. states."" So far, these candidates (or potential candidates) have already qualified: Bernie Sanders

Joe Biden

Kamala Harris

Beto O'Rourke

Elizabeth Warren

Cory Booker

Amy Klobuchar

Pete Buttigieg

Julian Castro

Kirsten Gillibrand

Jay Inslee

John Hickenlooper

Andrew Yang Americans have little trust in Donald Trump when it comes to healthcare Donald Trump has launched a fresh effort to take on Obamacare this week, and has told his fellow Republicans that they cannot ignore the issue if they want to win in 2020. But, a new poll from POLITICO/Morning Consult shows that Americans may not be on board wit the president's new effort to dismantle the 2010 law: A plurality of voters support the bill, voters have little trust in Mr Trump to reform the system, and the poll shows that Americans trust Democrats more when it comes to healthcare legislation. The poll was conducted in the days after the Trump administration asked a federal court last week to strike down the entire Affordable Care Act. When asked who they trust on healthcare: 45 per cent said they trust Democrats, while just 35 per cent said they trust Republicans. Wen asked about Mr Trump: A 59 per cent majority of voters said they have little or no trust in the president on the issue. The law itself also gained 47 per cent support, compared to 41 per cent who said they disagreed with Obamacare. The poll was conducted between 29 March and 1 April, and surveyed 1,945 voters. The margin of error came out to plus or minus 2 per cent. Americans more at ease with a gay president? A recent poll sheds some light on how Americans view the prospects of mayor Pete Buttigieg, a gay man, to become president. The NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll was released earlier this year, but its findings are getting a bit more attention now that Mr Buttigieg is getting some attention following a surprisingly strong first quarter fundraising total of $7m. The survey found that 54 per cent of Americans are comfortable with a gay man being president of the United States, while another 14 per cent say they would be ""enthusiastic"" about it. That's quite the change from just a decade ago, when a similar poll concluded tat 50 per cent of Americans had ""reservations"" or were ""very uncomfortable"" with the idea of a gay man being president. The shift was driven in part by those under 35, where 75 per cent of American voters indicated an ease with the idea of a gay person being president. The poll was conducted between 24 February and 27 February, with 900 adults surveyed. The poll has a 3.3 per cent margin of error.

When AwamiIttihad Party leader and former legislator, engineer Rashid, decided to contest the LokSabha election from the Baramulla parliamentary constituency last month, nobody had imagined that his rallies and social media campaigning will impact the voters’ psyche, particularly youngsters, in the north Kashmir segment.



“He (Rashid) cannot resolve the Kashmir issue, but he will raise his voice in the parliament over issues facing Kashmir. He has fought for the rights of Kashmiris in the Assembly,” said a group of youngsters in Kupwara town, where the polling was held in the first phase of the general elections Thursday.

Rashid’s fiery speeches and protests within and outside the Assembly seemed to have attracted youth towards the polling booths in several areas.



“He is the only MLA who was beaten up within and outside the Assembly many times for speaking up for the people of Kashmir,” said Nazir Ahmad of Maratigam.



Rashid may not be able to win, but he seemed to have made his presence felt in almost 10 to 12 segments in the northern constituency.



From Uri to Karnah, Rashid seems to have upset calculations of the established mainstream political parties.



“We never expected that he would evoke such a response, where mostly youngsters voted for him today,” said a National Conference leader, who was a minister in the NC-Congress regime headed by Omar Abdullah.



After deciding to contest the elections on March 22, Rashid would frequently appear on social media to seek votes.



He was also able to attract impressive crowds during his rallies in different parts of north Kashmir. Rashid was also supported by IAS officer-turned-political Shah Faesal and chairman Democratic Party Nationalist, Ghulam Hassan Mir.

That night, he applied for a job with the FBI. “I was trying to pay off student loans and then go for a federal career but decided it couldn’t wait,” Kevin McAleenan told The Associated Press in 2017. Robert C. Bonner, the new head of what was then called the U.S. Customs Service, got to McAleenan before the FBI and asked him to move to Washington to help set up an anti-terrorism office. A series of promotions over the next 18 years at what is now called Customs and Border Protection culminated Sunday when President Donald Trump named McAleenan to serve as acting Homeland Security secretary, when Nielsen leaves office later this week. It is in some ways an unusual choice. Trump and his supporters have railed against both Obama administration policies and career government officials. But in picking McAleenan, Trump will have as his point person on politically charged border issues someone who served as a top Obama administration immigration official, in addition to serving under President George W. Bush. Yet McAleenan appears to have endeared himself to Trump, who tweeted Sunday: “I have confidence that Kevin will do a great job!” While avoiding fire-breathing ideological rhetoric and keeping a relatively low profile, McAleenan played a critical role executing some of Trump’s most controversial policies. As Customs and Border Protection commissioner, he helped put in practice a “zero tolerance” policy on illegal entries that caused thousands of children to be separated from their families at the border. He also oversaw the rapid spread of a practice to limit the number of asylum seekers who can enter the country at border crossings with Mexico, which he blames on processing constraints.

He has also shown strong interest in understanding why large numbers of Central American families are coming to the U.S., travelling to Guatemala’s western highlands last year on a fact-finding mission. He put renewed emphasis on providing medical attention to migrants after two Guatemalan children died in U.S. custody. But McAleenan angered many Democrats when he didn’t mention the death of one of those children, a girl, during congressional testimony last year. Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat and chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said he called for McAleenan’s resignation after the omission, which McAleenan said was an effort to avoid politicizing the little girl’s death. “He cannot be trusted as Acting DHS Secretary based on his record of prioritizing Trump’s harmful policies that undermine national security and the economy, and hurt vulnerable families and children at the border,” Castro said. “The Hispanic Caucus will continue to hold the Trump Administration accountable for its actions against immigrants and against the will of the American people.”

Still, McAleenan was confirmed as Customs and Border Protection commissioner on a 77-19 Senate vote last year and has won praise from former colleagues and politicians across the political spectrum for his sharp intellect. As commissioner, he oversaw 60,000 employees and managed an annual budget of more than $13 billion. “Kevin is a true patriot,” said Gil Kerlikowske, Customs and Border Protection commissioner from 2014 to 2017 and former police chief in Seattle and Buffalo, New York. “He’s incredibly smart, he’s got a great intellect, he’s very thoughtful, and he has a level of integrity and honesty that is very impressive. In my whole career, I can probably count on one hand the number of people that I’ve worked with that have reached Kevin’s level in all of those areas.” Jay Ahern, acting head of Customs and Border Protection in the administration of George W. Bush, said McAleenan is a quick study who can recall important data when he needs it. He praised McAleenan’s humility as border chief. “You want someone who has a certain amount of compassion for the people they encounter,” Ahern said. “You have to have that humanitarian side to be a leader for this.”

That may be at odds with the president’s hardline policies, Ahern said, but “Kevin has the ability to be very flexible and understanding of the political direction and can strike that right balance.” McAleenan says was influenced at University of Chicago Law School in the 1990s by a professor, Gidon Gottlieb, who warned that that the U.S. was ill-prepared for a terrorist attack. “He pounded the table and basically said we’re waiting for a Pearl Harbour-style terrorist attack,” McAleenan told the AP. “He was right, unfortunately.” After working on counterterrorism issues, he supervised Customs and Border Protection operations at Los Angeles International Airport from 2006 to 2008 — “the best job I’ll ever have,” he said in the 2017 interview. From there, he steadily climbed the ranks. White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said Monday that McAleenan is “extremely knowledgeable” and wants to work with Trump to put the president’s policies into effect. “There’s no daylight between the two of ‘em,” Gidley said on Fox News Channel. “We’re happy to work with him.” ___ Associated Press writers Colleen Long and Jill Colvin in Washington contributed to this report.",New Homeland Security chief has worked across party lines,Toronto Star,https://www.thestar.com/news/world/us/2019/04/08/new-homeland-security-chief-has-worked-across-party-lines.html
142,ScienceAndTechnology,2019-04-08T14:03:00.0000000Z,"Now, CSE says that it is ""highly likely"" that interference in Canada’s democratic process will be done using similar tools that have been implemented in other countries, such as amplifying polarizing political issues; promoting one party over another ...","OTTAWA – The 2019 federal election is ""very likely"" going to be the target of foreign cyber interference, with voters being the most likely targets of this anticipated meddling, a new report from Canada's electronic spy agency warns.

The report is also putting renewed spotlight on the risks of not having more robust cybersecurity and transparency requirements for social media platforms and political parties in place in advance of this year’s campaign, given these two areas are cited as being potential targets for foreign actors.

""An increasing number of foreign adversaries have the cyber tools, the organizational capacity and a sufficiently advanced understanding of Canada's political landscape to direct cyber interference during the 2019 federal election, should they have the strategic intent,"" the report states.

The report is an update to the 2017 Cyber Threats to Canada's Democratic Process report published by the Communication Security Establishment (CSE).

The 2017 report noted that Canada's electoral process would not be immune from potential interference by outside actors, and that federal candidates, parties, and voters are all at risk. The update notes that the likelihood of online election meddling has increased as the amount of cyber interference in other countries has increased over the last two years.

Now, CSE says that it is ""highly likely"" that interference in Canada’s democratic process will be done using similar tools that have been implemented in other countries, such as amplifying polarizing political issues, promoting one party over another or discouraging participating in the election altogether.

The document repeatedly cites Russia as an example of a foreign country that has been proven to be conducting this kind of cyber interference, including during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. Though a CSE official speaking to reporters on background said it is not anticipated that interference in the Canadian election will be on the same scale as what Americans experienced.

The intention of cyber interference is to compromise or gain access to information, or to use online means to ""covertly manipulate online information"" in order to influence voters' opinions and ultimately the outcome of the election.

CSE says that the short-term consequences of this foreign meddling include burying legitimate information and distracting voters from important election issues, while the more long-term impacts include weakening the public’s trust in the democratic process and creating divisions with international allies while promoting foreign economic or geopolitical interests.

CSE has identified four key trends from recent examples of foreign interference that could play out in Canada in the lead-up and during the upcoming election campaign:

Elections targeted by foreign threats are increasing worldwide, more than tripling in OECD countries since the last time Canada held a federal election in 2015;

Online foreign interference increasingly targets voters directly through creating and spreading misleading information on social media;

Politicians, their parties, and their staff are targets for more advanced cyber attacks such as obtaining private information for the purpose of blackmail, accessing campaign databases, or being discredited by AI-generated video that appears real, known as ""deep fakes""; and

The electoral system itself is not immune, though in Canada where paper ballots are still used it is not considered a likely or even possible avenue for meddling.

Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould and Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan held a news conference to discuss the report's findings, where both stated that ensuring the election remains secured against this threat is the government's top priority. The ministers pointed to the series of new measures unveiled earlier this year that are aimed at further shoring up Canada's electoral system from foreign interference and disinformation.

""Foreign cyber interference targeting voters has become the most common type of cyber threat activity against the democratic processes worldwide,"" Sajjan said, calling the report the ""next step"" in the government’s preparedness efforts. ""The more we talk about these threats, the better we are prepared to react.""

The initiatives the federal government unveiled in January include a new plan to inform Canadians about serious meddling attempts during the campaign, the creation of a multi-departmental task force aimed at preventing interference attempts, and launching a new campaign for citizen-literacy about misinformation online.

As well, the elections modernization Bill C-76 passed parliament in January, making broad changes to Canada's elections laws, including new limits on spending and foreign participation, while also aiming to boost accessibility and participation in democracy.

It implements new political party spending limits; adds new reporting measures for third parties conducting partisan work; and also proposes multiple changes aimed at eliminating foreign interference and spending, including prohibiting organizations selling advertising from knowingly accepting elections ads from foreign actors.

Canada already subject to meddling

Canada has already seen examples of foreign interference outside of the election period, the report notes. ""Since the 2015 federal election, Canadian political leaders and the Canadian public have been targeted by foreign cyber interference activities.""

Among the examples of how this has already played out in Canada:

A foreign adversary has ""manipulated social media using cyber tools to spread false or misleading information relating to Canada on Twitter"" and has used social media to amplify viewpoints that are critical of Canadian legislation;

There have been foreign state-sponsored media attacks on federal cabinet ministers.

While not referenced specifically in the report, an example of a minister who has been disparaged online by foreign entities is Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland, who faced questions in Canada about pro-Russian outlets ""sharing scurrilous stories"" -- as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau once put it—about her grandfather allegedly helping the Nazis during the Second World War.

Political databases 'attractive' target

CSE's report states that political parties remain “attractive targets” for attacks, as parties, candidates, and staff made up one tenth of the cyber attacks against democratic processes.

This casts back into the spotlight one area left out of Bill C-76: tougher privacy rules and oversight for political parties and the data that they harvest from the electorate.

While the legislation does require political parties to create and publish their privacy policies when it comes to the collection and protection of Canadians’ personal information, various privacy watchdogs and the New Democratic Party were pushing for more concrete measures.

""Foreign adversaries may steal voter or party databases because they fetch a price on illicit areas of the Internet, where large quantities of personal identity information are constantly bought and sold. They can steal sensitive campaign documents and communications and sell or release them,"" the report states.

As part of the existing plan, Canada's intelligence agencies have been, and will continue to advise political parties about enhancing their security and offering classified threat briefings to senior party leadership.

Defending the government’s decision to not implement more strict rules for political parties, Gould said she has asked a House of Commons committee to study the matter further, though it remains to be seen whether that study will occur and conclude in time for additional policies to be put in place before voters head to the polls.

""This is something I think can be achieved but I think requires more study,"" she said.

Gould not confident social media doing enough

In January the Liberals called on social media platforms to do more, restating their expectation that they will crack down on disinformation and enhance their transparency -- though there is no policy or legislation compelling co-operation.

Gould said conversations about the roles companies such as Facebook and Twitter play in the election have had ""varying degrees of success,"" and not as much progress as anticipated.

""I don't have the confidence that they are disclosing everything with us, and I think that from experiences that we've seen around the word, there's a lot left to be desired in terms of how seriously they’re taking these issues,"" Gould said.

The report notes that social media has become the predominate space where people access information, and as a result is often where these cyber interferers are looking to manipulate information.

""I'm not feeling great about where we are right now,"" Gould said, adding that she is still in ""active conversations"" about the potential of pursuing further regulations if these social networks don’t take more robust measures on their own.

NDP MP Nathan Cullen criticized the government’s response to the report and the ""total lack of regulations.""

""We're now just six months or so from the next election, the government failed; chose not to bring in tough new rules for their last election bill,"" Cullen said, adding that he thinks there may still be time to implore big social networks to work more collaboratively with government on this.

""There's a brawl breaking out in the public square and they should do something about it,"" Cullen said.

This would go further than what Bill C-76 has set out requirements for: the creation of a registry of all digital advertising published and paid for by third parties and political parties, as well as nominated and prospective candidates during the pre-writ and writ periods.

In response to this, Google has announced that it will instead be banning all political advertising during the election rather than trying to compile a registry, while Facebook is launching a library that will capture this information.

In a statement to CTVNews.ca, Colin McKay, head of government policy for Google Canada, said that Google is ""combating misinformation and working with the Canadian government to fight cyber threats."" McKay says there have been several meetings with key elections players including Elections Canada to discuss cybersecurity and misinformation.

""We have every intention of continuing our close work with government to protect Canada's democratic institutions and election activities,"" he said.",Foreign cyber interference in 2019 'very likely': new report,CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/foreign-cyber-interference-in-2019-very-likely-new-report-1.4370321
143,,2019-04-10T20:27:00.0000000Z,"Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders has a new and improved version of his Medicare for all plan ... There is no Republican plan for universal health coverage, and the party seems lost on the issue after trying and failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act ...","Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders has a new and improved version of his Medicare for all plan. His vision for government-run health care for every American now includes long-term care for seniors and the disabled, and a few other tweaks. The 2020 presidential candidate also proposes some general ways to pay for the costly plan, such as new taxes on the wealthy, big banks and some other businesses.

The bigger news, however, is that Medicare for All now has a lot of competition. With health care continuing to be a top voter concern, Congressional Democrats have rolled out a range of proposals for making care cheaper and easier to obtain, without the huge tax hikes and massive disruption – and voter heartburn – Medicare for all would entail.

Sanders’ MFA plan—supported by at least 7 other presidential candidates—would eliminate the private insurance system through which 175 million Americans get coverage. Employers would no longer provide insurance for their workers, with everybody moving into the government plan. A surge of newly covered patients could stress the system and create long waits for some care. Doctors would get paid less, which might draw some would-be caregivers into other fields. Nobody knows if patients would be able to keep their doctors or be forced to see whoever’s available.

A Sanders-style plan would boost federal health care spending from $1.1 trillion per year to 3.5 trillion per year, according to a new analysis from Rand. That would require big tax hikes. But employers and individuals would no longer pay for health care, and it’s possible the nation might get more bang for the buck from a single national program with enhanced purchasing power. Still, the transition to a national program would produce many losers—starting with millions of insurance-company workers and others who’d lose their jobs—which makes the idea politically explosive and probably untenable.

More options

But there’s also a bill called the Medicare X plan that would establish a new federal plan for people who can’t find affordable private-sector coverage, while leaving the employer-sponsored market alone. Enrollees would pay premiums covering most of the cost, with no need for major tax hikes. The Choose Medicare Act would create a new program called Medicare Part E for anybody who doesn’t currently qualify for a federal program, which would also leave the private system in place and require enrollees in the new program to pay premiums. Another plan would let states offer Medicaid to anybody, with enrollees above certain income threshold paying premiums.

The Commonwealth Fund, which tracks health care legislation, counts at least 11 Congressional proposals for moving toward universal coverage that includes everybody. Only four of those call for a huge single-payer system. And one of those, unlike the Sanders plan, would require enrollees to pay premiums or co-pays, to help cover the cost.

The other seven plans would leave most or all of the current system in place, while seeking to expand coverage or lower costs through more government options. That approach seems more politically feasible, since in general it wouldn’t require people who like their current coverage—whether public or private—to give it up.

All of these proposals come from Democrats. There is no Republican plan for universal health coverage, and the party seems lost on the issue after trying and failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017, when Republicans controlled both branches of Congress and the White House. The Trump administration is still trying to kill the ACA, by joining a lawsuit claiming the ACA is invalid now that Congress has lowered the penalty for failing to get insurance to $0. Legal experts say the suit will probably fail. But if it doesn’t, the Trump administration has no backup plan and popular provisions of the ACA, such as a ban on insurance exclusions for pre-existing conditions, will disappear.

The time wasn’t right for another big health-care reform effort in 2016. The ACA was still highly controversial and voters, in electing Trump, decided to give a private-sector businessman a shot at something other than government solutions. Trump has done nothing on health care, and an improving economy hasn’t solved the health care affordability problems. So health care will be on the ballot in 2020. And Medicare for all may not end up the front-runner.",What’s really new about 'Medicare for all',Finance Yahoo,https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-really-new-about-medicare-for-all-202152067.html

To this end ... from which our populace must draw inspiration. We expect a new crop of dynamic and robust leadership which will serve ...","FORMER Nyanga North MP and MDC secretary general Douglas Mwonzora has finally emerged from his closet and declared his readiness to wrestle current party president Nelson Chamisa for the country’s biggest opposition job.

In a statement this week, Mwonzora literally pleaded with party structures to give him a chance to “take the MDC to the next level.”

“Our congress must not only be about elections but must also be a festival of ideas. This congress must be an occasion to reflect on our strengths and weaknesses, culminating in the adoption of far reaching resolutions that must position the MDC for a resounding victory come 2023.

“Together we must ensure the MDC remains a robust, vibrant and modern institution ready to take Zimbabwe forward,” Mwonzora said.

Amid reports of violence, intimidation and coercion in the run-up to the congress, Mwonzora said the MDC needed to rise above “archaic political practices”.

“The ongoing violence and intimidation of members from exercising their democratic right to choose is a serious affront to the very tenets and democratic principles on which the MDC was founded. These are acts of cowardice by people afraid of contestation.

“A recent development where some elements within the party have sought to mudsling and tarnish others so as to discredit their candidature is regrettable.

“As a party, we have gone through very difficult and turbulent times in the past five years; having lost our iconic leader, Dr Richard Morgan Tsvangirai, and suffered a stolen victory in 2018, we must therefore come out of this congress with a renewed, reinvigorated and focused institution. This must reflect in the resolutions that we adopt at the congress. Our resolutions must reflect a 21st century party, pliable to the ever changing global circumstances,” the Manicaland senator said.

“As the secretary general, I strongly believe in a united, democratic, tolerant and above all a disciplined party. To this end, there must be robust, non-violent contestation in which people must shake hands afterwards and allow the party to move forward with renewed impetus,” said Mwonzora, who has thus far only been nominated to remain the opposition party’s chief administrator.

His rival, Chamisa, has thus far been nominated by three provinces for his first full mandate as party leader following the death of Tsvangirai last year.

At the 2014 congress, the constitutional lawyer defeated Chamisa despite having received only one nomination for the position of secretary general, against his rival who was seemingly unstoppable with over 10 nominations.

Mwonzora, in the statement, said the crop of leaders to emerge must inspire Zimbabweans ahead of the next elections.

“The caliber of our leadership from this congress must be a beacon from which our populace must draw inspiration. We expect a new crop of dynamic and robust leadership which will serve the people of this country diligently with respect and take Zimbabwe back into the community of progressive nations.

“It is therefore important that all of the leaders be democratically elected to reflect the true aspirations of the people,” he said.

Mwonzora added that the MDC needed to consider reserving certain positions for women and youths as well as make sure all regions of the country are adequately represented at the higher echelons of the party’s leadership.

While reports said Mwonzora was part of a group of leaders who pushed for constitutional changes to have the party president given ‘imperial powers’, the MDC secretary general suggested there was need to reverse this.

“For us to truly reflect a democratic outfit, It is imperative that the 5th Congress does not centralise a lot of power in the president. To this end, the electoral processes around this congress must reflect that true democracy is indeed alive in the party,” said Mwonzora.

In the report prepared primarily for US lawmakers, the independent (CRS) on the ongoing elections said that ""has become the primary, if not sole target of the opposition"", but no individual challenger has emerged.

The CRS reports warns that a continuation of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led administration could entail an ""unwelcome continuation of its perceived illiberal policies"".

""A repeat performance could thus herald a new era of single-party dominance. Perhaps more crucially, the election pits an unabashedly Hindu nationalist and ruling party against an array of more secular minded parties, some focused on the interests of India's large lower-caste and Muslim minorities,"" said the CRS report.

The CRS is the bipartisan and independent research wing of the US which prepares reports on various domestic and global issues for the lawmakers for information purposes only. The reports, prepared by subject experts, are not considered an official view of the US

While Rahul Gandhi, ""the inheritor of a family dynasty that includes three past prime ministers, has the highest profile among potential leaders of an opposition coalition, the CRS report says the opposition's zeal to oust the NDA has led to some unusual alliances



""In January, the leaders of two powerful Uttar Pradesh-based parties agreed to set aside their bitter rivalry to cooperate in defeating the BJP. Other influential regional parties are maneuvering toward a potential opposition grand alliance,"" said the report dated March 28.

Modi and his BJP aspire to win another five-year term with a ruling majority. The Congress party historically dominant, but badly defeated in 2014seeks to build on recent state-level wins and potentially ally with powerful regional opposition parties to dislodge the BJP-led in New Delhi, according to the report accessed by PTI.

""Many observers see the upcoming election as an inflection point in Indian history. BJP's 2014 win, with 52 per cent of Lok Sabha seats, marked an end to 30 years of coalition politics at the national level,"" it said.

""Coalition governments are sometimes faulted for instability, but they may also compel leaders to negotiate and take account of a wider variety of perspectives, while secure majority governments can lead to complacency and arrogance,"" the CRS said.

Noting that secularism has been a more-or-less enshrined value in India, although its conception in both theory and practice varies widely, the Congressional report says Indian voters may face a landmark choice between two overarching identities for their country -- one, a pluralist, secular polity where religious minorities enjoy full equality; the other, a nation in which roughly 250 million non-Hindu citizens must accept Hindu majoritarianism, with potentially dire consequences for for India's civil liberties.

Authored by CRS's South K Alan Kronstadt, the report observes that given weak economic performance, the BJP-led government arguably is seeking to generate voter enthusiasm through Hindu identity.

The February Pulwama terrorist attack and Balakot air strikes by is likely to benefit the ruling party, the report said.

""The February 2019 bombing in Kashmir, blamed on a Pakistan-based terrorist group, and an unprecedented retaliatory airstrike on Pakistani territory, pushed foreign affairs into the headlines and triggered a sharp spike of Indian nationalism that is widely expected to benefit the incumbent BJP,"" it said.

As far as India-US relationship is concerned, it is unlikely to have any impact irrespective of any government that comes to power after the May general elections, it said.

The trend toward closer bilateral ties most likely will continue regardless of a leadership change in New Delhi, it said.

The Green New Deal could end up being a key issue for the Democratic Party going into the 2020 presidential election, with many of the candidates having already voiced support for the idea.","Rep. Scott Peters, D-San Diego, released Wednesday what he’s calling a “climate playbook” — a list of more than 50 pieces of legislation introduced by Democrats as well as Republicans since 2017.

The congressman said revisiting bipartisan ideas to rein in climate change is a better use of time than focusing on the Green New Deal, a wide-ranging resolution aimed at wiping out greenhouse emissions by 2030 and creating new jobs.

“The Green New Deal was aspirational and general,” Peters said. “That was its strength, but its weakness was that it was undefined, so our political opponents were defining it.

“This (climate playbook) is something that people who don’t want to sign on to all the language in that resolution can use to say, ‘This is what I mean by climate action,’” he added.

Peters said lawmakers shouldn’t have to start from scratch to take action on global warming.

“I think this is a really constructive way to harness energy and see if we can’t make real change,” he said, adding, “I’m very skeptical of congressional utopian plans. They never happen.”

Peters has made his case on the website medium.com/@Rep.ScottPeters, where he provides links to dozens of pieces of legislation.

The proposals include everything from putting a price on carbon emissions to requiring that new car fleets include zero-emission vehicles.

In recent months, Peters has taken heat from local environmental groups for not supporting the Green New Deal, and his playbook didn’t seem to immediately win back support from those activists.

“This is not the response we wanted from Congressman Peters,” said Masada Disenhouse, co-founder of SanDiego350. “What we’re looking for is a bold comprehensive vision that addresses climate change at the scale of the crisis, and this is not that.

“If he’s expecting change to come from the places where it hasn’t even worked in the past, I think it’s unrealistic,” she added.

SanDiego350 and the Sunrise Movement have also criticized local Rep. Susan Davis, D-San Diego, holding a sit-in at her office in San Diego last month to demand support for the resolution. Rep. Mike Levin and Juan Vargas, both representing parts of the San Diego region, have backed the idea publicly.

The Green New Deal has also proved divisive for other Democrats, with some vowing support and others distancing themselves from the proposal, such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco.

Republicans, led by President Trump, have seized on that tension, labeling the proposal as a “socialist” ban on cows, cars and planes. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. R-Ky., put the resolution up for a vote last month, but all 43 Democrats voted present in protest.

At the same time, climate groups across the country have held up the resolution as a major test for lawmakers wishing to brandish progressive credentials. It was spearheaded by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.

The Green New Deal could end up being a key issue for the Democratic Party going into the 2020 presidential election, with many of the candidates having already voiced support for the idea.

However, hammering out the details could prove complicated, including whether to embrace nuclear power and how to address union workers in the fossil fuel industry.

Despite opposition from legislative leadership and new Republican Gov. Bill Lee, members of the minority party filed several bills that would have allowed Lee to negotiate Medicaid expansion with the federal government.

A House subcommittee killed one proposal, from Rep. Gloria Johnson (D-Knoxville), on Wednesday. She called her plan the “Mike Pence Medicaid Act of 2019,” in reference to the expansion of Medicaid under then-Indiana Gov. Pence. Republicans were not amused.

“If we want to score political points, there’s a press conference room down the hall that everyone can use,” said Rep. Matthew Hill (R-Jonesborough), chairman of the House TennCare Subcommittee.

Hill also pressed Johnson on her request that the committee “be like Mike.” Indiana’s expansion, Hill said, featured copays, work requirements and monthly fees, but Johnson did not support those provisions in a potential expansion.

Rep. Mike Stewart (D-Nashville) withdrew his similar expansion proposal this week in order to back Johnson’s. Rep. Jason Hodges (D-Clarksville) pushed his expansion bill off until next year, and Stewart said the caucus would prepare to get behind that proposal moving forward.

“We’re going to have to keep pushing this issue until economic realities make it impossible for Republicans in the legislature to continue to block this sensible policy,” Stewart said. “It’s a matter of time.”

Stewart also suggested that, were Lee to back an expansion proposal, it could easily pass.

Former Republican Gov. Bill Haslam hoped to expand Medicaid, like Pence, in the state following the passage of the Affordable Care Act. But he came up against opposition from his fellow Republicans in the legislature.

Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel (L), Cuban Communist Party leader Raul Castro (C) and National Assembly President Esteban Lazo react during the enactment of the new constitution, in Havana, Cuba April 10, 2019. Irene Perez/Courtesy Cubadebate/Handout via REUTERS

In a speech to the national assembly, meeting to enact the new constitution, Castro said Cuba had been upping defense preparedness in recent months in view of increased U.S. hostility.

The island nation had also been adopting economic measures to contend with the Trump administration’s tightening of the decades-old U.S. trade embargo, Castro told legislators.

“We will never abandon our duty of acting in solidarity with Venezuela,” Castro said. “We reject strongly all types of blackmail.”

U.S. Vice President Mike Pence told the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday the United States would announce additional action to hold Cuba accountable for its support of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has accused Cuban security and intelligence officials of propping up Maduro’s government. Cuba denies those claims.

“Cuba is being blamed for all evils, using lies and the worst kind of Hitlerian propaganda,” Castro said. “We have told the U.S. administration Cuba is not afraid and will continue building the future of the nation without outside interference.”

The enactment of the new constitution allows Cuba’s government to launch a modest revamp of its centrally planned single party system with dozens of laws expected on everything from the justice system to political structures.

Many observers are hopeful the government will open Cuba’s still inefficient state-run economy further to free enterprise with a law recognizing private businesses, not just self-employment, although they do not expect that to be among the first pieces of legislation it tackles.

That could give a boost to an economy which has had to contend with declining aid from Venezuela and a resulting cash crunch over the past three years, prompting the government to introduce austerity measures.

Shortages of basic goods have increased recently, including flour, eggs and chicken, with the state even reducing the size and circulation of its newspapers due to a lack of newsprint.

The situation could worsen further in coming months in view of the tightening U.S. trade embargo, Castro warned.

That did not mean a return to the kind of deep crisis Cuba experienced following the 1991 collapse of its former benefactor the Soviet Union, however, as its economy had diversified since then, he said.

SLEW OF NEW LAWS

Cubans overwhelmingly ratified the new constitution in a February referendum after a year of debate, updating its 1976 Soviet-era Magna Carta.

While it retains socialism as “irrevocable,” it codifies changes in Cuban society since 1991, like the opening of the economy to free enterprise, and includes a political restructuring among other changes.

Analysts say the constitution gives some leeway as to how reformist the around 50 laws needed to bring the legal system in line with it should be.

“The formation of a more open and democratic country depends on this process and not on the constitution,” said Cuban lawyer and legal columnist for independent media Eloy Viera Cañive.

The constitution stipulates that the national assembly must approve a new electoral law to reflect the restructuring of government within six months.

Within the following three months, it must elect a president, widely expected to remain Miguel Diaz-Canel, who succeeded Castro last April. That president must then appoint provincial governors and a prime minister - a new post separating the role of head of state from head of government.

The Magna Carta stipulates that within 18 months, new laws reflecting constitutional changes to the judicial system such as the presumption of innocence in criminal cases and habeas corpus should also be introduced.

In a full-page advertisement in Reforma, the Democratic Revolution Party (PRD) said that López Obrador was undoing reforms implemented over the past 30 years that were designed to keep the power of the state in check.

“We’re in the process of restoring a presidential, centralizing and authoritarian system that weakens and suppresses the legislative branch and undermines the independence of the judiciary,” the PRD said.

“We are not exaggerating. This regression to authoritarianism is being revealed in many areas,” the advertisement read, and went on to cite eight.

Among them: striking a blow against federalism through the creation of powerful state delegates, the continued militarization of security, attacks against autonomous government agencies and a lack of transparency.

Today, the PRD’s Michoacán director explained that the party was issuing a call to “progressive forces” to create a united anti-AMLO front.

Antonio Soto Sánchez said López Obrador “has not delivered. It looks like he is still campaigning for election, so the PRD has decided to call on progressive forces to unite to form a progressive opposition force and act as a counterweight to the federal government . . .”

López Obrador held power as mayor of Mexico City for the PRD between 2000 and 2005 and subsequently stood as the party’s candidate at the 2006 and 2012 presidential elections.

However, after finishing as runner-up for the second consecutive time in 2012, he split from the party to form the National Regeneration Movement, or Morena party, taking thousands of PRD supporters and members with him.

The fortunes of the PRD have since dwindled and it fared poorly at last year’s elections.

The president has enjoyed strong public support since taking office in December, attracting a 78% approval rating in a poll published by the newspaper El Financiero last month.

López Obrador has held daily press conferences at the National Palace during which he aims to set the day’s political agenda and often criticizes his political, civil society and media opponents.

Grupo Reforma, which published yesterday’s ad, has often been described as “prensa fifi” (snobbish press) by the leftist leader.

The president has frequently taken aim at past presidents who held power during the so-called “neoliberal period,” accusing them of corruption and causing all manner of other problems faced by the country, including the poor financial position of the state oil company and high levels of violence.

López Obrador claims that he is democratizing freedom with his daily news conferences – his predecessor Enrique Peña Nieto rarely fronted the media – and denies that he is aiming to install an authoritarian government.

“We respect freedoms and the right to dissent,” the president said on March 8, a mantra he often repeats.

Nevertheless, government opponents – and some analysts – continue to contend that López Obrador is concentrating power in the federal executive.

The president has described autonomous government agencies as “a great farce” and accused them of corruption, and in the case of the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE), López Obrador hand-picked four new commissioners.

Energy sector experts warned that the appointments will result in a loss of autonomy for the CRE.

In an opinion piece published by Bloomberg last month, a Latin American expert contended that López Obrador “is systematically concentrating power in an already strong executive.”

Shannon K. O’Neil wrote that from the beginning of his administration the president “has undermined democratic norms and checks and balances,” often choosing “to work outside the formal legislative process,” even though the coalition led by his Morena party has a majority in both houses of Congress.

Later in March, opposition lawmakers accused the president of seeking to extend his rule by pledging to hold a revocation of mandate vote halfway through his six-year term. López Obrador subsequently signed a written undertaking that he will not seek re-election in 2024.

Now, opposition lawmakers argue that a Morena-backed legislative proposal to create an anti-corruption chamber in the Supreme Court (SCJN) and increase the number of justices from 11 to 16 is a ploy to enable López Obrador and his government to control the court.

The president distanced himself from the proposal.

New Delhi: India has reasons to cheer with Maldives President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih’s party appearing to have secured a landslide victory in the parliamentary elections held Saturday.

The election results are yet to be announced officially. The Elections Commission of Maldives said on Monday the results will be announced on 12 April while the swearing-in ceremony will take place on 28 May.

“I haven’t forgotten the hard work by our coalition partners to bring the country back from the brink of President Yameen’s disastrous rule. I will continue to work with the leaders of all our coalition partners to ensure we deliver on our pledges to the people,” Solih, who came to power in September last year, said Sunday as initial results started coming in.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi Monday called Solih and congratulated him on his victory, said an official statement from the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA). Modi said Maldives will be a priority in India’s ‘neighbourhood-first’ policy, the statement added.

The election results come as a relief to India, which had been closely watching the developments in the island nation, as it marks Maldives’ return to ‘India first’ policy while arresting its tilt towards China, official sources told ThePrint.

Yameen’s ‘dictatorial’ rule

Maldives has traditionally been an ally of India and its strategic advantage has remained one of New Delhi’s crucial foreign policy priorities. However, under the rule of previous president Abdulla Yameen, who was perceived as pro-China, Maldives began to rapidly drift away from New Delhi towards Beijing.

Presidential elections held in September last year overthrew Yameen and brought in Solih. The parliamentary elections were necessitated as several allies of Solih’s Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) had sided with the opposition.

Yameen, who was jailed on charges of corruption and embezzlement, was released days before the parliamentary elections.

With China’s support, Yameen was accused of ruling Maldives in an autocratic manner. He had jailed his predecessor Mohamed Nasheed on charges of terrorism. He had also put behind bars many of his political rivals and removed dissenting voices from institutions such as the Supreme Court, besides denying the voters their basic rights. In fact, speculation was also rife that China might build a military base in Maldives.

All these had forced India to contemplate military intervention in Maldives as it seemed the island nation may declare an emergency.

‘Maldives will have to balance it out with China’

Official sources said while India will remain important for Maldives, the island nation cannot look away from China.

China had invested heavily in infrastructure projects in Maldives such as China-Maldives Friendship Bridge and mass housing projects on reclaimed lands, which many say, have put the island nation into a debt trap. Under Yameen’s government, India had lost to China a $511-million project to develop and expand the Male airport.

Last month, during the visit of India’s External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj to Maldives, both sides had agreed to maintain peace and security in the Indian Ocean region while enhancing regional maritime security. Maldives had also stated it would “remain sensitive towards India’s security and strategic concerns” while promising to kick-start some of the Indian projects that got stalled under Yameen’s regime.

Last year during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Maldives, India had offered a grant of $1.4 billion to Maldives in the form of budgetary support, currency swap and concessional lines of credit to repay its debt to China that was incurred during Yameen’s era.

“While the outcome of parliamentary elections has come in line with the September’s presidential elections, there are two things that need to be kept in mind. Firstly, India should not overestimate Maldives’ tilt towards New Delhi. They will have to balance it out with China,” said former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia.

Bhatia, who is now a Distinguished Fellow of Mumbai-based foreign policy think tank Gateway House, also said Maldives would continue to remain a priority for India in the Indian Ocean region irrespective of which political party comes to power after the Lok Sabha elections.

April 15 not only is Tax Day, when income tax returns are due, but also marks the 10th anniversary of a series of protests against high taxes and an economic stimulus package pushed by the fledgling Obama administration.

This year’s rallies are planned under the name “Stop Socialism, Choose Freedom” and are supported by the group Tea Party Patriots.

The taxpayer rallies in 2009 were born of resistance to the Temporary Assistance Relief Program, a government bailout of financial institutions passed by a Democrat-controlled Congress in 2008. Signed into law by President George W. Bush, a Republican, it was designed to counter the Great Recession that began in December 2007.



Ever since, the tea party movement has stood for economic and personal freedom and a debt-free future, Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder and national coordinator of Tea Party Patriots, told The Daily SIgnal.



“In 2009, we saw Obamacare move through Congress, watched as our government took over health care and moved toward a more socialized health care system,” Martin said.



In the 2010 midterm elections, voters chose a historic number of Republican candidates—including so-called tea party conservatives in favor of lower taxes and limited government—for Congress, governorships, and state legislatures.



“What we’re seeing right now from many liberals in Congress is a call for socialized, single-payer health care,” Martin said.



Martin also singled out the Green New Deal proposed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass.



Their proposal, embraced by many Democrats, “would remove economic freedom, increase our debt, and infringe on personal freedom,” she said, decrying what she called “more and more calls for socialist programs and championing of democratic socialism.”



In conjunction with the 10th anniversary of the first Tax Day Tea Party, Martin said the “Stop Socialism, Choose Freedom” rallies will focus on the difference between socialism’s past in America and the path of freedom.



With over 300 rallies planned, the goal of Tea Party Patriots is to reach 500 rallies nationwide.



“So far, we’ve had nearly 400 people who have signed up to host rallies,” Martin said. “Now, dozens of these people have never hosted a rally before, so we are helping them get started and get organized, and we still have to get all those details nailed down to actually pull off all the rallies.”



Martin said some rallies will be formal, with speakers lined up, and others will be simpler, smaller, sign-waving events held by friends who want to show their communities that they choose freedom for America.



“I expect a decent-sized crowd like in Gilbert, Arizona, outside of Phoenix; [in] Sugar Land, Texas, outside of Houston; and in Atlanta, Georgia,” Martin said. “In 2009, the largest rally that we had on Tax Day was in Atlanta, where the crowd size exceeded 20,000 people.”



The Tea Party Patriots leader said those interested in holding or attending a rally can find information and resources at the group’s website.

CAIRO – 11 April 2019: Turkey’s main pro-Kurdish party on Thursday hit out at electoral authorities for blocking some of its successful candidates from taking office after a March 31 local vote.The Supreme Electoral Council (YSK) on Wednesday ordered that individuals sacked by an emergency decree during purges after a 2016 failed coup could not take up their posts despite being elected, DHA news agency reported.The candidate who came second would be able to serve in the post instead, DHA said.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has often accused the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) of ties with PKK Kurdish militants, a charge the party denies.The HDP said the YSK decision affects many candidates who had already been authorized to stand in the ballot by the same electoral council.“This step taken by the YSK is part of a deliberate political conspiracy, nothing else” by the ruling AKP and its coalition nationalist MHP partner, HDP spokesman Saruhan Oluc told reporters in Ankara.The HDP cannot challenge the YSK’s move or even take the council to court, Oluc said, but urged the YSK to reverse the decision.“Show respect to the people’s will,” he said.Erdogan said irregularities in Istanbul’s local elections, such as the appointment of ballot box officials, should lead to the annulment of the vote, the pro-government Sabah newspaper reported on Wednesday.Initial results show the main opposition Republican People’s Party narrowly won control of Turkey’s biggest city in the mayoral elections, seemingly bringing an end to the 25-year rule there by Erdogan’s AK Party and its Islamist predecessors.Speaking to reporters on his plane, returning from a trip to Moscow this week, Erdogan said that regulations requiring that ballot box officials be civil servants had not been met everywhere, with regular workers placed in charge in some places.“Our colleagues have established this. Naturally, all this casts doubt. If they take a sincere view, this will lead to annulment,” he said.Any decision to annul the elections would rest with the High Election Board.A senior AKP official said on Tuesday it would demand a new vote in Istanbul after its bid was rejected for a citywide recount of the March 31 election results after a series of recounts since the vote.Erdogan said on Monday the local elections were marred by “organized crime” at ballot boxes in Istanbul.

AMETHI, India (AP) — Congress party chief Rahul Gandhi, the scion of India’s most famous modern political dynasty, filed nomination papers in the family stronghold of Amethi in Uttar Pradesh state, hoping to hold onto a key seat for a fourth consecutive time in national elections that begin Thursday.

Gandhi was flanked by his mother, Sonia Gandhi, the widow of assassinated Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who is running as a Congress candidate from Rae Bareli, another city in Uttar Pradesh. He was also joined by his sister, Priyanka Gandhi, the Congress party manager of the eastern half of Uttar Pradesh, and her husband, businessman Robert Vadra.

Thousands of party workers accompanied the Gandhis in a massive road show Wednesday, carrying flags with the Congress’ party symbol — an outstretched hand — and dancing to drum beats. Others stood on balconies or climbed onto vehicles for a better view or to toss flower petals.

“Treat it just as a victory procession,” said Congress worker Rajesh Prajapati.

But while Gandhi will likely prevail in Amethi — which he has represented since 2004, and which was previously represented by Sonia Gandhi — the victory of his party in Uttar Pradesh is far from assured.

India’s most populous state is ruled by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The BJP trounced Congress in Uttar Pradesh in 2014, winning 71 of the 80 seats in the Lok Sabha, India’s lower house of Parliament, that were contested.

On the campaign trail, Modi has blasted the alleged corruption within the Congress party, which began with Rahul Gandhi’s great-grandfather and India’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.

Nehru, his daughter Indira Gandhi and her son Rajiv Gandhi ruled the country for about a half a century after India won independence from Britain in 1947.

Modi and his followers have painted him as a “chowkidar,” or “watchman” who has taken a hard stance against the corruption of previous governments.

“Narendra Modi can abuse my mother, father, grandmother and grandfather if he wishes so. But he should debate with me for 15 minutes on the issue of corruption,” Gandhi told reporters Wednesday.

Amethi is a small, impoverished district of about 1.3 million people, according to the last census, 120 kilometers (75 miles) southeast of Lucknow, the state capital. Over decades of Congress rule, the local government had helped create new industries and factories, but many of these closed after promised government subsidies failed to materialize.

The BJP has taken the district’s economic straits as an opening.

The Modi government’s Textile Minister Smriti Irani ran for the Amethi constituency in 2014. Even after losing to Rahul Gandhi, she has nurtured the constituency in the last five years, visiting the area frequently and appropriating government funds for roads, water and electricity projects.

Irani’s growing presence in Amethi has given BJP workers hope that she can beat Gandhi this time. The BJP has even coined a slogan: “Ab ki baar Amethi hamaar,” which translates to “This time, Amethi is ours.”

As the Gandhis’ slow-moving convoy approached the government office where Rahul Gandhi’s nomination was filed, people jostled for a sighting, to the annoyance of Narain Dubey, a resident having tea at a roadside shop.

“Why is this commotion and what for? He is MP for last 15 years from this constituency. What has he done for Amethi and you are climbing on one another to have a glimpse of him,” he said.

Dubey’s remarks were met with anger. One young person turned to him and shouted: “Chowkidar chor hai,” meaning “watchman is a thief,” Rahul Gandhi’s oft-repeated line referring to an ongoing investigation into the Modi-led government’s purchase of military aircraft.

Gandhi earlier this month also announced he was running for a seat in Kerala state in southern India, offending some supporters in Amethi.

“Rahul Gandhi’s decision to contest from Wayanad is an insult to Amethi because this gives an impression that Gandhi family is looking for a second option,” resident Surendra Tiwari said, adding that he wasn’t sure whether to vote for him again.

India’s elections, the world’s largest democratic exercise, will take place on seven days over a six-week period. Vote counting is scheduled for May 23.

Erdogan’s reluctance to acknowledge defeat in the city of 16 million, where much of Turkey's wealth is generated, twinned with blatant discrimination against victorious Kurdish mayors have put the country on a knife’s edge with unpredictable consequences for its future.

His ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has demanded a recount of ballots in all of Istanbul, claiming fraud with little evidence. Erdogan has gone as far as to accuse the opposition of “organized crime.” The Supreme Electoral Council (YSK), the committee of judges that notionally has the final say, rejected the demand, allowing a recount in just eight districts. But it acquiesced to the AKP’s other demand — to recount spoiled ballots — which failed to reverse the outcome. The lead of the main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) narrowed to around 14,000 votes at the last count. The YSK is set to deliver provisional results of the elections on April 13.

But before then, it faces a critical decision: whether to agree to the AKP’s demand for a rerun in the municipality of Buyukcekmece on the European side of the city. The body was expected to deliver its verdict today but then postponed at the last minute.

In an ominous sign, police have been raiding dozens of homes in the district, part of a hunt for more than 20,000 voters the AKP claims the main opposition CHP falsely registered or unlawfully removed from the lists so as to tip the outcome in favor of its own candidate, Hasan Akgun. It was his sixth straight win in Buyukcekmece since he was first elected in 1994.

Should the YSK uphold the AKP’s figures, it would likely trigger a rerun for all of Istanbul, as the number of fake or deregistered voters would then exceed the 14,000 votes with which Ekrem Imamoglu, the CHP’s mayoral candidate for Istanbul, secured his victory.

The CHP has brushed aside the AKP’s claims, saying it had challenged the voter rolls in Buyukcekmece prior to the elections and that 741 names had been removed as a result. “On Jan. 31, registered voter lists were finalized. If the AKP had objections, why did it not raise them then?” asked CHP spokesman Faik Oztrak.

Buyukcekmece’s incumbent mayor has meanwhile accused police of attempting fraud on the AKP’s behalf. Akgun told a news conference that police had set about manufacturing a list of fake voters to prove its case against the CHP and had included the name of a 10-year-old boy. The child in question grinned sheepishly as he faced the cameras at Akgun’s side.

Should the YSK order a fresh ballot in Istanbul, “the AKP’s last shred of legitimacy, which rests on marginally free if utterly unfair elections, will crumble,” CHP lawmaker Sezgin Tanrikulu told Al-Monitor. He declined to comment on the CHP's next move.

CHP members are under strict orders not to comment on the possibility, even among themselves, according to a party insider who spoke to Al-Monitor on condition that he not be identified. The same source speculated that if the YSK does order a rerun in Istanbul, the CHP may consider boycotting the elections because “they would clearly be rigged in the AKP’s favor.”

The People’s Democratic Party (HDP), the largest pro-Kurdish bloc in the parliament that has faced systematic repression with 95 HDP affiliated mayors booted out since 2016 and dozens of them jailed on thinly supported terror charges, would have good cause to follow suit. The party’s demands for a recount in several towns and districts, including Malazgirt in the east, where the HDP candidate lost by three votes, have been spurned. And on April 10, the YSK announced that any victorious candidates who had been sacked under the emergency law imposed in the wake of the failed 2016 coup would not be permitted to take up their posts. HDP lawmaker Meral Danis Bestas confirmed that six HDP candidates had been affected by the decision thus far. In Baglar, a district of Diyarbakir, the Kurds’ unofficial capital in the Kurdish-dominated southeast, the HDP swept over 70% of the vote but will be unable to serve. The first runner-up, an AKP man who trailed with 25%, will do so instead.

“This is a total breach of law and justice,” Bestas told Al-Monitor.

Wolfgang Piccoli, co-director of Teneo Intelligence, a London-based consultancy that closely monitors Turkey, predicted in a research note today that a re-run in Istanbul is “a distinct possibility.” Piccoli pointed to the YSK’s decision to order a rerun at the CHP’s request in the Black Sea town of Yusufeli, where the AKP won by just a handful of votes. “The YSK’s decision in Yusufeli could be aimed at forestalling accusations that it is bowing to pressure from the AKP if it also now agrees to to a rerun in Istanbul.”

Behlul Ozkan, an associate professor of international relations at Istanbul’s Marmara University, takes the opposite view. “If Erdogan had his heart set on a re-run he would be using far harsher rhetoric. We know what he sounds like when he's made up his mind to go for something. And retaining the legitimacy of the ballot box is critical to his claim that he always emerges victorious from them, which he has so far,” Ozkan told Al-Monitor. Although the AKP lost most of the big cities this time around, it won the overall vote in alliance with the far-right nationalists with 52%. More likely, Ozkan observed, ""Erdogan is allowing time for the party’s propaganda machine to discredit the outcome through claims of fraud so as to make the loss of Istanbul more digestible to his base.”

The most critical question is, of course, how would the AKP expect to prevail in a rerun with even its own base displaying unease over its refusal to accept the March 31 results?

Cynics would say by tampering with votes. But Erdogan could also reach out to the HDP. By not fielding candidates in most of the cities outside the its southeastern stronghold and by ordering its supporters to vote for the CHP, the HDP helped swing the outcome decisively against the AKP, especially in Istanbul, where ethnic Kurds are thought to account for 11% of the vote. The HDP has been exhorting Erdogan to resume peace talks with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and its imprisoned leader Abdullah Ocalan that collapsed in 2015 amid mutual recriminations. The government has since escalated the military campaign against the PKK, and the militants holed up in the mountains wedged between Iraq, Iran and Turkey are feeling the heat.

The treatment being meted out to the HDP candidates in the southeast suggests, however, that Erdogan has no intention of rekindling negotiations with the PKK and that his pact with far-right nationalist leader Devlet Bahceli remains intact.",Police raid homes in Istanbul as AKP demands new vote,Al-Monitor,https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/04/turkey-election-meme.html

Two seats in the violence-hit Jammu and Kashmir, Jammu and Baramulla, are voting on Thursday amid a boycott call by separatists and tight security to offset protests sweeping the Valley against an order to restrict civilian movement on highways two days a week.

In the sensitive Baramulla seat, three-tier security is in place with 400 additional companies [a unit typically comprising between 80 and 150 personnel] of forces deployed for security of the polling stations, voters and staff. Officials said around 30,000 additional forces have been deployed.

The Lok Sabha elections are being held with a raft of new measures, such as Voter Verified Paper Audit Trails in all voting machines (which corresponded to 1.74 million VVPAT units) to end any doubts about the veracity of vote cast, photographs of the candidates in EVMs in an apparent attempt to end confusion between nominees with similar names. After a Supreme Court order, VVPAT will have to be tallied with the physical vote count in five EVMs in every constituency.

(CNN) - Hours after unveiling his new Medicare for All proposal, Sen. Bernie Sanders said Wednesday he would do what it takes -- even if it meant busting Senate norms -- to pass his signature health care policy.

Sanders has frequently raised doubts over breaking with lawmaking customs to advance his big-ticket policy agenda, but in a statement to CNN, he said his Medicare for All push would not be halted by current filibuster rules, which effectively require 60 votes to advance a bill. He is also floating a path to passage by way of budget reconciliation.

The two options would only require a simple majority of senators to sign on.

""In terms of Medicare for All, before we even get to the issue of the filibuster, we need 51 senators who are prepared to do what polls show that rank and file Democrats want -- and that is a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system,"" Sanders said. ""Once we have, and I believe it will be sooner than later, a Democratic majority who are prepared to vote for Medicare for All in the House and Senate, we will pass it.""

Sanders noted that his Medicare for All plan, which was cosponsored by four fellow 2020 Democratic presidential rivals, currently has only 15 ""publicly stated"" backers in the Senate. ""That has got to change,"" he said, pushing his liberal colleagues and issuing a warning in the process. ""In my view, Democratic elected officials and candidates should do what grassroots Democrats want them to do.""

The goal would not wipe out the filibuster entirely, Sanders' office said, but weaken it as part of a broader strategy that would employ unconventional means to deliver on his aggressive agenda.

""Bernie would support reforming the current filibuster rules to maintain the talking filibuster while eventually allowing legislation like Medicare for All to pass with a simple majority,"" Sanders aide Josh Miller-Lewis told CNN.

In his statement, Sanders also suggested that he would consider using budget reconciliation -- an arcane process employed by Senate Republicans in their failed attempt to wipe out Obamacare -- that also allows for some legislation, potentially including Medicare for All, to pass with 51 votes.

""It is the vice president who determines what is and is not permissible under budget reconciliation,"" Sanders said, suggesting that he would be willing to go over the head of a skeptical Senate parliamentarian. ""I can tell you that a vice president in a Bernie Sanders administration will determine that Medicare for All can pass through the Senate under reconciliation and is not in violation of the rules.""

Expected to stoke debate on 2020 trail

Sanders -- an independent who caucuses with the Democrats and is again seeking their party's nomination -- introduced the revamped proposal in the midst of a charged political moment, as the presidential primary heats up and the Trump administration makes a fresh push to topple Obamacare in the courts. But even as they circle the wagons around the current law, Democrats are eyeing the future -- and the prospects of enacting a single-payer system that would fundamentally re-order American life well beyond doctors' offices and emergency rooms.

The decision to move forward now is also expected to stoke a more pointed debate on the 2020 presidential primary circuit, where top contenders -- including Sens. Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand and Cory Booker, who all cosponsored the Medicare for All bill -- are being faced with a high-stakes new question over the role of private insurance companies. Sanders, through this legislation, is determined to put the industry out of business. The other four, and a raft more who do not support the bill, have all said the private insurers are either inescapable or, as many moderates argue, vital cogs in America's health care system.

At a Wednesday morning event on Capitol Hill, Sanders cast the movement supporting the legislation in historical terms.

""We are involved in a great struggle not unlike, to be honest with you, the struggles of the labor movement, the struggles of the civil rights movement, the struggles of the women's movement, the struggles of the gay community, the struggles of the environmental movement,"" Sanders said. ""This is what we're about.""

Asked earlier if Sanders is priming for a showdown with his 2020 opponents, including the bill's candidate-cosponsors, campaign manager Faiz Shakir laid down a marker.

""Whether it's a fight that he's going to have with them is up to them,"" Shakir said. ""This is a core pillar of why (Sanders) is running for president, a core pillar of what he would do as president. It's up to other people to determine for themselves whether and how much, how core it is for them. I will let other people decide for themselves how they'll go about it.""

Much like Sanders has on the stump, Shakir predicted a sharp and expensive fight with private insurance interests to come.

""You aren't going to upend that system easily,"" he said. ""So there's going to be a bunch of lobbying groups out there (spending) hundreds of millions of dollars and you can be damn sure that they're going to decide that an advertising campaign against Bernie Sanders is a worthwhile expenditure for them -- rather than providing health care coverage for people.""

At the Wednesday rally in Washington, Gillibrand, the only cosponsor in attendance, said that universal, government-guaranteed coverage needs ""to become the next social safety net, to become something that is there for you no matter what.""

The New York senator, who has supported single-payer for more than a decade and wrote the Sanders legislation's four-year transition plan, said the path to building support for the bill could be greased by allowing Americans to first buy-in to a government-run public option -- a move, she argued, that would ultimately wipe out the private insurance industry.

""I dare any insurance company to just try to compete. They won't,"" Gillibrand said. ""The insurance industry wants to make money. They are a for-profit industry. Their goals are not aligned with ours.""

Booker, who was not at the rally, also discussed the bill -- and the roadblocks facing it in Congress -- during a New York radio interview.

""I think the best way to do (reach full coverage) would be to design a Medicare for All system,"" he said. ""But anybody who says those words, 'Medicare for All,' who's running for president, the next thing out of their mouth should be talking to people about, in a split Congress, what are you going to actually do in your first year to make healthcare more accessible and affordable?""

He has not discussed in detail his plan for moving it through a Senate in which Democrats lack that 60-vote supermajority. In a divided Congress, the legislation would likely be dead on arrival.

Soon after Sanders' announcement, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders offered another preview of the pushback awaiting Democratic candidates who back Medicare for All.

""Democrats just announced their government takeover of healthcare plan,"" she tweeted, claiming the plan ""confiscates every American's private health insurance.""

Would effectively eliminate private insurance

In addition to Sanders, Gillibrand and the other three presidential hopefuls, the bill's cosponsors also include Sens. Tammy Baldwin, Richard Blumenthal, Patrick Leahy, Mazie Hirono, Ed Markey, Jeff Merkley, Brian Schatz, Tom Udall, Sheldon Whitehouse and Martin Heinrich. A number of them, like the five candidates, have also signed on to less radical bills, some of which would create a Medicare buy-in system or expand previously existing programs.

The 2019 legislation would go further than Sanders' previous plans by covering more long-term care services, bringing it closer in line with a broader House version sponsored by Washington Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal. Nursing home and other institutional coverage would still fall to Medicaid under the new bill, as it had before, while long-term care at home and in the community would be expanded.

Apart from its new measures to cover long-term care, much of Sanders' proposal remains the same as what he introduced in 2017. He wants to create a federal universal health insurance program that would cover medically necessary services, prescription drugs, dental and vision services. Premiums, deductibles and co-pays would disappear, except for a potential $200 co-pay for brand-name drugs.

Though many of his rivals have said they would maintain a role for private insurance, Sanders' bill would effectively eliminate the industry. Insurers would only be allowed to provide services not covered by the universal plan, such as cosmetic surgery.

As for how to foot the bill, Sanders describes a litany of ways Americans are already spending billions on health care, particularly because of high administrative costs, executive pay packages and prescription drug prices. He maintains that Medicare for All, despite its cost, would save many people money.

The new legislation also lists several ways to raise additional funds, including levying premiums on workers and employers; boosting income and estate tax rates; and establishing a wealth tax.

The decision to extend coverage for home- and community-based long-term care was predicated on a need to help the elderly and the disabled, while extending care to rural communities, Shakir told CNN.

""It's a really critical part of whether you're going to be able to sustain life (among the elderly),"" he said. ""Home care means so much to the disability community because it is literally liberty and freedom to be able to still run their own lives and not be committed to institutions or have to travel far distances to get basic care.""

Over the past decade, North Korea—officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)—has joined Iran, Russia, and China as a frequent cyber actor ...","New 'HOPLIGHT' Malware Appears in Latest North Korean Attacks, Say DHS, FBI

The FBI and Department of Homeland Security release malware analysis report, indicators of compromise for nine different executable files.

The North Korean government has rolled out a new malware variant, dubbed HOPLIGHT, targeting US companies and government agencies, the US Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation warned April 10.

The US advisory and malware analysis report, or MAR, offered details on nine different executable files that use valid certificates and encrypted connections to download files to a compromised system and send information back to attacker-controlled servers.

Taken together, the malicious programs can read, write and move files, gather information on the targeted system, manipulate processes and services, and connect back to a remote host.

""Seven of these files are proxy applications that mask traffic between the malware and the remote operators,"" according to the MAR. ""The proxies have the ability to generate fake TLS (transport layer security) handshake sessions using valid public SSL (secure sockets layer) certificates, disguising network connections with remote malicious actors.""

The report also listed 15 Internet addresses associated with the malware's infrastructure.

""DHS and FBI are distributing this MAR to enable network defense and reduce exposure to North Korean government malicious cyber activity,"" the agencies stated in an advisory.

'A history of attacking with vindictiveness'

The malware is part of North Korea's cyber toolset which the US refers to under the codename HIDDEN COBRA.

Over the past decade, North Korea—officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)—has joined Iran, Russia, and China as a frequent cyber actor, with a particular focus on currency generation and attacks that support the DPRK's political aims.

In 2014, attackers—identified as the North Korean group Lazarus—stole e-mail files, business-sensitive files, and e-mail accounts from Sony Pictures, purportedly in retribution for the movie studio's film, The Interview. In the years since the attack, the North Korean group, also referred to as APT38 by security firms, has focused on stealing money from financial institutions—targeting as much as $1.1 billion–by attacking the SWIFT banking system, using ransomware, such as WannaCry, to extort money from firms, and compromising systems with crypto-mining software to generate cryptocurrency.

Recent diplomatic talks between the United States and North Korea have not slowed the pace of DPRK's hackers, according to Adam Meyers, vice president of intelligence at CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity services firm.

""Interestingly, despite participating in diplomatic outreach, DPRK has remained active in both intelligence collection and currency-generation schemes,"" he said.

The latest analysis by the US government describes methods of detecting the HOPLIGHT toolset—an incremental improvement of North Korean cyber operations—using indicators of compromise (IOCs) and information about the infrastructure and code.

""The fact that they are putting these out there is really cool,"" says Adam Kujawa, director of Malwarebytes Labs at Malwarebytes. ""I'm glad that they are sharing this data, because with IOCs, people can identify what the threats are.""

Among the details: One file contains a public secure sockets layer (SSL) certificate with a payload that appears to be encoded with a password or key, the MAR stated. Another file does not contain any certificates, but drops four files onto the target systems and repeatedly attempt to connect the servers at the listed IP addresses.

Kujawa notes that the analysis does not mention where the executables came from, whether found on a third-party server or on a compromised system. And with compilation dates stretching back to May 2017, some of the files are nearly two years old.

However, companies should take the threat seriously, says Chris Duvall, senior director of The Chertoff Group, a cybersecurity consultancy. North Korea has shown little hesitation in attacking companies or nation-state targets.

""There is a history of attacking with vindictiveness,"" he says. ""Financial institutions and critical infrastructure and healthcare, in particular, should be on their toes and watch out for this.""

Nelson McCausland: 'Mary Lou should know who built the Berlin Wall ... it was her ‘sister party’, the East German Marxists'

Brexit seems to dominate the news these days and Sinn Fein, anxious to prove their relevance and always ready to exploit any situation, have certainly been busy. They have had their “No Brexit” poster campaigns, their “No Brexit” demonstrations and conferences and even “No Brexit” white-line pickets in west Belfast.

They have also extended their repertoire of activities to include amateur dramatics on the border, with portable customs huts, replica uniforms, replica guns and a fake wall.

Indeed, Mary Lou McDonald even starred in one performance when she appeared on the border wielding a sledgehammer at one of these fake walls.

Meanwhile, Sinn Fein are becoming increasingly strident and shrill in their pronouncements on Brexit and the Sinn Fein president has really excelled herself recently by comparing Brexit to “rebuilding the Berlin Wall”.

Last Thursday, she said: “The idea of reinstating the border on the island of Ireland is almost like suggesting we rebuild the Berlin Wall.”

This drew strong criticism from unionists and Gregory Campbell MP accused Sinn Fein of “shamelessly exploiting border communities for their own electoral advantage, making claims which bear no relation to the facts”.

The truth is that even in the darkest days of the Troubles, when there was a permanent military presence on the border, there was nothing resembling the Berlin Wall and what was there at the time was a proportionate and necessary response to the fact that Sinn Fein’s military wing was exploiting the border to facilitate its terrorist campaign of murder and destruction.

However, the Sinn Fein president was undeterred by such criticism and she repeated the reference to the Berlin Wall when she spoke to journalists last Sunday.

Now, the Berlin Wall was built in 1961 and Mary Lou McDonald wasn’t born until 1969, but it was in place until 1989, by which time Mary Lou was 20, and we can safely assume that she remembers the wall coming down.

It is, therefore, somewhat surprising that she makes such a particularly bizarre comparison.

The Berlin Wall was a high, continuous concrete wall, built by the communist government of East Germany to prevent its citizens defecting to the West and it was sometimes referred to as the “wall of shame”.

In making such a comparison, the Sinn Fein president was simply escalating the Sinn Fein tactic of scaremongering. Her comments certainly did not go down too well at home and I have heard few people rushing to her defence.

Nevertheless, she has spoken twice about the Berlin Wall and seems quite content with her comparison. Indeed, a week has passed since she first used it and yet she seems not to have picked up on the irony of her words.

In the European Parliament, political parties form themselves into groups and Sinn Fein is a member of the Confederal Group of the European United Left-Nordic Green Left.

This group is made up of a variety of socialist and communist parties, from counties across the EU, including the German party Die Linke (The Left).

You might imagine, then, that Mary Lou would know something about the history of her German “sister party”, especially since her reference to the Berlin Wall, but I am left wondering.

Die Linke was founded as a merger of two parties, one with its roots in Eastern Germany and one with its roots in Western Germany and that’s where we come back to the Berlin Wall.

The eastern partner in the merger was the Party of Democratic Socialism, the legal successor to the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the communist party, which ruled East Germany from 1946 to 1989 as a brutal one-party state and the party which built the Berlin Wall.

So, when Mary Lou McDonald talks about the notorious Berlin Wall, it is worth remembering that Sinn Fein’s “sister party” is the legal successor of the Communist Party that actually built the monstrous wall.

He'd likely rather have ex-Ontario premier Kathleen Wynne still running things in Queen's Park.

But in lieu of allies and like-minded leaders, Jason Kenney and Doug Ford could provide Justin Trudeau with something he has lacked since he dispatched Stephen Harper in 2015: the right kind of adversary.

There's always Andrew Scheer, of course — standing right across from Trudeau most afternoons in the House of Commons, the two of them separated by the length of two swords. In the one way that counts — this fall's federal election — Scheer is still Trudeau's direct and official opponent.

But nearly two years after taking the job, the leader of the Official Opposition remains an amorphous character, with arguably less of a presence in Canadians' political consciousness than his lingering predecessor. Until Scheer has a set of policies to his name, a match-up with Trudeau will be a difficult fight to promote.

When Pierre Trudeau's time in office is remembered, it's not for his confrontations with Robert Stanfield, whom Trudeau faced in three federal elections. Rather, Trudeau's greatest foe was René Lévesque, the separatist premier of Quebec from 1976 to 1985.

The National Film Board commissioned a three-part documentary about the two warring leaders. Lévesque was the one Trudeau battled in the 1980 referendum campaign and during the constitutional negotiations that followed. It was those battles that animated Trudeau's political career and legacy.

Doug Ford's audition

Doug Ford has spent the last nine months auditioning for the role of the prime minister's principal antagonist, with an unending series of complaints about the federal government. The Liberals have responded by embracing every opportunity to state their differences with the Ford government, while enthusiastically linking Scheer with Ford's agenda.

The Ford government is moving now to plaster anti-carbon tax stickers on every gas pump in Ontario — a remarkable use of public funds and authority to advance a partisan argument in an election year. Ford's direct involvement in the fall federal election seems inevitable.

Since coming to office, Trudeau has been offered up by some as a liberal beacon against a tidal wave of populism, so it might seem fitting that he would be defined now by a battle with a populist at home. Trudeau and Ford disagree on nearly everything, from carbon pricing to supervised consumption sites. The Ford government's austerity measures will stand in sharp contrast to the Trudeau government's spending. And Ford's bombast and family legacy are a neat match for Trudeau's celebrity and surname.

But Jason Kenney is the more intriguing foe. For one thing, Kenney can barely hide his contempt for the prime minister. For another, they already have a history.

Trudeau vs. Kenney

It was Kenney, as federal immigration minister in 2011, who moved to ban new citizens from wearing the niqab while swearing the citizenship oath. Four years later, that ban inspired Trudeau to deliver one of the most important speeches of his political career, a treatise on freedom and diversity that would end up framing a pivotal portion of that year's election.

""It is a cruel joke to claim you are liberating people from oppression by dictating in law what they can and cannot wear. Whatever happened to a free society's requirement that we can disagree with a person's choices, but must defend their right to make them?"" Trudeau asked.

""But what's even worse than what they're saying is what they really mean. We all know what is going on here. It is nothing less than an attempt to play on people's fears and foster prejudice, directly toward the Muslim faith. This is not the spirit of Canadian liberty, my friends. It is the spirit of the Komagata Maru. Of the St. Louis. Of 'none is too many.' ""

Kenney fumed over the comparison.

The federal court already had ruled against Kenney's ban, but the government appealed. When the Federal Court of Appeal again ruled against the government in September 2015, the issue was thrust into the election.

Trudeau had staked his position. Stephen Harper doubled down on the Conservative position. Seemingly reluctant to offend their supporters in Quebec,Tom Mulcair and the NDP struggled to express a contrary view. A month later, Trudeau and the Liberals won a decisive majority.

A possible rematch

Now, Kenney is in line to become the next premier of Alberta, a province that claims its own history with Trudeau, or at least with his surname.

Kenney would invite conflict with Trudeau over climate change, the defining issue of the era. He would be eager to blame Trudeau (or British Columbia or anyone else) for the province's lack of a pipeline to the coast — this moment's foremost threat to national unity.

Kenney also is vowing to call a referendum on equalization if he doesn't get a pipeline. As Jason Markusoff wrote recently in Maclean's, Kenney's proposed approach to governing sounds a lot like Quebec's traditional posturing.

There's a dual risk here for Scheer — of being overshadowed by two premiers and of sinking his own chances by tying himself to provincial leaders courting controversy. It's possible that, by October, many voters will be looking for a PM who is more likely to stand up to the premiers of Alberta and Ontario.

The greater threat posed by Kenney and Ford is still to the prime minister's own agenda and world view. But Kenney and Ford can at least do him the favour of clarifying the choice Trudeau wants to present to Canadians this fall.

That would have a big impact on relations between Edmonton and Ottawa; it also could play a significant role in October's federal election.

Rachel Notley, the incumbent premier and Alberta NDP leader, has had a delicate relationship with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government — an ally on climate change and pension reform but an uneasy partner on pipelines. If relations between the two levels of government have become more difficult over time, they're likely to get even more combative if Kenney's United Conservatives win next week's vote.

Not only has Kenney pledged to get rid of the province's carbon tax and lift the cap on greenhouse gas emissions for the oilsands, he has said he would hold a referendum on equalization if the federal government doesn't make any changes to the equalization formula.

It was just last week that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was accusing the opposition of making political hay out of Liberal dirty laundry for their own gain.

Then, by the weekend, Conservative leader Andrew Sheer informed the country Justin Trudeau was threatening to sue the opposition leader for statements he made after former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould released a damaging recording of her conversation with Michael Wernick, who retires as clerk of the Privy Council on April 19.

That catapulted the story into another week with a new angle, completely away from Wilson-Raybould or former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott.

These stories have simmered down compared to the Trudeau/Scheer legal dust-up, even after Philpott this week challenged why she was thrown out of caucus without a vote — which is odd, considering it’s highly unlikely the outcome would have been any different.

So it appeared the story was dying down until the PM’s legal threats and ongoing hints that new Attorney General David Lametti could grant SNC-Lavalin what Jody Wilson-Raybould would not, keeping the issue in the headlines themselves followed by attempts to deflect what they created.

By threatening to sue Scheer, Trudeau has handed the Conservatives another opportunity.

In court, everything is on the table, including testimony by all players as well as Trudeau, and cannot be shut down by a Liberal-controlled committee.

To add another tire to the heap, Andrew Scheer stood up outside the protected House of Commons and read the same statement that got him in trouble, trying to force the PM’s hand.

Once again, the Liberals have severely underestimated a situation and made it worse by trying to control it.

And the tire fire continues to burn.

The changes would prevent asylum-seekers from making refugee claims in Canada if they have made similar claims in certain other countries, including the United States, a move Border Security Minister Bill Blair says is aimed at preventing ""asylum-shopping.""

Lawyers and advocates who work with refugees are sounding the alarm about the legal changes, saying they would strip human-rights protections from vulnerable asylum-seekers.

Trudeau said Wednesday that Canada has been seeing larger numbers of refugee claims because of global instability. Sustaining Canadians' confidence in the country's asylum system means ensuring those who enter Canada do so according to the law, he said.

""That's why we're putting more resources in, and we're also ensuring the system is fair for everyone,"" he told reporters on Parliament Hill.

More than 41,000 asylum-seekers have crossed into Canada ""irregularly"" through unofficial paths across the Canada-U.S. border since early 2017. By doing so, they take advantage of a loophole in Canada's ""Safe Third Country Agreement"" with the United States that allows refugees who find a way into Canada by avoiding official border checkpoints to make refugee claims. The agreement would otherwise see them turned back to the U.S. — a country Canada considers safe for them.

The influx of irregular migrants began after U.S. President Donald Trump announced he would end a program that offers temporary protected status to migrants from several countries, serving notice he would seek to return them to homelands the United States had previously considered too dangerous. It has become a difficult political issue for the Trudeau government as hundreds of migrants continue to arrive in Canada through one particular unofficial crossing in Quebec each month.

Scheer says borders need to have 'integrity'

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer blames Canada's border woes on Trudeau, based on a tweet he issued in 2017 in which he welcomed refugees to Canada. Given the timing, it appeared to be a response to Trump's changes to the U.S. rules on temporary protected status there.

But Scheer on Wednesday sidestepped questions about the changes to refugee eligibility proposed by the Liberals, focusing instead on his own party's belief in an immigration system that is ""fair, orderly and compassionate.""

""We have to have a system that prioritizes those fleeing danger, fleeing civil war and natural disasters and that has to be based on our borders having integrity,"" he said.

That's the plan, said Blair's spokeswoman Marie-Emanuelle Cadieux.

""Our proposed changes include measures to deter irregular migration and maintain the integrity of our asylum system by preventing access to those who make repeated claims in different countries,"" she said. ""This encourages those who truly need protection to seek asylum at the first possible opportunity, while those who do not need to follow the rules.""

The Canadian Press Border Security Minister Bill Blair says changes to Canada's asylum laws aim to prevent ""asylum shopping.""

Government figures show that since April 1, 2017, roughly 3,150 asylum-claimants in Canada had previously applied for asylum in the United States. Three-quarters of them were irregular migrants — fewer than six per cent of the total number of irregular asylum-seekers to arrive in Canada since 2017. The vast majority of them had made their claims to the U.S. between one and five years ago, according to government data.

The Liberals signalled their intent to get tougher on the border in the 2019 budget, which included a plan to spend $1.18 billion over five years to beef up security and law enforcement and speed up the processing of asylum claims.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau said Canada wants to maintain its reputation as a fair and welcoming country, but also one that is governed by the rule of law.

Trudeau echoed these comments Wednesday.

""Every single person who comes to Canada — whether it's regularly or irregularly — goes through our immigration system, gets the full treatment within our asylum system.""

Asylum changes 'shocking': NDP MP

But refugee advocates and lawyers say disallowing asylum seekers who have made refugee claims in other countries from making claims in Canada does just the opposite, stripping them of their ability to plead their cases to the Immigration and Refugee Board.

NDP immigration critic Jenny Kwan is particularly concerned that migrants to Canada wouldn't be permitted to make claims in Canada after having had their claims rejected in the United States.

She is concerned for those who might be rejected as a result of a shift in U.S. immigration policy last year. The new rules say domestic and gang violence can no longer be used as grounds for asylum in the United States.

""The Trump government has demonized immigrants and asylum-seekers, they have removed gender-based violence and gang violence as grounds for making an asylum claim, they have taken (migrant) children from their parents ... for Canada to take a page out of that with this measure is shocking to me,"" the Vancouver MP said.

Kwan, May ask Speaker to break up budget bill

Kwan also raised the case of Seidu Mohammed — a man from Ghana who lost all his fingers to frostbite after crossing irregularly into Manitoba from the U.S. in December 2016. Both Mohammed and the man he was travelling with, Razak Iyal (who also lost digits to frostbite) had previously had their asylum claims rejected in America before coming to Canada.

Both of their claims for refugee protection were eventually accepted in Canada.

""If this law that's being proposed in the budget bill was in place, Mr. Seidu would be sent back. This is the real ramification for people and Canada is knowingly embarking on this path,"" Kwan said.

Both she and Green Leader Elizabeth May have asked House of Commons Speaker Geoff Regan to break up the budget bill to separate out these and other non-budgetary measures, arguing they should be treated separately as notable changes in public policy.

Stelco Holdings Inc., president and executive chairman Alan Kestenbaum met with Justin Trudeau in Ottawa Thursday.

While he thanked the prime minister for the government’s support of the metals industry since the imposition of American tariffs last year, Kestenbaum said steel producers are now facing new pressures.

Stelco reported a surge in income and revenues in the final quarter of last year, despite the 25 per cent tariffs on steel imported from Canada that the Trump administration imposed last June.

The company reported net income of $108 million on revenue of $648 million in the three months ending Dec. 31, compared with $16 million of income and revenues of $452 million during the same period in 2017.

But the Canadian International Trade Tribunal (CITT) issued a report last week that could see Canadian import restrictions lifted on some steel products.

The provisional safeguards announced in October, designed to shield domestic producers from a flood of imports into Canada resulting from the U.S. tariffs, were considered by the World Trade Organization as emergency measures and are set to expire in about a month’s time.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau issued emergency import restrictions on seven products, arguing that they posed a serious threat to Canada’s steel industry.

The CITT report, issued April 3, ruled the safeguards were warranted on just two of the seven products.

“The measures that were put in place, the actions that were put in place, have enabled Stelco and other steel producers to really be able to operate well in this very, very difficult environment,” Kestenbaum said as he sat with Trudeau in the prime minister’s West Block office.

“Today we’re here to talk about a changing landscape.”

Amnesty International ...","OTTAWA — A group of civil-society and legal organizations are asking Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to withdraw changes to asylum laws included in a Liberal budget bill tabled this week, calling them harsh and unnecessary.

Amnesty International, the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers, the Canadian and B.C. civil-liberties associations and the Canadian Council for Refugees have written a joint letter to Trudeau saying the proposed legal changes would strip crucial and hard-won human-rights protections from vulnerable refugees.

""These cases involve incredibly high stakes for the claimants, including questions of persecution and torture, of being able to live life freely in accordance with one’s identity and culture with protection for fundamental human rights and even questions of life and death,"" states the letter. ""That is why Canada has long ensured that refugee claims are determined in a fair hearing before an independent tribunal.""

The changes would prevent asylum-seekers from making refugee claims in Canada if they have made similar claims in certain other countries, namely the United States — a move Border Security Minister Bill Blair says is aimed at preventing ""asylum-shopping.""

Refugee advocates and lawyers have said these changes would have a devastating impact on people seeking asylum in Canada because it would remove their ability to plead their cases in full oral hearings before the Immigration and Refugee Board.

The letter to Trudeau echoes these concerns, calling Blair's justification for the changes ""simplistic and inaccurate"" and ""offensive.""

""We know from our collective experience that there are a wide range of legitimate reasons why refugee claimants may seek Canada’s protection after having filed a claim elsewhere. They must be given the opportunity to do so,"" it says.

The groups are also upset that these measures were buried in a nearly 400-page omnibus budget bill, calling that an undemocratic move that prevents parliamentarians from being able to fully consider the effects and potential unforeseen consequences these measures could have on the refugee system.

They urge Trudeau to withdraw the proposed refugee eligibility changes, which they say would likely result in legal challenges.

Since 2017, over 41,000 asylum-seekers have arrived in Canada via the Canada-U.S. border at unofficial entry points. Blair's office says the proposed legal changes are meant to deter these ""irregular"" migrants and maintain the integrity of Canada's asylum system.

Did he fail to properly ...","Among the various ways Justin Trudeau is being slammed for his handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair, the charge that the Prime Minister has revealed himself during this controversy to be no real feminist is the hardest to pin down.

Did he fail to properly respect the independence of the attorney general, back last fall when Jody Wilson-Raybould had the job? On this core question, there are meetings and phone calls and text messages to argue about, rules and codes to interpret, in trying to arrive at an answer.

Did he botch efforts to contain the controversy after it exploded, and ultimately go too far in kicking Wilson-Raybould and her chief ally, Jane Philpott, out of the Liberal caucus? On these issues, political strategists, Parliament Hill veterans, and even pundits, have thoughts about crisis management to kick around.

Did he somehow let down the feminist side, though? This question naturally arises because the two former cabinet ministers testing Trudeau’s mettle both happen to be women. And, to quite a few commentators, that fact alone is telling enough. But it is hardly sufficient.

There’s no solid reason I’ve heard to presume that two male cabinet ministers would have fared differently had they dissented from Trudeau’s handling of a file that brings into play hard questions about the administration of justice, worrying possible economic outcomes, and, yes, potential ramifications in the coming fall election.

What’s needed to give the critiques of Trudeau’s feminist credentials heft are facts that don’t require guesses about the dynamics between men and women in Trudeau’s famously gender-balanced cabinet, or speculations about the PM’s own putative biases.

In other words, does any data show that he’s running the government in a way that’s better or worse for women than what came before him? In fact, there are at least some numbers, and they tend to bolster his feminist credentials.

Maclean’s asked the Privy Council Office (PCO), the branch of the bureaucracy that supports the Prime Minister’s Office, for recent figures on what are called Governor in Council appointees. These are the fortunate individuals who get paid to work on federal commissions, boards, Crown corporations, agencies and tribunals.

As of the end of 2018, 49 per cent of these appointments had gone to women, according to the PCO data, up markedly from 35 per cent in 2015, the year the Trudeau Liberals beat Stephen Harper’s Conservatives in an election. That 14-point rise in the share of these plum federal jobs going to women compares to just a four-point increase, from 31 per cent to 35 per cent, in the previous three-year period.

Those numbers represent—to home in on just one significant segment of them—a shift from women filing only about a third of the seats on Crown corporation boards when the Liberals took power to very nearly half now—up from 34 per cent at the end of 2015 to 48 per cent at the close of 2018. That’s up 14 points in three years of Trudeau rule, compared to six points over the previous three-year span.

Looking more broadly at women in the executive ranks of the federal public service—known to bureaucrats by their “EX 01” through “EX 05” designations—there’s been less dramatic change, but still an uptick. The number of women at that level stood at 2,567 last spring, up from 2,264 in the spring of 2015. That meant women accounted for 49 per cent of the government’s executive ranks, up from 46 per cent over that three-year period.

Arguably even more important, or at least more prestigious inside the government, is the cadre of deputy ministers—the top mandarins in federal departments. Overall the number of women filling these powerful posts climbed to 39 last year from 30 three years earlier. That translates into 46 per cent women at the deputy minister level last spring, compared to 41 per cent three years earlier.

Even taken together, of course, these numbers don’t mean Trudeau’s Liberals have excised sexism from the federal government. Still, weighed against mere impressions of what the SNC-Lavalin affair might signify about his feminist bona fides, knowing how many more women are working in key federal jobs these days has to count for something.

And then, a couple years later, there was Trudeau again, draping himself in gawky Indian garb on a trip to a country where Indians these days are much more comfortable in khakis and a golf shirt. That was supposed to reflect Canada’s embrace of multicultural values, at least I think it was, but it really just ended up looking dorky, and not so nice.

The theatrics didn’t even come close to the reflecting the reality of Trudeau’s leadership. Canada’s actual response to the refugee crisis in 2015 was woefully inadequate. Even today, despite all the rhetoric of openness and empathy for the world’s vulnerable, Canada still only accepted a miserly 14,790 refugee referrals in 2018. Our immigration and refugee system, as I’ve written before, is not based on values or empathy; it is based on economics.

The India fiasco was of a different species. The sartorial faux-pas could be forgiven but it was hard to overlook the presence of Jaspal Atwal, the one-time Sikh separatist convicted in India of trying to assassinate the Indian prime minister, on the list of VIPs traveling with Trudeau.

Whether flipping pancakes in a meme-ready cowboy outfit or photo-bombing newlyweds, Trudeau’s social media brand is the envy of progressive leaders around the world. The careful nurturing of his public persona—the champion of liberal values, a feminist with a high emotional IQ and other such hazy accolades—fits neatly into the political niche left vacant after Barack Obama exited the White House.

Trudeau is now everything liberals around the world hoped Obama would be, the foil to rising right wing authoritarianism, a handsome and youthful leader who speaks for the up-and-coming generations longing for a break from the old ways of politics. It’s almost become cliché outside of Canada: mention being Canadian and people inevitably say, “Oh aren’t you lucky to have Trudeau!”

We are lucky, but not because of Trudeau. We’re fortunate we have a political system that is still relatively stable and inclusive, though it may be fraying at the edges. Where our luck could run out is when ideological certainty muscles its way into complex issues, when leaders, Trudeau included, decide they have all the answers and if only the levers of democracy would align to their vision, the world would be such a better place.

Is Trudeau falling prey to his own image? His handling of the SNC Lavalin affair would suggest so. What stuck out most to me in recent revelations was the insistence with which Trudeau appeared to be pursuing his agenda. Over the course of the now-infamous 17-minute telephone conversation between Jody Wilson-Raybould and Michael Wernick, Wernick said no less than four times that the Prime Minster was “firm” about his position on the SNC-Lavalin file. “He is gonna find a way to get it done one way or another,” he warned.

Then there was the god-awful quip Trudeau attempted after a protester at a Liberal donor event was being removed. “Thank you very much for your donation tonight,” he bellowed, to the laughter and applause of the wealthy elites holding court with the PM.

His subsequent apology did little to fix the damage. And why would it? Apologies are easy. It’s much harder to re-build a broken public image, especially when it was constructed from flimsy material to begin with.

The sad fact is that the collapse of Trudeau’s brand is infecting the Liberal party. It doesn’t deserve it. I have been impressed, for instance, with Chrystia Freeland’s poise on the international stage. The Liberal government has shown more deep thinking when it comes to handling the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. It has used Canada’s resources much more effectively in places like the Mediterranean Sea and Ukraine. And its principled stand against Saudi Arabia’s excesses has been laudable.

But when the leader of a nation embraces his public façade as fact, we’re in real trouble. It is the first step toward authoritarianism.

All authoritarians believe what they do is for the good of their nation. Here in Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan rails against his critics for endangering the path of glory upon which he claims to have set his nation. Stop your moaning about due process, constitutional norms and all that cumbersome legal jibber-jabber, he intimates, I know what I’m doing.

Erdogan, of course, likes to jail his detractors, and Turkey’s laws are such that he can do so with relative abandon. Trudeau is more encumbered by law but the underlying motivation—the near-prophetic faith in his progressive mission—feels unsettlingly familiar.

Before Erdogan, secular, progressive Turks also had their white knights, the Kemalist elites who threw all sense of equanimity to the wind in pursuit of their version of progress. There was nothing inherently wrong with that vision—who wouldn’t want a pluralistic, democratic, secular Turkey based on the rule of law—but the way they went about it undermined the project itself. Kemalist disregard for pluralism, its rabid hatred of religious conservatives and Kurdish identity, only served to galvanize conservative and Kurdish discontent. Now, under Erdogan, the conservatives are taking their revenge and the Kurdish issue has metastasized into an insurgency with no sign of ending.

Of course, Canada is nowhere near the political dysfunction we’ve seen in Turkey, or the U.S., or parts of Europe. But the irony, or perhaps inevitability, is that Trudeau’s failure is precisely what could hand over power to Canada’s own right wing ideologues. This is what happens when leaders embrace their own vision of the world and believe they are the ones to impose it. There is often an equal and opposite reaction. And in Canada that could mean the end of our place atop the world’s progressive nations.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Conservative leader Andrew Scheer wore rosy ties for the International Day of Pink, and a sea of MPs behind them sported yellow daffodil pins in support of cancer research. But they couldn’t agree on much else Wednesday. The annual frenzy colloquially referred to as “silly season,” always hotter in an election year, seemed to have begun in earnest.

Despite the flowers and pastels, Liberals still seemed mired in the barren, grey winter. On the agenda Wednesday, aside from a triumphant “We freed the beer!” from Trudeau, were repeated challenges from Scheer for the prime minister to make good on a defamation lawsuit his lawyer threatened last week — apparently in the hopes that bringing the matter to court would unearth further details about the ongoing SNC-Lavalin scandal.

Variations on “When will I see the prime minister in court?” and “I’m just waiting for him to tell me on what day I should show up” from Scheer were met with variations on “They’re still following Stephen Harper’s playbook” and “The Opposition continues to mislead Canadians” from Trudeau.

After several rounds of the same, the Liberal leader made a joke about how Groundhog Day had been back in February, before repeating himself anew. The Conservative leader joked that with Trudeau’s father, it had been “just watch me,” but with Trudeau, it was “just watch me run away.”

Trudeau did not address, in question period or to reporters earlier Wednesday, whether or not he planned to proceed with the suit.

Conservatives had made public the libel notice from Trudeau’s lawyer, Julian Porter, on the weekend. And daring Trudeau to a game of chicken, Scheer had stood outside of the House of Commons chamber before question period to recite his allegedly defamatory March 29 statement again.

“These documents and recordings are concrete evidence that proves Justin Trudeau led a campaign to politically interfere in SNC-Lavalin’s criminal prosecution. He personally gave the orders and when the former attorney general refused to follow them and break the law, she was fired,” Scheer repeated, going on to reiterate the entire 200-word statement, which ended with a demand for Trudeau’s resignation.

Scheer was referring to documentation former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould presented to the House justice committee. In testimony she had accused the prime minister and his officials of inappropriately pressuring her to overturn, for political reasons, the Director of Public Prosecutions’s decision not to offer the Montreal company a remediation agreement.

Porter’s letter said Scheer’s comments were “highly defamatory” and “beyond the pale of fair debate.” The lawyer spelled out each of Scheer’s assertions and how they were “entirely false.” Bolstered by an enthusiastic roster of MPs, Scheer challenged Trudeau to say so in front of a judge.

In what felt like a dress rehearsal for the federal election scheduled for October, the leaders talking over each other on SNC-Lavalin led to sparring on an entirely different political issue.

Responding to Scheer’s demand for a court date, Trudeau accused Scheer of failing to denounce white supremacy, and invited him to chastise Conservative Sen. Leo Housakos for saying, during a committee exchange with Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland Tuesday, that “I would find it disturbing to believe that there’s a politician in this country that believes that white supremacy is a threat to our way of life in Canada.”

In response, Scheer said he has always denounced white supremacy and racism, and added it was “disgusting” for Trudeau to bring it up. “The Liberals are using the very real threat of hatred and racism in this country to cover up their corruption scandal,” he said.

There was a brief uproar in the House as MPs reacted to the exchange. Independent MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes was heard loudly protesting the political football over racism. “It’s real,” she was heard yelling over the crowd. Later on Twitter, she said, “Playing politics with racism, which impacts people on a daily basis is, disgusting and wrong. What just happened in the (House of Commons) is shameful.” Whether she was attacking Trudeau or Scheer — or both — wasn’t clear.

Housakos had earlier used Twitter to clarify his comments, saying his point was that no leaders in Western democracy condone white supremacist movements or extremism of any kind. Scheer, after question period, used the same platform to accuse Liberals of trying to “score cheap points.”

It had been a classic made-for-TV question period, the kind that Ottawa politicos write off as a necessary evil but that turns the stomachs of the sweet summer children in the gallery. It was chock full of combat, revealing almost nothing new, containing several dad jokes and managing to deeply offend.

There are still 194 days to go until the scheduled election day. The forecast guarantees that summer will be filled with hot air.

Re: Trudeau hasn’t lost his claim as a feminist, April 6.

I completely agree with Janice Kennedy; the SNC-Lavalin affair is not a feminist issue. It’s about two people fighting for their own point of view – an argument that should have stayed within the federal cabinet. Instead, we are left with divisions and people taking sides when we really don’t know everything.

Jody Wilson-Raybould said herself that nothing illegal happened. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tried to “do things differently” by waiting and trying to smooth the waters. I feel very sorry that we have lost two very strong women. But this has really become an issue blown out of all proportion. A “tempest in a teapot.”

Can we not now get on with more important issues: China, trade, climate change?

Barbara O’Connor, Ottawa

This was just plain common sense

Janice Kennedy’s opinion piece made me realize how much I miss her voice of reason and her plain common-sense approach. In these turbulent times, we need more of her on a regular basis.

Barbara McWhinnie, Morrisburg

It was a disagreement over policy

Finally, a balanced opinion column as to whether Trudeau remains a feminist or not. The SNC-Lavalin affair comes down to a strong disagreement between two members of the Liberal cabinet and caucus as to which line of action to follow. It has absolutely nothing to do with feminism. On the contrary, all those who pursued and still do, that line of thinking, are missing the point.

Within any types of teams, as with all families, you will sometime encounter disagreement. Usually, the differences of opinion will be argued within the team and, hopefully, these will remain within the team. It is called team solidarity and is essential to the well-being of any organization. These teams are composed of female and male members, respected as equal by all.

Gender equality means that the gender and sexual orientation have no bearing on the merits and respect of such a person. They are all persons within a community. The sooner we all come to terms with this, the better.

But enough of all this, already! There are more serious and pressing issues that need to be dealt with by Parliament. Canadians expect no less from their elected representatives.

Jacques Faille, Ottawa

Both genders have a right to their say

One particular sentence stands out in Janice Kennedy’s opinion piece: “The real truth is that there is no single truth and no sainted truth-teller.”

I have become dismayed in recent years with the uncivil discourse that now seems to be the norm in politics and elsewhere. Middle ground seems to have disappeared. George W. Bush said: “If you are not with us, you are against us.” Compared to some of our current political leaders, he was a moderate.

I hear female politicians raising their voices over the “feminist” issue and other issues as well. Might a male not raise his voice without being branded?

Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott are humans with ideals and principles stating what they believe to be real truth. That does not mean that those who disagree with them – both men and women – cannot believe differently and say so loudly.

Harvey Davey, Ottawa

What about the dismal Conservative record?

Janice Kennedy makes the case for equal rights and treatment, rather than special consideration for being a woman. Would Justin Trudeau or any prime minister eject two men from caucus in the same circumstances? What would Stephen Harper or Jean Chrétien do? We know now that Trudeau continued to work on a compromise, and two of the three people whom Jody Wilson-Raybould identified have left the government.

Although not discounting the issue of miscommunication or power-play between the PMO and the former attorney general, I ask myself everyday why few journalists are challenging the “sacrosanct” position of today’s Conservatives who were members of the Harper government when he displayed contempt for the judiciary, including then-chief justice Beverley McLaughlin, going so far as falsely accusing her of inappropriate behaviour?

So, thank God for Janice Kennedy.

Rita Sarot, Ottawa

What, then, qualifies as controversy?

Re: Letter, SNC affair about absolutely nothing, April 6.

The SNC-Lavalin affair has resulted in the resignation of the prime minister’s principal secretary and the Clerk of the Privy Council; the demotion of one of the prime minister’s star cabinet ministers and her subsequent resignation from the cabinet altogether; the resignation of another star cabinet minister in sympathy; the ultimate expulsion of both these former high flyers from the Liberal caucus; and tanking poll numbers for the prime minister.

Yet one letter-writer likens the SNC-Lavalin affair to a show about absolutely nothing. I shudder to think what the fallout would be from an affair of substance.

Geoff Regan said he has no role in deciding how caucuses should conduct themselves.

Moreover, he said the Parliament of Canada Act expressly bars the courts from intervening in such matters.

""This leaves caucuses alone with the authority to govern their internal operations,"" Regan told the Commons.

""With the full authority given to caucuses themselves in such unequivocal terms, it is clear that the chair has no role in the interpretation or enforcement of the statute, even when members feel rudderless without what they feel would be clearly stated and understood rules.""

Philpott argued Tuesday that Trudeau did not follow reforms made to the Parliament of Canada Act in 2015 that were supposed to give MPs more power over caucus decisions — including whether to expel members — rather than leave them entirely up to party leaders.

The reforms required each party caucus to hold recorded votes at their first meeting following an election on whether to adopt the new rules.

The Liberals never had such a vote, deciding in 2015 to defer the matter to a party convention instead. But they ultimately informed the Speaker that they had implicitly chosen not to use the new rules.

Trudeau has said he made the decision to turf Philpott and Wilson-Raybould only after extensive consultations showed overwhelming caucus support for kicking the pair out of the Liberal fold.

The two former ministers have been at the centre of a political storm that has engulfed the Trudeau government for more than two months.

Watch: Philpott raises issue in House of Commons

Wilson-Raybould alleges she was improperly pressured last fall by the Prime Minister's Office and others to intervene to stop the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. She believes she was moved out of the prestigious justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs in a mid-January cabinet shuffle as punishment for refusing to override the director of public prosecutions, who had decided not to invite the Montreal engineering giant to negotiate a remediation agreement, a kind of plea bargain in corporate corruption cases.

Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet in mid-February. Philpott followed suit a few weeks later, saying she had lost confidence in the government's handling of the SNC-Lavalin case.

The last straw for Liberal MPs was the revelation that Wilson-Raybould surreptitiously recorded a December phone conversation with Michael Wernick, the clerk of the Privy Council, to bolster her claim of improper pressure. Many said they no longer felt they could trust the former ministers.

The Conservative leader revealed Sunday that he received a letter on March 31 from Trudeau’s lawyer, Julian Porter, threatening a libel suit.

“If Mr. Trudeau believes he has a case against me, I urge him to follow through on his threat immediately,” Scheer said in a statement.

In March 2008, though, it was then-prime minister Stephen Harper of the Conservatives who sued the Liberal Party for $3.5 million.

Harper sued the Liberals for libel over allegations that Conservative party officials offered dying independent MP Chuck Cadman a $1-million life-insurance policy in exchange for his key vote on a confidence matter that could have defeated the Liberal government in 2005. Harper was leader of the opposition at the time and Cadman sat as an independent MP.

The Liberals alleged that Harper knew of this offer and Cadman’s vote against the budget of the Paul Martin government in 2005 would lead to a no-confidence vote that would have brought down the minority Liberals. Cadman would not be running for re-election. In fact he flew to Ottawa to vote in May 2005 shortly after undergoing chemotherapy treatment for melanoma. He ended up voting with the Liberal government, supporting their budget and allowing the party to survive the no-confidence vote tabled after the budget. Cadman died in July of that year.

Harper’s initial claim was for $2.5 million, but later increased it by $1 million for “misappropriation of personality.” He proceeded to sue the Liberal party itself, but initially filed notice of libel against Liberal Leader Stephane Dion, deputy leader Michael Ignatieff and Liberal Party house leader Ralph Goodale over allegations that he knew about the bribe. The criminal code forbids bribing a member of Parliament.

“I have every right, as does my family, to defend our reputation, and the Liberal party will, as I said, come to regret engaging in this illegal and untruthful behaviour,” Harper said at the time.

The Liberals said the lawsuit was a tactic to keep opposition MPs from looking into “alleged improprieties” of the government. It was the first time a sitting prime minister sued the opposition.

In February 2009, after Michael Ignatieff took leadership of the Liberals, the two sides said they had “settled all issues” and agreed the case will be dismissed without costs.

Scheer called Trudeau’s threatened lawsuit “an intimidation tactic” aimed at silencing the Conservatives, who have been demanding a thorough, independent investigation of the affair.

Next week's Alberta election could raise the climate change policy stakes to a new high just in time ...,"Ottawa has been working to meet the court-imposed conditions to restart the project for the better part of a year.

It is an open secret that Trudeau has long planned to press relaunch as soon as that process was completed — ideally in time for this summer's construction season.

His government now owns the pipeline and has, if only by default, become the prime mover behind its expansion.

The federal cabinet is expected to review the file next month. The assumption has been that it would at that time give the project the green light to resume. As of next Tuesday night, that widespread assumption could be no longer valid.

If, as the polls predict, Kenney does become the next Alberta premier, he will kill the carbon tax introduced by Notley's New Democrats, remove the ceiling cap on the carbon emissions of the oilsands and halt the phase-out of Alberta coal-fired electricity.

In so doing, a UCP government would effectively be removing the very rationale upon which the prime minister based his decision to give the Trans Mountain expansion the go-ahead in the first place.

That approval was contingent on Alberta's climate change commitments. Absent those, Trudeau would have cause to reconsider.

To give the project the green light against the backdrop of the complete withdrawal of Alberta from the federal climate change framework would cost Trudeau's signature policy its last shreds of credibility.

But to put it on hold would shatter the federal contention that the expansion is in the national interest.

For the prime minister, it could come down to an unpalatable choice as to which of his words on the pipeline-versus-climate change issue he walks back.

No one really expects Kenney to meet the federal government part of the way on the issue. If he is elected to lead the next Alberta government, he is likely to wait Trudeau out until the October election, in the hope of accelerating a return of the pipeline-friendly federal Conservatives to power.

That being said, that strategy could yet backfire on both Conservative leaders.

Kenney is looking for a prime minister liable to force the hands of B.C. and Quebec on pipelines. More than a few voters in those two provinces are bound to find that prospect unpalatable.

For better or for worse, the next episode in the Trans Mountain saga is poised to become a defining moment for the prime minister but possibly also for his main opposition rival.

I suspect she’d an inkling this was coming. After all, every time she turns on the TV, watch a movie, read the paper or browse some social media chat room the message is unmistakable. It’s all the fault of those Russians.

She being born and bred in Moscow, though for years a proud Canadian, it’s a tad annoying to constantly see your native land being blamed for every problem on earth.

For comparison, let’s recall those old John Wayne movies where Indians — as they were then called — were portrayed as such needless, nasty critters they could be shown getting mown down like dithering ducks in some early-morning November sky. The movie audiences of the time ate it up.

Thankfully, that storyline doesn’t play well today. But such cultural and political correctness isn’t universal. Now the only bunch left you can impugn without fear of societal vilification are those nasty Ruskies.

Now, truth be told, I’ve always had a fondness for Russia: some of the greatest literature, dance, art, engineering and science has emanated from what is by far and away the biggest slice of national landmass on our planet. Oh, and having the world’s most beautiful women didn’t hurt, either.

Of course, if I actually lived and worked there, it wouldn’t last long — pondering in print why Vladimir Putin insists on being photographed with his shirt off more often than Kim Kardashian would likely guarantee I’d soon be slipping whilst giving some ninth-storey windows a quick clean. (I love Canada — it puts up with me.)

But what’s the latest dirty deed those Russians are involved in? For an answer, who better to turn to than the man standing bravely and resolutely on guard for Canada: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Yes, in a much-needed (for him, anyhow) time out from insulting Indigenous women protesting mercury poisoning or booting former ministers out of caucus because they think the rule of law worth defending, Trudeau was in fine fettle, speaking about something he undoubtedly is an expert in: malign actors.

“We have seen over the past number of years an increase in the interference or the implication of foreign actors in democratic processes,” he said. “We saw very clearly that countries like Russia are behind a lot of the divisive campaigns, a lot of the divisive social media.

“The election that’s coming up in six months will be decided by Canadians. We’re going to work very hard with all the intelligence communities and our partners around the world to ensure that our democracies stay strong for all the different voices that express themselves within it.”

Wow. He certainly wasn’t talking about his own Liberal caucus and how it stands up for different voices within it.

That’s not all. Apparently, we need a group of five senior civil servants who might be forced to go public if they find a malign act of interference in the October campaign.

What a bunch of tosh. We’ve witnessed a bigger threat to the values this country holds dear emanating out of Trudeau’s own government than could ever be envisaged by some nebulous Moscow-based bunch intent on placing some daft ads on Facebook.

But this is just a smokescreen. The only threat this man is concerned about is the free-fall his personal approval ratings are taking at the polls. Or maybe that too is some fiendish Russian-inspired plot.

No, this is simply another lame attempt to derail the SNC-Lavalin scandal, to make himself look statesman-like when in reality Trudeau appears increasingly as a thin-skinned, bully boy.

Still, he might have reason to worry about those Russians after all. I know a fair number here in Calgary, mostly engineers in the energy industry.

Yes, they will be interfering in the federal election all right. It’s called voting and like the majority of their fellow Calgarians, they won’t be marking an X anywhere near Trudeau’s party.

The proposal was included in a budget bill introduced this week in Parliament. The government is earmarking 1.18 billion Canadian dollars ($880 million) in spending over the next five years to reinforce border security and speed up processing of asylum claims.

Trudeau said Canada has been seeing larger numbers of refugee claims because of global instability. Sustaining Canadians' confidence in the country's asylum system means ensuring those who enter Canada do so according to the law, he said.

""That's why we're putting more resources in, and we're also ensuring the system is fair for everyone,"" Trudeau told reporters Wednesday.

Authorities say that since early 2017, more than 41,000 asylum-seekers have ""irregularly"" crossed into Canada, meaning they arrived without going through an official port of entry. By doing so, they take advantage of a loophole in Canada's Safe Third Country Agreement with the U.S. that allows people who cross irregularly to make refugee claims. Asylum-seekers trying to enter at official border crossings are turned back to the U.S. — a country Canada considers safe for them.

The influx of irregular migrants to Canada began after U.S. President Donald Trump announced he would end a program that offers temporary protected status to people from several countries, serving notice he would seek to return them to homelands that the United States had previously considered too dangerous. The U.S. also eliminated domestic and gang violence as possible grounds for asylum.

Refugee advocates, lawyers and opposition parties have questioned the asylum proposal, saying that disallowing asylum-seekers in Canada who have made prior refugee claims in other countries could see them sent back to dangerous situations.

Editor’s note: The opinions in this article are the author’s, as published by our content partner, and do not necessarily represent the views of MSN or Microsoft.

Conservatives in Canada are fond of telling a simplistic story about Justin Trudeau’s relationship with the press. Journalists are knee-jerk partisans, the argument goes, and their love of Trudeau’s Liberal administration is deep and uncomplicated. Accordingly, the news media is engaged in an unwavering project to praise, excuse and protect the prime minister.



Recent weeks must have been confusing to fans of this theory.

The Canadian media at this point is vividly hostile to Trudeau. Coverage and analysis cling to the most uncharitable interpretation of the “Lavscam” affair — essentially that the prime minister engaged in a pseudo-criminal coverup and abused his power to protect the sinister SNC-Lavalin corporation from prosecution, then unjustly fired two heroic cabinet ministers. Headlines blare stories of a prime minister scrambling for his political life; editorial pages thunder that the scandal isn’t going away.

On social media, meanwhile, journalists engage in an outrage arms race, inflating every incremental Lavscam development into an unprecedented assault on truth and justice. Pundits who express contrarian opinions, like Neil Macdonald or Susan Delacourt, get smothered in a tsunami of denunciation by the blue-check-mark set.

How can this be reconciled with the conservative belief in a pro-Trudeau press? Did Tory partisans hallucinate the past four years? Has the horror of Lavscam forced formerly liberal journalists to convert?

The answer begins by conceding the obvious: There’s no such thing as a singular “press.” Social media often makes it seem as though all headlines and hot takes emanate from a common pipeline, but in practice the news media remains a diverse collection of outlets, not all of which share ideological and institutional biases.

Take the distinct journalistic sub-genre “entertainment and lifestyle.” Soft media of this sort has undoubtedly been a Trudeau ally, as it’s been to other “celebrified” politicians, sucha as Barack Obama and Beto O’Rourke. Good looks and an intriguing biography will always make a compelling subject independent of politics. Accordingly, Vanity Fair, Rolling Stone, Vogue, Chatelaine, and Reader’s Digest have all turned their gentle lens on Trudeau at some point. The resulting profiles, sycophantic in the ways celebrity profiles often are, became major news events in their own right.

A similar sub-genre is the international press. Major non-Canadian outlets such as the New York Times, the Economist, BBC and the Guardian have all sought to explain the Trudeau phenomenon but have been hampered by a shallow understanding of Canadian politics.

Reporting on foreign nations is inevitably clouded with stereotype, metaphor and cliche. In Canada’s case, this means framing the country as a Scandinavia-like beacon of progressivism in contrast to its backward neighbor. Trudeau’s flair for showy virtue-signaling — beginning with his “because it’s 2015” quip at his inauguration — offered reliable fodder for outside journalists filling holes in pre-written scripts. As populist conservatives won power elsewhere, obsequious praise was heaped on Trudeau for his “lonely defense of liberal values.”

The irritating omnipresence of these flavors of Trudeau coverage made it easy to ignore a third category: the Canadian political press.

Go back and revisit the domestic political commentary that greeted Trudeau’s meteoric ascension to the prime ministership, and you’ll be struck by two themes: extraordinary hostility to Trudeau’s Conservative predecessor, Stephen Harper, and extreme apprehension about the skills and talents of Trudeau himself.

“Justin Trudeau may have the heady combination of external charisma and internal strength, but we don’t know whether he has the discipline, the knowledge, the moxie to face down the mega-ton of malice that would come his way,” wrote the Globe and Mail’s Lawrence Martin back in 2012. I’m not sure “even Trudeau knows why he’s running for the leadership of his father’s former party, other than that everybody expects him to,” said the Montreal Gazette’s Don Macpherson.

Andrew Coyne called Trudeau a man with “next to no qualifications for the job” who had “made a virtue of his opacity” and turned his party into a “personality cult.” The similarly ultra-establishment Chantal Hebert at the Toronto Star described a politician in need of “training wheels” who could “only avoid putting his foot in his mouth by sticking to banalities.”

Yet many of these same voices portrayed Harper as such a glowering, scheming, reactionary tyrant that his removal could simultaneously be regarded as a self-evident good. This was a bias in Trudeau’s favor, but not an affirmative endorsement. Few pundits may have believed he deserved to win, but they were near-unanimous that Harper deserved to lose.

If those who make a living talking about Canadian politics have now turned on Trudeau, it may be less a reflection of a broken heart than a rediscovery of old suspicions, given they don’t have Harper to kick around anymore.

Conservatives are savoring their current alliance with the press, but it’s surely unsustainable. As the October election draws closer, it’s easy to imagine a scenario in which Canada’s mostly urban and progressive commentators ultimately conclude that whatever the prime minister’s flaws, he remains less frightening than Tory leader Andrew Scheer. Indeed, even as Trudeau enjoys a wave of bad press, Scheer’s remains arguably worse, with pundits linking him to white supremacy, religious bigotry and Islamophobia.

Canada’s journalists have proved capable of being anti-Trudeau. What’s less clear is if they have the capacity to be fair to a Conservative in the moment that matters.

The Conservative leader repeated, word for word, the March 29 statement that prompted Trudeau’s lawyer, Julian Porter, to send him notice of a potential libel suit.

For good measure, Scheer did it outside the House of Commons – making the point that he’s not trying to hide behind parliamentary privilege that protects anything said in the chamber from lawsuits.

“I’m not withdrawing my remarks. In fact, I’m standing by them and I repeated them outside of the House of Commons,” Scheer told Trudeau during question period a short time later.

“Will he have the backbone to stand by his threats and show up in court to fight this case?”

Trudeau did not respond directly to Scheer’s repeated taunts but he didn’t withdraw the threat either.

“We put (Scheer) on notice because he and his party have a history of making false and defamatory statements,” the prime minister said.

“We won’t stand by while he continues to mislead Canadians.”

Trudeau then accused Scheer of flogging the SNC-Lavalin issue to deflect attention from his own failure to distance himself from white supremacists or to produce plans for the economy and the environment.

He referred to Scheer’s repeated refusal to denounce “by name” Faith Goldy, a white nationalist political commentator who was banned by Facebook this week. She was one of the speakers at a pro-pipeline protest on Parliament Hill in February that included some anti-immigrant, white nationalist extremists. Scheer also spoke to the protesters, showing his support of the oil and gas industry, but he did not denounce the extremists at the time.

Trudeau also demanded Scheer denounce Conservative Sen. Leo Housakos, “a member of his own caucus,” for saying there is no politician in this country “who believes that white supremacy is a threat to our way of life in Canada.”

Scheer dismissed the ploy as “typical Liberal smear tactics.”

“They know that I have always 100% denounced white supremacy and racism and anyone who promotes those hateful ideologies … This is what is disgusting about this. They are using the very real threat of hatred and racism in this country to cover up their corruption scandal.”

Scheer also maintained that Housakos “withdrew and clarified” his comments. In a series of tweets April 10, Housakos explained that he meant “extremism in ALL forms is a threat to our way of life, not just one or the other.” He was challenging Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland’s assertion that white supremacists and their ilk represent one of the most serious terrorist threats to western democracies.

In the March 29 statement that triggered the lawsuit threat, Scheer accused Trudeau of leading a campaign to interfere with the criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavalin and directing Canada’s former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, to break the law.

Scheer said he stands by “every single word” in that statement, whereas Trudeau’s “falsehoods” in the SNC-Lavalin affair “would be perjury in a court of law.”","Scheer repeats alleged libel, goads Trudeau to sue",plant.ca,https://www.plant.ca/general/scheer-repeats-alleged-libel-goads-trudeau-to-sue-182765/

Unicorn sightings during Question Period are down to zero.

After weeks of being drubbed by the opposition over LavScam, the prime minister is now threatening a lawsuit against Andrew Scheer, his chief detractor in this misbegotten affair. What’s next? Suing Andrew Coyne?

They say drowning people will clutch at anything. But a threatened lawsuit against Scheer? The Michelin Tire Man is more menacing than the leader of the Official Opposition. This guy edits his tweets when he gets a paper airplane thrown his way.

And didn’t this PM promise a new, open way of doing politics? Dumping MPs who won’t bend to his will, effectively firing a cabinet minister who didn’t take the hint on a big file, shutting down the justice committee investigation of this travesty, and now waving a libel action around does not exactly conjure up sunny ways.

Having already claimed two star female federal cabinet ministers, the clerk of the privy council, and the PM’s principal secretary, it appears the next victim of LavScam could be Justin Trudeau himself. And all because one way or another, the PM seems determined to spare SNC-Lavalin a criminal conviction for its alleged bribery and corruption in Libya. Why?

That remains the biggest mystery in Canada. On so many levels, Trudeau’s puzzling advocacy for the Quebec engineering firm is a dog that won’t hunt. Four related questions persist:

1. Why didn’t no mean no?

For starters, the judicial officers whose sole task it is to decide who gets prosecuted and who doesn’t have done their jobs.

The director of public prosecutions (DPP), decided that the company did not qualify for “remediation” under a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA). The attorney general of the day agreed.

If it had qualified, SNC-Lavalin would have been spared a possible criminal conviction for its activities in Libya. It could then continue to bid on federal contracts in Canada, as opposed to facing a 10-year ban.

It already operates under such a ban on all World Bank-financed projects in the wake of widespread corruption scandals in other countries, including Cambodia and Bangladesh.

The irony here? SNC-Lavalin has pleaded not guilty in the criminal process now underway in Quebec on the Libya charges. But one of the key conditions of qualifying for remediation, which the company badly wants, includes the admission of guilt. Go figure.

In his zeal to go to bat for SNC-Lavalin, Trudeau appears to have forgotten a few things about the justice system — apart from the fact he and his minions have no business interfering in a decision by the DPP, which is by law an independent office.

DPAs are not like birth certificates. Not everyone gets one. In the U.S., DPAs have been around for 20 years and they get handed out like hot dogs at a Little League game. In the U.K., they were only introduced five years ago, and are rare legal outcomes. The new Canadian law comes with disqualifying conditions that preclude remediation. The DPP cited three of them in turning SNC-Lavalin down for a DPA in the Libya prosecution:

The nature and gravity of the company’s alleged activities; the involvement of senior officers of the company in said activities; and the failure to self-report. Reporting after the RCMP is already on the case is not self-reporting; it is covering ass.

Take that first disqualifier. Not even the PM could argue that the charges and allegations SNC-Lavalin is facing are the stuff of a fine, a stern talking to, and some corporate quiet time:

Forty-eight million dollars in bribes to various public officials in Libya, including, Saadi Gadhafi; picking up the tab for Saadi’s Canadian Debauchery Tour, and re-decorating his luxury, fortieth-floor penthouse overlooking Lake Ontario that the United Nations still doesn’t know what to do with.

According to court filings, Canada’s DPP, Kathleen Roussel, offered the above three disqualifications. The occasion was SNC-Lavalin’s second bid to get the Federal Court to agree that it should have been afforded remediation to avoid prosecution on criminal charges.

The company’s first attempt was thrown out. The court confirmed that prosecutorial discretion is not subject to judicial review, period. The PM obviously didn’t get the memo.

2. Why no alarm about SNC’s murderous client?

Trudeau also seems to have forgotten another thing — just what sort of “family” SNC-Lavalin had been dealing with in Libya for years, right up to the civil war in that country that ended in the fall of the regime and Moammar Gadhafi’s gruesome death.

It was the Gadhafi regime that gave the world Lockerbie — the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, killing all 259 people onboard and 11 others on the ground. And according to a CIA report declassified in 2011, it was the Gadhafi regime that exported terror through groups like Abu Nidal. And it was on orders of Papa Gadhafi that Libyan dissidents living abroad were targeted for assassination.

It is worth noting that one of the reasons a DPA can be denied in Canada is if the act or omission that forms the basis of the offence was committed “for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with, a criminal organization or terrorist group.”

The Gadhafis? Hmmm.

While Canada was leading a NATO bombing campaign in Libya in 2011, officers of SNC-Lavalin were allegedly putting the wife of Saadi Gadhafi on the payroll. That information came in court documents from the company’s former executive vice president, Riadh Ben Aissa. The former SNC-Lavalin high roller ended up in a Swiss jail after pleading guilty to fraud, corruption, and money-laundering charges. He is now a cooperating witness for the RCMP in the Libya criminal case in Quebec.

Though the company now says Ben Aissa was a “rogue” executive who was secretly sympathetic to the Gadhafi regime, it was this same executive who secured billions of dollars in contracts in Libya and North Africa for SNC-Lavalin. Ben Aissa was one of the company’s top wage earners.

3. Why be soft on the scourge of bribery?

In addition to some of the finer points of the law, Trudeau seems to have forgotten another important matter: Canada’s signature on the Anti-Bribery Convention. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has not.

The OECD is desperate to stamp out corruption in international business deals — in which a staggering $1 trillion a year is paid out in bribes. Forty-four countries are party to the agreement, including Canada. The poorest countries are the worst victims of such corruption — the ones Trudeau said he would do a better job for when he came to power.

Now the OECD says it is “concerned” about allegations of political interference in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin and will “closely monitor” how the scandal develops. No wonder. Here’s what Article 5 of the Anti-Bribery Convention sets out:

“As a Party to the Anti-Bribery Convention, Canada is fully committed to comply with the Convention, which requires prosecutorial independence in foreign bribery cases pursuant to Article 5. In addition, political factors, such as a country’s national economic interest, and the identity of the alleged perpetrator, must not influence foreign bribery investigations and prosecutions.”

It seems obvious that the Trudeau government has already violated the Anti-Bribery Convention by citing possible job losses as a reason to decriminalize SNC-Lavalin’s case. And the OECD is not Trudeau’s only problem on the international scene. There is also the new deal to replace NAFTA.

Prominent amongst the 34 chapters, 11 annexes, and 12 side-letters of the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement is an entire chapter devoted to robust anti-corruption measures.

The bottom line is that parties to this new deal agree to establish criminal offences under the law for corruption in both the public and the private sector. The goal is to tackle corruption, not push it out of bounds along the sideline and return to the huddle, as Trudeau has done.

4. Why squander the ‘transparent’ high ground?

The PM’s final bit of amnesia? These words from his mandate letter to his minister of international development back in 2015:

“It’s time to shine more light on government... Government and its information should be open by default... It is important that we acknowledge mistakes when we make them... Canadians do not expect us to be perfect — they always expect us to be honest, open and sincere...”

She appealed to Speaker Geoff Regan to rule that their rights had been denied and their privileges as members of Parliament breached on the basis of the 2015 Reform Act, which set rules around the administration of party caucuses.

“This matter is urgent. … Procedural fairness and the rule of law demand this. Secret in-camera meetings or private notices should not be a shield to prevent the upholding of the law and members’ rights,” Philpott told the Commons.

“This is very concerning. It speaks to the rule of law at the heart of our democracy,” Conservative MP Michael Chong, who authored the Reform Act, told the National Post in an interview shortly after she made her arguments. So what exactly is this latest foofaraw all about?

How did the ouster from caucus go down last week?

In a brief speech last Tuesday Trudeau announced his decision to remove Philpott and Wilson-Raybould from caucus after both resigned from cabinet in the wake of the SNC-Lavalin scandal. Wilson-Raybould testified that Trudeau and his top officials tried pressuring her, for political reasons, to cut a deal for Montreal engineering firm SNC-Lavalin so it could avoid criminal prosecution for fraud and bribery.

Both initially stayed members of the Liberal caucus, citing their faith in the party’s policies despite a lack of confidence in the prime minister’s handling of the affair.

But Trudeau said last week the caucus has lost “trust” in the two former ministers. “We’ve taken every effort to address their concerns but ultimately if they can’t honestly say that they have confidence in this team despite weeks of testimony, face-to-face conversations and phone calls with myself and other members of caucus, then they cannot be part of this team.”

Trudeau announced the decision as his own, and Philpott argued Tuesday Liberal MPs never had a chance to have their say — even though the Parliament of Canada Act was amended in 2015, with Chong’s Reform Act, so that these types of situations could be avoided.

What exactly does the Reform Act say about this?

The Reform Act, which amended the Canada Elections Act and the Parliament of Canada Act, spells out rules around expulsions and readmissions of caucus members, the election or removal of caucus chairs, leadership reviews and the election of interim leaders.

The act requires caucuses, after each general election, to hold four votes on whether or not a majority of MPs in each party wants to abide by the rules it sets out on its four topics. If they reject the rules, then they do not need to follow them.

On expulsions, here are the rules that parties can opt in to, or not: A member of caucus can only be expelled, according to the Reform Act, if “the caucus chair has received a written notice signed by at least 20 per cent of the members of the caucus requesting that the member’s membership be reviewed” and if “the expulsion of the member is approved by secret ballot by a majority of all caucus members.”

Neither of those things happened in this case. Philpott said if the Reform Act rules were followed, it would have taken a recorded vote in which 90 Liberal MPs voted to expel her and Wilson-Raybould — yet no such vote took place. “We were expelled prior to the commencement of the Liberal caucus meeting,” she argued in the House Tuesday.

Did Liberals ever vote on the provisions in the Reform Act?

The answer to this question would go a long way to settling whether Liberals did anything to violate the law.

If Liberal MPs never had a chance to vote on opting into the Reform Act rules, as Philpott alleged in the House, that would inherently be an “illegal act,” argued Chong. “I’ve been concerned about it for three-and-a-half years,” he said, since the Liberals reportedly held their first caucus meeting without recording votes and reporting results to the Speaker, which the law required them to do. “It’s now come to fruition with the two questionable expulsions last week.”

But Liberals said on Tuesday that they had followed the rules. Kevin Lamoureux, the parliamentary secretary to the government House leader, told the Commons that “over three years ago,” the chair of the national Liberal caucus, Francis Scarpaleggia, sent a letter to the speaker outlining the caucus’s decisions not to have the Reform Act provisions apply.

“Given the fact that the Liberal caucus did not adopt these provisions, the points raised by the honourable Member on this issue are moot,” said Lamoureux.

Lamoureux said the only requirement, which the caucus met, was for Liberals to inform the speaker of “the results of the caucus decisions.” But the law actually stipulates that they communicate “the outcome of each vote.”

Lamoureux did not address whether individual, recorded votes were held on each element of the Reform Act, nor whether the votes occurred at the Liberals’ first caucus meeting after the election, both required under the law. Philpott is alleging that neither happened.

The House leader’s office referred questions about whether votes were actually held to Scarpaleggia, who told the Post caucus confidentiality means he can’t discuss whether individual votes occurred.

So, does Philpott have a point?

What she’s arguing is that Trudeau breached the privileges of his Liberal MPs by not allowing them to vote on the administration of their own caucus back in November 2015, after the federal election, in accordance with the law. As a result, she is arguing, Philpott’s and Wilson-Raybould’s privileges were breached when Trudeau made a unilateral decision to remove them. And the rights of the entire Liberal caucus were breached because they didn’t have an opportunity to vote on that decision by secret ballot.

Chong said Philpott spoke with him about the topic before going ahead with her arguments on Tuesday morning, and he told the Post he is fully on board with them.

“This point of privilege she has raised is vitally important because if there is no recourse here to enforce the rights of members, there is no other place,” he said. Courts have repeatedly ruled they do not have jurisdiction over matters of parliamentary administration, so he believes this is the only way for it to be enforced. The Reform Act also specifically states that caucus decisions aren’t subject to judicial review.

“The only recourse we have to uphold the rule of law and to ensure that the law is followed in the House of Commons, its parliamentary parties and committees, is in the House of Commons and by appealing to the speaker,” Chong said.

But Philippe Lagassé, a procedure expert at the University of Ottawa, said the whole thing seems more like a question around the legal interpretation of the Parliament of Canada Act rather than a matter of parliamentary privilege.

“I don’t see how this is a point of privilege in the traditional sense,” he said. If Liberal MPs didn’t vote in favour of opting in to the Reform Act rules, then they wouldn’t be bound to them, “and since the courts can’t review, I’m not sure who would enforce this,” he added.

What has the speaker said about this?

Two weeks ago, a Conservative MP raised similar issues when he complained that it seemed MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes had resigned from the Liberal caucus because she was forced out. Had the Reform Act rules been in place, he argued, there would’ve had to have been a vote.

“If you, Mr. Speaker, decline to exercise jurisdiction to entertain breaches of the statute here, then members of caucuses, like the Liberal caucus who flagrantly ignore the law, have no protection and no recourse when their rights are trampled. Because of the lack of judicial recourse, general restraint on speakers interpreting the law and the House’s privilege to manage internal affairs, I respectfully submit that the way forward, indeed the only way forward, is to allow the House to deal with this matter,” John Nater argued.

Caesar-Chavannes ultimately confirmed that she had left of her own accord. And the speaker had come back on Monday, the day before Philpott made her arguments, with a ruling that he didn’t have the jurisdiction anyway.

As relayed by Deputy Speaker Bruce Stanton, Regan’s ruling said asking the House to deal with an expulsion from caucus was “not a proper subject for a question of privilege.” Further, “I as speaker have no role in the interpretation of statute nor in the conduct of these 2015 provisions.”

Philpott acknowledged that ruling on Tuesday morning. “But with respect it is our view that this does not relieve you of your responsibility to ensure that all members are aware of their rights in this place. This is our privilege. Accordingly, a remedy is required for our situation,” she said. Regan responded: “While I am left with the difficulty, as I said in my ruling yesterday, that the speaker does not have power to enforce statutes, I will certainly consider her argument and come back to the House.”

So now what happens?

The House will have to wait for Regan to come back with an opinion on the issue. If he does find a prima facie breach of privilege, which Lagassé found unlikely, Philpott will be able to move that the matter be referred to a parliamentary committee.

Liberals have a majority in the House and on committees — including the two committees that recently decided not to pursue any further investigation of the SNC-Lavalin issue.

Asked whether he’s hopeful that some of them will vote to look at what happened here, Chong said, “We have to try. We can’t give up. … I hope that our House of Commons is strong enough to adjudicate this and to seek justice.”

Before the parade, there will be kirtan (singing of hymns) from 7 to 9 a.m. at the gurdwara with reception for dignitaries from 9 to 9:30 a.m. and speeches from 9:30 to 10:30 a.m. There will be Ardas at 10:45 a.m.

The parade will proceed south from the Ross Street Temple on Ross Street to Marine Drive, then west to Main Street, turning east on 49th Avenue to Fraser Street, then south to 57th Avenue and west to Ross Street.

The Khalsa Diwan Society notes: “Vaisakhi is a very important day for Sikhs and one of the most colourful events in the Sikh calendar. It occurs during mid-April every year and traditionally concurs in Punjab with the first harvesting of the crops for the year. So, historically, it has been a very joyous occasion and a time for celebration. Since 1699, it has marked the very significant religious event of the creation of the Khalsa.”

“The Khalsa Diwan Society is a pioneer Sikh society which took root on July 22, 1902 and was formally established in 1906. In 1908, the Society purchased and built the first Sikh Gurdwara at 1866 West 2nd Avenue, Vancouver, BC. This Gurdwara served the community until 1970 when the new Ross Street location was opened.

No other ...","The expulsion of Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott from the Liberal caucus is a great wrong, and would be whether it were legal or not. It is wrong because they did nothing to deserve such treatment, and wrong because it should not be up to the leader — and make no mistake, this was Justin Trudeau’s decision — to decide the fate of members of Parliament in this way.

No other parliamentary democracy makes unswerving loyalty to the leader a condition of membership in caucus, possibly because no other parliamentary democracy gives the leader such powers to enforce his dominion. Canadian party leaders are too powerful in a dozen different ways, but this is the most egregious.

Still, the matter would take on an altogether different hue if party or leader had actually broken any laws. Have they?

In one respect, yes, clearly. Section 49.8 of the Parliament of Canada Act states, without equivocation, that any party caucus with 12 or more members “shall” vote at their first meeting after each election to decide whether each of a number of other sections of the Act should apply to them — among them, a rule stating that caucus members can only be expelled by a vote of a majority of the caucus in a secret ballot.

The Liberals, it is equally clear, never held a vote on this, or any of the others — prescribing a similar vote of caucus as the process for, variously, the election or removal of the caucus chair, the removal of the party leader, and the election of an interim leader. For the last three and a half years, in other words, the party has been in open violation of the law — a law, what is more, that its members voted for.

The relevant sections were passed into law in 2015 as part of the Reform Act, a private member’s bill sponsored by Conservative MP Michael Chong. At its introduction the bill had the ostentatious public support of all of the party leaders, including Trudeau, even as behind the scenes they were ordering that it be watered down in various ways.

Even then they were not satisfied. To save the bill Chong was forced to insert that peculiar provision requiring each caucus to vote whether or not to empower itself in the ways prescribed — only not, as in the other votes, by a secret ballot, but by a “recorded” vote, meaning party leaders would be fully aware of which members of caucus had voted which way. It was an episode of surpassing cynicism.

And still, after all that, the Liberals couldn’t be bothered. (The NDP was better, but still failed to comply fully with the law: the vote of caucus did not take place until the following year. Only the Conservatives held the vote in the manner prescribed.) Attempts by some Liberals to pretend caucus “decided” by some means other than a vote insult the intelligence.

So all right, by not holding that vote of caucus — the vote on whether caucus should have the power to vote on the other matters — the Liberals clearly broke the law. Does that mean they broke the law last Tuesday? That’s not so clear. Chong argues that the Reform Act, even with the caucus opt-in proviso, brought these questions within the ambit of the written law, effectively wiping the slate clean of whatever conventions had previously applied.

Unless a caucus actually votes to opt out of its provisions — well, it’s not clear they apply even then. But it’s not clear they don’t. In Chong’s words we are in “uncharted territory,” meaning the leader’s power to make such decisions is at least in doubt. (Erin Weir, the NDP MP expelled by his leader last year for failing to read “non-verbal cues” in social situations, has made similar arguments.) If we can’t say Trudeau broke the law, neither can we say he abided by it.

The opposing view is that, unless caucus specifically votes to opt in to a particular provision, it doesn’t apply. Since there is no default rule in the law laying out what happens in the event a caucus fails to opt in — whether because a majority of its members vote to opt out, or because they don’t vote at all — nothing happens: the status quo rules.

Who’s right? Ordinarily, the matter would be decided by the courts, or some other adjudicator. In this case, there doesn’t seem to be any. The courts are extremely loath to intervene in any matter to do with the internal workings of Parliament, while the Speaker of the House, who does have some authority in Parliament, has declined to rule in similar situations — rightly or wrongly — on the grounds that it is not his role to interpret statutes.

This is highly unsatisfactory. Even if no laws were broken in the present exercise of the leader’s power, they plainly were with regard to the broader question of whether the leader should have that power at all. And yet, absent any penalty for non-compliance in the legislation, and absent any authority to enforce it, party and leader are free to ignore the law as they please.

Which, considering the whole controversy that led to the expulsions was over the leader’s failure to respect the rule of law, is more than a little ironic.

The Conservative leader repeated, word for word, the March 29 statement that prompted Trudeau's lawyer, Julian Porter, to send him notice of a potential libel suit.

For good measure, Scheer did it outside the House of Commons — making the point that he's not trying to hide behind parliamentary privilege that protects anything said in the chamber from lawsuits.

""I'm not withdrawing my remarks. In fact, I'm standing by them and I repeated them outside of the House of Commons,"" Scheer told Trudeau during question period a short time later.

""Will he have the backbone to stand by his threats and show up in court to fight this case?""

Trudeau did not respond directly to Scheer's repeated taunts but he didn't withdraw the threat either.

""We put (Scheer) on notice because he and his party have a history of making false and defamatory statements,"" the prime minister said.

""We won't stand by while he continues to mislead Canadians.""

Trudeau then accused Scheer of flogging the SNC-Lavalin issue to deflect attention from his own failure to distance himself from white supremacists or to produce plans for the economy and the environment.

He referred to Scheer's repeated refusal to denounce ""by name"" Faith Goldy, a white nationalist political commentator who was banned by Facebook this week. She was one of the speakers at a pro-pipeline protest on Parliament Hill in February that included some anti-immigrant, white nationalist extremists. Scheer also spoke to the protesters, showing his support of the oil and gas industry, but he did not denounce the extremists at the time.

Threat of white supremacy questioned

Trudeau also demanded Scheer denounce Conservative Sen. Leo Housakos, ""a member of his own caucus,"" for saying Tuesday there is no politician in this country ""who believes that white supremacy is a threat to our way of life in Canada.""

Scheer dismissed the ploy as ""typical Liberal smear tactics.""

""They know that I have always 100 per cent denounced white supremacy and racism and anyone who promotes those hateful ideologies ... This is what is disgusting about this. They are using the very real threat of hatred and racism in this country to cover up their corruption scandal.""

Scheer also maintained that Housakos ""withdrew and clarified"" his comments. In a series of tweets Wednesday, Housakos explained that he meant ""extremism in ALL forms is a threat to our way of life, not just one or the other."" He was challenging Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland's assertion that white supremacists and their ilk represent one of the most serious terrorist threats to western democracies.

In the March 29 statement that triggered the lawsuit threat, Scheer accused Trudeau of leading a campaign to interfere with the criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavalin and directing Canada's former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, to break the law.

Scheer said he stands by ""every single word"" in that statement, whereas Trudeau's ""falsehoods"" in the SNC-Lavalin affair ""would be perjury in a court of law.""","Scheer repeats alleged libel, goads Trudeau to follow through on lawsuit threat",CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/scheer-trudeau-snc-lavalin-lawsuit-1.5092652

By reinforcing this message, Justin Trudeau is hoping to maintain the narrative that swept in his progressive government back in 2015.

I’m not sure how successful a strategy that is. For starters, Trudeau has lost much of his early sheen. He is now tainted, both by cynicism and scandal. Furthermore, Scheer, with his pleasant demeanour and boyish grin, hardly evokes the memory of his dour predecessor.

If anything, Scheer is far more similar to a different prime minister. That, of course, would be the Rt. Hon. Joe Clark, who celebrates the 40th anniversary of becoming prime minister this year.

Clark, at the age of 39, became the youngest prime minister in Canadian history. If Scheer is successful in the October federal election, he will be prime minister at age 40.

Both conservative leaders also represent(ed) the western prairies – High River and Regina, respectively.

And of course, both Clark and Scheer exude that quintessential characteristic for which Canadians are known: “niceness.”

Other parallels are more striking.

Prior to becoming leader of Her Majesty’s Opposition, neither Clark nor Scheer maintained long-term careers outside of partisan politics. Instead, both men jumped into the political circus and contested elections while in their 20s. In contrast, many prime ministers established themselves with impressive careers long before Ottawa’s siren call beckoned them forth with the promise of influence and prestige.

For instance, Lester Pearson was a Nobel Prize-winning diplomat prior to his entry into electoral politics. Brian Mulroney, a successful businessman and lawyer. William Lyon Mackenzie King (our only prime minister to have earned a PhD) was an accomplished public servant and labour conciliator. Even Pierre Trudeau, often accused of being something of a dilettante, established himself as a journalist and constitutional professor before throwing his hat into the political arena.

Clark and Scheer also faced struggles to appear statesmanlike. In 1979, Clark sought to improve his credibility in foreign affairs by taking a trip to the Middle East. Alas, the trip proved to be a PR disaster. From his vocal support of Brexit to his outrageous claims that he would have negotiated a better NAFTA agreement, Scheer has similarly proven inept. Notwithstanding Justin Trudeau’s embarrassing trip to India, Scheer has little grounds to criticize the current prime minister on the issue of statesmanship.

Notwithstanding Justin Trudeau’s embarrassing trip to India, Andrew Scheer has little grounds to criticize the current prime minister on the issue of statesmanship.

Furthermore, with questionable policy proposals, as with his promise to allow the Quebec government to collect federal taxes, Scheer is imitating Joe Clark and his view of Canada as a “community of communities.”

But of course, one notable difference remains between the two men. Where Scheer has been cautious and timid, Clark was bold and daring.

As prime minister, Clark oversaw the resettlement of 60,000 Vietnamese refugees in a very short span of time. The achievement did not go unnoticed. In 1986, citizens of Canada were awarded the Nansen Medal, largely for the efforts of the Clark government to significantly increase refugees into the country.

Other examples include Clark’s efforts to balance the federal budget with tax increases, after a decade of inaction. Or his government’s key role in the rescue of six American diplomats during the Iranian revolution. This, in a tenure as prime minister that lasted just shy of nine months.

As historian Richard Gwyn wrote, “contrary to his public image, Clark in some ways was far bolder than Trudeau.”

In contrast, Andrew Scheer may be many things, but bold he is not.

On the issue of immigration, Scheer has sought to fear-monger with his opposition to the UN’s Global Compact for Migration. On cannabis legalization, he has conveyed no coherent message for or against the Liberal policy. His support of supply management is nothing more than weak-kneed pandering to eastern dairy farmers. And on the existential threat of climate change, Scheer remains firmly opposed to any tax on carbon, and has offered no credible, alternative course of action.

Evidently Scheer believes his strategy of merely lounging about and watching the Liberal Party self-destruct will prove successful.

If Scheer is wise, though, he will take heed of Clark and his boldness. After all, Joe Clark remains the only politician to defeat a Trudeau.

“I do believe it’s a threat in Canada because we have seen, tragically, people lose their lives because of people who subscribe to these views,” Scheer said. “I understand that the senator has issued a clarification … And I absolutely do believe that these types of threats are important for governments of all levels to protect Canadians.” Scheer was responding to a question about Quebec Conservative Sen. Leo Housakos, who suggested Tuesday that white supremacy is not a significant “threat to our way of life, to our communities, to our democracy.”

“With all due respect minister, I think that flies in the face of reality over the last two decades. I think over the last two decades western liberal democracies around the world would tell you that the biggest threats we’ve faced are extremist fundamentalism,” Housakos said. “I can’t identify a single country in the world where governments are supporting white supremacist movements. I can’t identify governments around the world, democratic governments around the world, that are supporting that type of behaviour, certainly not in Canada.”

“I absolutely do think white supremacists and white supremacists movements are a very real, very grave threat to western liberal democracy. I think they are a grave and real threat here in Canada,” Freeland responded. “The shooting in the Quebec City mosque is a tragic Canadian example of the same threat that we face here at home. So I absolutely believe we need to name that, we need to be aware of it, and we need to work hard to find ways to protect our societies and our people from it.” In question period Wednesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau demanded Scheer denounce white supremacy, which the opposition leader had publicly done only hours before in a press conference. But the exchange makes clear that white nationalism and far-right extremism — once a fringe issue in Canada’s political debate — will likely remain front and centre in the lead-up to the 2019 election. In March, Trudeau accused unnamed politicians of exploiting racism for political gain. In a statement on Twitter Wednesday, Scheer shot back. “Racism and white supremacy are threats in Canada and I condemn them unequivocally,” Scheer’s statement read. “It is pathetic and disgusting that Liberals are inflaming these threats to divide Canadians and score cheap points.” An aide for Housakos declined the Star’s request for an interview Wednesday afternoon, pointing to the senator’s comments on Twitter. “No western, democratic politician condones extremism of any kind, including white supremacy,” he wrote Wednesday after Freeland released a video of their exchange. “Extremism in all forms is a threat to our way of life, not just one (form) or the other.” Alex Boutilier is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

Members of Parliament are protected from legal action for defamation over statements they make in the House, but not outside it.

In Question Period, Mr. Trudeau did not directly address Mr. Scheer’s efforts to provoke the lawsuit. He attacked Mr. Scheer’s credibility, saying the Conservatives ""have a history of making false and defamatory statements,” and accusing the Conservative Leader of refusing to disavow white supremacists, misleading Canadians on climate change and failing to produce a workable economic plan.

“The Conservatives actually do not want to talk about anything that actually matters to Canadians in their day-to-day lives,” the Prime Minister said.

“What we have, right here, is a political party that does not want to talk about the economy, that does not want to talk about the budget, that does not want to talk about climate change, that just wants to play politics and attack us.""

Mr. Scheer called the white supremacist charge “typical Liberal smear tactics,” saying he has always “denounced white supremacy and racism and anyone who promotes those hateful ideologies.”

Mr. Trudeau did not say whether he planned to follow through on his legal threat. The Prime Minister’s Office declined to comment.

On March 31, Mr. Trudeau’s lawyer, Julian Porter, wrote a letter to Mr. Scheer that he said should be “treated as notice” of possible action under the Libel and Slander Act of Ontario, citing a March 29 news release that he said went “beyond the pale of fair debate and is libelous.”

On Feb. 27, Jody Wilson-Raybould told the Commons Justice committee that as attorney-general she faced “consistent and sustained” pressure from Mr. Trudeau and top officials, including “veiled threats,” on the need to shelve the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. Ms. Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott quit cabinet over the government’s handling of the matter.

Mr. Scheer said on Wednesday he would welcome a battle in court after Liberal-dominated parliamentary committees shut down further hearings into the SNC-Lavalin affair. He said a lawsuit could result in an ""an inquiry where Justin Trudeau does not control the proceedings, where he won’t be able to use his majority to shut down an investigation.”

Separately, a former director and chair of the audit committee of the Federal Liberal Agency of Canada, Elbert Paul, told The Globe and Mail he supports Ms. Philpott’s contention that the Liberals broke federal law in the process that led to her expulsion and that of Ms. Wilson-Raybould from the party caucus. On Tuesday, Ms. Philpott asked Commons Speaker Geoff Regan to rule on the matter, including whether it breached the two MPs’ privileges.

“The conduct of Prime Minister Trudeau was a breach of parliamentary rights of the members and was an an ad hoc and arbitrary action,” Mr. Paul said in a statement. “It also deepens Canadians’ profound concern over his failure to establish a public inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin scandal,” he said. He was director of the federal Liberal agency between 1986 and 2016.

At the heart of Ms. Philpott’s argument is that, after the 2015 federal election, the Liberal caucus did not conduct a recorded vote, as required under the Parliament of Canada Act, to decide whether to adopt a set of rules governing the expulsion of caucus members and other matters.

Story continues below advertisement

Liberal MP John McKay has said “there was no vote” when the Liberal caucus met after the 2015 election to decide how to proceed with the rules.

Ms. Philpott says this means the caucus never voted to adopt the rules, including one that said 20 per cent of a caucus must submit written notice to review an MP’s membership, and that MPs can be ejected only if a majority of all caucus members vote to do so in a secret ballot.

Ms. Philpott has also noted no caucus vote took place before Mr. Trudeau expelled her and Ms. Wilson-Raybould last week. Mr. Trudeau has said he consulted caucus before his decision.

In a press conference outside the House of Commons Wednesday, Scheer said he looks forward to seeing what the Liberal government will propose to bring the ubiquitous social media platforms under more stringent rules. “We do have concerns when we look at the actions of Justin Trudeau and his government in the past using, imposing certain things like the attestation on the summer jobs file,” Scheer said, referring to the Liberals’ requiring groups hiring summer students with federal grants attest they uphold Charter rights. “But we look forward to having a conversation to make sure all levels of society, whether they’re social media platforms or institutions, are doing their part to ensure that people who promote racist ideologies and violent extremism aren’t given a platform.”

“We have to be very careful that we find that proper balance,” Scheer said. A spokesperson for Scheer clarified that the Conservative leader is “open” to the idea of regulations, but won’t pronounce on any until the Liberal government makes clear what they’re proposing.

In an interview with the Star on Monday, Gould said that “all options were on the table” when it comes to regulating things like hate speech, extremist content, and foreign electoral meddling through social platforms. “They see themselves as actors operating on a different level than other companies operating in our society. And I think that is not fair to citizens and to Canadians,” Gould said. “I think that one thing that we need to do, partly government but it’s partly civil society, is to have a much more robust conversation about how these companies operate, what they do with our data, and what the consequences are of that for us as individuals but also collectively.” Alex Boutilier is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

The Conservative leader has repeated, word for word, the March 29 statement that prompted Trudeau’s lawyer, Julian Porter, to send him notice of a potential libel suit.

For good measure, he’s done it outside the House of Commons, so parliamentary privilege won’t protect him.

Scheer accuses Trudeau of leading a campaign to interfere with the criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavalin and directing Canada’s former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, to break the law.

Trudeau says he put Scheer on notice because the Conservatives have a history of making misleading and defamatory statements.

“I think highlighting that there are consequences short-term and long-term when politicians choose to twist the truth and distort reality for Canadians, it’s not something we’re going to put up with,” Trudeau said on his way into a cabinet meeting Tuesday morning.

The potential lawsuit came to light over the weekend when Scheer held a press conference in which he distributed copies of a letter from the prime minister’s lawyer.

The letter to Scheer gave notice of a possible libel lawsuit over a statement the opposition leader issued on the day that Jody Wilson-Raybould’s supplementary statement and audio evidence related to the SNC-Lavalin scandal was released.

In that statement Scheer called Wilson-Raybould’s submission “concrete evidence that proves Justin Trudeau led a campaign to politically interfere in SNC-Lavalin’s criminal prosecution,” and the entire affair “corruption on top of corruption on top of corruption.”

Scheer has said he stands by his comments and welcomes the opportunity for Trudeau to test the case in court, where he’d have to testify under oath about the scandal, something the Conservatives have been calling for.

Trudeau said in French that if Scheer withdraws the statement, he’ll find that satisfactory and would not pursue the lawsuit further.

“I think it’s important that all politicians be straight with Canadians in how they characterize their own actions and their own beliefs. I think we’re going to have an election in the coming months, you can’t be inventing things, you can’t be lying to Canadians,” Trudeau said.

The potential court case dominated question period on Monday. Government House Leader Bardish Chagger fielded the questions in the prime minister’s absence.

By reinforcing this message, Justin Trudeau is hoping to maintain the narrative that swept in his progressive government back in 2015.

I’m not sure how successful a strategy that is. For starters, Trudeau has lost much of his early sheen. He is now tainted, both by cynicism and scandal. Furthermore, Scheer, with his pleasant demeanour and boyish grin, hardly evokes the memory of his dour predecessor.

If anything, Scheer is far more similar to a different prime minister. That, of course, would be the Rt. Hon. Joe Clark, who celebrates the 40th anniversary of becoming prime minister this year.

Clark, at the age of 39, became the youngest prime minister in Canadian history. If Scheer is successful in the October federal election, he will be prime minister at age 40.

Both conservative leaders also represent(ed) the western prairies – High River and Regina, respectively.

And of course, both Clark and Scheer exude that quintessential characteristic for which Canadians are known: “niceness.”

Other parallels are more striking.

Prior to becoming leader of Her Majesty’s Opposition, neither Clark nor Scheer maintained long-term careers outside of partisan politics. Instead, both men jumped into the political circus and contested elections while in their 20s. In contrast, many prime ministers established themselves with impressive careers long before Ottawa’s siren call beckoned them forth with the promise of influence and prestige.

For instance, Lester Pearson was a Nobel Prize-winning diplomat prior to his entry into electoral politics. Brian Mulroney, a successful businessman and lawyer. William Lyon Mackenzie King (our only prime minister to have earned a PhD) was an accomplished public servant and labour conciliator. Even Pierre Trudeau, often accused of being something of a dilettante, established himself as a journalist and constitutional professor before throwing his hat into the political arena.

Clark and Scheer also faced struggles to appear statesmanlike. In 1979, Clark sought to improve his credibility in foreign affairs by taking a trip to the Middle East. Alas, the trip proved to be a PR disaster. From his vocal support of Brexit to his outrageous claims that he would have negotiated a better NAFTA agreement, Scheer has similarly proven inept. Notwithstanding Justin Trudeau’s embarrassing trip to India, Scheer has little grounds to criticize the current prime minister on the issue of statesmanship.

Notwithstanding Justin Trudeau’s embarrassing trip to India, Andrew Scheer has little grounds to criticize the current prime minister on the issue of statesmanship.

Furthermore, with questionable policy proposals, as with his promise to allow the Quebec government to collect federal taxes, Scheer is imitating Joe Clark and his view of Canada as a “community of communities.”

But of course, one notable difference remains between the two men. Where Scheer has been cautious and timid, Clark was bold and daring.

As prime minister, Clark oversaw the resettlement of 60,000 Vietnamese refugees in a very short span of time. The achievement did not go unnoticed. In 1986, citizens of Canada were awarded the Nansen Medal, largely for the efforts of the Clark government to significantly increase refugees into the country.

Other examples include Clark’s efforts to balance the federal budget with tax increases, after a decade of inaction. Or his government’s key role in the rescue of six American diplomats during the Iranian revolution. This, in a tenure as prime minister that lasted just shy of nine months.

As historian Richard Gwyn wrote, “contrary to his public image, Clark in some ways was far bolder than Trudeau.”

In contrast, Andrew Scheer may be many things, but bold he is not.

On the issue of immigration, Scheer has sought to fear-monger with his opposition to the UN’s Global Compact for Migration. On cannabis legalization, he has conveyed no coherent message for or against the Liberal policy. His support of supply management is nothing more than weak-kneed pandering to eastern dairy farmers. And on the existential threat of climate change, Scheer remains firmly opposed to any tax on carbon, and has offered no credible, alternative course of action.

Evidently Scheer believes his strategy of merely lounging about and watching the Liberal Party self-destruct will prove successful.

If Scheer is wise, though, he will take heed of Clark and his boldness. After all, Joe Clark remains the only politician to defeat a Trudeau.

Trudeau's lawyer Julian Porter sent a letter to Scheer on Mar. 31 pointing to what he called ""highly defamatory comments"" the Official Opposition leader had made in a public statement two days earlier. Porter took issue with four sections of the statement, calling it ""beyond the pale of fair debate"" and libellous to Trudeau personally and in his role as prime minister.

Speaking about the threatened lawsuit for the first time today, Trudeau said it's important that all politicians be straight with Canadians in how they characterize their actions and beliefs.

""I think we are going to have an election in the coming months, and you can't be inventing things,"" he said on his way into a cabinet meeting on Parliament Hill.

""You can't be lying to Canadians, and I think highlighting that there are consequences, short-term and long-term, when politicians choose to twist the truth and distort reality for Canadians, it's not something we're going to put up with.""

Scheer held a news conference Sunday — a week after the libel notice — to reveal the threatened lawsuit.

Scheer's March 29 statement, in part, accused the prime minister of political interference, of lying to Canadians and of corrupt conduct in relation to the SNC-Lavalin criminal proceedings.

In a letter sent in response to the threat, Scheer's lawyer Peter Downard called the prime minister's complaint ""entirely without merit.""

'Profoundly disappointing'

""It is profoundly disappointing that the prime minister is seeking to silence debate on matters of such great public importance,"" he wrote. ""Mr. Scheer will not be intimidated.""

Today, Scheer tweeted that he stands by his public statement and posted it again.

""Speaking of distorting reality, does Justin Trudeau still say this story is false? Or that Wilson-Raybould never raised the issue? Looking forward to Trudeau testifying under oath,"" he wrote on Twitter.

Scheer is urging the prime minister to move ahead with the lawsuit because it could shed more light on the SNC-Lavalin matter. Legal proceedings could require Trudeau to testify.

One legal expert told CBC Radio's The Current that while Scheer is essentially daring the prime minister to take him to court, it likely won't happen.

""If you saw his press conference, you couldn't help but notice that the leader of the Opposition was almost salivating with this prospect, because he wants to see the optics of a whole slew of witnesses and discoveries taking place, and emails, letters ..."" Errol Mendes, a professor of constitutional and international law at the University of Ottawa, told host Anna Maria Tremonti.

The poor optics of launching such a trial in an election year mean ""it's probably never going to happen,"" he said.

Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott were expelled from the Liberal caucus last week after they both spoke out about the government's handling of the SNC-Lavalin matter.

Philpott questions expulsion

Today, Philpott rose in the House of Commons on a point of privilege, questioning whether the expulsion process was fair.

The Reform Act, a private member's bill that was championed by Conservative MP Michael Chong and passed before the 2015 federal election, was designed to give MPs more control over their leader, the power to expel and reinstate caucus colleagues and the ability to choose their own caucus chairs.

The law requires that party caucuses vote on whether to adopt those optional provisions at their first meetings after the election. The Liberal caucus did not hold that vote.

""Members of Parliament are not accountable to the leader. The leader is accountable to members of Parliament,"" Philpott said. ""This is a constitutional convention.""

Broad caucus consultations

On his way into question period today, Trudeau said he consulted widely with caucus over the preceding weeks and with the regional caucus chairs in the days before the expulsions.

""The will of caucus was very, very clear, that they wanted the two individuals removed from caucus,"" he said. ""It was my decision to make, but the fact that the caucus was clear and united made my decision easier.""

The NDP says it complied with the vote as required under the Reform Act.

""As is well known, caucus meetings are confidential. But as it pertains to the question of the Reform Act, we fulfilled the requirements of the act,"" NDP MP Brian Masse said in a statement. ""Recorded votes were conducted rejecting all elements and the results were transmitted to the Speaker, as required.""

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau explains that his caucus was clear about its desire to expel Jane Philpott and Jody Wilson-Raybould from its ranks. 0:42

Today, Liberals on the Commons ethics committee blocked two more motions from the Conservatives and the NDP to study the SNC-Lavalin affair. Liberal MPs on the committee already have used their majority to defeat a Conservative motion to launch an inquiry, arguing that the justice committee's work was ongoing and Wilson-Raybould was expected, at that time, to present a written submission.

But Liberal MP Nate Erskine-Smith and the other Liberals said an ethics probe is more appropriately handled by the federal ethics commissioner, who has the tools, resources and mandate to execute it. He also noted that Wilson-Raybould stated in her submission that she had said everything she had to say.

""For us to then undertake and renew this process all over again doesn't strike me as an effective use of our time,"" he said.

Conservative MP Peter Kent said ""huge questions"" remain that the prime minister and some of his top aides should answer.

Scheer revealed Sunday that Trudeau’s lawyer sent him a libel notice late last month, demanding he take back claims the prime minister interfered with the prosecution of Montreal firm SNC-Lavalin and lied to Canadians.

The notice is not an actual lawsuit, just a threat that one might come – a standard first step in a defamation claim.

On Monday, the Conservative leader urged Trudeau to bring it on, saying he’d welcome a lawsuit that would force Trudeau to testify about the affair under oath.

“Canadians are looking forward to the prime minister finally appearing under oath and testifying in a setting that he, himself, cannot control,” Scheer said Monday, repeatedly asking the government to set a date for legal proceedings to begin.

Trudeau says that while people disagree in politics, there are consequences for telling lies about one’s partisan adversaries. He says he would be satisfied if Scheer agrees to retract the comments and apologize.

This would not be the first time Canada’s political parties took legal action over comments made by opponents.

WATCH: Scheer asks Trudeau why the truth gets you kicked out of the Liberal party (Apr. 3)

In 2008, then Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper launched a libel suit against the Liberal party over allegations that he had known about an alleged attempt by Conservatives to bribe independent MP Chuck Cadman in exchange for his support in a key confidence vote in 2005.

The lawsuit made it difficult for then-Liberal leader Stephane Dion to raise the issue during the 2008 election campaign. A few months after the election, which returned Harper’s Conservatives to power with a minority in Parliament, Harper settled the matter out of court with Dion’s successor Michael Ignatieff.

Trudeau called on the Conservative leader to denounce white supremacists by name after a Tory senator's remarks about racism. Scheer accused the prime minister of using ""typical Liberal smear tactics"" to avoid talking about the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Watch Trudeau and Scheer's heated question period exchange:

It was the first question period featuring both leaders since it was revealed Trudeau has threatened a libel suit against Scheer over his allegations that the prime minister politically interfered with SNC-Lavalin's criminal prosecution. The Tory leader repeatedly goaded Trudeau to start court proceedings so that he will testify about the controversy under oath.

The prime minister returned fire by accusing Scheer of being soft on denouncing racism.

""On Monday, the Conservative leader refused to denounce white supremacists in this House,"" Trudeau said, referencing how the Government House leader claimed Scheer has an ""affiliation"" with Faith Goldy.

Liberal MPs pounced on Facebook's decision to ban Goldy this week over racist videos that violated its new policy; they blasted Scheer for having spoken at a rally in February that featured members of ""Yellow Vests Canada."" The populist group is known for promoting anti-immigrant sentiments.

Goldy also addressed protesters that day, but not at the same time or from the same stage as the Tory leader.

""On Tuesday, a Conservative senator said 'I would find it disturbing to believe that there's a politician in this country that believes that white supremacy is a threat to our way of life in Canada,'"" Trudeau said.

The prime minister asked when Scheer will ""finally denounce white supremacists by name"" and the comments from Conservative Sen. Leo Housakos.

Scheer responded: ""I have always 100 per cent denounced white supremacy and racism and anyone who promotes those hateful ideologies."" Scheer responded, adding that Housakos withdrew and clarified his remarks.

""And this is what is so disgusting about this. They are using the very real threat of hatred and racism in this country to cover up their corruption scandal,"" Scheer said of the Liberals and their leader. ""That is disgusting and he should answer for it.""

I've spoken with Sen. Housakos and he has clarified his comments. Racism and white supremacy are threats in Canada and I condemn them unequivocally. It is pathetic and disgusting that Liberals are inflaming these threats to divide Canadians and score cheap points. — Andrew Scheer (@AndrewScheer) April 10, 2019

The exchange sparked a ruckus with shouting on both sides of the chamber.

""It's not a political thing though. It's real,"" Independent MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes could be heard yelling. Caesar-Chavannes, a former Liberal MP, is one of the few black MPs in the House.

She called the exchange ""shameful"" in a tweet that has since been deleted. HuffPost Canada has reached out to the Whitby MP for further comment.

Trudeau responded that he seemed to have ""hit a nerve in the way Conservatives are misleading Canadians on intolerance,"" before then accusing Tory MPs of not being straight with Canadians on the new carbon-tax rebate in four provinces.

White supremacy 'a grave and real threat' in Canada: Freeland

White supremacism came up in question period after Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland shared a clip of her exchange with Housakos during a Senate committee meeting Tuesday.

Trudeau and other top Liberals, including Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussein, also shared the video with comments directed at Scheer and his party.

The Quebec senator had asked Freeland to clarify comments she made at the United Nations last month, calling white supremacism and Islamophobia among the ""gravest threats"" currently facing the world.

""With all due respect, minister, I think that flies in the face of reality over the last two decades,"" Housakos said, citing ""extremist fundamentalism"" to be a top concern to Western liberal democracies.

Watch the full exchange:

The foreign affairs minister doubled down, calling white supremacists and their associated movements ""a grave and real threat here in Canada."" Freeland brought up the deadly mosque shootings in Quebec City and Christchurch, New Zealand.

""I absolutely believe that as a minister of a white-majority country, of a Christian-majority country — I'm Christian myself — that there is a special responsibility to stand up and to denounce this ideology,"" she said.

Housakos responded to the clip on Twitter by calling it an attempt to ""further divide Canadians.""

OTTAWA — Andrew Scheer is challenging Justin Trudeau to follow through on a threat to sue him over his assertion that the prime minister politically interfered with the criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavlin.

The Conservative leader revealed Sunday that he received a letter on March 31 from Trudeau's lawyer, Julian Porter, threatening a libel suit.

""I stand by every single criticism I have made of Mr. Trudeau's conduct in regards to this scandal, including those Mr. Trudeau's lawyer cites in his letter,"" Scheer told a news conference.

""If Mr. Trudeau intends to pursue this course of legal action, if he believes he has a case against me, I urge him to do so immediately. This is an urgent matter of public interest and it deserves to be heard in a legal setting where Liberals do not control the proceedings.""

Scheer said he looks forward to Trudeau testifying ""for hours"" under oath in open court.

That said, Scheer made it clear he believes Trudeau is bluffing. He called the threatened lawsuit ""a bullying attempt"" to prevent the official Opposition from doing its constitutional duty to hold the government to account and a continuation of Trudeau's attempts to ""silence those who stand up to Justin Trudeau and who seek the truth"" — just as he tried to silence former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould, Scheer said.

In a statement, the Prime Minister's Office said Scheer and his party ""have repeatedly made false and defamatory statements. We put him on notice that there are consequences for making completely false and libellous statements.""

Wilson-Raybould maintains she was inappropriately pressured last fall by the Prime Minister's Office to stop criminal proceedings against SNC-Lavalin on bribery charges related to contracts in Libya. She believes she was moved to Veterans Affairs in a mid-January cabinet shuffle as punishment for refusing to override the director of public prosecutions, who had decided not to negotiate a remediation agreement, a type of plea bargain, with the company. She resigned from cabinet a month later.

Last week, Trudeau expelled both Wilson-Raybould and fellow former cabinet minister Jane Philpott from the Liberal caucus. Philpott had resigned from cabinet in early March, citing a loss of confidence in the government's handling of the SNC-Lavalin case.

At issue in the threatened libel suit is a statement Scheer issued on March 29 in which he said documentation provided by Wilson-Raybould to the House of Commons justice committee — including a surreptitiously recorded phone conversation with the clerk of the Privy Council, Michael Wernick — is ""concrete evidence that proves Justin Trudeau led a campaign to politically interfere with SNC-Lavalin's criminal prosecution.""

Porter called the statement ""highly defamatory.""

""The prime minister supports wide-ranging and vigorous political debate on matters of public policy,"" he said in his letter to Scheer. ""However, your statement, in its entirety, is beyond the pale of fair debate and is libellous of my client personally and in the way of his occupation as prime minister.""

Porter said it's ""entirely false"" to say Trudeau interfered in the SNC prosecution, which has not been halted, or that he personally directed Wilson-Raybould to ""break the law"" and ""fired"" her when she refused. It's also entirely false to suggest Trudeau was aware of Wilson-Raybould's concern that he was politically interfering in the SNC case but lied to Canadians about it, Porter said.

Scheer's statement that the affair amounts to ""corruption on top of corruption on top of corruption"" was meant to suggest that Trudeau ""had engaged in dishonest and corrupt conduct that would contravene the Criminal Code,"" a crime deserving of up to 14 years in prison, Porter said. That too was ""entirely false.""

Undeterred, Scheer repeated that phrase twice during his news conference Sunday.

While Conservatives have embraced every other aspect of Wilson-Raybould's testimony as the absolute truth, they have not accepted her conclusion that nothing illegal occurred.

""That was her opinion on that,"" said Scheer, noting that he's asked the RCMP to investigate whether any laws were broken. He said he's not heard anything from the RCMP other than an acknowledgment of his Feb. 28 request for an investigation.

Scheer's lawyer, Peter Downard, wrote back to Porter on Sunday, saying that Scheer ""will not be intimidated."" If Trudeau is serious about suing, Downard said he must immediately take steps to preserve all relevant documents and to notify all members of his government, past and present, who've been involved in the SNC-Lavalin matter that they can expect to be called to testify.

If Trudeau does not proceed with the threatened lawsuit, Downard said Scheer will conclude that Trudeau ""has properly acknowledged that Mr. Scheer's statements were appropriate and grounded in evidence before the Canadian people.""

The Conservative leader repeated, word for word, the March 29 statement that prompted Trudeau’s lawyer, Julian Porter, to send him notice of a potential libel suit.

For good measure, Scheer did it outside the House of Commons – making the point that he’s not trying to hide behind parliamentary privilege that protects anything said in the chamber from lawsuits.

“I’m not withdrawing my remarks. In fact, I’m standing by them and I repeated them outside of the House of Commons,” Scheer told Trudeau during question period a short time later.

“Will he have the backbone to stand by his threats and show up in court to fight this case?”

Trudeau did not respond directly to Scheer’s repeated taunts but he didn’t withdraw the threat either.

“We put (Scheer) on notice because he and his party have a history of making false and defamatory statements,” the prime minister said.

“We won’t stand by while he continues to mislead Canadians.”

Trudeau then accused Scheer of flogging the SNC-Lavalin issue to deflect attention from his own failure to distance himself from white supremacists or to produce plans for the economy and the environment.

He referred to Scheer’s repeated refusal to denounce “by name” Faith Goldy, a white nationalist political commentator who was banned by Facebook this week. She was one of the speakers at a pro-pipeline protest on Parliament Hill in February that included some anti-immigrant, white nationalist extremists. Scheer also spoke to the protesters, showing his support of the oil and gas industry, but he did not denounce the extremists at the time.

Trudeau also demanded Scheer denounce Conservative Sen. Leo Housakos, “a member of his own caucus,” for saying there is no politician in this country “who believes that white supremacy is a threat to our way of life in Canada.”

Scheer dismissed the ploy as “typical Liberal smear tactics.”

“They know that I have always 100% denounced white supremacy and racism and anyone who promotes those hateful ideologies … This is what is disgusting about this. They are using the very real threat of hatred and racism in this country to cover up their corruption scandal.”

Scheer also maintained that Housakos “withdrew and clarified” his comments. In a series of tweets April 10, Housakos explained that he meant “extremism in ALL forms is a threat to our way of life, not just one or the other.” He was challenging Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland’s assertion that white supremacists and their ilk represent one of the most serious terrorist threats to western democracies.

In the March 29 statement that triggered the lawsuit threat, Scheer accused Trudeau of leading a campaign to interfere with the criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavalin and directing Canada’s former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, to break the law.

Scheer said he stands by “every single word” in that statement, whereas Trudeau’s “falsehoods” in the SNC-Lavalin affair “would be perjury in a court of law.”","Scheer repeats alleged libel, goads Trudeau to sue",plant.ca,https://www.plant.ca/general/scheer-repeats-alleged-libel-goads-trudeau-to-sue-182765/

The proposed law would prevent asylum seekers from making claims in Canada if they have made similar ones in certain other countries, including the United States. Scheer said its inclusion in the omnibus legislation limits opportunities for study and debate.

“This is a measure that has been slipped into an omnibus bill, that will not be given the scrutiny it deserves on its own,” he told reporters Wednesday.

Lawyers and refugee advocates are furious at the Trudeau Liberals over the move, saying they were blindsided by the measure tucked into the budget bill, calling it an attack of refugee rights in the country.

Under the provision, asylum seekers deemed ineligible to make claims in Canada will not have the legal right to have their claims heard by an independent tribunal or court. Instead, they will undergo pre-removal risk assessments on whether it’s safe to send them back to their countries of origin.

Border Security Minister Bill Blair said the measure is aimed at preventing “asylum shopping.”

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday defended the proposed changes, saying his government’s priority is to ensure Canadians “can continue to have confidence in our asylum system.”

“We need to recognize that there are larger numbers now than before because of global instability in terms of refugees,” he said. “That’s why we’re putting more resources and we’re also ensuring that the system is fair for everyone.”

When asked about the proposal, Scheer repeated a past talking point that the flow of asylum seekers at the Canada-U.S. border was a problem caused by a January 2017 tweet made by Trudeau.

The tweet, which said Canada welcomed those fleeing persecution, terror and war, was posted as the Trump administration moved to bar entry of persons from several Middle East and African countries and suspend its refugee admission program.

Since then, more than 41,000 people have arrived at the Canada-U.S. border to seek asylum in Canada.

Canada and the U.S. are moving to redraft the Safe Third Country Agreement, which prevents those wanting to claim asylum in Canada from doing so at official points of entry, although there is a loophole allowing irregular migrants to claim asylum at non-official crossings.

OTTAWA – Justin Trudeau says his threat to sue Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is about making sure there are consequences for lying in politics – but he’s not saying if he intends to make good on it.

Asked whether he plans to follow through with his threatened lawsuit, the prime minister would only say that with an election on the horizon, he won’t put up with politicians twisting the truth and distorting reality.

Scheer revealed Sunday that Trudeau’s lawyer sent him a libel notice late last month, demanding he take back claims the prime minister interfered with the prosecution of Montreal firm SNC-Lavalin and lied to Canadians.

On Monday, the Conservative leader urged Trudeau to bring it on, saying he’d welcome a lawsuit that would force Trudeau to testify about the affair under oath.

Trudeau says that while people disagree in politics, there are consequences for telling lies about one’s partisan adversaries.

He says he would be satisifed if Scheer agrees to retract the comments and apologize.

With less than a week to go before Albertans head to the polls, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is making an early exit from the capital to hit the campaign trail with his former federal caucus colleague turned United Conservative Leader, Jason Kenney, who, barring a sudden — but not, in the case of this particular province, entirely unprecedented — shift in the polls, seems all but certain to oust Rachel Notley’s New Democrats from the premier’s office.

According to the advisory, Scheer will join Kenney at a “family friendly” UCP-organized event on the baseball diamond at a Calgary grade school, where the pair will “send a message by rallying together” for the “fight to get our province, and our nation, back on track!”

Scheer can also take comfort in knowing that he likely won’t be missing out on the chance to continue his cross-examination of his chief political rival, as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is also expected to skip question period this afternoon.

As per his official itinerary, Trudeau will spend the day ensconced in “private meetings,” including a mid-morning sit-down with Stelco chair Alan Kestenbaum, during which they’ll almost certainly go over the latest developments in the government’s ongoing efforts to support the steel and aluminum sectors amid the current cross-border trade tensions.

Also on the Hill agenda today: Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould teams up with senior officials from the Communications Security Establishment and the Privy Council Office to brief the House procedure committee on the plan to “safeguard” the next federal election, as well as provide MPs with a status report on the interagency task force charged with monitoring “covert, clandestine or criminal activities” that aim to “interfere with,or influence electoral processes in Canada.”

Gould’s appearance comes just days after CSE officials issued an update on the risk of foreign meddling in the upcoming federal vote, which, they warn, is virtually certain to be the target of cyber saboteurs, although not likely of the same intensity or severity as the 2016 US presidential campaign.

Elsewhere on the committee circuit, opposition members have teamed up to force a special session of the House justice committee to discuss launching a probe into what they describe as the “unprecedented breaches of confidentiality” that resulted in a series of media reports alleging a running dispute between Trudeau and then-justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould during last year’s ostensibly closed-door process of choosing a new Supreme Court justice to replace retiring chief justice Beverley McLachlin.

With Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s Progressive Conservatives set to unveil their inaugural budget this afternoon, it’s likely not a coincidence that a full contingent of federal cabinet ministers is being dispatched to various venues across the province, where they will, naturally, be only too happy to share their concerns over Ford’s fiscal roadmap— and, of course, tout their own government’s planned initiatives — both before and after the full details are released.

Out and about in the Greater Toronto region today: Indigenous Services Minister Seamus O’Regan and Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains, both of whom are booked in for panel discussions at the Public Policy Forum’s annual Canada Growth Summit, where they will focus on “Indigenous innovation” and industry renewal, respectively.

Meanwhile, Science and Sport Minister Kirsty Duncan drops by the Ontario Lacrosse Hall of Fame in St. Catharines with news on the 2021 Canada Games as Tourism Minister Mélanie Joly has back-to-back events in Timmins, where she’ll outline new federal funding “to strengthen, diversify and grow the regional economy,” as well as cash to boost “cultural and community space projects” at the Timmins Museum.

Finally, Green Party Leader Elizabeth May is in Victoria to “challenge” Canadians to “become empowered into action to protect the future” as the next guest in the St. Mary’s Lenten Speaker series.

That is, if the province’s new secularism legislation, Bill 21, becomes law.

That’s what Quebec MNA Christopher Skeete, who serves as the parliamentary assistant to Quebec’s Premier Francois Legault, told Evan Solomon during an episode of CTV Question Period, airing Sunday.

“While [Singh] is working, if he chooses to be a police officer, we would ask him to remove his turban while at work, yes,” Skeete told Solomon.

Singh would be just one of many people impacted by the secularism bill, which was introduced in Quebec’s National Assembly Thursday. The proposed legislation would prevent certain public sector employees from wearing overt religious symbols at work. The bill specifically mentions teachers, police and court clerks, among other people in positions of authority in public sector workplaces.

“We’re saying that when you come to work, when you exercise the power of the state, that you leave your religion at the door, and I don’t think that’s too much to ask in a secular society,” Skeete said.

“Of course, they can always wear their religious symbols when they’re finished work.”

The bill has come under fire from civil rights groups and groups representing religious minorities. While the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects freedoms of conscience, religious expression and the right to equality, the bill invokes the notwithstanding clause to override those charter rights.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who represents a Quebec riding in the House of Commons, also criticized the proposed legislation.

“I don't think a lot of people feel that in a free society we should be legitimizing discrimination of our citizens based on religion,"" he said, speaking with reporters in New Brunswick on Thursday.

Singh has addressed Bill 21 as well. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, he said “it’s something that’s going to hurt people.”

“I remember what it’s like to grow up and not feel like I belong, and I think about all the young people in Quebec right now that won’t be able to pursue, maybe, their dream job that won’t be able to become a police officer or a judge or a teacher -- and that, to me, is sad,” Singh said.

The Quebec government, however, has been defending its proposed legislation. They say they’re addressing something that has been a conversation in Quebec for 12 years -- and Skeete said Quebecers support the proposed law, even if advocacy groups warn it could tread on minority rights.

“Well we do live in a democracy, so you know, the majority often does determine the orientation that we take, but we always have to be careful when we make laws like this to make sure that we do respect minority rights,” he said.

Skeete emphasized that the legislation is all about balance.

“I think it’s just a question of how do we balance individual rights from collective rights and I realize that we’re on that line… but I do believe that ultimately it’s more important to have a truly secular state,” he said.

Skeete said the bill will undergo a consultation period where it will seek support from other parties and hear the concerns of affected groups. While he said the government is open to changing the bill, he said the changes would only take place “where we think it’s acceptable,” and “where it’s in line with what the population wants.”",Proposed secularism bill would force Singh to remove turban in public sector gig: Quebec MNA,CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/proposed-secularism-bill-would-force-singh-to-remove-turban-in-public-sector-gig-quebec-mna-1.4358767

OTTAWA -- New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh has been sworn in as a member of Parliament.

The NDP says Singh becomes the first racialized party leader to sit in the House of Commons.

He won a byelection in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South in February, taking roughly 39 per cent of the vote.

The win means Singh can finally go toe-to-toe in the House of Commons with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau -- something he hasn't been able to do since taking over the party reins from Tom Mulcair in October 2017.

In a statement, Singh says he will use his new position to pressure the Liberal government to take action on affordable housing and bringing down prescription drug costs.

He says as a kid, he never would have imagined being in this position.

""I would've never imagined that someone who looks like me could ever run to be prime minister,"" Singh said in a statement issued by the party on Sunday.

Singh intends to announce the policy proposal Friday during his keynote speech at the Broadbent Institute’s Progress Summit, an annual gathering of progressive thinkers and New Democrats near Parliament Hill.

NDP MP Peter Julian, left, looks on as NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh speaks during a news conference in Ottawa on March 13, 2019. Singh wants to raise the tax paid on capital gains. ( Adrian Wyld / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

In an interview with the Star on Thursday, Singh said he wants to increase the proportion of capital gains profits that are taxed by the federal government. This “inclusion rate” is currently set at 50 per cent — meaning only half the profits people make by selling property or securities investments is subject to income tax. The NDP wants to increase that rate to 75 per cent, which Singh said party researchers predict would bring an additional $2.7 billion in tax revenue to the federal government each year. Capital gains are profits made from selling real estate — other than your primary residence — and from the sale of other investments, like stocks or certain businesses, that aren’t held in registered retirement or tax-free savings accounts. “The vast, vast majority of people that use this benefit are the wealthiest, the richest people in Canada,” Singh said, contrasting the capital gains inclusion rate with how most people’s salaries are taxed.

“We want a fairer system.” Capital gains taxes have been around for decades, and the inclusion rate Singh wants to increase has been changed as well — most recently in 2000, when the Liberal government led by Jean Chrétien slashed it from 75 to 50 per cent. Singh would reverse that change.

Article Continued Below

There were several media reports ahead of the 2017 budget that saw business analysts warn that increasing the proportion of capital gains that gets taxed would deter investment and innovation in Canada. Singh dismissed such concerns on Thursday, arguing a 75 per cent rate still gives capital gains better tax treatment than employee income. He added that the change would bring in more money that an NDP government would use to extend public health care to cover prescription medicine, dental and eye care, as well to build affordable housing units and fund a transition to cleaner energy. “There’s got to be some fairness to pay for the things that people need,” he said. “This is one of the ways we can do it.” The proposal to increase the tax on capital gains follows an announcement last fall, when Singh touted a trio of policy changes to crack down on tax dodgers and prevent the wealthy from hiding their money. He said the NDP would make changes to prevent companies from moving money overseas to avoid corporate taxes, and ban special types of company shares — called bearer bonds — that don’t require disclosure of who owns them. Singh also called on the Liberal government to close the so-called stock option “loophole,” which allows corporate executives to avoid income taxes by receiving compensation in company shares instead of through regular paycheques. The Liberals banned the issuance of new bearer bonds in legislation last year, and the Trudeau government announced in the recent federal budget that it intends to cap stock compensation at $200,000 per year so high income earners no longer benefit disproportionately from the option. But Singh said he does not believe the Liberals will follow through on the stock option limit, contending Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has demonstrated he is beholden to business interests through the SNC-Lavalin controversy and by not moving faster to create a government pharmacare program for all Canadians. “The track record of this government now makes it clear that they’re not going to make changes that will help out everyday families,” Singh said. Friday’s policy announcement is part of a series that Singh and the NDP plan to make in the coming weeks. The party has said its entire 2019 election platform will be public before the end of spring.

While Singh is hardly the first politician to release a book during an election year, the publisher claims Love & Courage is “not a political memoir.”

“In this personal and heartfelt memoir, readers are invited to walk with Jagmeet through childhood to adulthood as he learns powerful, moving and sometimes traumatic lessons about overcoming adversity and the impact of not belonging,” the release says.

“It's a story of family, love, and courage, and how strengthening the connection between us all is the way to build a better world.”

April 8, 2019 | By Sikh Siyasat Bureau

Ottawa: On Thursday (April 4), the Leader of the NDP, Jagmeet Singh, and the NDP Public Safety Critic, Matthew Dubé, sent a letter to the Prime Minister regarding the 2018 Public Report on the Terrorism Threat to Canada that labelled the Sikh and Muslim communities as extremists.

The letter to Prime Minister Trudeau highlights concerns about the inappropriate labelling of the Sikh and Muslim communities in the report, in some circumstances without sufficient evidence.

The letter noted that the report has left Canadians with many questions and many concerns specifically regarding the fact that the report uses terms such as “Sikh”, “Shia”, and “Sunni” to label and equate entire communities to extremism.

“This report unfairly stigmatizes Muslim and Sikh communities, while failing to consider dangerous and unintended consequences. These consequences include the potential to place vulnerable communities and all Canadians at greater risk, by emboldening the harmful stereotypes that fuelled terrorist attacks in Christchurch, Quebec City and Oak Creek” said Singh. Adding that, “Political leaders must act with great care and responsibility, so their words are not used to exploit fear and fuel hatred – instead, they must promote solidarity and challenge hatred, whenever atrocities occur.”

Dubé added, “You have in us and in our caucus, a strong ally prepared to tackle extremism. It is of tantamount importance to us, however, that any approach avoids further divisions between groups, which in turn fuels hatred and in some circumstances violent acts.” Adding that, “There is nothing more important to us, than the safety and security of all Canadians.”

Jagmeet Singh and Canada’s New Democrats urged the Prime Minister and his Liberal government to remove the report from government websites until all promised changes regarding these labels and references to the Sikh, Shia and Sunni communities are made, or until a clear explanation including any evidence, where appropriate, is released.

The federal NDP leader pitched the plan Friday during a keynote speech to the annual Broadbent Institute's Progress Summit, which brings together progressives and New Democrats from across the country.

It is expected to form a key plank in the NDP's election platform this fall alongside other policy proposals the party says will target the rich, pay for more services for Canadians and cool the housing market.

""A fairer tax system means more funding for services that Canadians need like universal pharmacare, child care, affordable housing and post-secondary education,"" Singh said in a statement.

Watch: Singh calls out Quebec's secularism bill

While the government currently taxes 50 per cent of profits made on investments, known as capital gains, the NDP wants to increase that threshold — known as the ""inclusion rate"" — to 75 per cent.

The party estimates the move, which would also apply to the sale of most real estate but not primary residences, tax-free savings accounts or registered retirement plans, would generate nearly $3 billion in additional revenue for the federal treasury.

""When you go to work, you're taxed on almost all of your income,"" Singh said. ""It doesn't make sense that someone making their money from investments is taxed on only half.""

The inclusion rate for capital gains has fluctuated since it was introduced in 1972, when it was 50 per cent. It was raised several times in the intervening years to a high of 75 per cent, before Jean Chretien's government cut it to its current rate in 2000.

A hotly debated topic

The question of raising the inclusion rate on capital gains has been hotly debated for years, with some suggesting it would address inequality and others arguing it would hurt Canadians' savings and make the country less attractive for investors.

New Democrats have also previously talked about closing a stock-option loophole and cracking down on the use of bearer shares and foreign tax havens they say help the rich hide their wealth and avoid paying their fair share of taxes.

The government in its most recent budget moved to address the stock-option loophole by putting a $200,000-limit on the tax-deductible amount on employee stock options.

The stock-option deduction works by taxing only 50 per cent of the earnings an employee receives when they cash in any stock options received as part of their compensation packages, if certain conditions are met.

The new limit appears aimed at tightening the loophole while acknowledging concerns that closing it entirely would make it more difficult for companies to attract talent and discourage start-ups.",Singh: New Democrats Will Tax The Rich To Pay For Pharmacare,HuffPost Canada,https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2019/03/29/jagmeet-singh-pharmacare_a_23702695/

Singh rose ...,"NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has successfully moved a motion calling on the Senate to pass legislation harmonizing Canadian laws with the UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and requiring sexual assault training for judges.

Singh rose in the House after question period Wednesday to ask his fellow MPs to support sending a message to the Upper Chamber calling for both bills to be “passed into law at the earliest opportunity.”

In the motion, Singh called the bills “critical pieces of legislation” that had been passed by the elected House and had been before the Senate for “many months.”

It was unanimously adopted by the House.

Both pieces of legislation are private member’s bill that won relatively broad support in the House.

NDP MP Romeo Saganash’s Bill C-262 to have Canadian laws conform with UNDRIP was passed by the House last May. It was supported by all parties in the House save for the Tories, and enjoys broad support among Indigenous groups, including the Assembly of First Nations.

Bill C-337, known alternatively as the JUST Act, would mandate sexual assault training for everyone seeking a federal judicial appointment. It was sponsored by former interim Conservative leader Rona Ambrose, citing concerns over the behaviour of judges handling sexual assault cases.

In the most notable instance, an Alberta judge questioned the accuser in a sexual assault case he was overseeing about why she “couldn’t just keep [her] knees together.”

The bill was passed unanimously in the House in 2017, however,

it has not advance quickly in the Senate, where it remains at committee. Saganash’s bill is at the second reading stage in the Upper Chamber.

Ambrose has frequently criticized the Senate for moving slowly on her bill. In a recent CTV interview, she blamed a “group of old boys” in the Upper Chamber for stalling the bill. A website promoting the bill that prominently features Ambrose has a running clock on how long the Senate has been “delaying the JUST Act.”

As of Wednesday, it stood at 694 days.

The full text of Singh’s motion:

That, in the opinion of the House, bill C-262, An Act to ensure that the laws of Canada are in harmony with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, as well as bill C-337, An Act to amend the Judges Act and the Criminal Code (sexual assault), are both critical pieces of legislation that have been duly passed by the House of Commons, and have been in possession of honourable Senators for many months; that both bills should be passed into law at the earliest opportunity; and that a message be sent to the Senate to acquaint that House accordingly.","House backs motion calling on Senate to pass UNDRIP, sexual assault training bills",iPolitics,https://ipolitics.ca/2019/04/10/house-backs-motion-calling-on-senate-to-pass-undrip-sexual-assault-training-bills/

The letter to Trudeau highlights concerns about the inappropriate labeling of the Sikh and Muslim communities in the report, in some circumstances without sufficient evidence.

The letter noted that the report has left Canadians with many questions and many concerns specifically regarding the fact that the report uses terms such as “Sikh”, “Shia”, and “Sunni” to label and equate entire communities to extremism.

“This report unfairly stigmatizes Muslim and Sikh communities, while failing to consider dangerous and unintended consequences. These consequences include the potential to place vulnerable communities and all Canadians at greater risk, by emboldening the harmful stereotypes that fuelled terrorist attacks in Christchurch, Quebec City and Oak Creek” said Singh. “Political leaders must act with great care and responsibility, so their words are not used to exploit fear and fuel hatred – instead, they must promote solidarity and challenge hatred, whenever atrocities occur.”

It is of tantamount importance to us, however, that any approach avoids further divisions between groups, which in turn fuels hatred and in some circumstances violent acts.” He added “There is nothing more important to us, than the safety and security of all Canadians.”

Jagmeet Singh and the NDP urged Trudeau and his Liberal government to remove the report from government websites until all promised changes regarding these labels and references to the Sikh, Shia and Sunni communities are made, or until a clear explanation including any evidence, where appropriate, is released.

DUBE also notified the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security of his intention to move a motion to invite the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, Ralph Goodale, to appear before committee and answer questions related to the Public Report tabled in Parliament on December 11, 2018.

Dubé introduced the motion after sending a letter to the Minister last December, which the Minister did not answer. Dubé’s letter raised questions about the concerns expressed by Canadians regarding the labelling of Sikh and Muslim communities as extremists. His letter also raised the dangers of this labelling and its potential to lead to inappropriate stereotypes and stigmas.

While speaking to the Committee on Wednesday, Dubé introduced the following motion:

“That the Committee invite the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness to appear before it no later than June 21, 2019 to respond to and take questions on the 2018 Public Report on the Terrorism Threat to Canada tabled in Parliament on December 11, 2018.”

Dubé went on to state: “We’ve heard from communities that are named in this report that there is concern over what impact it can have.” He added: “It’s become pretty clear that there needs to be rethinking of how these groups are identified in these reports and a better understanding of the thought process behind the decisions.”",Jagmeet Singh writes to Trudeau about labeling Muslim and Sikh communities as terrorists,Voice Online,https://www.voiceonline.com/jagmeet-singh-writes-to-trudeau-about-labeling-muslim-and-sikh-communities-as-terrorists/

Singh has developed a double-skewering narrative, calling Liberal indifference about economic anxiety a fuel for Conservative exclusion. He can’t let up on it.""

NDP leader Jagmeet Singh sees the opening. His challenge, before summer, is to climb through it and make it a three-way race.

The Trudeau Liberals dragged out the Burnaby South byelection, pinning the seatless NDP leader on the west coast as long as possible — at 164 days from seat vacancy to byelection vote, the longest a Prime Minister has ever blocked an opposition leader. Singh’s support eroded, dropping the NDP to about 13 per cent.

But Singh made opportunity from necessity, building Vancouver-area networks. Coming out of the byelection, his NDP has continuing BC support. Premier John Horgan’s popular NDP government helps.

With the byelection done, Singh quickly pivoted to Quebec. He appointed MP Alexandre Boulerice as his new deputy, boosted new Montreal candidate Nima Machouf (who holds a strong Quebec Solidaire connection), and met Premier François Legault.

And since winning, three recent polls — IPSOS, Angus Reid and Nanos — show a significant rebound. A Quebec recovery may be underway — while IPSOS still puts NDP’s Quebec support at 12 per cent, both Angus Reid and Nanos put it at 18. Angus Reid shows Singh’s NDP leading in the city of Vancouver. And nationally, NDP support is pegged at 21, 17 and 20 per cent, respectively.

Written off only weeks ago, Singh’s NDP is back in business. But no cork-popping: before summer Singh needs to hit the next level — 25 per cent — to say it’s a three-way race.

He has opportunities. The SNC-Lavalin scandal has set the Liberal house afire — and the burnline couldn’t be better for him. The scandal shows Trudeau Liberals doing just about anything to aid powerful corporate friends. And it exposes the pretense of Liberal identity politics — a clever play to use appropriated identities as cloaks over same-old Liberal politics.

Quebec political realignment may help. The Parti Quebecois, which took the Quebec left in a cultural-nationalist direction, is being edged out by Quebec Solidaire, which has helpful NDP policy overlaps. The QS, in a policy switch last weekend, will oppose the CAQ bill on religious symbols, arguing secularism is for institutions, not individuals. Now, on this sensitive issue, the federal NDP position is backed by a party inside the Quebec National Assembly — no longer a foreign intervention from outside Quebec’s cultural debates.

Climate change voters are an opportunity. Doing a bit more than climate do-nothings isn’t working. Canada, at the end of 2018, was further from carbon targets than in 2017. Canada needs a bold federal Green New Deal that partners with provinces to decarbonize. To make buildings more efficient. To shift to electricity-powered vehicles. To expand and operate transit. To end coal burning — still a mainstay in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia — and build clean energy production.

But Singh also faces challenges — particularly to gain ground on nominations and get supporters to open their wallets. First quarter fundraising results come soon. The past can’t be changed, but the second quarter needs to show bounce.

He needs more signature policies. He’s announced a plan to build 500,000 affordable housing units. He pledged to reverse a Liberal tax cut that lets the ultra-wealthy pay tax on only half their capital gains income — even from the largest fortunes. Monday he returned to pharmacare. Singh needs a full suite of actions focused on affordability.

He needs the key that unlocks Liberal Fortress Toronto. He knows what it looks like — trace the seats the Ontario NDP took last year in while winning the popular vote in Toronto and Brampton. To some, Toronto is a notoriously self-centred city of affluence. But in the 31 seats of Brampton and Toronto, all Liberal held, are millions of voters frustrated with low wages, high costs, bad transit and provincial cuts.

And Singh needs to prevent Trudeau and Scheer from polarizing a culture war. Singh has developed a double-skewering narrative, calling Liberal indifference about economic anxiety a fuel for Conservative exclusion. He can’t let up on it.

Singh’s got the opening. If by summer his NDP can climb to 25 per cent, then the game really is on.

Jagmeet Singh, Leader of Canada’s NDP, issued the following statement:

“In 2007, a student in Nova Scotia wore a pink shirt on his first day of school. And like too many kids across Canada and around the world, he was met with hateful homophobic bullying.

Inspired to act, two of his peers decided to take action to support him and stand up against bullying. They bought dozens of pink shirts and asked their classmates to take a stand by wearing pink.

The result was incredible. The next day, almost every student in school was wearing pink.

Today, 12 years later, we celebrate the courage and compassionate activism of these students.

As a kid who grew up with long hair and a funny-sounding name, I know first-hand the terrible effects of bullying.

It makes you feel like you don’t belong. It works to disconnect neighbourhoods and communities, not bring them together. It makes you wonder if there’s something wrong with you just for being you.

Nobody should feel that way.

That’s why the New Democrats stand for love and courage, and have always worked to build a Canada that is inclusive for all people.

That’s why I’m proud to wear pink today, in solidarity with Canada’s youth who are bravely fighting bullying, homophobia, and transphobia as they work to make their schools safer for everyone.

Today, we can recommit to creating a more inclusive, compassionate, and open society where everyone can be who they are without fear.”",NDP Statement on International Day of Pink,New Democratic Party,https://www.ndp.ca/news/ndp-statement-international-day-pink

The biggest thing to watch for is whether New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh nabs a seat in the House of Commons.

Here’s a look at what the parties are hoping to gain (and what they have to lose):

Burnaby South

Burnaby South is where Singh, who was named NDP leader about 18 months ago, is finally hoping to win his first seat in federal politics.

Winning in Burnaby is key for Singh who has faced criticism that his performance as leader has been underwhelming, and he is still relatively unknown across the country.

READ MORE: NDP’s Jagmeet Singh fights for a seat during federal byelections

Under his leadership, the NDP has plunged to its lowest standings in public opinion polls since 2000, when it won just 13 seats.

The party is mired in debt and its fundraising is sluggish. At least 11 of the 44 MPs who won seats for the party in 2015 have announced they won’t seek re-election this fall.

WATCH: Federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh under pressure to win Burnaby-South byelection

Singh is running against Liberal candidate Richard T. Lee, Conservatives’ Jay Shin and Laura-Lynn Thompson from the People’s Party of Canada (PPC).

Voters can cast their ballots at local stations from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. local time.

Outremont

While most eyes are on Burnaby on Monday evening, the Montreal riding of Outremont is important to watch for the NDP as well.

The riding was previously held by former NDP leader Thomas Mulcair, but before that, it was a Liberal stronghold.

READ MORE: What’s at stake for federal parties in Outremont byelection on Monday

Muclair’s victory turned Outremont into a beachhead for the NDP, which helped to launch the so-called orange wave that swept the province in 2011 and boosted the party to official Opposition status for the first time in its history.

While the party held onto just 16 Quebec seats in 2015, Quebec MPs still make up more than a third of the NDP caucus.

WATCH: Tom Mulcair calls on Canada to be champion of democracy as he marks his retirement

The candidates running in Outremont are: Liberal Rachel Bendayan, NDP Julia Sanchez, Conservative Jasmine Louras, Green Party’s Daniel Green, Michel Duchesne from Bloc Québécois and James Seale from the PPC.

Polling stations are open from 9:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. local time.

York-Simcoe

The third byelection is being held in the Ontario riding of York-Simcoe, which was left vacant by the retirement of Peter Van Loan.

Van Loan, who had held the seat for the Conservatives since 2004, won with a healthy 50 per cent of the votes in 2015. The Tories are expected to easily hang on Monday night.

The candidates in York-Simcoe are: NDP’s Jessa McLean, Liberal Shaun Tanaka, Scot Davidson from the Conservative Party and Robert Geurts from the PPC.

Voters can cast their ballots at local stations from 9:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. local time.

By winning a seat in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South, Jagmeet Singh becomes the first visible minority leader of a federal political party in this country’s history. He did so in the face of withering critiques, notably from former NDP leader Thomas Mulcair, as to his prospects and abilities, as well as a dominant narrative that suggested the Liberal Party of Canada was quickly usurping the NDP as Canada’s leading progressive voice. We are better as a country with Jagmeet Singh in Parliament.

Now the bad news. Though he is now leader of a political party with significant representation in Quebec, Singh soon wouldn’t be allowed to guard prisoners, police the streets, serve as a judge — or even teach schoolchildren in the province. That’s because the provincial government plans on banning religious symbols from the bodies of certain civil servants, teachers included, in the name of secularism.

And were Singh to show up at the National Assembly to protest the forthcoming legislation, he wouldn’t be allowed in. Unlike Canadian Parliament, the National Assembly still considers the kirpan, the ceremonial dagger worn by many practising Sikh men, to be a dangerous weapon. He wouldn’t make it past the X-ray machines.

I bring all of this up not to relive the long and often tiresome debate about the place and space allowed religious minorities in Quebec, but rather to illustrate the uniquely challenging political context Singh now finds himself in the very province that helped launch the NDP’s rebirth eight years ago.

In a few months’ time, Singh will be tasked with campaigning in a province that overwhelmingly supports the above-mentioned legislation. It has the potential to be a jarring spectacle. Policy-wise, the NDP under Singh, an unabashedly progressive counterpoint to Thomas Mulcair’s Liberalesque leadership, is the stuff of dreams to the province’s centre-left electorate. Yet it is tough not to see the party’s sudden and inherent disadvantage: its leader happens to be a brown guy in a turban.

Quebec’s political class is obsessed with identity issues like immigration, which took up an outsized proportion of the oxygen during the last provincial election, according to Influence Communication, a Quebec-based media analysis firm. For this you can at once point to history (francophone Quebecers’ collective and existential worry about the survival of their language and culture) and blame politicians for exploiting this worry for political gain.

This tinder is regularly turned to flame by way of certain columnists — almost all of whom are from the Journal de Montréal — who tend to portray Quebec’s religious minorities as an invading horde bent on undermining Quebec’s proudly secular society.

The end result is a zealous rejection of conspicuous religiosity. Consider how some 61 per cent of Quebecers, far and away the largest percentage of respondents in the country, say the wearing of the turban or other religious symbol by teachers is “unacceptable,” according to a national Léger Marketing poll published last December. Never mind that at least three teachers’ unions have said the government’s proposed ban is patently unworkable. The decade-long politicization of the issue has ensured gut feeling, not cold logic, rules the day.

Singh is about to step into this politically perilous breach, his religion conspicuously displayed. To be fair, he has a lot going for him. He’s good on TV and great on the stage — a necessity in the Trudeau age of campaigning. Most important, his French is excellent. And on the island of Montreal, at least, he has a multicultural beachhead where his appearance is an advantage, or at least less of a disadvantage.

But beyond our fair city? I worry we aren’t yet ready for a leader like Jagmeet Singh. I can only hope I’m proven wrong.

On Sunday he began campaigning with NDP leader Jagmeet Singh at his side. Dean Stoltz reports.

Bob Chamberlin is well-known locally, but it didn’t hurt to have NDP leader Jagmeet Singh at his side for day one of his campaign in the Nanaimo-Ladysmith by-election.

“Now we have Bob Chamberlin as our next candidate who will be the next MP in this riding, that’s a hugely exciting thing,” Singh told supporters Sunday outside Chamberlin’s new Nanaimo campaign office.

Chamberlin has a long history of First Nations leadership in B.C. as chief councilor of the Kwikwasut’inuxw Haxwa’mis First Nation based on Gilford Island, and Vice-President of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs.

But eight weeks ago Chamberlin decided now is the right time to enter federal politics.

“The work that I’ve done on this coast to protect this beautiful coastline that we all enjoy is hand and glove with the issues that I’ve heard so far here in Nanaimo,” Chamberlin said.

Chamberlin was nominated Saturday as the NDP candidate, and Singh today, sang his praises.

“What Bob brings is an incredible wealth of leadership experience,” said Singh.

“He’s got the ability to be a strong advocate, someone who’s willing to stand up for the community with what the community needs and someone who’s an effective communicator.”

The NDP has 13 federal seats in BC and badly wants to re-capture Nanaimo-Ladysmith after Sheila Malcolmson resigned to run provincially in February.

It’s been NDP since 2004, (Nanaimo-Cowichan) and the party will try to capitalize on the Trudeau Liberal’s infighting over the SNC Lavalin affair.

“What we have now is an opportunity to ensure that a strong party, the NDP party is represented by as many Members of Parliament as possible to ensure that the average Canadian’s needs are spoken to so we don’t see governments that have the ease and think that it’s ok to mix politics with justice and cut political favours or legal favours for political friends,” added Chamberlin.

Adrian Wyld/THE CANADIAN PRESS

Former federal cabinet minister Rona Ambrose is criticizing the Senate for holding up her private member’s bill requiring sexual-assault law education for judges, nearly two years after it passed the House of Commons.

The former MP said she learned late last week that her appearance before the Senate committee on legal and constitutional affairs, which is studying the bill, was pushed back a fifth time. She was expecting to appear before committee on Wednesday and has not been given a new date.

“Once again, they have shown that sexual-assault survivors are not a priority,” she said. “I suspect they will go straight into other government business and use that as yet another delay tactic. ... The bottom line is this is the old boys’ club protecting the old boys’ club.”

Story continues below advertisement

Ms. Ambrose’s Bill C-337, the Judicial Accountability Through Sexual Assault Law Training Act, would restrict eligibility for federal judicial appointments to those who have completed education in sexual-assault law and social context.

It would also require the Canadian Judicial Council to report on seminars in matters related to sexual-assault law and it amends the Criminal Code to require that reasons provided by a judge in sexual-assault decisions be entered in the record of the proceedings or be in writing.

Senator Serge Joyal, chair of the committee, said the reason Ms. Ambrose’s bill has not yet been studied at committee is because government bills take precedence over private member’s bills and his committee has been swamped with government legislation.

“So as soon as committee’s work will have been completed on government legislation, the private member’s bill of Madame Ambrose is the first on top of it. ... That’s the procedure, it’s not me that’s defined that procedure. It is the procedure that is followed in the Senate.”

On Wednesday, the House of Commons adopted a motion from NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh calling on the Senate to pass Ms. Ambrose’s bill and NDP MP Romeo Saganash’s private member’s bill, which would require the government to ensure Canadian laws are in harmony with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

Mr. Singh’s motion says that both bills are “critical pieces of legislation” that have been passed by the House of Commons and have been in possession of senators for months.

Ms. Ambrose said she stayed quiet for the past year and a half and realized in the last couple of months that if her bill doesn’t get time at committee and go to a vote, it never will because Parliament has seven weeks of sittings left before the federal election scheduled for October. The former interim Conservative leader recently launched a social-media campaign and a petition to pressure senators to move forward with the legislation.

Story continues below advertisement

Brian Laghi, the director of communications for the government representative in the Senate, Peter Harder, said Ms. Ambrose’s bill “has taken longer to deal with than bills that have come to us that were unanimously passed in the House.”

Nine private member’s bills have received Royal Assent since the beginning of the parliamentary session.

Of those nine, two bills that arrived to the Senate after a unanimous recorded vote in the Commons, C-224, the Good Samaritan Drug Overdose Act and C-305, which amends the Criminal Code, took about six months to pass the Senate.

Another, Bill C-211, which addresses post-traumatic stress disorder, also had the support from all parties in the House of Commons at second reading, and it took about a year to pass. Some bills, including Ms. Ambrose’s, landed in the Senate with no recorded vote from the House of Commons.

Mr. Joyal said he did receive a letter from Ms. Ambrose about the bill and that Senator Raynell Andreychuk, who is sponsoring the bill, expressed her concern about how long it was taking.

Senator André Pratte, a member of the Senate committee, said he has worked on a number of amendments and he believes the bill will pass with the help of his proposed changes. He said the changes will make the bill similar to a law that was passed recently in Prince Edward Island, and which Ms. Ambrose supports.

OTTAWA – While the richest use loopholes to evade their taxes, regular people are paying the price. In a keynote speech at Broadbent Institute's Progress Summit, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh made an announcement that unlike Justin Trudeau's Liberal government, the NDP will have the courage to address our unfair tax system that is preventing Canadians from getting the public services they need.

“For far too long, people have been working hard to make ends meet, and they just want things to be a little easier. When you go to work, you’re taxed on almost all of your income. It doesn’t make sense that someone making their money from investments is taxed on only half,” said Singh. “Trudeau’s Liberals have refused to limit the capital gains tax benefit for the wealthiest. This is hurting hard-working Canadians who are forced to pay the price.”

To make our tax system fairer, Jagmeet Singh and the NDP will increase the capital gains inclusion rate from the current 50 to 75%. This plan will bring in almost $3 billion more in government revenue every year to fund the services Canadians need, like childcare, education, and housing. New Democrats are committed to a fairer and more progressive tax system and will get rid of tax loopholes for the wealthiest, by increasing taxes on investment profits and by getting tough on tax evasion.

As it stands, 88% of the capital gains tax benefit goes to the 1%. Under the Liberal tax plan, people earning less than $45,000 get nothing – and that’s the majority of Canadians. Meanwhile, those earning over three times that salary receive much higher tax cuts. This is unfair for people who are trying to build a better future for their families.

“A fairer tax system means more funding for services that Canadians need like universal pharmacare, childcare, affordable housing and post-secondary education,” added Singh. “Everybody wins when we deliver better services that Canadians can rely on. New Democrats have the courage to bring in a fairer tax system that will help people build a better future.”",Singh: Let's Help People by Bringing in a Fairer Tax System,New Democratic Party,https://www.ndp.ca/news/singh-lets-help-people-bringing-fairer-tax-system

Fourth federal byelection of 2019

The Nanaimo-Ladysmith vote, scheduled May 6, will be the fourth federal byelection of the year, after three were decided in February.

In the Feb. 25 byelection, voters preserved the Conservatives' long string of wins in Ontario's York-Simcoe electing Scot Davidson. The Liberals, with candidate Rachel Bendayan, regained Montreal's Outremont riding, held by former NDP leader Tom Mulcair before he resigned as an MP last August.

Current NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh earned a seat in the House of Commons with a win in Burnaby South, vacated last September by former New Democrat MP Kennedy Stewart, now Vancouver's mayor.

Singh said he is thrilled to have Chamberlin onboard.

""Bob is a tireless worker with an unparalleled dedication and determination to stand up for the common good, protect our environment, and make life easier and more affordable for those who have been left behind by decades of Liberal and Conservatives governments,"" Singh said in a written release.

The 40-year-old former Ontario legislator has lacked a voice in Parliament since becoming party leader in the fall of 2017. Now he finally has his chance in Burnaby South as voters in the riding cast their ballots on Monday after a six-week race.

The Liberals got off to a rocky start when their first candidate, Karen Wang, resigned after pointing out Singh’s ethnicity online. In recent weeks, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been besieged by allegations his office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to stop a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

Singh said he’s not taking anything for granted but he’s confident his hard work to connect with voters will pay off.

“I think people are very disappointed with what’s going on with the Liberal government,” he said.

“Canadians expect our government works in our interest. It looks more and more like this government and Mr. Trudeau and the Liberal party are working in the interest of a massive multinational corporation.”

Trudeau has denied he or his office directed Wilson-Raybould on the matter. Michael Wernick, clerk of the Privy Council, recently said Trudeau repeatedly assured Wilson-Raybould a decision on the prosecution was hers alone to make.

Richard T. Lee, the Liberal candidate who replaced Wang in Burnaby South, said few people are raising the issue on the doorstep.

“I understand some people are concerned about that, but the office of the prime minister and the prime minister himself have made a statement already,” he said.

Byelections typically have low turnouts, but there is evidence the results of them are driven by the popularity of the government and its leader, said Richard Johnston, a University of British Columbia political science professor.

“(Singh) may have been handed the gift of some voters as a result of all this,” he said. “Although it’s just one thing amongst many, boy, he could use a win right now.”

Singh has faced criticism for poor fundraising and low poll numbers. Burnaby South occupies historically strong NDP territory, so if Singh can’t win in the riding, it adds to the interpretation that he hasn’t secured the support of party loyalists, said Johnston.

The NDP beat the Liberals by just over 500 votes in the riding in 2015, but Johnston said he never expected the Liberals to do as well this time in Burnaby South.

“That was kind of a high point and their support might drop even further,” he said.

Lee said local issues, especially affordable housing, are more important to Burnaby South voters than the situation in Ottawa.

He has touted the Liberal government’s national housing strategy, which promises $40 billion over 10 years, while Conservative candidate Jay Shin has called for lower taxes and job-creation measures to help residents earn and save more money.

Singh has unveiled a plan to build 500,000 affordable homes across Canada. He challenged Trudeau to eliminate the GST for developers building affordable homes, subsidize low-income renters and double the first-time homebuyers’ tax credit.

Byelections will also take place in York-Simcoe in Ontario and Outremont in Montreal on Monday. The results might provide insight into whether Quebec MP Maxime Bernier’s new right-wing People’s Party of Canada can snatch votes from the Conservatives.

A recent debate in Burnaby South became heated when People’s Party candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson discussed immigration.

An online video of the debate shows Singh urging audience members to recognize they are all immigrants, unless they are Indigenous.

When Tyler Thompson raises the murder of Burnaby teen Marrisa Shen — in which a Syrian national has been charged — to argue for more careful vetting of refugees, an audience member yells: “That is racist! Shame on you!”

“It’s not racist to have safety,” replies Tyler Thompson.

Shin, the Conservative candidate, recently distributed flyers taking aim at Tyler Thompson, accusing her of supporting supervised injection sites and the legalization of marijuana, which she described as a “smear campaign” based on “lies.”

However, Shin said he isn’t worried about Tyler Thompson and doesn’t think her message is resonating.

“When I speak with voters at the doors, I don’t get a sense of that at all,” he said.

Tyler Thompson, a former Christian TV show host who opposes abortion and has protested teaching resources that educate kids about gay and transgender identities, said she believes the Conservatives are threatened by the People’s Party.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh announced details of the pharmacare plan today with health critic Don Davies at an event in Coquitlam.

article continues below

The party says the plan would see every Canadian covered for a list of prescription drugs determined by an arms-length group of experts that it says would be protected from industry and political pressure.

The party says the plan would save families who don't currently have private drug coverage an average $550 per year and it would save employers about $600 per employee with extended health benefits.

The legislation would be modeled on the Canada Health Act and provide an annual pharmacare transfer to the provinces and territories, with provinces paying about 60 per cent of the total cost and the federal government providing the remaining 40 per cent.

Davies, who represents Vancouver Kingsway, says the cost to provinces will be about the same as they are paying now.

An analysis from the parliamentary budget officer says the total cost of a national pharmacare program would be $23.7 billion in 2020, representing a $4.2 billion savings each year over the current amount being spent on drugs in Canada.

Last week, Singh said an NDP government would expand the tax on investment profits as part of a package of measures aimed to pay for pharmacare, affordable child care and housing.

""Those measures would free up billions that would be available for this as well. The rest of financing would be a matter of discussion between the federal government and provinces and territories,"" Davies said.

The federal government taxes 50 per cent of profits made on investments, also known as capital gains, but the NDP wants to increase that threshold — known as the inclusion rate — to 75 per cent. It says that would raise about $3 billion in revenue.

The New Democrats have also talked about closing a stock-option loophole and cracking down on the use of bearer shares and foreign tax havens, which they say help the rich avoid paying their fair share of taxes to society.

In its budget last month, the Liberal government said Canada's patchwork of drug coverage, which comprises more than 100 public programs and 100,000 private insurance plans, is not well equipped to handle the increasingly expensive drugs now coming to market.

The arrival of the turbaned leader into the house on Monday, cheered by all members, coincided with the induction of a senior woman member into Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's cabinet.

Singh, 40, the leader of the New Democratic Party, placed his hand over his heart as he walked into the House of Commons, the lower of house of Parliament, before the daily question period.

He was elected in federal by-elections held on February 25.

Singh's first words as an elected lawmaker were about last week's terrorist attack on two mosques in New Zealand.

""I want to begin by expressing our solidarity with the people of New Zealand who are mourning the attack on Muslim brothers and sisters... in Christchurch,"" he said.

About 50 people were killed last week in the Pacific country's worst-ever mass shooting.

He then launched his first question about housing in Burnaby-South.

""I met a mom in Burnaby. She bought a home, but cannot afford to live there anymore. Her daughter has a good job, but only gets by because she lives in the basement. Her son does not see a future. Like too many Canadians, he has lost all hope,"" Singh said.

""However, the prime minister is telling families like theirs to wait for help. I believe that better is possible. Will the government commit to building half a million new affordable homes?"" he said.

Prime Minister Trudeau responded by congratulating Singh for his entry into the Commons, before touting the government's record on fighting poverty.

Singh's remarks echoed the mood of the House on a crucial day when the prime minister beleaguered by the resignations of his two key cabinet colleagues.

Speculations are rife that the last budget of the Trudeau government with an eye on the general elections in October is expected to have several attractions for the middle class.","Indian-origin Jagmeet Singh creates history, becomes first non-white leader of Canada Parliament",Business Today,https://www.businesstoday.in/current/world/indian-origin-jagmeet-singh-creates-history--becomes-first-non-white-leader-of-canada-parliament/story/329428.html

Publisher Simon & Schuster says the book follows Singh, who is Sikh, from childhood as he learns lessons about overcoming adversity and the impact of not belonging.

Rather than a political memoir, it’s being billed as a story about “how strengthening the connection between us all is the way to build a better world.”

The title alludes to Singh’s oft-invoked call for “love and courage,” which he deployed in a viral response to a heckler at a 2017 NDP leadership campaign event.

After taking the reins of the federal party, Singh earned a seat in the House of Commons in a byelection last month.

His sights are now set on the post of prime minister as Canadians prepare to vote in this fall’s federal election.

“This book is the story of my family and my personal experiences growing up — sometimes difficult ones. I often felt alone, unworthy, ashamed,” Singh said in a statement.

“I hope this book helps some people feel less alone and know that they deserve love and happiness, no matter what they’ve gone through.”

Arun Tyagi, a property dealer and resident of Dundahera ...","New Delhi, April 6 (IANS) It was once known as the badlands on the eastern fringes of the national where only the brave stirred after dark. Then came roads, industries, a railway junction, educational institutes, shopping complexes, Metro connectivity and even condominiums, so much so that it has become the preferred residential destination of Noida’s young upwardly mobile brigade.

Along the way, it has become a high profile parliamentary constituency – being represented by Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Minister of State for External Affairs V.K. Singh.

In fact, according to a survey conducted by the City Mayors Foundation, a global think tank on urban affairs, Ghaziabad is the second fastest growing city in the world.

Unlike its sister constituency Gautam Budh Nagar, Ghaziabad has a distinctly urban sheen. Of the total 27.26 lakh registered voters in the Lok Sabha seat, the metropolitan assembly constituencies of Sahibabad and Ghaziabad together account for 51 per cent of votes.

It’s a tougher battle for votes in the rural pocket. The rural part of the Ghaziabad Lok Sabha seat – comprising Loni, Dhaulana (partial) and Muradnagar assembly constituencies – accounts for only 32 per cent of the voters.

As per the 2011 Census, the constituency has 25.34 per cent Muslims, 72.93 per cent Hindus and 16.5 per cent people from the Scheduled Castes. Unofficial caste estimates put Gujjars at 11.2 per cent of the total population, Vyasas 9.6 per cent, Rajputs 8.6 per cent, Tyagis 8.22 per cent, Brahmins 4.6 per cent and Yadavs 2 per cent.

To this extent, although General V. K. Singh won the 2014 Lok Sabha polls with a margin of more than over 5 lakh votes – the second highest after Prime Minister Narendra Modi – retaining the Ghaziabad constituency will have to depend on a lot more than the euphoria generated by his political plunge immediately after stepping down as the Indian Army chief.

A major factor in the election is the resentment of the local MLAs at not being given a shot at the seat.

Singh is facing a tough challenge from Samajwadi Party (SP) candidate Suresh Bansal, a former Ghaziabad MLA who had fought the 2017 assembly election on a BSP ticket but lost to the BJP’s Atul Garg.

In 2017 Assembly polls, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had won all the five Assembly segments of this parliamentary constituency and many of the MLAs were contenders for a Lok Sabha ticket.

In 2009, the BJP had fielded Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and he won. He became the first Lok Sabha MP from Ghaziabad after the constituency came into existence in 2008 as part of the delimitation process.

Singh had defeated the Congress party’s Surendra Prakash Goyal by a margin of 90,681 votes at a time when there were 16 candidates in the fray.

In last Lok Sabha polls, the BJP again denied a ticket to any of the locals and fielded V.K. Singh. Gaining from the Modi wave, the former General bagged the seat in 2014 with a record margin and later became a minister in the Modi government.

Singh, who filed his nomination papers on Monday, had announced that he will focus on development of his constituency but locals said he was busy in urban areas and could not focus on rural areas.

“The General will win for sure. But the people in the villages are not happy with him because he kept his focus on urban areas,” Nitesh a resident of Loni, said.

Rahul Chouhan, a resident of Crossing Republik, said that the General will secure victory because the BJP has a huge following in the constituency, but the fight will be tough because SP’s Bansal has the support of both the SP and the BSP supporters.

“Bansal’s selection is really a good choice of alliance parties and he would undoubtedly give a fight to the BJP,” Chouhan said.

Arun Tyagi, a property dealer and resident of Dundahera, told IANS that the BJP’s inner clash against outsider candidates may shrink its vote bank but there is no doubt about the party’s victory.

“V.K. Singh’s margin of vote is going to shrink this time because there is the issue of local and outsider candidate. The five MLAs of the BJP were waiting that the party would select one of them for the seat as they are the hard working candidates of the party.

“But the renomination of the General really has affected their blind faith in the party which is being seen on the ground. The issue is not new for this constituency,” Tyagi said.

Arpit Sirohi, who runs a medical shop in Raj Nagar, agreed.

“BJP will win from the seat but his vote margin will go down as Sharma of the Congress will cut its Brahmin votes and help Bansal,” Sirohi said.

Bansal, on the other hand, is from the Vaishya community and has a good hold in the business community, he added.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh announced details of the pharmacare plan Monday with health critic Don Davies at an event in Coquitlam, B.C.

article continues below

""This is a bold plan, it's going to take some courage. It's going to take us standing up to pharmaceutical industries and insurance companies who don't want us to bring this plan in, but we know this plan will work,"" Singh said.

The plan would see every Canadian covered for a list of prescription drugs determined by an arm's-length group of experts that it said would be protected from industry and political pressure. The agency would evaluate drugs for coverage based on what is scientifically proven to be safe and effective, and on the best value for money, the party said.

It would save families who don't currently have private drug coverage an average $550 per year and it would save employers about $600 per employee with extended health benefits, the party said.

Medications covered under the formulary would always have at least one option involving no upfront cost, in a move intended to nearly eliminate the co-payment system that the party said is a barrier to access. If there is a generic drug available but an individual chooses a brand name instead, there would be a $5 co-payment with exemptions for vulnerable populations.

It's time to make medication available to all Canadians who need it, Singh said.

""We can't afford not to do this at this point, given how difficult it is for so many people to get the medication they need,"" he said.

The legislation would be modeled on the Canada Health Act and provide an annual pharmacare transfer to the provinces and territories, with provinces paying about 60 per cent of the total cost and the federal government providing the remaining 40 per cent.

Davies, who represents Vancouver Kingsway, said the cost to provinces will be about the same as they are paying now.

It would cost the federal government an additional $10 billion annually on top of what the provinces already pay but Singh said it's worth it, pointing to overall cost saving identified in an analysis by the parliamentary budget officer.

The report says the total cost of a national pharmacare program would be $23.7 billion in 2020, representing a $4.2 billion savings each year over the current amount being spent on drugs in Canada.

Last week, Singh said an NDP government would expand the tax on investment profits as part of a package of measures aimed to pay for pharmacare, affordable child care and housing.

""Those measures would free up billions that would be available for this as well. The rest of financing would be a matter of discussion between the federal government and provinces and territories,"" Davies said.

The federal government taxes 50 per cent of profits made on investments, or capital gains, but the NDP wants to increase that threshold — known as the inclusion rate — to 75 per cent. It said that would raise about $3 billion in revenue.

The New Democrats have also talked about closing a stock-option loophole and cracking down on the use of bearer shares and foreign tax havens, which they say help the rich avoid paying their fair share of taxes to society.

Singh took aim at the Liberal government's pharmacare plan, saying it puts pharmaceutical and insurance companies ""in the driver's seat.""

""The Liberal government is proposing to bring in a U.S.-style patchwork system that's only going to increase the premiums families pay,"" he said.

In its budget last month, the Liberal government said Canada's pastiche of drug coverage, which comprises more than 100 public programs and 100,000 private insurance plans, is not well equipped to handle the increasingly expensive drugs now coming to market.

Drug spending in Canada is expected to surpass $50 billion by 2028, an expert panel has found.

In the budget, the Liberals promised a new agency to negotiate prescription drug prices for Canadians to try and drive down costs, a move it billed as an ""important step"" on the path to an eventual national pharmacare plan. It also promised to build a national formulary and promised to spend $500 million a year, starting in 2022, to subsidize drugs that treat rare diseases.","NDP unveils universal pharmacare plan, aims program delivery by the end of 2020",Times Colonist,https://www.timescolonist.com/sports/hockey/ndp-unveils-universal-pharmacare-plan-aims-program-delivery-by-the-end-of-2020-1.23776850

Meanwhile, his party colleagues ...","1 of 3 2 of 3

March 25 will go down as another dreadful day in the history of the world’s so-called largest democracy.

After all, an Indian court refused to give bail to a well-known human rights defender—Delhi University Professor G.N. Saibaba—who is being incarcerated under inhuman conditions despite being 90 percent disabled below the waist.

Saibaba was convicted and sentenced to life in prison after being accused of being a sympathizer of Maoist insurgents who are fighting a class war in the tribal areas of India.

He had been raising his voice against the repression of Indigenous peoples who are being forcibly evicted by big mining companies. These corporations are eyeing these people's traditional lands to extract rich minerals without their informed consent, yet with the backing of the Indian state.

The police have become a ready tool in the hands of these companies and frequently target any voice of resistance. Often, state repression forces Indigenous peoples to join the Maoist ranks to escape police brutality.

Since Saibaba was instrumental in mobilizing public opinion against the exploitation of tribal communities, he was arrested in 2014 after being branded as a Maoist sympathizer. He was given his life sentence in March, 2017 under the country's draconian laws.

Recently, his family applied for bail plea on medical grounds for the wheelchair-dependent Saibaba, who has suffered from 19 ailments.

Because he's paralyzed from the waist down, Prof. Saibaba relies on a wheelchair for his mobility. Gurpreet Singh

However, a court in Nagpur not only rejected his bail application, but refused to show any leniency, stating that he is ""mentally fit"" and is working as a ""think tank for Maoists"".

This is nothing but defiance to international bodies, such as the United Nations, whose experts have called for his immediate release on compassionate grounds. Last year, UN rights experts urged the New Delhi government to let him of jail in the light of his deteriorating health.

Now, contrast this with the Indian Supreme Court’s decision to grant freedom to a mass murderer on medical grounds.

About two weeks before Saibaba’s bail plea was rejected, the apex court in India granted bail to Babu Bajrangi—a Hindu extremist who convicted of being involved in the anti-Muslim pogrom of 2002 in Gujarat.

Thousands of Muslims were slaughtered in the state following the burning of a train carrying Hindu pilgrims.

More than 50 people died in the initial incident, which was blamed on Muslims by the ruling right-wing Hindu nationalist Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP).

Back in 2002, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was chief minister of Gujarat when the violence broke out. Though he was never charged, human rights activists and survivors of the violence believe he was complicit in the crime—an allegation he has consistently denied.

It is pertinent to mention that ever since Modi became prime minister in 2014, attacks on religious minorities and political dissidents have grown. Saibaba has also been critical of Hindu chauvinism.

Babu Bajrangi was a foot soldier of the Hindu right. He confessed his involvement in a media sting operation and was given life sentence for the crime. And yet, on March 7, the Indian Supreme Court granted him bail, citing his major bypass surgery and other medical conditions.

Video of The Truth: Gujarat 2002: Babu Bajrangi In 2007, the Indian magazine Tehelka used a hidden camera to capture Babu Bajrangi talking about the killing of Muslims in Gujarat in 2002.

The Saibaba case is not only a national shame for India where mass murderers like Babu Bajrangi continue to enjoy state patronage under the BJP government. It is also a matter of shame for countries like Canada that remain indifferent to such an important issue.

This is despite the fact that more than 1,000 people signed a petition concerning Saibaba, which was drafted by lawyer and human rights activist Amandeep Singh on behalf of Radical Desi Publications Ltd.

Singh is the former New Democratic Party candidate in Richmond-Queensborough.

The petition, which asks the Canadian government to intervene, was submitted to the Canadian House of Commons by two MPs, Sukh Dhaliwal and Peter Julian. But the Canadian government has refused to step in.

New Democratic Party Leader Jagmeet Singh issued a statement on social media in the past expressing his concern over the deteriorating health condition of Saibaba.

Meanwhile, his party colleagues, including former MP and strong human rights advocate Svend Robinson, have also spoken out for Saibaba in light of recent decision of Nagpur High Court.

Other groups that have come forward to raise their voice for Saibaba in Canada include the International League of People's Struggles, South Asian Network for Secularism and Democracy, East Indian Defence Committee, and the B.C. Federation of Labour. In addition, members of Alliance Against Displacement, the residents of seniors' home run by Progressive Inter Cultural Community Services in Surrey, Sikh Nation, and the World Sikh Organization have spoken out.

The Sikh community supported the cause by enthusiastically signing the petition at two Vaisakhi parades in Greater Vancouver in 2017. Members of Gurdwara Dashmesh Darbar and Sukh Sagar Sikh temple in New Westminster have also vehemently come out in favour of Saibaba's release.

On April 3, University of British Columbia students are going to organize “A Night of Awareness for G.N. Saibaba” at 6 p.m. at the Institute of Asian Research (1855 West Mall, Point Grey campus). It's an open event and anyone can attend.

Considering the sentiments of people who are concerned with the situation of Saibaba, the Canadian government that claims to be a human rights leader in the world needs to break its silence over growing repression in India.

It must stand up for Saibaba and others like him who are being punished for merely fighting for a just society.","Gurpreet Singh: Shame on Indian state for persecuting disabled, harmless scholar while patronizing mass killers",The Georgia Straight,https://www.straight.com/news/1221616/gurpreet-singh-shame-indian-state-persecuting-disabled-harmless-scholar-while

Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna announced Monday that the government is giving Loblaw Companies Ltd. $12 million to install lower-emission refrigeration systems in 370 of its stores.

The company says the new refrigeration systems will reduce its overall carbon footprint by 23 per cent.

The money is coming from a $450-million federal fund designed to help businesses, not-for-profit groups and lower-tier governments cut their emissions levels.

But the decision is rubbing many the wrong way, including the Canadian Federation of Independent Business which represents 110,000 members.

The CFIB believes financial relief like this should have gone to more deserving, smaller companies -- especially those hit by the new carbon tax which hit Ontario, New Brunswick, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba.

“We know that when it comes to the carbon tax that small businesses will be left holding the carbon tax bag,” Julie Kwiecinski, director of provincial affairs for Ontario at the CFIB, told CTV Toronto.

Back on April 1, the federal carbon tax went into effect for the four provinces because they didn’t create their own plans before the federal deadline.

Kwiecinski couldn’t believe how the feds had the “audacity” to seemingly ease the carbon tax for a big company like Loblaw.

She said she was told that the government would be rolling out relief for Ontario businesses, but in the meantime, Kwiecinski said her members are still waiting to hear something.

“How is that fair?” she asked.

OUTRAGE ONLINE

News of the funding also received a largely negative reaction on social media, with people questioning the merits of giving government money to Loblaw, a company which reported $221 million in profit in its fourth quarter.

Some Twitter users also questioned the wisdom of giving $12 million to a company that has admitted to taking part in an industry-wide, 16-year conspiracy to fix the price of bread.

Others noted that Loblaw shareholders recently voted down a motion to pay all of the company’s employees a living wage.

Opposition politicians also weighed in, with NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh saying the government should not be “prioritizing handouts to rich corporations” and People’s Party Leader Maxime Bernier saying “corporate parasites” prefer “lobbying politicians” to “offering a better product or service.”

Meanwhile, Environment Minister McKenna defended the announcement in Ottawa arguing small businesses could’ve applied too.

‘It was a competitive process so big business, small business, communities, schools, were entitled to apply,” she said.

Your anti-pipeline leader Jagmeet Singh, or your anti-pipeline ally Justin Trudeau?” Kenney said, following it up with an even better applause-getting line. “I know what Albertans are doing—they’re ...","In what’s become a brutally personal election campaign, Jason Kenney didn’t mind asking one very private question of Rachel Notley in public at a rally Monday in Medicine Hat.

“Who are you voting for in October, premier? Your anti-pipeline leader Jagmeet Singh, or your anti-pipeline ally Justin Trudeau?” Kenney said, following it up with an even better applause-getting line. “I know what Albertans are doing—they’re voting against both of those anti-jobs, anti-pipeline leaders.”

Surely, that’s a secret Notley is entitled to keep between herself and a small slip of paper this fall. But the question, and its political potency in her opponent’s stump speech, speaks to the unusually massive headaches Notley faces in terms of guilt by association. Sometimes, a provincial leaders has to distance herself or himself from a federal leader who’s a local liability. Notley has to shake off ties to two federal leaders.

Despite the structural ties between provincial and federal NDP parties, Notley has never had much to do with Singh—and doesn’t appear to have met him once since he became federal leader 18 months ago. She’s knocked Singh publicly on the pipeline file. But they share the party name and colour. Notley’s links to the Liberal Prime Minister are clearer, having worked collaboratively with him on carbon policy and the Trans Mountain pipeline approval throughout her term. As anti-Trudeau anger boiled over in Alberta over the last year’s pipeline delays and Kinder Morgan’s sale of the project to Ottawa, she’s had to step away. The only time Kenney actually mentions his rival by name—note the “premier” reference in the above quote— is when he refers, in typically sinister tones, to the “Notley-Trudea alliance.” While polls suggest Notley remains about as popular as Kenney does, one of the meanest things you can say about somebody in Alberta today is that they’re tight with Trudeau, a toxic name brand here.

A provincial NDP branch often relies on a large influx of New Democrats from other provinces to bolster their campaign ground troops. There’s precious little of that this year, given the tensions between Alberta NDP and their federal cousins, as well as B.C. Premier John Horgan’s anti-pipeline crew. And federal Liberal MPs in Alberta like Kent Hehr and Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi recognize the grief they’d cause by endorsing Notley. New Democrats are used to counting on their labour-friendly “brothers and sisters” during elections. Notley is uniquely isolated from the rest of Canada’s progressive political factions.

That sharply contrasts with her rival. Kenney counts conservative allies in premiers’ offices in Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, Manitoba and Ontario, pledging to join them in their carbon tax fight. Andrew Scheer’s federal Conservatives, Kenney’s former blue man group, enjoy 60-per-cent support in Alberta. Its MPs are campaigning to get United Conservative candidates elected, to further the national movement, while Michelle Rempel flew west last week to play the role of Notley at the UCP leader’s pre-debate rehearsals. Kenney can also get the sort of high-profile help Notley cannot—former Saskatchewan premier Brad Wall was a last-minute scratch as a rally “special guest” earlier in the campaign, while Laureen Harper, the former prime minister’s wife, introduced Kenney at a recent event. Scheer will co-headline a UCP rally in Calgary on Thursday. Don’t rule out a final-week cameo by Stephen Harper himself, who Tuesday morning wrote in a UCP fundraising letter that “the next week will be historic for our province. But don’t underestimate the challenge before the United Conservative Party.”

Appearances by Harper and Scheer are a gift to Kenney. Notley can only hope her out-of-province supporters stay quiet.

Pipeline posturing

Rachel Notley will start Day 22 of the campaign testifying by video at a Senate hearing on Bill C-48, the Trudeau government’s ban on oil tankers on B.C.’s north coast. Kenney argues that she was late to the booing game on that legislation, that she was with Justin Trudeau the day he announced the tanker ban was announced and didn’t protest. It’s true—she was busy that day in November 2016 celebrating Trudeau’s cabinet approval of the Trans Mountain pipeline at the same time.

Notley’s big campaign announcement on Monday was a strange one: that she expects Trudeau to grant Trans Mountain’s approval anew next month, following last summer’s dimming of the earlier green light by the Federal Court of Appeal. This seemed based largely on a mixture of hope and conversations with Ottawa. Kenney, whose campaign is based largely on deep distrust of the current government in Ottawa, pledged that on a UCP government’s Day 1 he’d proclaim into law the NDP’s bill that allows the province to “turn off the taps” to limit oil to an anti-pipeline province (read: British Columbia). This would move this nuclear option one administrative step closer to reality, an inflammatory gesture meant to make the B.C. government cower, rather than compromise. It will get angry Albertans excited, but will it work tactically? It’s already provoked the Horgan government’s counter-threat to block it in courts.

Andrew Leach, an energy economist and author of Alberta’s current climate strategy, wonders if Kenney’s victory makes it harder for Trudeau to get to “yes” on Trans Mountain.

Is there any way Trudeau can approve the pipeline if Kenney moves ahead with his promises on emissions policies? Not if he wants a shred of credibility on the climate change file. Kenney has pledged a rollback of carbon pricing in Alberta, a lawsuit challenging federal authority to regulate provincial emissions, a removal of the oil sands emissions cap and a halt to the phase out of Alberta coal-fired electricity. That alone will make it very difficult for Trudeau to approve the pipeline. Now imagine that Kenney, as premier of Alberta, is actively campaigning for Trudeau’s opponent in the upcoming federal election when Trudeau faces his decision. The prospects for the Trans Mountain pipeline get even more slim.(Maclean’s)

Voting begins today

Advance voting runs Tuesday through Saturday—for information on your nearest voting stations, click here. Elections Alberta is now letting voters cast advance ballots outside of their ridings, a measure that will help boost the popularity of early voting. In 2015, 16 per cent of all Xs were marked in advance, compared with 14 per cent in 2012. Eventually, election day may come to be known mainly as the last day to vote, and when they’re tallied.

Campbell Clark on the climate headache Doug Ford creates for Kenney: “At a closed-door first ministers’ meeting in December, Mr. Ford attacked Mr. Trudeau for setting a climate-change policy that assumes Ontario must do more than other provinces. Mr. Trudeau shot back that Mr. Ford’s position would mean shutting down the oil sands. As it happens, if Alberta were to make a 30-per-cent cut from 2005 levels, it really would be roughly the equivalent of shutting down the oil sands.” (Globe and Mail)

Kieran Leavitt on yet another candidate with deeply socially regressive views: “Another United Conservative election candidate is under fire for once suggesting that a Christian couldn’t support a government that endorses gay marriage, abortion, and the minimum wage — because they’re not biblical. Martin Long, the UCP candidate running in West Yellowhead, commented on a Facebook post in 2016 that questioned supporting a government that endorses these things.” (The Star Edmonton)

Justin Giovannetti on Rachel Notley’s brand of Tim Horton’s socialism: “Over her time in office, she has linked her party’s Prairie pragmatism with support for the oil industry – breaking most ties with the federal NDP in the process. Her brand of Tim Hortons socialism, focused on the blue-collar jobs created by pipelines and oil refineries, finds few friends in Toronto or Montreal. Once one of the federal party’s best fundraisers, she hasn’t made a call for the federal New Democrats since the party showed up for a 2016 conference in Edmonton and debated supporting a far-reaching document known as the Leap Manifesto, which calls for an end to the use of fossil fuels.” (Globe and Mail)

Keith Gerein on a pipe of empty promises: “Yet it’s quite a gamble for the NDP leader to now tell Albertans she has confidence in the reliability of a federal Liberal government whose standing in this province is about as bad as it’s ever been. The approach seems to play right into the “Notley-Trudeau alliance” attacks Kenney has been pushing repeatedly during the campaign. Not that Kenney is offering anything better in terms of policy.” (Edmonton Journal)

Sarah Rieger with a carbon tax reality check: “UCP Edmonton-West Henday candidate Nicole Williams tweeted last week the average family would save up to $1,150 a year. It was a claim Kenney repeated during the leaders’ debate. But Tombe says that’s pretty deceptive unless you’ve mixed up the average family with the One Per Cent. Just 1.2 per cent of households spent more than $1,000 due to the tax. ‘That is very misleading…. If you look at the full, overall average across households, you see that costs are nowhere near $1,150. That’s really the outlier, very top-end estimate, for very high-income households,’ Tombe says.” (CBC)",Rachel Notley and the political company she can’t keep,Macleans.ca,https://www.macleans.ca/politics/rachel-notley-and-the-political-company-she-cant-keep/

While I agree with the headline, I find Lawrie McFarlane’s column filled with recycled claims that I hear from the CBC’s political pundits. In an attempt to be impartial, the CBC has the usual crop of Conservative, NDP and Liberal pundits serving up their opinions with their party biases to gain political points.

McFarlane calls the improper phone call Jody Wilson-Raybould made a “hammer blow” because it “backed up everything she claimed.”

I would not call it a true conversation, but rather a manipulative device to control the result of the conversation. To me, it is an example of “the end justifying the means,” chillingly Orwellian.

Finally, I do agree with McFarlane when he says the Liberal hierarchy might wonder about the cost of keeping Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on. Not that the alternatives, Andrew Scheer and Jagmeet Singh, look capable of leading the country. I might have to look for another leader.

The Star has reported extensively on the effects of an industrial mercury dump 50 years ago upstream from Grassy Narrows First Nation, revealing that fish near the community are the most contaminated in the province, that there is mercury-contaminated soil and river sediment at or near the site of the old mill, and the provincial government knew in the 1990s that mercury was visible in soil and never told anyone inGrassy Narrows or nearby Wabaseemoong (Whitedog) Independent Nations.

New research reported in December indicated children in Grassy Narrows whose mothers ate fish at least once a week while pregnant are four times more likely to have a learning disability or nervous system disorder.

People in the community have also developed tremors, slurred speech, impaired hearing and tunnel vision, and lost muscle co-ordination, the Star has reported.

On top of that, the fishing industry in the region has been decimated.

Trudeau's jibe toward demonstrators at the Liberal fundraiser was greeted with criticism. Perry Bellegarde, National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations, posted on Twitter that Trudeau's comments ""unacceptable and offensive"" and said he should apologize directly to those involved.

Major shifts in party support are possible between now and the election.

At home and abroad, the public is restless.

In these conditions, the Green Party of Canada has a better chance to make a breakthrough than at any time since its founding in 1983. Its prospects are the best they have been since leader Elizabeth May first won the party’s only seat in the House of Commons in 2011.

Why do the Greens have a chance to ascend to major party in the House of Commons? The party represents an alternative without a lot of baggage. The Greens cannot be branded with old ideological labels. Many Canadians no longer see them as a one-issue party, as existential as that issue is. If they play their cards right, the Greens can appeal to a protest vote and a concerned moderate vote at the same time.

The Greens have a real chance to grab a chunk of the Liberal electorate. Justin Trudeau’s “sunny ways” image is gone for good.

""Justin Trudeau’s “sunny ways” image is gone for good."" — Tom Urbaniak, Political Insights

In 2015, the Liberal leader managed to rally, among others, motivated young voters and Indigenous Canadians, who also turned out in greater numbers. But Trudeau’s handling of the SNC Lavalin affair has been very poorly received by these constituencies. They entrusted him to do politics differently. The new ways were also supposed to include electoral reform, though the Prime Minister abandoned that promise.

These voters will not go to Andrew Scheer’s Conservative Party, perceived as being on the wrong side of history on core policies.

Meanwhile, the NDP has been struggling to define itself and its not-yet-sure-footed leader, Jagmeet Singh, who is finally in the House of Commons after winning the Burnaby South by-election on Feb. 24.

In many parts of Canada, party loyalties ran deeply in families and communities. No longer.

Prince Edward Island was once the poster child for traditional Liberal-Conservative politics. But now, many polls have the Green Party leading provincially in a tight contest ahead of the island’s April 23 election.

The province’s relatively strong economic indicators are not benefitting the governing Liberals as much as would have been the case in previous elections.

The Greens won’t need to form government on PEI to turn heads. A strong showing (multiple seats) would draw serious national attention ahead of the federal election.

Now let’s imagine another scenario. What if Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott eventually decide to run as Greens in the election?

Elizabeth May

This notion is not far-fetched. Both of the former senior ministers and expelled Liberals have a good rapport with Elizabeth May.

The profile and popularity of Wilson-Raybould and Philpott are huge political assets. Their candidacies would be a coup for the Greens.

For a Green breakthrough to have a chance of materializing, the party must immediately take candidate recruitment seriously. True, many invisible, unknown NDP candidates were unexpectedly elected in Quebec in 2011. But phantom or dubious candidates across Canada would be more of a liability to the upstart, less-established Greens than they were to the NDP.

The Green Party suffers from an impression that May, for all her strengths, has few obvious, strong successors or seasoned advisors. Besides Wilson-Raybould and Philpott, several “star candidates” would help.

And all candidates should be thoroughly vetted to avoid embarrassing the party in a campaign.

May, the longest serving of the party leaders, would also need a victory in the leaders’ debates, drawing attention to a comprehensive, costed, plausible platform.

I emphasize that a Green surge is not foregone or even probable. The Liberals will run with a “fear of Scheer” strategy. They will try to unite progressive and worried voters, however reticent they might be to back the Liberals this time.

And Andrew Scheer’s more-volatile candidates might play into Liberal hands with offensive or weird comments, or with old, embarrassing, ignorant social-media postings on immigration, minorities, Indigenous peoples, LGBTQ Canadians, abortion or climate change.

All told, these are strange, unstable times in all the established democracies. Voters are cranky and on edge. Or else they yearn for something modern, open and positive.

Election 2019 has surprises in store. There’s a chance that the performance of the Greens will be one of them.

GTS enables the sponsoring employers to get the application processing work done within two weeks.

GTS which is hailed by the experts as not just an immigration programme, but a strategy by companies to build diverse and innovative teams is divided into two categories.

Category A that requires the sponsoring employer (an innovative company) to be validated by a designated referral partner such as regional development agencies. The sponsoring employers must be looking to hire 'unique and specialised talent'.

While Category B necessitates the sponsoring employees to exhibit their willingness to fill in positions on the 'Global Talent Occupation List' and are required to hire highly skilled international workers. However, the specified wage requirements must be met in both cases.

About 100 allegations of coerced sterilization have surfaced across the Prairies and in Ontario and Quebec since 2017, when a lawsuit was filed in Saskatchewan.

Don Davies, NDP MP for Vancouver Kingsway, handed the letter to Goodale on Thursday after question period.

""I ... request that you use all legitimate tools at your disposal to ensure that the RCMP opens an investigation into all allegations of forced or coerced sterilization within its jurisdiction in Canada and lay appropriate charges against those responsible for committing them,"" wrote Davies in the letter.

In a statement, Goodale's office said coerced sterilization was ""a serious violation of human rights.""

However, the statement sidestepped Davies' request saying that the RCMP is one of 300 police forces across Canada and can't investigate crimes outside of its jurisdiction.

""We encourage anyone with specific criminal allegations to report them to the police of jurisdiction,"" said the statement. ""There is no time limit to report an assault to police.""

The minister's office said it recognized that ""survivors may feel barriers to reporting to police"" and that it would ""welcome Mr. Davies' collaboration to help explore any barriers so they can be broken down.""

NDP MP Don Davies wrote a letter urging Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale to trigger an RCMP probe into allegations of coerced sterilization. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)

Davies said in an interview that Ottawa was ignoring its international obligations as a party to the UN Convention Against Torture which requires governments to proactively investigate violations of human rights.

""We have over 100 women say they have been assaulted, with names, dates and places. We are obligated by international law to investigate,"" said Davies.

""The ministers of the Crown acknowledge that these are crimes but the police force and the minister of public safety don't think they need to investigate. It think this is a disgrace.""

UN committee called for probe

The UN Committee Against Torture released a report in December 2018 calling on Ottawa to investigate ""all allegations of forced or coerced sterilization"" and hold those responsible accountable.

The UN report also called on Ottawa to criminalize coerced sterilization but the federal government said it wouldn't amend the Criminal Code to outlaw it, saying existing criminal provisions were enough.

Davies previously wrote to RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki in February asking her to investigate allegations of coerced sterilization but she responded that a review of the federal police force's national database revealed no complaints of coerced sterilization. She wrote in her reply that she had asked detachment commanders to review their files and that the RCMP would also liaise with other police agencies on the issue.

Davies has said he was ""shocked"" by Lucki's response and wrote to Goodale in hopes the minister would step in and ensure the Mounties opened a probe into the allegations that primarily stem from Saskatchewan, which includes Goodale's riding.

""These are clear crimes under Canadian law, and police should act when evidence of a crime emerges regardless of whether a specific complaint has been lodged,"" said Davies, in his letter.

Latest allegation from December 2018

Earlier this month the Saskatchewan Health Authority said it was investigating an allegation of coerced sterilization that occurred at a Moose Jaw, Sask., hospital in December 2018. The Saskatoon police also confirmed to CBC News this month that it had investigated a separate complaint of coerced sterilization in 2018 but it led to no charges.

Greg Ottenbreit made a speech to an anti-abortion group in his constituency of Yorkton last week.

The Saskatoon StarPhoenix obtained a copy of the speech and published a story about it on Wednesday.

On Thursday, the NDP asked Ottenbreit in question period about whether his beliefs were preventing easier access to an abortion pill.

NDP MLA Vicki Mowat read a quote from Ottenbreit's speech into the record.

""The minister encouraged them to continue their 'battle' and he told the anti-choice gathering, 'I will continue to do what I can in my professional capacity,' "" Mowat said.

Premier Scott Moe responded by saying, ""there is a balance for all of us in this house when it comes to matters of conscience. We all have personal beliefs in this house.""

Ottenbreit did not take to his feet despite repeated attempts by the opposition.

""I was quite disappointed to see that he wouldn't stand and answer those questions in that space,"" Mowat said after question period.

""I think that members can have their own opinions. But when we're talking about a member who is standing up in a public forum and indicating that he will continue to fight the battle that is deeply concerning.""

Mowat said she wanted to know if Ottenbreit's personal beliefs may be the reason the government has been ""slow"" to add the abortion pill Mifegymiso to the provincial drug plan.

Mifegymiso is available by prescription in Saskatchewan but not covered under the province's drug plan. Medical students from the University of Saskatchewan have lobbied for it to be added to the plan. Minister of Health Jim Reiter says a review is underway.

Mifegymiso is a part of the province's drug plan. The health ministry is conducting a review on whether it should be universally covered. (CBC)

The drug, which can be used terminate a pregnancy up to nine weeks in, was added to the provincial plan two years ago.

Mowat said universal access to Mifegymiso ""reduces barriers increases access in rural and remote communities and is safer and less invasive"" than a medical abortion.

Reiter said the government's position on abortion is clear.

""Abortion is legal in Canada. We provide those services in this province Saskatchewan,"" Reiter said.

He added that he is support of reproductive rights and said the abortion question is a ""moot point"" because the Supreme Court of Canada ruled ""a long time ago.""

Ottenbreit defends views

Following question period, Ottenbreit spoke to reporters.

""It's not the first time I've been under fire for my pro-life views or my Christian faith and you know what I'm pretty solid in those views and I'm comfortable defending that.""

He said when he was referring to his ""professional capacity"" he meant his role as a MLA and not as a health minister.

""One of those duties of mine is to convey [constituents'] message to members of caucus and cabinet,"" Ottenbreit said.

He said in his time as minister he has received ""equal hassle"" from pro-choice and anti-abortion groups.

""I've been here for four-and-a-half years and I wouldn't think anybody could point to any one decision that my beliefs influenced the direction of government.""

On Mifegymiso, Ottenbreit said recommendations will be made by the ministry of health and it will ""come down to a financial and a cabinet decision.""

As the Alberta election is fought on issues of the economy and oil pipelines, the NDP has staked its re-election campaign on a major new social program: subsidized child care.

The proposal is a centrepiece of the NDP’s platform and represents new spending of $1.5-billion over the next five years, accounting for close to half of the party’s $3.2-billion in promises. The proposal would make $25-a-day child care available across the province by 2024 and add thousands of new spaces. It contrasts with the United Conservative Party, which does not mention child care in its platform.

The NDP frames its child-care promise in economic terms. The party predicts its plan would produce dividends above its cost as it boosts Alberta’s GDP. The party says the program would also narrow the work-force participation gap between women and men in Alberta. According to Statistics Canada, among people aged 25-54, Alberta has the highest rate of work-force participation among men in Canada (94 per cent) and the third-lowest among women (82 per cent). Quebec, with capped child-care fees since 1997, has the highest work-force participation rate for women (86.5 per cent).

“[Affordable child care] is critical for families and critical for the economy,” said Janet Eremenko, the NDP candidate in Calgary-Elbow. “The return on investment on child care, even in the most conservative estimates, is two-to-one.”

Ms. Eremenko and her husband have daughters aged 5 and 8. When the girls were younger, Ms. Eremenko worked part-time for a period because of child-care challenges. For several years, the couple paid more for child care than rent.

Four Canadian provinces set child-care fees for parents and provide operating funding. Quebec was the first, followed by Manitoba and Prince Edward Island. The most recent is Newfoundland and Labrador. The first three provinces have the lowest costs for parents in Canada and the price is falling in Newfoundland. Funding child care directly is “the right thing to do” in terms of spending options, said Martha Friendly, executive director at the Childcare Resource and Research Unit in Toronto.

Alberta and British Columbia are running pilot programs. In Alberta, there is a hint of the impact. Two years ago, the NDP started a pilot of its $25-a-day program and it now covers about 7,300 spaces out of 62,000. An annual survey by Ms. Friendly and economist David Macdonald of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives found the median cost of child care for toddlers in 2018 in Calgary fell 2 per cent to $47 a day. In Edmonton, costs also fell 2 per cent, to $40. Costs are highest in Vancouver at $64 a day and Toronto at $62. In Montreal, it is $8 a day. St. John’s in 2018 saw a drop of 24 per cent to $33.

The UCP declined an interview request. The party reissued a statement it first put out on March 25, when the NDP announced its plan.

“We cannot afford massive new spending,” the UCP said. The party would consider “additional support for child care in the future, when Albertans can afford it.”

Political scientist Keith Brownsey at Mount Royal University said the NDP’s child-care proposal aims to woo voters in the centre and centre-right of the political spectrum.

Story continues below advertisement

“What the NDP is trying to do is appeal to the suburbs, especially in Calgary,” Prof. Brownsey said. “You do that by appealing to parents.”

Beyond the cost of child care, the NDP proposes to increase the number of spaces to 75,000 from 62,000, along with measures such as more training for staff, expanded use of a new curriculum and support for centres outside of the standard 9-to-5 hours.

Edmonton resident Bridget Casey voted for the provincial Liberal Party in 2015. This time, she will vote NDP. Ms. Casey runs Money After Graduation, a financial-advice website. Ms. Casey, whose daughter is 1½, looked for a child-care space when she was six-months pregnant but got stuck on wait lists. She worked part-time longer than she had planned until she found a spot for her daughter when the girl was 1.

“The government missed out on income taxes because I couldn’t find child care,” Ms. Casey said.

She is speaking out on Twitter about child care during the election. “A lot of people are blind to the need,” she said. “First, men don’t think of it. But this isn’t an issue I even thought about until I was 31, when I was pregnant.”

Anita Turna, chair of Alberta Association of Child Care Operators, represents a group of privately owned centres. The association is concerned about how the NDP would roll out the new system if elected and whether private operators could struggle for a period. The provincial $25-a-day pilot has been limited to non-profit centres. But Ms. Turna supports affordable child care.

NDP Justice Critic Tracey Ramsey issued the following statement:

“Today, at the Justice Committee, Liberal MPs refused to launch an investigation into the leak of Chief Justice Joyal’s application for a seat on the Supreme Court of Canada by voting down an opposition motion. This leak, which was manipulated to smear the former Attorney General, was a flagrant attack on the independence of the judiciary and a severe form of disrespect of its work.

Liberals are compromising the integrity of our judiciary, namely the process for selecting judges in Canada. It is clear that they are trying to normalize the violation of the core principle of our justice system by avoiding any attempt to get to the truth about the leak.

With the case of the political interference in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, this is the second justice scandal that implicates the PMO in three months, and no one on the Liberals’ side is willing to deliver the truth to Canadians. This is wrong.

Canadians want a Prime Minister that works for them, not one who does everything in his power to protect his political interests and the interests of his rich friends.

Talk about the virtues of Mayor Nenshi in the local pub and you might just get an argument.

But here is Notley, in Calgary another day, and the premier tells us she has real momentum.

Now some sorts might think Notley is looking through orange-coloured glasses. Others may think she’s just trying to pump up the troops.

There has likely been some movement of opinion in Calgary, where the Notley NDP has to do well to win. A ThinkHQ poll this week showed the needle moving the NDP’s way.

Last month, the NDP were behind the United Conservatives by 21% in the Calgary area. Now they’re behind by 16%.

Er … that’s still a long way to go and the NDP are running out of runway.

And where is United Conservative leader Jason Kenney? He’s been spending a lot of time outside Calgary. He was in Fort McMurray Wednesday.

What do his numbers say? If the math was getting ugly, you’d think he’d camp out in Calgary to save the day.

Then again, maybe, just maybe, Notley does know something we do not know.

The campaign is not over.

“Everywhere I go I see it happening, Albertans from all walks of life coming together behind our campaign,” says the premier.

“Since the debate we actually have seen some pretty significant shifts in where people are and the level of enthusiasm in and around Calgary.”

Since the debate? She didn’t win the debate.

Notley has looked at some indicators, presumably including numbers.

“The race is tightening up considerably in Calgary. That’s why I’m spending all my time here. I am very bullish and quite optimistic about where things are going.”

The premier reaches out to PC voters and Alberta Party voters and Liberal voters because, says Notley, they have much in common and share the same core values and “won’t attack minorities.”

For Notley, minorities means LGBTQ individuals and people “of certain religions.”

By the way that last crack about Kenney attacking minorities isn’t mud-slinging, according to the premier.

She says people need to know if any of those on Kenney’s team “go against the fundamental values of the majority of Albertans.”

In Notley’s playbook, if you see the name Jason Kenney, it means “deep ties to extreme fringes” and “troubling views” and “discriminatory attitudes.”

Horrible things. Yes, the NDP see Kenney as not just a political opponent. They see him as horrible, vile.

While we’re in scenic Deer Ridge, Notley talks about the probe into the United Conservative leadership race Kenney won.

The premier says she will create jobs and Kenney won’t. She will get a pipeline and Kenney will just screw things up.

“Mr. Kenney has a plan to do a big press conference where he has a temper tantrum and then really nothing for a second day,” says Notley.

And you remember when Notley said Alberta was “the embarrassing cousin no one wants to talk about.”

Kenney quotes the line a lot and Notley says the UCP leader is misrepresenting her on purpose.

Notley says she wasn’t calling Alberta the embarrassing cousin. She was embarrassed by the record of the former PC provincial government on protecting the environment.

One thing is certain. There is hope on the NDP side.

Who thought they’d win last time? Who counted out the PCs in 2012 only to see the Wildrose vote tank in the literal dying days of that campaign?

“Alberta elections, they have a way of surprising people and I think this one might just do that as well,” says Notley.

Earlier this week, former prime minister Stephen Harper fired off a letter to United Conservative supporters cautioning them not to underestimate the challenge for Team Kenney in the critical last week of the ballot battle.

Harper said the NDP are “desperate” and “their friends within the media and special interests are going to do everything possible to attack the United Conservatives.”

Kenney brings us back to the morning after the night before, the morning of May 6, 2015, when Alberta turned NDP orange.

“A lot of Albertans woke up the day after the last election a little astonished to see we ended up with a socialist government,” says the UCP leader.

“I think Albertans don’t want to do that again.”

This comes after MP Jane Philpott said in the House of Commons that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau violated her rights and the rights of Jody Wilson-Raybould when he expelled them from Liberal caucus without a full caucus vote.

""Now that the issue has been put out there for public discussion I think it is worth noting and worth remembering that Mr. Singh ignored the law when he threw me out of the NDP caucus,"" Weir said.

Weir said the question of legality stems from the Parliament of Canada Act, which sets out a model rule for expulsions from caucus.

""The NDP caucus voted to not adopt that model rule in 2016, which was far later than required by law and therefore of questionable legitimacy,"" he said.

""The reason the NDP caucus voted not to adopt those safeguards is that we were assured by our leadership that the only reason someone would be expelled is if they were subject to criminal charges and then a conviction.""

Weir was expelled after a harassment investigation but no charges were laid.

'Worth calling attention to'

He said the Speaker has ruled that he will not enforce the Parliament of Canada Act and the section in the Act that deals with caucus expulsions is not subject to judicial review.

""So the speaker isn't going to enforce the law and the courts can't enforce the law. So I'm not really sure how it could be pursued in a more formal way. But I think it is worth calling attention to the fact that the law was ignored by NDP leader Jagmeet Singh in removing me from the NDP caucus,"" Weir said.

We were assured by our leadership that the only reason someone would be expelled is if they were subject to criminal charges and then a conviction. - Regina MP Erin Weir

He said he also feels due process was lacking in his expulsion, noting that he didn't receive written notice and a caucus vote was not held.

""It's important to have that process because it creates enough of a delay that the MP at risk of being expelled would have an opportunity to make their case to the caucus…. There was no opportunity for me to actually go to caucus and tell my side of the story and explain what happened and make the case as to why I should remain a member of caucus.""

He said it's important to keep some power in the hands of MPs, ""rather than concentrating it all in the leader's hands.""

Weir said that since the accusations surfaced, he has participated in sensitivity training and he's apologized for his actions.","Erin Weir questions legality of expulsion from NDP caucus, points to Philpott",Yahoo News Canada,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/erin-weir-questions-legality-expulsion-230411981.html

Speaking at a southeast ...","The NDP is narrowing the gap with its UCP foes in Calgary, says Rachel Notley, who’ll spend much of the rest of the campaign in the city seen as crucial to the race.

Speaking at a southeast Calgary daycare on Wednesday, Notley said there are indications her party has gained some momentum in the city, where polls have consistently shown the UCP dominates.

And while she also has appealed to supporters of the Liberals and Alberta Party to come over to the NDP to ensure the UCP’s defeat, she said there’s reason to believe that’s already happening.

“We’re actually hearing from lots of Calgarians … people who may not have voted for us last time but who are turning to us this time because they trust us to look out for what matters to families in Calgary,” said Notley.

“Alberta elections have a way of surprising people and this one might do just that, too — everywhere I go, I see that happening.”

Those who once voted PC or who now support the Alberta Party and the Liberals have a home with the NDP, said Notley because “you don’t feel quite right in voting for Jason Kenney because of his risky economic plans and deep ties to extremist fringes.”

“We won’t attack minorities,” said Notley, adding UCP candidates who’ve displayed intolerance shouldn’t be welcome into the legislature.

And she appealed to Calgarians’ fiscal concerns, saying the Trans Mountain pipeline is on the verge of approval but that UCP Leader Jason Kenney’s “temper tantrums” embodied in threatened legal and economic action against other governments puts that in doubt.

The NDP leader will be in Calgary for almost the rest of the race, which culminates in the April 16 vote.

As of Wednesday, the premier has been in Calgary for 11 of 23 days in the campaign.

The most recent polls conducted in early April have shown the UCP leading comfortably provincewide. In Calgary, that advantage has varied considerably, from 16 percentage points to as few as nine.

Notley’s probably correct in saying her party’s making gains in Calgary, “but I don’t know if it’s enough momentum to get them past the finish line,” said Mount Royal University political science professor Duane Bratt.

Kenney’s time spent recently boosting candidates in Calgary ridings like Bow, Glenbow and Peigan could suggest the UCP leader isn’t entirely confident in winning them, said Bratt.

“The fact the NDP is feeling more optimistic in Calgary is from some of the doubts they’re putting in people’s minds about Mr. Kenney,” he said.

Those concerns have included bigoted comments by UCP candidates, the so-called kamikaze candidate scandal surrounding the party’s 2017 leadership race and that party’s planned corporate tax cut.

As for attracting votes from other political camps, Bratt said there might be potential in a group shrouded in some mystery.

“Where did the progressive wing of the PC party disappear to? They haven’t all gone to the UCP or Alberta Party,” he said.

But anger over an ongoing economic slump and high unemployment in the city continue to dog NDP fortunes, added Bratt.

On Tuesday, Kenney told reporters he’s spent more time in the Edmonton area and elsewhere than Calgary for a reason.

“We’re very confident with the support we’ve had in Calgary,” he said. “We’ve always seen Edmonton as being more competitive.”

On Tuesday, Kenney literally waded into the Calgary anger that’s fuelling his campaign when he addressed a noisy pro-pipeline rally in the city’s downtown from the back of his trademark blue pickup truck.

“I could see faces filled with anxiety and those are the survivors, unlike their colleagues who were laid off,” he said minutes later at a press conference.

“I’m just an Albertan who wants to get us back to work.”

He made no apologies for his vow to get tough with B.C. and the federal governments, which he says are preventing the export of Alberta bitumen to tidewater.

“We have defined the need for a more assertive approach,” said Kenney.

It doesn’t.,"The Opposition NDP wants Manitobans to believe a report released last week on illicit drug use in Winnipeg recommends safe injection sites should be established in Winnipeg.

It doesn’t.

“Safer Consumption Spaces,” a 68-page report penned by a working group whose members include government agencies such as the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority as well as addictions groups and Indigenous organizations, doesn’t make any recommendations at all. It draws no conclusions except to say there’s some support for safe injection sites but also reservations.

It includes the views and experiences of 38 drug users who were consulted for the report and reflects the varied opinions of a handful of service providers who were also interviewed for the study.

Despite that, the NDP are trying to characterize the study as one that recommends the opening of safe injection sites, while criticizing the Pallister government — which is opposed to the sites — of ignoring evidence from front-line service providers.

“Experts were clear they support a safe consumption site,” NDP justice critic Nahanni Fontaine said in the legislature this week.

Some did. But others also raised questions about them. Some service providers wanted more evidence and others wondered if resources could be better used elsewhere. To say the study found that service providers “supported safe consumption sites” is simply inaccurate. That’s not what the report says.

“It’s definitely something we need in this city, like, yesterday,” one service provider said in the report.

But not everyone agreed.

“There are many competing needs for addiction and mental health services in Manitoba at this time,” said another service provider. “Careful consideration should be made regarding the most effective use of sparse resources in terms of having the biggest impact.”

Some providers wondered if resources wouldn’t be better used for “upstream services” like housing instead of for safe injection sites. There was a recognition by some providers that there are limited resources to support people with addictions and that decisions on how to use them should be based on local evidence.

Meanwhile, all working group members were invited to participate in the study, the report said. But not all did. Interviews were conducted with “formal” and “informal” service providers and other organizations that work with drug users. Only 11 people from seven organizations took part. It wasn’t a large group and the report acknowledges it wasn’t necessarily a representative sample.

“This resulted in an over-representation of some organizational perspectives, which may have skewed our findings,” the report says. “Similarly, the absence of some organizations may have left some perspectives out of the analysis.”

And the perspectives that were presented were mixed. There was a consensus that drug users need more support and many saw safe consumption sites as one of many tools that could help. But not everyone did.

“Provider participants expressed that they wanted more local evidence about whether SCS will work in Winnipeg,” said the report. “Some participants believed that there is not enough local evidence to inform the applicability of SCS in Winnipeg, although others felt Winnipeg was similar enough to other places where SCS have been shown to be effective.”

There wasn’t even a consensus among SCS proponents for the reasons they supported them. Some said safe consumption sites are important to respond to drug overdoses. Others said the main benefit is to provide drug users with a place to consume illicit drugs without fear of being arrested by police, an important distinction that informs the debate on whether SCS are appropriate for Winnipeg.

So no, the report does not say, or even suggest, all service providers support opening safe injection sites in Winnipeg.

Unlike the polished, visually appealing sites the governing NDP and opposition UCP have launched to attack each other in recent weeks, this one has the black-and-white esthetic of a Windows 95 text document. However bland and antiquated its look, though, it inserts a set of damning allegations into the middle of this Alberta election campaign.

The site, not-so-artfully named after the person running it, was launched earlier this month by lawyer and former power executive Robert Hemstock, who is currently suing the Alberta government, Deputy Premier Sarah Hoffman and NDP Premier Rachel Notley’s top spokesperson Cheryl Oates for defamation. It breaks down in lawyerly detail what Hemstock considers to be a series of mistakes the NDP government made as it changed the rules governing the province’s deregulated electricity market — moves he claims cost Alberta power consumers $2 billion, a niggling scandal of the NDP’s first term.

Hemstock filed the defamation suit in July 2018, based on events dating as far back as 2015, when Notley’s New Democrats were elected. The website went live after he filed a new affidavit on March 29.

He launched the suit because he believes the government unfairly blamed him for a series of contract cancellations in the power market in 2015 and 2016, based on a clause he helped negotiate into those contracts in 2000.

He launched the website because he wants to “expose” the details of the controversial episode, and because he believes the public doesn’t understand how or why those cancelled contracts ended up saddling consumers “with an estimated $2 billion in unnecessary costs” — and how the province could have avoided those mistakes in order to save Albertans money.

Both the suit and the website also appear to be an attempt by Hemstock to clear his name.

“It’s also about how our elected representatives in the Alberta Government used their position of power and access to taxpayer funds to attempt to achieve their political objective of avoiding accountability,” the website charges.

Hemstock declined to comment on the site because his defamation suit is still before the court but the affidavit filed March 29 contains a new allegation that the government has not provided all the documents requested in the case.

“That a decision was made to defame me, by implicating me as the cause of the loss of approximately $2 billion to electricity consumers, with no records showing how that decision was arrived at discloses the defendants have not discharged their obligation to provide all relevant material records,” Hemstock states in the affidavit.

“I’m not aware of anything new being filed, but because the matter is before the courts we won’t be commenting,” said Oates, who was Notley’s communications director before the writ dropped and is working on the NDP campaign.

It is a scandal. It is absolutely a scandal

Alberta’s electricity sector is unique in Canada and is confusing even for Albertans. The province has no Crown corporation like BC Hydro, SaskPower or Hydro Quebec that produces and distributes power to its residents. Instead a jumble of private-sector companies and some city-owned utilities like Calgary’s Enmax Corp. own the power plants, transmission lines and distribution networks while multiple provincial government agencies regulate or oversee the market.

In the middle of 2015, the province’s then-new NDP government increased the price industrial companies had to pay for emitting carbon in the province, which triggered an opt-out clause for many of those power producers, letting them cancel their contracts to purchase power in the province.

On his website, Hemstock called the price increase “a mistake” that government ought to have known would trigger the opt-out clause. Further mistakes, Hemstock alleges, include trying to deflect blame for the cancelled contracts, and specifically, going “on the offensive” by blaming him.

The government called the opt-out clause the “Enron clause,” after Enron Canada had asked for it to be added before that now-defunct company agreed to bid on power contracts.

Hemstock was in-house counsel for Enron Canada in the late 1990s when Alberta was in the midst of deregulating its electricity market and when the contracts in question were signed. He later joined Enmax as an executive.

In his defamation suit, Hemstock said he was employed by Enron Canada and “was not employed by nor did he advise (parent company) Enron Corporation in relation to any financial reporting obligations in the United States of America, at any time.”

Enron Corp. — rather than Enron Canada — collapsed amid a corporate scandal that included misleading investors and falsifying financial information.

In December 2015, Enmax became the first company to make use of the opt-out clause and handed the money-losing contracts it was holding over to an arms-length government agency called the Balancing Pool.

In the following months, other money-losing power contracts were also handed to the Balancing Pool, shifting the potential losses from the contracts from companies directly onto Albertans.

One power executive, speaking on condition of anonymity because they didn’t want to run afoul of the government or comment on the defamation case, said the case should be “a cautionary tale when it comes to political interference in the electric market” because electricity “is a complicated but essential commodity.”

The issue stirred up controversy in Alberta — though many residents don’t fully understand what happened — as the government moved to support the Balancing Pool through a loan.

“What I can’t fully grasp, and perhaps this is a failing on my part in opposition, is how it is that $2.2 billion has gone into the Balancing Pool, backstopped by Alberta taxpayers, and it isn’t the single greatest scandal that Albertans have seen,” said Greg Clark, then leader of the Alberta Party, in the province’s legislature in May 2017. “It is a scandal. It is absolutely a scandal.”

A decision was made to defame me

Industry groups have also sharply criticized how the government handled the series of cancelled contracts.

“Albertans should be concerned about the government’s $2.25-billion loan to the Balancing Pool and the mounting interest cost (about $400 million), which will need to be repaid,” the Independent Power Producers Society of Alberta said in a release.

The controversy is not a key focus in the current Alberta election, partly because it’s so complicated, but it is a point that parties have included in their platforms.

The UCP has promised that, if it forms government, it will “Ask the Auditor General of Alberta to conduct a special duty audit of the NDP-incurred financial losses on the power purchase agreements held through the Balancing Pool.”

In an emailed statement, the UCP said the NDP has not been transparent about their electricity market changes.

Hemstock’s defamation case is expected to drag on long after the April 16 election. He believes the government blamed him for the power contracts being handed over to the Balancing Pool.

In their statement of defence, the provincial government, Hoffman and Oates state they never referenced Hemstock directly and “as such, the statements cannot be defamatory or cause harm to the plaintiff, as alleged or at all.”

The defence also states that comments were made “as senior government officers in the performance of their official duties and are protected by absolute privilege” and their comments were “based on true facts about matters of public interest and are fair comment on a matter of public interest.”

Population: 45,519

Eligible voters: 30,886

One of the NDP’s most vocal cabinet ministers is hoping for second term in the Edmonton-Glenora riding.

Sarah Hoffman, who served as deputy premier and health minister in Rachel Notley’s government, became the riding’s first NDP MLA in 2015. Since the 1970s, the riding has oscillated between Liberal and Progressive Conservative MLAs. Hoffman snagged a commanding 68.4 per cent of the vote when the NDP’s orange wave washed over Alberta’s cities.

In 2017, provincial electoral boundaries were redrawn, and the riding expanded eastward to include the Prince Rupert neighbourhood and the yet-to-be-developed Blatchford area, where the City Centre airport once sat.

As the United Conservative Party leads in the polls provincially, hoping to capitalize on less right-wing vote splitting, could the party’s Marjorie Newman make inroads in Edmonton-Glenora? After moving to Canada 13 years ago from the Philippines, Newman works as a regulated immigration consultant helping families resettle in the country — a job she says helps families reunite and achieve their dreams.

Hoffman and Newman are up against the Alberta Party’s Glen Tickner, a senior economist with the Worker’s Compensation Board, and roofing business owner Clint Kelley of the Alberta Independence Party.

For the first time since 1975, no Liberal candidate is running in the riding.

In 2015, the Wildrose and PC party together garnered 24.9 per cent of the vote in Edmonton-Glenora. However, PC MLA Heather Klimchuk preceded Hoffman, winning the 2012 ballot against former NDP stalwart and past party leader, Ray Martin.

Land of opportunity

Although they may disagree on how to do it, three candidates say they’re motivated by a calling to make life better for Albertans.

Kelley could not be reached for comment.

Alberta needs to wean itself off oil revenues and focus on its other advantages, such as its young population and entrepreneurial drive, said Tickner, who moved to the province from B.C. 30 years ago. He’s “appalled by the NIMBY (not in my backyard) attitude” of British Columbians resisting oil pipelines running to the coast from Alberta, he said in an interview.

Alberta’s rising debt is no lost cause, he said, and he sees no need for austerity.

“The positive things are there,” Tickner said. “I really do think they’re there, we just have to take advantage of them.”

Newman said in a written statement she chose to settle in Alberta because it was the “land of promise and opportunity.” She said that status has been at risk since the NDP government came to power in 2015.

“I have come to love my new home Alberta,” she wrote. “I’m determined to help restore Alberta to that promised land of opportunity I once knew.”

Hoffman, who had been an Edmonton public school trustee since 2010, said NDP Leader Rachel Notley approached her to run in the last provincial election when she was frustrated by proposed freezes to education funding in the growing school district. Notley told Hoffman she should run for office and try to change it, so she did.

On the doorsteps, seniors told Hoffman they want more long-term care and dementia facilities, she said. A mom with a three-month-old baby told her she was excited about the NDP’s plans to expand $25-a-day daycare across Alberta.

Employees at Woman’s Health Options, a clinic in the riding that offers abortions, have thanked Hoffman more than once for creating a “bubble zone” preventing protestors from harassing them and their patients, Hoffman said.

“My commitment is to be a fierce fighter the people I work for,” she said.

Reason for running: “I’m running to ensure our loved ones have the health care they need and that our kids are learning in good schools. From Edmonton Public School Board chair to being your local MLA and minister of health, I’ve committed to ensuring families have the support and services they need. We must keep our province moving forward to build one Alberta that sticks together as our economy recovers.”

Priorities: Investing in public health care — we cancelled the Progressive Conservatives’ unfair health premiums and expanded home care to support our seniors. Fighting to ensure our kids get the best possible start in life by investing in new, modernized schools and hiring teachers. Supporting women and families by expanding midwifery and maternal health care.

As a fourth-generation southern Alberta rancher in a region that has elected right-of-centre candidates for 50 years, he is running as the NDP candidate for Livingstone Macleod in the provincial election.

It makes him a rarity.

The constituency stretches from north of High River, west to the British Columbia border and south to the United States border, an area of about 3.5 million acres, most of it farm and ranch land.

Gardner’s Bluebird Valley Ranch sits in the middle of the northern third, amid picture-postcard-pretty property west of Nanton.

“Do the right thing, not the Right thing,” quips Gardner, acknowledging the usual direction of local politics.

If he has surprised his friends and neighbours with his choice of political party, Gardner isn’t inclined to say so.

“Ranchers’ wives frankly like (Alberta NDP premier) Rachel Notley and many, many, many, very, very, very conservative friends of mine stare at their boots and admit that they like Rachel. They think she is trying to do the right thing and Jason (Kenney, leader of the United Conservative Party) isn’t as trustworthy.

“I firmly believe that if Rachel Notley was a conservative male running this government, that we would all be talking about the best conservative government in a generation or two.”

Protection of public lands and developing a system that pays landowners for carbon sequestration are the projects nearest to his heart, said Gardner in a March 22 interview. He has been working for years on both issues as a rancher and as a councillor and reeve with the Municipal District of Ranchland.

“I’ve been fighting for a framework to allow farmers and ranchers to participate in that market, to get paid directly from big emitters and store the carbon in their own farmland where it will do good,” he said.

“I’ve been working on it for 10 years now, and I believe the environment minister is ready to move on this. Actually, I know she is.”

A system for ecosystem services payments to farmers and ranchers would generate millions of dollars, he said, and would allow them to support services and infrastructure in Alberta’s small towns, preserving them in the process.

Gardner said his choice of party resulted in large part from his admiration for Notley’s leadership and her government’s approach to difficult issues, among them passage of the Enhanced Protection for Farm and Ranch Workers Act, better known as Bill 6.

That legislation caused widespread protest from farmers in the early days of the NDP government. Gardner said it has provided important protection for farm workers.

He said he also respects the NDP for implementing the carbon tax as a response to help mitigate climate change. Carbon taxes might protect Canada from tariffs on domestic goods that could be imposed by other countries that have taken their own measures to respond to climate change, he said.

“The amount of work that this government has got done is absolutely staggering and any time you’re doing that much change, there’s going to be feathers ruffled,” said Gardner.

He’s also worried about the potential sale of public lands proposed by the UCP as a way to reduce public debt. Gardner said many ranchers make use of public land and are good stewards as a result. Sale of that land leaves it open to abuse, said Gardner.

MLAs are in the second week of an increasingly bitter argument about a wage differential the NDP is establishing in the social-services network.

A funding plan for the fiscal year just starting gives unionized workers in the sprawling care network a considerably bigger raise than the one scheduled for the non-union people. In blended agencies, the two classes of employees, the vast majority of them women, often work side-by-side, doing the same jobs. They work in day cares, home care, crisis lines, social housing, treatment services, counselling, immigrant settlement, special-needs support and other fields.

Advocates in the sector are deeply unhappy about the unfairness. They organized a small demonstration this month on the steps of the legislature. That prompted questions in the house that have persisted.

So far, there have been no coherent answers from NDP cabinet ministers about the policy. The issue is complicated by the bizarro world MLAs currently inhabit. Opposition B.C. Liberals short-changed the sector several times during lean budget years, and are now purporting to ride to the rescue of the same people they stiffed. New Democrats spent those same years objecting to all that mistreatment, but now look to be heading down the same road.

So the matching histories of the two now-reversed sides are being recounted to the point that they’re dominating the argument. Cabinet ministers have dodged almost every question by reaching back into history and pointing out the Liberal track record from years gone by.

The cabinet’s answers include extended-play reminders that the Liberals tore up contracts, diminished the value of workers, slashed the community-living budget and rolled back wages.

“The litany of unfair treatment of the service providers by that side is 16 years long,” said Social Development Minister Shane Simpson.

Actually, it will be 17 and counting if the policy stands.

Funding has been established to cover two per cent raises for the next three years that were negotiated. Non-unionized workers will get a similar increase.

But additional special funding for “low-wage redress” is available to cover only the unionized staff. The raises that money will provide will vary widely throughout the sector, but average about four per cent a year.

That leaves about 17,000 non-union workers behind, which is roughly half the people in the overall sector. It will be a $4-an-hour gap in some agencies by the end of three years.

The policy for the past dozen years has been to match non-union wage hikes to union-negotiated raises. But that has apparently been shelved.

Leaders in the field are warning the gap will have widespread, damaging implications.

Simply unionizing would restore parity. But the field is so complicated and intertwined that it’s not an option for everyone or every agency.

What’s more likely is that workers will quit the lower-paying jobs and move to the higher-paid ones, leaving some agencies in deep trouble. It could also create chaos in some outfits where union and non-union staff work closely together at the same jobs.

The NDP has budgeted big increases in targeted areas to provide more and better social services. So the overall sphere will likely grow, but so will the festering problem they have created with the institutionalized wage gap.

It’s not just opposition Liberals who aren’t getting answers. The government has ignored a couple of letters from leaders in the field warning them about the problem. And the convoluted official communiqué that confirms the differential came after some verbal reassurances that the existing policy was unlikely to be changed.

The lack of answers is starting to wear thin.

Opposition Leader Andrew Wilkinson said Tuesday: “Across the way, they stare into their laps. They play with their gadgets on the table. They’re not sure what to say, because this is a flagrant example of discrimination.”

And NDP resentment about being grilled by people with a spotty record in the field is also on display.

After Wilkinson pictured Simpson meeting workers in his riding and hanging his head in shame, Simpson said he’d be happy to take the stroll. “Then he can take me to the West Vancouver Yacht Club for tea afterwards.”

And, amid this political soap opera that is so blatantly transparent in its partisanship, we should also pause and remember that no political party is innocent in this land title tumult.

article continues below

The current NDP government certainly deserves to have its knuckles rapped for making an utter mess of this issue.

To recap, the two Kamloops B.C. Liberal MLAs — Todd Stone and Peter Milobar — were doing their jobs well when, a couple of months ago, they mentioned hearing rumours the Kamloops land title office might be closing.

It turns out they were on to something. While the office isn’t scheduled to close (yet), land title officials finally confirmed to media that documents stored here would be moving to Victoria and that staff in Kamloops would be leaving their offices in the Kamloops Law Courts to a yet-to-be-determined location in the city.

In a March 21 email to KTW reporter Sean Brady, the Land Title and Survey Authority said:

“We are currently seeking alternate space in Kamloops, which will be a smaller, modern office in keeping with the quality of our other land title offices in Victoria and New Westminster.

“The Kamloops hard copy records will be moving to our state-of-the-art vault space in Victoria, where they will be conserved as required. There will be no reduction in staff in our Kamloops office.”

That was close as anybody has come, as far as I can tell, in trying to find out why the records are being moved.

That they are being moved without consultations with local MLAs, city council or First Nations in the area is offensive.

And it has prompted Whispering Pines Clinton Indian Band Chief Michael LeBourdais to launch legal action this week to stop the movement of the original documents.

While the current NDP government, from Premier John Horgan down to Forests Minister Doug Donaldson (whose ministry administers land title registries), should be criticized for this boondoggle, let’s not forget that other governments under different political flags have done exactly the same thing with land title offices — including the B.C. Liberals.

For more than a century, there had been seven land title offices in the province: Kamloops, Nelson, Prince George, Prince Rupert, New Westminster, Vancouver and Victoria.

Following the NDP’s election in 1991, those seven offices began to be reduced, with Vancouver records moving to New Westminster, Prince Rupert records moving to Prince George and Nelson records moving to Kamloops.

In 2003, under the B.C. Liberals, the Prince George land title office was closed and all its records moved to New Westminster. At that time, the B.C. Liberals also announced plans to close the Kamloops and Victoria land title offices and move those records to New Westminster.

(So, as we can see, such decisions are not exclusive to particular political parties.)

But, as a Kamloops Daily News article of April 5, 2003, notes, then-premier Gordon Campbell was praising a plan by Kamloopsians — including then-mayor Mel Rothenburger — to convince the province to instead move the New Westminster records to Kamloops and use this city as a centralized land title registry.

Alas, Vancouver city council and others in the Lower Mainland balked at the plan, leaving the land title grouping as we see it today.

This brief history illustrates that how dastardly a government decision is remains predicated on which side of the legislature aisle one sits.

Joe Byrne

Joe Byrne said this transition would add 9,766 jobs over five years.

These will be good jobs with decent wages across many sectors and they are expected to pay between $15 and $25 an hour, he said, adding the Island must commit to a strategy based on sustainable development.

“Not only because it is the right thing to do, but because it will also help ensure our long-term prosperity as a province in a competitive modern global economy,” said Byrne at an announcement Wednesday at the District 12 campaign office in Charlottetown.

Byrne said the party will move the Island’s economy to zero carbon pollution by investing in public transit, retrofitting and renewable energy sources.

The NDP’s plan for a Green New Deal would make a $70.8-million annual investment in renewable energy, focusing on wind and tidal power, creating well-paying jobs in the clean energy economy and reducing the province’s reliance on energy imports.

The Green New Deal also includes a $60 million annual investment in energy efficiency, including home and building retrofits and insulation upgrades, saving the average Island family 30 per cent on power bills.

The NDP will also annually invest $66 million in public transportation to reduce fares and expand access within Charlottetown and add additional urban-rural public transit routes going across the province.

At a glance

NDP MLAs will fight to:

Convert 100 per cent to non-toxic, renewable energy generation within 15 years

Develop a rebate system, progressive-like income tax, to compensate low-income people for the extra costs they incur from carbon-pricing.

Ensure public investment in measures to replace carbon-producing activities (power generation, heating/cooling of buildings, etc.)

Support innovation in sustainable engineering and architecture

Cultivate geothermal energy, heat pumps and next-generation technology

Modernize building codes and ensure they keep up with developing technology

Have a clear plan to increase retrofits for existing buildings (private and public) by enhancing - for example, the Home Insulation Rebates program to make it more useable for more low-income households

Increase incentives to encourage people to purchase electric or other low-pollution vehicles

Increase electric powered public transit and access to consistent transit between Charlottetown and Summerside.

Publicly led development of Island-wide charging stations for electric vehicles.

Lethbridge’s public transit union is endorsing Rachel Notley and the NDP to form the next government of Alberta.

The Amalgamated Transit Union Canada Local 987 in Lethbridge says no government has done more to support public transit than Premier Notley, and no other provincial party in this current election has as extensive a commitment to public transit as the NDP.

“The United Conservative Party does not care about public transit in any meaningful way. We’ve moved ahead so far in the last four years that we cannot afford to move backwards,” warned Travis Oberg, president of Amalgamated Transit Union Local 987, which represents transit workers in Lethbridge. “The UCP’s austerity agenda will throw every improvement we’ve made to public transit in Lethbridge out the window.”

The union cites the NDP’s investment in transit infrastructure the past four years as the reasons for its endorsement, including its $10-million investment in the downtown Park N’ Ride Terminal and its investments in the electrification of the Lethbridge city fleet.

The federal NDP leader pitched the plan Friday during a keynote speech to the annual Broadbent Institute's Progress Summit, which brings together progressives and New Democrats from across the country.

It is expected to form a key plank in the NDP's election platform this fall alongside other policy proposals the party says will target the rich, pay for more services for Canadians and cool the housing market.

""A fairer tax system means more funding for services that Canadians need like universal pharmacare, child care, affordable housing and post-secondary education,"" Singh said in a statement.

While the government currently taxes 50 per cent of profits made on investments, known as capital gains, the NDP wants to increase that threshold — known as the ""inclusion rate"" — to 75 per cent.

The party estimates the move, which would also apply to the sale of most real estate but not primary residences, tax-free savings accounts or registered retirement plans, would generate nearly $3 billion in additional revenue for the federal treasury.

""When you go to work, you're taxed on almost all of your income,"" Singh said. ""It doesn't make sense that someone making their money from investments is taxed on only half.""

The inclusion rate for capital gains has fluctuated since it was introduced in 1972, when it was 50 per cent. It was raised several times in the intervening years to a high of 75 per cent, before Jean Chretien's government cut it to its current rate in 2000.

The question of raising the inclusion rate on capital gains has been hotly debated for years, with some suggesting it would address inequality and others arguing it would hurt Canadians' savings and make the country less attractive for investors.

“The federal government issued an imminent threat of extinction in May 2018,” said Forests and Lands Minister Doug Donaldson, referring to a finding under Canada’s Species at Risk Act.

Faced with that finding, the New Democrats entered into months of consultations with the federal government and First Nations, leading to draft rescue plans that are just now being shared with the public.

Those plans have generated widespread anger and opposition, particularly in northeast B.C., where even the lowball estimate points to the loss of 500 forestry jobs and at least one mill.

The alternative, said Donaldson would be even worse: “The path that we were headed down … was leading to a result where the federal government would unilaterally impose an order, based on habitat only, that would be catastrophic to workers, catastrophic to communities, and could result in billions of dollars in economic losses in B.C.”

Premier John Horgan took much the same tack in responding during question period to a challenge from the B.C. Liberal Opposition.

“We are seeking feedback on a response to federal legislation,” he told Mike Bernier the B.C. Liberal MLA for Peace River South. “To characterize this as somehow an NDP plan is a mischaracterization of the enormous challenges we face.”

In one breath he blamed the B.C. Liberals for letting the problem slide for more than a decade. In the next he appealed to Bernier “to work with us to try and find a way forward in the interest of his constituents, the B.C. economy and mountain caribou.”

But central to Bernier’s complaint — and to the 30,000-plus name petition he tabled in the house — was a concern he and his constituents had been cut out of the process until the last minute.

Public consultations on two caribou rescue plans — one for the northeast, the second for other parts of the Interior — only began this month.

The New Democrats have dictated that the process ends with the month as well.

LISTEN: This week on In The House, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw dig into new legislation that bans ticket bots. Will the changes help you get a better price on your favourite concert tickets? They also delve into the politics around B.C.’s money-laundering scandal, parties flip-flopping over gas taxes and criticism of the carbon tax, and the Speaker’s attempt to clean up heckling at the legislature.

As for the “Ottawa made us do it” argument, one has to note the New Democrats are not always quick to say “how high?” when the federal government says “jump!”

They were not in the least submissive to Ottawa’s decision to twin the Trans Mountain pipeline, instead spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on legal actions. Nor did they simply accept the prospect of increased tanker traffic without a fight.

If the prospective loss of 500 B.C. forestry jobs did indeed originate with the Justin Trudeau federal government, Premier John Horgan could readily push back against that threat in the political arena.

His lines were practically written for him by columnist Merlin Nichols in a recent piece in the Dawson Creek Mirror.

“If we enact changes that result in massive job losses we are doing no one any good and we cannot be sure that the changes will benefit the caribou,” he wrote in part.

“Mr. Trudeau expressed a touching concern for the potential loss of 9,000 jobs, one of which might have been his, in Quebec.

“We understand, Mr. Trudeau, we really do. But 9,000 jobs in Quebec would be less painful to the body politic than 500 or more in our Northeast.”

Provincial officials maintain some reduction in access to the land base for forestry and other resource development is essential to protecting the caribou habitat.

But they also admit that (as one official put it last week) “you could stop all logging and industry today, and it would take decades for the habitat to recover, and you would still need predator control or other management.”

On that expectation, the province might try to preserve jobs now while experimenting with more proven methods of restoring populations.

The same provincial officials who made the case for reduced forestry have admitted the decline in caribou herds has been partly reversed by culling wolves.

Also promising is the use of pens to protect caribou calves from predators. One such experiment led to a five-fold increase in the number of survivors, a representative of the Salteau and West Moberly First Nations told a consultation session in Prince George this week.

The combination of culling wolves and penning pregnant cows offers the best hope of reversing a decline in caribou populations, according to a recent study by University of Alberta biologist Rob Serrouya.

He and his colleagues looked at 18 herds in Alberta and B.C., some managed, others not. The most promising results were in the managed herds where protective measures included killing wolves, penning cows and relocating the herds.

“It doesn’t mean recovery, “ Serrouya told Bob Weber of The Canadian Press, “but it means some of these herds have turned around.”

He also said those measures are better than trying to restore habitat damaged by oil, gas and forestry activity. The latter is too slow; herds don’t have the decades it would take to recover.

None of which says the New Democrats can put off the reckoning for as long as the Liberals did.

But neither is it necessary to impose an artificial timeline of barely a month, before finalizing a plan that could do so much damage to jobs and communities in the northeast.

REGINA — The ...","REGINA — The Saskatchewan NDP is calling on Premier Scott Moe's government to introduce legislation that would protect students' rights to form gay-straight alliance clubs.

Opposition Leader Ryan Meili said the clubs are a topic of debate right now in the Alberta election, where United Conservative Leader Jason Kenney has promised to replace legislation that prevents educators from telling parents if their children participate in GSAs.

Meili said such a move would be backward. He said the Saskatchewan Party government needs to legislate students' rights to form or join a GSA.

The NDP said Saskatchewan is one of the only provinces where a student's right to do so is not protected by legislation.

Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe said a policy exists that allows GSAs in school divisions and respects the confidentiality of students.

Cat Haines, program co-ordinator with UR Pride Centre at the University of Regina, said she knows youth who face bullying and negative comments about their gender and sexual identity.

She said the centre has encountered students who had difficulty forming GSAs because of unsupportive school staff and administration, as well as students not feeling safe because their parents may find out.

""A GSA really provides a safe space and community within their school where they can feel supported and where they feel like they can really be themselves,"" Haines said Wednesday.

Without legislation around GSAs, students lack a clear path about what to do in cases where the policies are not being followed, she added.

Education Minister Gord Wyant said the province's existing policy that says school divisions should respond positively to student requests to form GSAs works well. His office has not received a complaint where a student has been denied forming such a group, he said.",Saskatchewan NDP want legislation to protect gay-straight alliances,Waterloo Region Record,https://www.therecord.com/news-story/9278186-saskatchewan-ndp-want-legislation-to-protect-gay-straight-alliances/

Back in 2016, Jason hired me to do a photo and video project documenting a year on his family farm. Having grown up on a farm myself, I was amazed at the scale and complexity of his operation, 15,000 acres in size. But more significantly, I got to see a work ethic that is next to impossible to match. If he sleeps, I don’t know when. The video series just rolled over half a million views on YouTube for the primary video, and 800,000 views for another one. In it, you can see for yourself just how hard he and his family work. This is one serious farmer.

Since that time we’ve become friends. We agree on most things, but not everything, and I’m not afraid to tell him that, and he’s not afraid to tell me the same. This is what is called a relationship built on mutual respect.

So imagine my surprise when I watched NDP Leader Ryan Meili take a run at Jason for 13 minutes during question period on April 1, fittingly, April Fool’s Day. Conveniently he did this where he had parliamentary privilege, and can say whatever he wants without reprisal. I say that because his allusions bordered on slanderous.

Jason is not a politician, nor does he intend to be. He will be the first to tell you that he’s a farmer, first and foremost, but I will expand on that and note he is a damned good one, and a successful auctioneer, to boot.

The last three months have been rather remarkable for him. Being an ardent opponent of our current prime minister, he made sure he was right at the front of the line to get into the very-short notice town hall session Prime Minister Justin Trudeau held in Regina on Jan. 10. Doing so placed him front row, centre, opposite the TV cameras so that he was in almost ever shot. And being there, he was fortunate enough to be handpicked by Trudeau to ask a question. Jason let him have it on the carbon tax. Trudeau promptly turned that around to talk about “putting a price on pollution.”

This led to Jason being invited to take part in a convoy to Ottawa to protest that very thing, among others, on Feb. 19. This became known as the United We Roll! convoy to Ottawa. It very specifically dropped any association with the yellow vest movement, but did not tell people who wore yellow vests to stay home.

Jason never once wore a yellow vest, nor did he carry a sign with some of the yellow vests more questionable issues, like the United Nations and immigration. When I wrote a column regarding how the yellow vest moniker had become tainted (which Meili, himself, quoted last week), it was precisely with this in mind.

Jason delivered the longest speech on Parliament Hill when that convoy made it to Ottawa, saying, “In my hometown of Estevan, Saskatchewan, we are known as the Energy City. We are proud of that claim and proud of our city, but Prime Minister Trudeau’s policies have had profound impacts on our community. The state of uncertainty has clouded investments, killed jobs, eroded community support for programs, made it difficult for businesses to obtain and retain qualified employees, decreased property values and turned people’s dreams and hopes of an amazing life into a nightmare.”

Pretty radical stuff, huh? He spoke in particular about climate change, clean coal, and the carbon tax, and I watched all of it on live feeds on Facebook.

Coming back from that convoy, several of the participants, including Jason, soon started planning one of their own, to Regina. Their message would be four points, and four points only – fight the carbon tax, build pipelines, kill Bill C-69 and kill Bill C-48. And that’s it. No talk of anything that would take away from that energy and carbon tax message.

I wasn’t there on Day 1, but I was there on Day 2, and pretty much every other day, covering this planned convoy and rally in Regina from the get-go.

And I was there when Jason LeBlanc, at the very beginning of that first key organization meeting, stood up and said they needed to be clear, in no uncertain terms, “yellow vests prohibited.”

And it was at his insistence, with the concurrence of the rest of the organizers, that those very words appeared on the poster, drafted that morning. That was a group decision, but one led by him. And a lot of people who had been die-hard yellow vesters slagged him mercilessly as a result.

At the time, I expected that if any of the key organizers of the United We Roll convoy with former ties with the yellow vest movement became involved with this new rally, they would be tarred and feathered by those in favour of the carbon tax. I had expected it from the CBC. I did not expect it from the leader of the opposition.

Meili led off question period by quoting a post online questioning climate change, goading the premier into identifying how might have said it. Premier Scott Moe did not take the bait.

Then Meili smeared Jason by saying the following, “And one of the main organizers and the spokesperson for this rally — the spokesperson for the group that the premier has accepted to address — is a fellow by the name of Jason LeBlanc.

“And Jason attended the rebranded yellow vest convoy event in Ottawa, the event that featured Faith Goldy among other great luminaries, Mr. Speaker. And he gave a speech at that rally, and in his speech he described himself as a ‘man-made climate change doomsday denier.’ And he said that the Prime Minister is someone who ‘. . . manipulates society through basic human needs and wants to make the globe a one-world government,’ Mr. Speaker.

“Far-out-there conspiracy theories, climate change denial, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, anti-Semitic sentiment — this is what the yellow vest movement has become, Mr. Speaker. And I do not understand, but I’d like the Premier to explain why he wants to be associated with that group,” Meili asked of Moe.

Let me point out some the glaring issues with that statement. First, having followed the United We Roll! convoy intently through the lead up and the event, at no point did Faith Goldy come into the consideration. To the best of my knowledge, she just showed up and started talking, making a scene right in the centre of the counter protest. I don’t think Jason had ever even heard of her before that day, and yet Meili tried to draw some sort of association to one of the most politically blackballed people in the nation.

Regarding being a doomsday denier, yes, Jason did say that. And I have said similar things, many times, questioning the argument for anthropogenic climate change. I have pointed out in this column numerous times that no one, including climate change scientists I have spoke to, have been able to give me an adequate answer on how is it Canada was almost entirely covered with ice for 80,000 of the last 100,000 years, and yet it melted, and it wasn’t my gas guzzling SUV or the two coal-fired power plants six miles from my house that caused it to melt, either.

But you see, Meili used the strategy of calling anyone who does not conform to current orthodoxy, the religion of anthropogenic (man-made) climate change, for all intents and purposes, a heretic. They should be totally discredited in all that they say and do! Burn them at the stake!

That is what Meili implied in his line of questioning. If Jason LeBlanc had the audacity to question climate change, then how could Premier Moe dare associate himself with anything related to Jason, including the rally he has been working to organize.

I am just waiting for the day when I am given the same treatment. Heretic! Burn him!

And let’s not forget the biggest slur of the all – in the same breadth, Meili seemed to associate “anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, anti-Semitic sentiment” with Jason. Those were precisely the things that Jason stood up against when I saw him vehemently argue for “yellow vests prohibited.” And there wasn’t any real argument, because the organizers were all on the same page.

But don’t let reality get in the way of a good smear job, Mr. Meili.

What Jason has been fighting against is this carbon tax. By one estimate he’s seen, it may cost his family of five $6 per acre, each year. Now this is my argument: His farm, at 15,000 acres, equates to $18,000 in carbon tax impact for each member of his family. Should his 12-year old daughter who, goes to school with my son, be responsible for $18,000 in carbon tax, and going up every year?

Are those numbers accurate? We don’t know. And one of the motivating factors here is the fear of the unknown. We don’t know for sure what the impact will be. But we do know it will double in two years, and keep going up beyond that.

That is the reality Jason LeBlanc will soon have to contend with. That is the reality farmers across this province will contend with. That is why he’s went toe-to-toe with Trudeau in Regina. That’s why his grain truck was parked at the gates of Parliament. That’s why he gave a speech in a snowbank. And that’s why he’s been working so hard to get this Regina Rally Against the Carbon Tax on April 4.

Maybe more people should be following his example.

Kenney told supporters at a rally in Fort McMurray that a UCP government would fight B.C. and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government if they continued to impede the oil sector.

Kenney has promised he would go to court to fight proposed federal legislation on how projects are assessed as both unconstitutional and as a major deterrent to future megaprojects.

He has also said he would proclaim legislation giving Alberta the power to reduce oil shipments to B.C. if that province continued to delay the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion from Alberta to the west coast.

Premier Rachel Notley has criticized Kenney’s approach as needlessly antagonistic and has said his plans could see Trans Mountain derailed just as shovels are ready to turn the ground on the pipeline.

Kenney says Notley’s failure to push back harder on Trans Mountain is the reason it remains in limbo.

“The NDP sold Alberta out to the Trudeau Liberals _ and we won’t let that happen again,” Kenney said Wednesday to the cheers of supporters.","UCP’s Kenney takes pro pipeline message to Fort McMurray, accuses NDP of selling out",energeticcity.ca,https://www.energeticcity.ca/2019/04/ucps-kenney-takes-pro-pipeline-message-to-fort-mcmurray-accuses-ndp-of-selling-out/

Both the B.C. Civil Liberties Association and the Canadian Civil Liberties Association say Minister of Solicitor General and Public Safety Mike Farnworth’s additions to the 2013 law violate rights such as the presumption of innocence when charged with a crime and due process in the court system.

article continues below

The groups said the changes violate the Constitution’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms section on right to life, liberty and security of the person.

“They can think whatever they like,” Farnworth said April 9 as he defended the changes, saying similar acts have been passed in other provinces and that local governments support the proposals.

Farnworth said B.C.’s amended law is similar to those in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Yukon.

However, only the Alberta, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick laws go as far as apparently presuming people to be guilty based on past convictions.

But, when a Nova Scotia couple was evicted under a community safety order in that province’s legislation, the courts upheld the order. The court found that the property was habitually used for the possession, use, consumption, sale, transfer or exchange of illicit drugs. It said previous convictions were not needed to corroborate that fact. The court said that police observations of known drug dealers, confessions of drug use and multiple anonymous complaints established a problem property.

“The impugned activity need not be daily, continual or permanent,” the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal ruled in 2012. “Occasional activity implying ongoing conduct would suffice.”

Farnworth said B.C.’s bill has passed a legal review.

“We have every confidence in it,” Farnworth said, adding people in communities around B.C. are tired of nuisance properties and drug houses.

Farnworth said April 4 that Bill 13 will help crack down on such properties.

The law would allow people to make confidential complaints to a dedicated government unit, Farnworth said April 4 as he announced the 2013 law would be revamped and enforced.

The original act was passed in 2013 after being presented by then-minister of Justice Shirley Bond.

While it allowed confidential complaints, the legislation did not specify use of previous convictions or that officials need not testify to those offences as the current bill does.

Liberal attorney general critic Michael Lee, a lawyer, said the 2013 law tried to balance legal rights and community concerns.

“This government has had a tendency to step all over those rights,” Lee said, pointing to the looming ICBC minor injuries claims cap as another example.

Lee said the Liberals would be addressing concerns about the community safety bill when it gets to committee stage.

Targets of complaints would have evidence of their past criminal convictions presented to courts as evidence of current wrongdoing.

The civil liberties associations say the law strips British Columbians of the constitutional right to face an accuser, pits landlords against tenants and will put the poor and mentally ill onto the streets during a housing crisis.

The bill provides for so-called certificates to be presented to courts. They would include previous criminal convictions of people at problem sites that are subject of anonymous reports.

The ministry said prior convictions are relevant because “they are proof that specified activities have been occurring at or in close proximity to the property. Previous criminal convictions may also show how the community is being adversely impacted.”

The ministry also said including people’s past convictions reduce court administrative burdens, meaning investigating officers needn’t testify, and that less evidence would “have to be gathered and submitted to the court to prove that specified activities are occurring that are adversely impacting the community when there is a lengthy criminal history associated with the property.”

The ministry said the lower standard of proof required under the bill would allow a court to accept that alleged offenses are occurring given similar offense had happened in the past.

Victoria lawyer Michael Mulligan, a member of Lawyers’ Rights Watch Canada, said Farnworth should be discussing “whether it’s wise, fair, or reasonable, to permit people to be evicted from their home based on anonymous reports, or things they may have done in the distant past.”

“There is some significant risk that this legislation will be used by landlords as a mechanism to evict tenants, without needing to go through the residential tenancy process, so that they can raise rents, Mulligan said.

“It would be entirely possible to design legation that would meet the reasonable objective of ensuring communities aren’t inappropriately disrupted by unlawful activity without resorting to anonymous reports, or decision making based on past, rather than present, behavior,” Mulligan said.

Canadian Civil Liberties Association executive director and former Ontario attorney general Michael Bryant said April 8 the bill poses “significant constitutional risk.”

It targets people struggling with poverty and with mental health and addiction issues, Bryant said.

B.C. Attorney General David Eby, former executive director of the B.C. Civil Liberties Association and PIVOT Legal Society, which advocates for the poor, has championed the rights of the underprivileged in the past.

“Minister Eby is not available for an interview,” his staff said, directing Glacier Media back to Farnworth’s office.

Farnworth stressed the tools in the act will target criminals operating in neighbours and will be in addition to the existing justice regime, not an alternative to it.",Updated: NDP's Farnworth defends new law against charge it violates democratic rights,Richmond News,https://www.richmond-news.com/updated-ndp-s-farnworth-defends-new-law-against-charge-it-violates-democratic-rights-1.23785980

Peter Mueller - NDP - Cypress-Medicine Hat Peter Mueller - NDP - Cypress-Medicine Hat

1. Outside of pipelines, what is the biggest challenge facing Alberta?

I’ve had the pleasure of knocking on a lot of doors in Cypress-Medicine Hat and something I hear often from residents is that we need good jobs.

That’s why I’m focused on creating good jobs, diversifying our economy and fighting for pipelines. Rachel Notley is investing in and supporting upgrading and refining, and she’s also focused on new industries, such as renewable energy. I’m happy to see that we are already seeing large new investments in oil and gas processing plants, and the thousands of jobs that come with those investments, but there’s more work to do.

Lastly, as a longtime educator, I also tend to hear a lot from people on the doors about the need for good schools for our children to learn in. I know that Rachel Notley will protect our education and healthcare, while these areas would see deep cuts and privatization under Kenney.

2. How do your party’s policies bring jobs to Southeastern Alberta?

I recognize how important jobs are to this region. But, I know that Jason Kenney’s plan for deep cuts to our public service would only kick families when they’re down.

Our kids need to learn in good schools and our loved ones deserve to receive healthcare in good facilities. As a teacher, I lived through the Klein years when our infrastructure was crumbling and class sizes were ballooning.

Rachel Notley’s plan for more economic diversification will create 70,000 new jobs over the next decade by increasing the volume of oil and gas that is processed in Alberta – instead of in the U.S. Our plan also includes increasing private sector renewable energy in our region and across Alberta to create over 7,000 jobs by 2030.

Here in Medicine Hat, we’ve attracted Bluenergy Solarwind, Aurora Cannabis, Atlantis Research Lab, and more.

3. What improvements can be made to the Alberta health care system?

I’m fighting to ensure that people in Cypress-Medicine Hat have access to great public healthcare services close to home. I’m also fighting against American-style two-tier health care, where the rich get priority access while regular families wait longer.

Our plan is to reduce surgical wait times, eliminate seniors’ co-pay on prescription drugs and build 2,000 more long-term care and dementia beds across the province.

Jason Kenney has spent 20 years advocating for private health care, and has even suggested cutting healthcare or freezing healthcare services, instead of improving them.

A freeze to the health care budget would be devastating, considering our population is growing, aging with more complex health needs than ever before. Since 2015, we’ve added 4,000 more nurses and 1,200 more doctors across the province to keep up with growing health needs, and there is more to do.

If you support public healthcare, then vote for me.

4. Why should youth be optimistic about the future of Alberta?

As a teacher for 32 years, I have worked with youth and seen the excitement and optimism for the future. I’ve taught students to think critically, to be creative and innovative. Our future requires that our students have those skills and are prepared for new industries.

That’s why updating curriculum is essential. We can’t be teaching our youth curriculum that in some cases is older than the internet, and we can’t revert to old policies that don’t provide safe and caring learning environments. We must move forward.

Rachel Notley froze tuition to help support youth get post-secondary education – saving students hundreds of dollars a year. We’re tackling climate change, diversifying the economy and creating jobs in new and exciting industries, like renewables and technological industries.

275,Politics,2019-04-11T01:41:00.0000000Z,"Only days before Albertans prepared to go to the polls, NDP leader Rachel Notley sat down with Jen Gerson to discuss pipelines, her political relationship with Justin Trudeau, and whether a province that has suffered four years of a stagnant economy under ...","Only days before Albertans prepared to go to the polls, NDP leader Rachel Notley sat down with Jen Gerson to discuss pipelines, her political relationship with Justin Trudeau, and whether a province that has suffered four years of a stagnant economy under her government should give her party another chance. This interview has been edited for clarity and concision.

Q: As we all know the economy is struggling, particularly here in Calgary, the unemployment rate is still high. Why should Albertans give you another chance if things haven’t turned around in the last couple of years?

A: The key thing is we have an economic plan. We have a plan to balance the budget, we have a plan to create jobs and what Jason Kenney is talking about actually puts that in jeopardy on a number of different fronts. To the degree that he has a plan, people should be worried that it’s actually going to make the situation worse.

His whole plan is we’re going to give a massive, historic corporate tax cut and then new jobs will magically reappear. What we’re seeing across the board is that doesn’t actually work.

Contrast that with what we are focused on which is diversifying the economy as a whole and diversifying our energy industry so our diversification efforts can serve as a hedge against the drop in the price of oil.

We have a made in Alberta plan which has already incented about $13 billion worth of investment with just under $1 billion worth of incentives—primarily royalty credits. We’ve proposed to multiply that seven-fold.

Q: In 2015, you raised the corporate income tax and at the time that was a popular move. But it hasn’t brought in more corporate income. In hindsight was it the best move or was it the popular move?

A: I do think it was the best move because we’re comparing it to what corporate income tax was before the price of oil went down. I think that we are getting more income through those increased corporate taxes than we would have had we not increased it. It’s very convenient for people to say ‘Oh, well the amount of the corporate income revenue went down.’ Well, yes, because the price of oil dropped by 70 per cent, so I do think it is the right thing and particularly when you compare it to overall we continue to be the most competitive place to do business by a long shot.

With the absence of a sales tax, we do have an $11 billion tax advantage over the next lowest tax province and those provinces have a whole series of other problems like housing and affordability. They struggle to attract people. We don’t have that problem. So we continue to be a great place to invest. The merits of this massive corporate tax cut when economists use it, it’s typically when you’re going from being over taxed to becoming competitive or really super competitive. When you’re going from already being competitive to more competitive, it doesn’t bring in the same investment.

Q: A future Alberta government, whether it’s yours or Kenney’s, is going to have to look at tax increases. Is that part of the conversation that you’re having right now?

A: We’re not. We’re still in the recovery stage and to be quite frank I’ve been very clear in this campaign that we’re not looking at increasing taxes outside of the pricing changes that would occur as part of the Climate Leadership Plan [the carbon tax], should the Trans Mountain pipeline get back under construction. We are very much hoping our personal income taxes and corporate income taxes, not the rate, but what comes in through our investment diversification.

Q: One of the things that Kenney keeps on coming back to is the Trudeau-Notley alliance. What is the nature of your political relationship with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau right now?

A: The nature of my relationship is one that you would expect to see between a premier of a province that is engaged in a determined, strategic, well informed, deliberate effort at advocating on behalf of the people of their province.

In his role as Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau has the authority to make critical decisions that have an impact on the people of this province therefore it is worth it for me to be able to engage in a conversation that doesn’t involve solely name calling and political grandstanding. We don’t always agree on things; I have called him out on things, but it is strategic. And it’s strategic to the long term goal. It’s not about using the relationship with the federal government as a political backdrop to my own political objectives, it’s about working the relationship with the long term objectives of what Albertans need from their federal government in line.

It’s not an alliance and it’s not a war. It’s a mature intergovernmental relationship and, frankly, something that Albertans should expect from their leaders.

Q: Has the relationship gotten worse over time as things have become rockier over things like the stalled Trans Mountain pipeline?

A: I think it’s changed. It is not one particular line as it’s gotten worse or it’s gotten better. Sometimes it’s better and sometimes it’s more challenged. It depends on the issues as they come up, because we certainly don’t hesitate to call them out both publicly and privately. We need to advocate for Albertans.

Q: One of the criticisms that is lobbed against you is when you first came to power you opposed Northern Gateway. With the benefit of hindsight, do you regret opposing Northern Gateway?

A: I would say that to some degree yes. I realize now that I have a better understanding of the takeaway capacity needs and pipeline needs of our industry, and I realize now what we’re coming up against and we see what’s happened with the differential. And the degree of uncertainty when you’re dealing with Line 3 and KXL. You’re a hostage to U.S. fortune there.

What I will say is that most people who have really dug into the issue will agree that Northern Gateway was essentially dead before I was elected and before the Prime Minister was elected because of the depth and breadth of the judicial critique around everything associated with that application. Some would argue that [Stephen] Harper himself would do that.

That’s why I did what I did with C-48 yesterday [Notley opposed the federal Liberals’ bill which would place a moratorium on much oil tanker traffic along the northern section of the West Coast.] We know we need to get our products to different markets and going west is a good way to do that.

Q: What should the Alberta government do about C-48 and Bill C-69 (the federal government’s overhaul of the regulatory structure overseeing major infrastructure like pipelines)?

A: What we’re doing right now is we are working with many, many people. On C-69, we’ve worked with the industry, we’ve worked with other provinces to develop the suite of recommendations that would achieve the objectives that the federal government is trying to achieve, but at the same time provide the certainty that industry needs so that we don’t kill investment.

It’s the same kind of approach that will need to go ahead with C-48 in its current form. I’m not convinced that with the timing being what it is that it will. But if it is we’re just going to have to keep fighting and that’s exactly what we will do. We will get more information and align with more Canadians and we will push hard and leverage where necessary and do the things that a provincial government does when we need to push back on an ill-advised decision of the federal government.

Q: Do you think the federal government would shut down the Trans Mountain expansion if the oil sands emissions cap doesn’t go through (as per Jason Kenney’s promise).

A: Kenney is literally jeopardizing the pipeline at this point. Politics is politics, we’re going into a [federal] election period and so what the federal government is going to do is it’s going to listen to what voters want them to do in places where they need votes—B.C., Ontario, Quebec. I spent the last three-and-a-half years having a reasonable conversation with Canadians about the need for the pipeline.

If I’m not here and Jason Kenney is here and starts randomly trying to turn off the taps, creating massive amounts of investor uncertainty with that, by the way, and then demonizing Canadians outside of Alberta then I think the public support for the pipeline will start to go down.

The federal government was clear that our emissions cap was part of their deal in terms of approving it. Mr. Kenney wants to blow that up for no apparent reason, so I think it’s a risk.

Q. Are you angry at Justin Trudeau?

A: No. I have no particular emotion one way or another. It’s a working relationship.

Q: After the 2015 election, you were pretty candid that you weren’t necessarily expecting to win. That this was something that happened by surprise. Are you expecting the win this time and are you prepared for that?

A: I’m super prepared. I’m very proud of the team we’ve pulled together, not to mention the team that’s running again. They’ve matured and handled the pressure of government [in a way] that should be inspiring to all people who want to get into politics, actually. Because there were some regular folks that stepped up to run because of what they believed in and they found themselves in positions that they didn’t necessarily expect to be in and they have all risen to the occasion.

But now, there’s no question that where we’re at from a party perspective, our organization so much better, our contacts, our reach, our engagement across the province; if there were a word I could use that would take it beyond qualitative, I would.

Q: What are you going to do if Jason Kenney becomes premier, what is your plan?

A: That is a hypothetical question that I am not interested in engaging in now because I’m still planning on being Premier.

The budget bill would set into law rules for the Liberals’ 10-year national housing strategy, now valued at more than $55 billion, impose those rules on future governments and create two new oversight bodies meant to make sure the spending reduces homelessness.

A national housing council is to advise the government on the effects of the strategy and a new housing advocate, tied to the Canadian Human Rights Commission, is to report annually on systemic issues preventing Canadians from finding affordable and safe places to live.

Reports would also be required every three years on how well the strategy is meeting national goals and furthering “the progressive realization of the right to adequate housing” — wording that mirrors international standards.

In each case, the minister in charge of the strategy would have to “reply and act” on the reports, said Social Development Minister Jean-Yves Duclos, “which will ensure there is sufficient pressure on the federal government to meet the legislated right to housing.”

Characterizing housing as a human right is meant to provide recourse, usually through tribunals, to anyone wrongfully denied a home for reasons such as ethnicity, religion, or gender identity, and put pressure on the federal government to help make the right a reality.

“The federal government has admitted to having an obligation when it comes to protecting the most vulnerable of Canadians,” Duclos said in an interview Wednesday. “There will always need to be a continuing conversation (and) that’s exactly what the bill says — the national housing strategy will need to evolve, but I think we’ve made major steps in very little time.”

The United Nations special rapporteur on the right to housing said wording in the budget bill is a big step forward and addresses a long-running concern from the international body.

But Leilani Farha said her chief concern is that having an advocate “hot-desking” at the human-rights commission and filing annual reports “doesn’t amount to human-rights accountability by any measure.”

“The government needs to strengthen the role of the advocate so that they can appoint panels to hear systemic housing-related claims and recommend remedies,” said the Canadian-based Farha.

“And the government can’t be allowed to just ignore recommendations. If the legislation is strengthened in this way, then Canada would not just be in compliance with its international human rights obligations, it might also be a model for other countries.”

The Liberals have been looking into setting the right to housing into law since early in their mandate, when they met with housing advocates about ways to pump more money into affordable housing.

What followed, though, was a debate among officials in Duclos’s Department of Employment and Social Development Canada and their counterparts in the Finance and Justice departments over how far the government could go in its wording, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.

As time wore on, housing advocates became concerned about whether the government would have time to pass a law before the next election.

Putting the housing law into the budget bill is a tacit acknowledgment that time was running short. Inside the budget bill, it is practically assured passage by the summer.

Now, groups plan to lobby MPs for amendments to give the new housing council greater powers to critique government progress on the strategy and allow the advocate to refer issues to the human-rights tribunal for public hearings.

In a post to members, the Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness said “the government got a lot right” on housing in the budget bill, but the legislation lacks “important elements of a workable, rights-based accountability framework that would ensure that the housing strategy is effective.”

The news comes after Damoff, who represents the Toronto-area riding of Oakville-North Burlington, slumped over at her desk during question period while Omar Alghabra, the parliamentary secretary to the foreign-affairs minister, was responding to an opposition question about trade.

Damoff sits just behind Alghabra and so was captured on the House of Commons cameras, which only zone in on whoever is speaking at the time.

Marco Mendicino, a fellow Liberal who was sitting near Damoff, then noticed something was wrong and waved for the Speaker of the House of Commons to suspend question period so that medical attention could be provided.

Damoff sat up after a few seconds and looked around, appearing confused.

Multiple MPs with health training ran over to help, including Liberals Doug Eyolfson and Carolyn Bennett and former Liberal cabinet minister Jane Philpott, who now sits as an independent, all physicians. So did Conservative Colin Carrie, a chiropractor.

The Prime Minister’s Office says Damoff left the chamber on her own and was given water in the inner lobby.

A spokesperson for the Ottawa Paramedic Service confirmed an ambulance was dispatched to Parliament Hill for a loss of consciousness and that one individual was transported to hospital in stable condition.

Hilary Lawson, chief of staff to Damoff, also confirmed to Global News that the first-term MP is being treated.

“At this point I can share that MP Damoff is doing well and is receiving medical care,” said Lawson.

Damoff was elected for the first time to the House of Commons in 2015 and currently serves as the parliamentary secretary to the minister of health.

Prior to her time in federal politics, she served five years as an Oakville town councillor.

At the end of question period, Liberal House leader Bardish Chagger thanked everyone who put politics aside and jumped up to help a colleague.

House Speaker Geoff Regan added that Canadians who normally watch vigorous partisan debate would have been heartened to see the response.

The President is wrong, of course, but uncontrolled migration is a crisis in the United States and a problem in Canada, because it undermines confidence in the immigration system.

This is one reason the Trudeau government introduced legislation this week to stem the flow of people who cross at unauthorized points of entry from the United States.

Another might be that, even though the Liberals have done a good job over the past year of slowing the flow of unauthorized crossings, they fear the public might think they haven’t done enough.

Story continues below advertisement

In either case, it’s also important to remember that the core purpose of immigration is to stoke the economy and prevent population decline. The intent of deterring crossings at unauthorized places should be to bolster the overall system.

The total fertility rate in the United States has fallen to 1.8 children per woman, and will likely continue to fall. The Canadian rate is 1.6. Both countries are reproducing far below the average of 2.1 children per woman needed to prevent population decline.

This is good news. Teenage pregnancy rates have fallen by two-thirds in the United States since 1990, and 80 per cent in Canada, thanks to improved access to sex education and birth control. In the United States, white, African-American and Latino birth rates are converging, reflecting improved education and economic opportunity for minorities. More women are waiting to establish their careers before having a child, a reflection of increasing equality. Low fertility means social progress.

But fewer babies eventually means fewer young workers to pay the taxes needed to sustain health care and pension for older folks. It also means lower economic growth, because there are fewer young consumers buying that first car, first house and so on. Two dozen countries are losing population each year, and in many cases their economies are struggling.

The United States and Canada counter the effect through high levels of immigration, which is why their populations continue to grow, and to age more slowly.

But the United States faces a growing crisis of uncontrolled immigration, with more than 100,000 crossers from Mexico detained in March alone. In Canada, the number of people who crossed at unauthorized points of entry was just less than 20,000 for all of 2018, mostly from the United States into Quebec.

Mr. Trump wants to build a wall, which would be ineffective, and is threatening to close the southern border completely, which would be an economic disaster.

Story continues below advertisement

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government is taking a different approach. The budget bill introduced Monday includes a new law that would prohibit people from making refugee claims who have already made a similar claim in the United States and certain other countries. And Canadian officials are working with their American counterparts to toughen the Safe Third Country Agreement so as to further deter crossers.

The Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers has condemned the new legislation as “callous.” But Canada will continue to take in refugees who make legitimate claims through regular channels, such as the refugees from Syria.

The immigration system is not humanitarian; it is economic. In Canada, we bring in almost 1 per cent of our population each year so that our economy and population will continue to grow. Mr. Trump encourages nativist, anti-immigrant sentiment. If Americans listen to him, their country will eventually start losing people − with or without unauthorized migrants − surrendering a key geopolitical advantage, since the Chinese and Russian populations will both start to decline in a few years. (In Russia, it may already have begun.)

Some people argue for policies − enhanced parental leave, subsidized daycare, even cash payments − that will encourage couples to have more children, while limiting immigration. Such policies are very expensive and research shows they don’t work. Women in developed countries today for the most part don’t have children because the state, or God, or their kinfolk, or domineering husbands want them to. Parenting for most couples is an act of personal fulfilment. And they are quickly fulfilled.

The Trudeau government should not have placed these new rules in an omnibus budget bill. And those rules may not survive a judicial challenge. But the goal is sound, even if it was opportunistic.

Federal Liberals have thwarted an opposition attempt to find out who leaked information about a dispute between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould over who should be chief justice of Canada’s top court.

The Liberals used their majority on the House of Commons justice committee Thursday to defeat a Conservative motion calling for the committee to investigate the leaks.

Conservative MP Michael Cooper, who introduced the motion, said the “shocking and unprecedented” leaks smeared respected judges and undermined the independence of the judiciary by publicizing what was supposed to be confidential information about the selection process for Supreme Court appointments.

Story continues below advertisement

But Liberals countered that the motion was entirely political, aimed at further dragging out the SNC-Lavalin affair, which has been plaguing the Trudeau government for more than two months.

Wilson-Raybould calls for investigation into confidentiality breaches in the Supreme Court appointment process

The committee should take Trudeau at his word that neither he nor his staff had anything to do with the leaks, Liberal MP Ali Ehsassi said.

The Canadian Press and CTV reported last month that Wilson-Raybould recommended Glenn Joyal, chief justice of Manitoba’s Court of Queen’s Bench, be appointed chief justice of Canada, heading the Supreme Court.

According to sources, Trudeau was concerned about her choice because he believed Joyal has a conservative, restrictive approach to interpreting the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Trudeau ultimately named sitting Supreme Court Justice Richard Wagner to replace Beverley McLachlin, who retired as chief justice in December 2017. He also appointed Alberta judge Sheilah Martin to fill western Canada’s seat on the bench (McLachlin was born and raised in Alberta and rose through the judicial ranks in British Columbia).

Opinion: Leak detailing Supreme Court appointment rift only shows how little Trudeau’s camp respects the rule of law

The leaks landed in the midst of a furor over Wilson-Raybould’s contention that she was improperly pressured last fall to stop the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. It suggested Trudeau had reasons unrelated to the Montreal engineering giant to move Wilson-Raybould out of the prestigious justice portfolio to Veterans Affairs in a mid-January cabinet shuffle.

Wilson-Raybould believes the move was punishment for her refusal to halt the prosecution. She resigned from cabinet a month after the shuffle.

Story continues below advertisement

Another leak a day later to the Globe and Mail suggested Wilson-Raybould wanted to elevate Joyal to the Supreme Court to make way for an Indigenous judge to take his place at the head of the Manitoba court. It also said she believed Wagner was more conservative in his approach to the charter than Joyal.

“What we have as a result of this leak is an undermining of the integrity of the appointment process,” Cooper told the committee, adding that Joyal, Wagner and Martin have all had a “cloud” put over them. “Quite frankly, this goes to the heart of the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary, which has been undermined as a result of this leak.”

New Democrat MP Murray Rankin said he and Conservative MP Rob Nicholson are also under a cloud since, as their parties’ justice critics at the time, they had access to all the confidential information about the finalists recommended by an independent panel for appointment to the top court.

Liberals take Rankin and Nicholson at their words that they didn’t leak anything about the appointments, either, Ehsassi said.

He agreed the leaks were “regrettable” but said they were not unprecedented. He noted that information about the selection process was leaked in 2014, when the Conservative government of the day named Marc Nadon to the top court – an appointment that was later struck down by the Supreme Court because Nadon did not meet technical eligibility requirements. There was no investigation into that leak.","Liberals exploit justice committee majority, blocking Opposition motion to probe Supreme Court selection leak",The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-liberals-exploit-justice-committee-majority-blocking-opposition/

THE CANADIAN PRESS





FREDERICTON -- New Brunswick's Liberal party has confirmed Kevin Vickers is the lone candidate for its leadership, setting the stage for his acclamation.

The party's leadership steering committee says it decided late Wednesday to recommend to the party's board that the former House of Commons sergeant-at-arms be appointed leader.

The board will make a decision next Tuesday evening.

The steering committee says it still wants the June 21-22 leadership convention in Saint John to proceed, ""with an altered itinerary.""

Hailed as a hero for helping to end the 2014 attack on Parliament Hill, Vickers was the first candidate to officially enter the race two weeks ago.

The only other declared candidate, Rene Ephestion, leader of the party's Multicultural Inclusion Commission, announced earlier this week that he is withdrawing from the race.

""I wish good luck to Kevin Vickers,"" Ephestion said on Facebook.

Vickers, a political neophyte in his early 60s, issued a statement last month saying he is looking forward to speaking with Liberals ""about a new path forward.""

He has drafted a five-point plan that calls for growing the province's economy and population, improving health care, ""transforming"" education, ensuring environmental protection and making sure provincial finances are well managed.

Vickers, who also served as Canada's ambassador to Ireland, has acknowledged spending many years away from the province, but he has also focused on his deep roots in New Brunswick.

Vickers had a long career of public service, including 29 years in the RCMP. He also served as aide-de-camp for the lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick. He served as sergeant-at-arms for the House of Commons between 2006 and 2015.

On Oct. 22, 2014, Vickers was serving as sergeant-at-arms of the Commons when he shot and helped take down a man armed with a .30-30 rifle. Michael Zihaf Bibeau had barged into Centre Block on Parliament Hill after killing honour guard reservist Cpl. Nathan Cirillo at the National War Memorial.

The provincial Liberals under then-premier Brian Gallant won just 21 seats in an election last fall -- one fewer than the Tories -- and they relinquished their hold on power in November after losing a confidence vote in the legislature.

Premier Blaine Higgs' minority government is relying on support from a third party -- the right-leaning People's Alliance, led by Kris Austin.

In recent weeks the party mailed a survey to Tory donors, signed by the party’s campaign director Hamish Marshall, asking them to rank major Canadian newspapers and TV stations — the Globe & Mail, Toronto Star, the Sun papers, Global, City, CTV, CBC and the National Post — based on the outlets’ perceived ideological leanings: “left of centre,” “neutral/balanced,” or “right of centre.”

The mail-out, sent to supporters as a pitch to kick in monthly donations to the party, further asks: “In your opinion, which of Canada’s major political parties is most favoured by the mainstream news media?”

A party spokesman confirmed the authenticity of the questionnaire.

“It was about raising funds for our campaign, and gathering supporters feedback on where and how they consume media, and their personal perceptions,” said party communications director Cory Hann. He added that the appeal for donations was spurred by the Liberal Party’s proposed support program for Canadian media outlets — a program that would be administered by an arms-length body, to avoid possible political favouritism.

Beyond surveying supporters’ news diet, the mail-out asks whether the party should “bypass” the news media and instead hone “an aggressive social media strategy to communicate with people directly in their homes or on their mobile devices” and whether the party “should focus on direct voter contact … that will allow us to take our message to voters unfiltered.”

It also asks whether the campaign should prioritize local and community media outlets, and invest more in advertising and a “sophisticated ground game” in order to “counter the efforts of pro-media news organizations.”

In your opinion, which of Canada’s major political parties is most favoured by the mainstream news media?

The direct-mail appeal to donors included a letter from Marshall, but the party refused to provide it to the Post.

While the Conservative Party is no stranger to taking aim at perceived bias in the media, the proliferation of hyper-partisan, conspiratorial and outright hateful online news outlets has made such tactics a riskier proposition.

As he pummelled the New York Times and CNN, Donald Trump enjoyed almost relentlessly flattering coverage from alt-right websites like Breitbart, Infowars, and the Gateway Pundit — and he, in turn, used them to relay his message to his base. He hired Breitbart co-founder Steve Bannon to apply his sharp-elbowed media tactics to the Republican presidential campaign. In so doing, though, he may have emboldened the likes of Infowars, which promotes baseless conspiracy theories including that the American government carried out the 9/11 attacks and that a 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School that killed 20 children and six adults was a hoax. Infowars has been removed from numerous platforms, including YouTube and Twitter, for promulgating hate speech.

Scheer appointed Marshall as his campaign director for the upcoming election despite controversy over Marshall’s connections to Rebel Media, an ideological cousin of Breitbart.

Marshall ran a digital strategy company, Torch Agency, from Rebel’s Toronto office, where he also ran Scheer’s leadership campaign. While with Rebel, where he was a corporate director, Marshall and Torch helped design its outreach strategies, which included aggressively microtargeting possible supporters and donors with issue-specific campaigns — a tactic he appears to have made use of in the Conservative Party as well. Often, that outreach involved attacking the mainstream media as untrustworthy.

Though a longtime Conservative strategist, Marshall’s close association with Rebel Media prompted questions, including over Scheer’s own involvement with the media organization.

Scheer made several appearances on The Rebel, but in August 2017 he announced he would no longer grant interviews to the outlet after Rebel host Faith Goldy appeared on a neo-Nazi podcast while in Virginia to cover a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, at which one person was killed. Rebel fired Goldy amid the ensuing controversy.

The questionnaire asks supporters to what extent they agree with the statements: “The mainstream Canadian media spend too much time covering left-wing social justice issues and not enough time reporting on the economy or international affairs,” and “When union leaders who represent news media workers attack Conservatives, it creates an undeniable conflict of interest.”

The party spokesperson elaborated that the mailer was referencing Jerry Dias, the president of Unifor, who has been openly critical of the Conservative Party. Unifor represents a number of newsrooms, although they represent a small fraction of the union’s 300,000-plus members.

He was formerly Director of Communications to Stephen Harper.

Hark! Word comes from Ottawa of the vaunted channel change from SNC-Lavalin!

With everyone busy rubbernecking the multi-car, highway-closing SNC-Lavalin pile up, Finance Minister Bill Morneau went ahead and tabled his budget implementation bill. And buried in that 392-page (!) behemoth was a change to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act that would make it harder to claim refugee status in Canada.

To take things in order: 1) yes, there was a federal budget this year; 2) yes, it is being jammed through the House via an omnibus bill (which the Liberals promised never to do); 3) yes, omnibus legislation is how Liberals tucked deferred prosecution agreements into the criminal code for SNC last year; and 4) the Liberals are now massive hypocrites.

Trudeau’s vaunted “Welcome to Canada” poster is now festooned with giant brand-damaging caveats: If you, dear asylum seeker, have opened a claim for refugee protection in another country, have already made an unsuccessful claim in Canada, been deemed inadmissible because of your criminal record, or been granted refugee protection elsewhere, your claim is now ineligible for consideration.

And if all of that sounds like common sense to you, welcome to where federal and provincial Conservatives have been for the past three years. Or, as the Liberals used to call it: being un-Canadian.

The budget bill sleight of hand on asylum claims follows the Liberals’ earlier fold on the Safe Third Country Agreement, which they are now looking to revise in negotiations with the United States, another step the Conservatives have been urging for the better part of two years.

“I can tell you we’ve been working very hard over the past several months to significantly reduce the number of people who are crossing our borders irregularly,” Conservative Minister Bill Blair told reporters. “There’s a right way to come to the country to seek asylum and/or to seek to immigrate to this country, and we’re trying to encourage people to use the appropriate channels and to disincentivize people from doing it improperly,” Blair added.

Blair is, of course, a Liberal. He just sounds like a Conservative, based on the volte-face evidence; 40,000+ “irregular” asylum claims from the United States will do that to you. The Liberals have been thoroughly mugged by the reality of this year’s election.

And what of the mountains of prior Liberal talk of principles, compassion and openness? One presumes they’re buried in the backlog of asylum claims Trudeau said the system was equipped to handle.

The step change in direction on entry to Canada has certainly upset the cast of immigration and asylum advocates who threw themselves at Trudeau’s feet after Trudeau threw open Canada’s doors in the midst of the 2015 refugee crisis in Europe.

Janet Dench, executive director of the Canadian Council for Refugees, anticipates a Charter challenge to Trudeau’s proposed reforms, while Maureen Silcoff, chair of the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers’ litigation committee, bemoaned the “degraded” nature of the system being proposed. “This is really a devastating attack on refugee rights,” Dench concluded.

These criticisms—to say nothing of the changes themselves—should terrify the Liberals who, as they never fail to tell us, are the party of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. One wonders whether the lemmings on the Grit backbench were even made aware of them. It certainly explains why the changes were buried in a budget bill and not debated in the harsh light of day. Opaque ways, my friends.

Refugee advocates will now add their names to the rather long and distinguished list of disappointed Liberal stakeholders: electoral reform advocates, transparency gurus, balanced-budget believers, sticklers for the rule of law, Indigenous rights groups and environmentalists, to name a few.

But the criticism from the asylum crowd is of a different calibre, one that will leave a mark. The Liberals are sawing at a pillar of their core identity, to say nothing of their brand promise. Liberals of the Trudeau vintage didn’t get into politics to be a Tory on asylum and immigration.

Now that the media have spotted the change we shouldn’t be surprised if Trudeau kicks Jody Wilson-Raybould out of caucus again to change the channel. Or, barring that, give another $12 million climate gift to a wealthy grocery retailer with a history of price-fixing a food staple. The point being, the longer the discussion stays on the asylum about-face the more Trudeau will sink.

And with Liberal support continuing to bleed every which way, Trudeau could yet have further to fall. Indeed, bar the carbon tax, it’s not clear what the Liberals propose to stand on in the next election. Well, other than power for power’s sake, which has always been the Liberal proposition.

But it wasn’t Trudeau’s; he promised a different Liberal Party. The fact that Michelle Rempel could now be the Liberal spokesperson on immigration wasn’t a part of the vision he sold to Canadians.

But on asylum, as with Trudeau’s other disappointments, it turns out that #WelcomeToCanada was #OnlyAMarketingSlogan.

The Liberals introduced the Canada Child Benefit in 2016, providing parents with payments indexed to household income to target lower-income families. In last year’s federal budget, they announced the CCB would increase with inflation to keep pace with the cost of living. And with the expanded child benefit now up to a maximum of $540 per month for a child under the age of six, the Liberals have been touting the policy at every stop.

In 2019 alone, Trudeau has mentioned the child benefit 36 times in the House of Commons, sometimes several times a day.

It’s hard to argue with the results. According to Statistics Canada the effect has been 278,000 fewer children living below the poverty line in 2017, compared to when the Liberals took office in 2015.

But if the enhanced child benefit helps secure another Liberal victory this fall, some Conservatives claim it will have been the product of one of the most comprehensive ideological victories for the Conservative Party in Canada’s history.

Twelve years ago, in the 2006 election that saw the Conservatives win a minority government, voters endorsed Stephen Harper’s plan to hand parents cold, hard cash over Paul Martin’s promise for a national government-run daycare program. The Canadian policy debate has never been the same.

An election is almost never a referendum on a single policy idea and it could be true that Martin’s government, after more than a decade of Liberal rule, was always destined for defeat. But the Conservative triumph stopped national daycare in its tracks by handing that money back to parents and telling them to care for their kids however they liked. And although Liberals deplored the Harper plan in 2006, by 2015 they had adopted their own version of it and will now be running on the results.

Ken Boessenkool, one of Harper’s policy advisers at the time, had been pitching similar ideas since the mid ’90s and inserted it into every platform in which he had a hand. To his surprise, a Liberal staffer found the perfect framing for the Conservative idea.

“The beer-and-popcorn comment was an absolutely pivotal moment in that debate,” said Boessenkool, in an interview with the Post.

The beer-and-popcorn comment refers to a media appearance by Paul Martin’s director of communications Scott Reid. In comparing the two plans, Reid described the Martin idea as “safe and secure” government-run childcare. The Harper plan was nothing more than a tax cut dressed up as a childcare plan, he said, during a CBC panel discussion during the election campaign in late-2005.

“Don’t give people 25 bucks a day to blow on beer and popcorn. Give them childcare spaces that work,” said Reid.

Reid’s comments were met with hyper-charged election-campaign outrage from all ends of the spectrum.

“Every day, Canadians are putting their children first. They are making sacrifices for them. But the Liberals don’t trust people with their own money. They don’t trust Canadians to make the best decision for their children,” then-Conservative MP Rona Ambrose told reporters.

Harper replied that he was putting the money in the hands of “the experts, mom and dad,” which Boessenkool said was equally as effective for the Conservatives as calling attention to Reid’s comment. (Reid declined the Post’s request for comment for this story.)

Although the policy debate conclusively changed in 2006 — the most ambitious federal daycare programs are now reduced to funnelling money to the provinces — Liberals disagree with Boessenkool’s contention that the child benefit grew out of Harper’s 2006 policy.

“The (Harper) benefits were favouring wealthier and affluent families who didn’t expect those benefits… and didn’t ask for those benefits either,” Jean-Yves Duclos, the minister for families, children and social development, said in an interview with the Post.

The Liberals say they didn’t need inspiration from the Harper government, either. Policies like this, Duclos said, have been “an important feature of all federal governments since 1945.” A similar program, the National Child Benefit was introduced by Martin in 1998 to combat the “welfare wall” and give low-income parents a greater incentive to join the workforce.

The scale of Harper’s child care benefit seems quaint now by current standards. At $1,200 annually per child under six, it was a little more than a family at the low end of the income ladder will now receive in two months under Trudeau’s plan. But Conservatives are keen to point out that the Liberals have retreated from the battle over government-run daycare.

In a long article reflecting on Harper’s tenure for Policy Options magazine, Boessenkool and Sean Speer, another former Harper policy advisor, emphasized the high stakes of the 2006 election’s policy debate. The Liberals had been promising some kind of state-run daycare for 20 years and, finally, with Paul Martin looking for big ideas, they were about to get serious.

“It was a grand scheme that represented the worst technocratic impulses of modern liberalism,” Boessenkool and Speer wrote.

It was a grand scheme that represented the worst technocratic impulses of modern liberalism

With payments rising to more than $500 a month, the plan almost resembles a small-scale guaranteed basic income for Canadians at the low end of the income scale, which might seem odd to credit as a conservative policy idea. Although the basic income is embraced by progressive governments and policy makers, it’s historically also been attractive to conservatives who see the need for some kind of welfare state but want to limit the bureaucracy that administers it.

In the early 1970s, a time of highly pragmatic conservatism, even Richard Nixon saw the benefits of a universal basic income as opposed to a bundle of government programs all staffed by legions of bureaucrats. The plan never came to fruition but the “negative income tax” was seriously considered by conservatives who wanted smaller government.

In that era in the United States, conservatives were opposing a massive expansion of social programs but recognized the need to respond with ideas rather than just nay-saying.

In an interview with the Post, Speer said conservatives across the country should take a lesson from the 2006 election, the Ronald Reagan era in the United States and other times of creative policy-making. He’d like to see “applied conservatism,” where policy is built on a foundation of conservative principles.

With an election campaign that is likely to see the Liberals’ proposed pharmacare plan take prominence, Speer said the Conservatives should be thinking hard about how they will counter it.

“There’s going to be this instinct to be opposed but I don’t think that’s adequate,” he said.

In late March, while the SNC-Lavalin affair was at full boil, CTV News and The Canadian Press both reported — citing anonymous sources — that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had ...","OTTAWA — Liberal MPs have spiked a motion that would have seen the Commons justice committee hold hearings on the leak of information about the last selection process for the Supreme Court of Canada — a leak widely viewed as a political attack on former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould.

In an hour-long meeting that consisted mostly of partisan bickering, the Liberals used their 5-4 majority on the committee to reject the motion, backed by both Conservatives and New Democrats. The motion did not give a list of potential witnesses, but called for the committee to sit additional hours to study the matter and report back by May 31.

“Is this the perfect venue to investigate this matter? No it isn’t,” said Conservative MP Michael Cooper during the meeting. “But seeing as the Prime Minister is seeming to take no action, and given that the attorney general has shown no interest in pursuing the matter, we’re left with where we are today.”

In late March, while the SNC-Lavalin affair was at full boil, CTV News and The Canadian Press both reported — citing anonymous sources — that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had disagreed with Wilson-Raybould’s choice to replace chief justice Beverley McLachlin on the court in 2017. Wilson-Raybould had preferred Manitoba Chief Justice Glenn Joyal, the reports said, but Trudeau rejected that choice because he saw Joyal as too critical of how courts apply the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Trudeau eventually chose to appoint Alberta Judge Sheilah Martin to the top court and promoted sitting Justice Richard Wagner to the role of chief justice. The reports said the episode led Trudeau to doubt Wilson-Raybould’s judgment, and it soured their relationship long before the SNC-Lavalin affair came up.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the leak did not come from him or his office.

The leak was widely condemned by organizations representing lawyers and judges, who described it as a threat to the integrity of a selection process that is supposed to be highly confidential. At the time, Wilson-Raybould herself also condemned the leak, said she was not the source of it, and called for “some sort of investigation as to the source of this information.”

Joyal also issued a statement, saying he feared that “someone is using my previous candidacy to the Supreme Court of Canada to further an agenda unrelated to the appointment process. This is wrong.”

At Wednesday’s committee meeting, opposition members argued that this appeared to be the only real chance to get to the bottom of the matter.

“The integrity of how we appoint people to the highest court of our land is at issue,” said the NDP’s justice critic Murray Rankin during the meeting.

He added that it’s personal for him, as he was one of the two opposition members, along with Conservative MP Rob Nicholson, who sat on the nomination advisory committee on the agreement they keep the information secret.

“I am under a cloud of suspicion, as is my colleague from the Conservative Party,” he said. “I was prepared to go to my grave with the information as to who were the finalists in the process.”

He also rebutted Liberal accusations that they were trying to haul journalists before the committee, saying he’s focused on who leaked the information, not on journalists for doing their job in publishing it.

“I want to hear from people in the Department of Justice,” Rankin said. “I want to hear from people in Prime Minister’s Office. Somebody leaked it. It was either my Conservative friend, myself, or an official.”

Liberal MPs said they were rejecting the motion because the committee is a poor venue for investigating the leak, and pointed out there were also leaks of information over the botched 2013 Supreme Court nomination of Marc Nadon at a time when a Conservative government was in power.

The Liberals accused the opposition of just trying to play politics and keep the SNC-Lavalin affair alive in the news.

“This is really becoming an abuse of process, when we’re trying to politicize everything and trying to make sure that we don’t get around to dealing with all of the issues that Canadians expect us to deal with,” Liberal MP Ali Ehsassi said.

Rankin argued that the Liberals have condemned leaks in much stronger terms in the past. He pointed to Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale calling it “very, very serious” in 2017 when the Omar Khadr $10.5-million settlement payment was leaked. The Privy Council Office went on to investigate that leak, though it won’t say if the hunt was successful.

In 2015, the government referred an investigation to the RCMP into who leaked information about a $700-million shipbuilding project; it eventually resulted in a criminal charge against Vice-Admiral Mark Norman, who has a trial scheduled for August.

Rankin told reporters that he thinks decisions over which leaks to investigate “get made on political grounds, sadly, and the administration of justice, and Canadians, deserve better.”

But opposition MPs say the Liberals’ latest revamp of the main spending estimates still removes parliamentary scrutiny on spending, requiring MPs to “rubber stamp” programs that aren’t ready and gives them funds nonetheless.

“I think we have the same problems we had the year before,” said NDP MP Daniel Blaikie (Elmwood-Transcona, Man.), because Parliamentarians are still signing off on spending that hasn’t been vetted through a Treasury Board process, where program details are fleshed out and spending levels often change.

The Liberals’ first attempt at reforming the way Parliament approves billions in government spending was last year when they put all budget funding into a single $7-billion central vote, but, given the backlash, Parliamentary Budget Officer Yves Giroux said the Treasury Board “clearly needed to take a different approach.”

“It’s really important that Parliament not just become a rubber stamp where we approve funds and find out about the details later when it’s too late,” said Mr. Blaikie, who stressed the Liberals should be “restoring the accountability function” back to MPs.

Mr. Giroux said the critics are “totally justified in making these criticisms,” but what they’re asking for would require a complete overhaul of the system, requiring the budget to be published much earlier and seeing Treasury Board and Finance under one department.

“There is no easy solution,” he said. “In the absence of the structural change, that’s probably the best that can be done in the existing framework. But it’s true that it doesn’t provide Parliamentarians with the same level of oversight.”

The 2019-20 main estimates, tabled on April 11 in the House, ask Parliament to approve $300-billion, which represents the bulk of annual spending by department for programs and services in the current fiscal year. It also includes $6-billion of measures announced recently in the March 19 budget.

Under the old system, which long faced complaints, Parliament approved main estimates before the budget was presented, so when the financial plan was eventually published the estimates were immediately out of line with the government’s spending plan for the year. Budget funding then rolled out through various “supplementary estimates” throughout the year and it was hard to follow where the money went.

Since all $7-billion in budget measures were tacked under one department—the Treasury Board—only one committee studied them. Now that it’s broken into parts, measures dealing with the environment, for example, will go before the Environment Committee where MPs have a better handle on the relevant questions that should be asked about such programs and spending.

The Liberal response this year is an “interesting take to a problem that’s been flagged for many years,” said Mr. Giroux, and a “clear improvement” to the central vote.

Treasury Board President Joyce Murray (Vancouver Quadra, B.C.) said this revamped approach represents “another big step forward” that gives “far more transparency than there has ever been before.”

Asked if the opposition prompted the government’s change in approach, she replied “we’re on a journey to make the estimates and budget more closely aligned and last year was a great first step.”

Moving budget spending under the relevant ministers so different committees can scrutinize them is “what Parliamentarians asked for, and that’s what we delivered,” Ms. Murray said.

“We’ve taken leaps forward already, twice now, and there is far more transparency on budget spending,” she said. “And we’ll continue to work step-by-step on making it even more so in the future.”

Mr. Giroux agreed this system offers more transparency, because the public can “clearly see” specific budget measures over several departments, down to the line. In the past, when budget funding rolled out, he said all announcements were “lumped together” by department so one couldn’t track how much was allocated to each budget measure.

While Mr. Blaikie called that shift “a win,” Conservative MP Kelly McCauley (Edmonton West, Alta.) said the government doesn’t deserve credit for listening on that front because it ignored the primary concern: that its plan undermines parliamentary scrutiny.

“It’s a tiny, tiny improvement but it’s still an affront to why Parliament exists and it’s an affront to taxpayers,” he said. “It’s almost like tripping someone on the sidewalk and then helping them up and expecting a pat on the back. We should not be going down this path anyways.”

The Conservatives panned last year’s central vote as a “slush fund,” and Mr. McCauley said he still considers that description accurate because MPs are still being asked to approve funding on programs that aren’t ready to be rolled out. Their experience in the last year under this approach proves that point, he argued, because officials in many departments who came before committee couldn’t answer questions about staffing, basic program details, or how millions of dollars were being used.

“It’ll be no different this year,” said Mr. McCauley.

$2-billion unspent from last year’s budget

Though Parliament approved $7-billion in budget measures in last year’s main estimates, to date only $4.8-billion has been allocated to the relevant departments.

While it’s normal to see some lapsed spending, Mr. Giroux said the $2-billion is a “big lapse,” and the level of delay apparent in last year’s rollout “suggests there are improvements that are necessary.”

Both Mr. Blaikie and Mr. McCauley highlighted last year’s unspent funds, saying it proves the government should not be asking for money when it doesn’t have a real picture of what the program costs will be.

To that criticism, Ms. Murray said governments “don’t always spend every dollar.”

“Treasury Board’s job is to make sure the plans are in place to make sure spend carefully and wisely and sometimes that’s just not possible, so that’s normal that there will be some lapsed spending,” Ms. Murray said.

While Mr. Giroux is inclined to think it reveals a lack of proper planning, he said the amount leftover could be seen as reassuring that Treasury Board officials are doing their due diligence and not simply “rubber stamping” funds.

“It could be seen as either way,” he said.

The “sclerotic pace” of government administration remains the main issue, said Mr. McCauley, while Mr. Blaikie said it shows “pre-approving the funds doesn’t get the program out the door quicker,” so there’s no reason to go with this approach.

Instead, the government should only ask for budget spending that’s been vetted, and the rest of programs could be rolled out in supplementary estimates as they did before. While that could work, Mr. Giroux said it would return to the “same age-old problems,” where critics bemoaned that all budget promises weren’t reflected in the main estimates.

The Prime Minister has been accused of interfering in a criminal prosecution involving SNC-Lavalin. Even the Liberals most recent re-election budget has generated little interest from Canadians and, surprisingly, the media. Things aren’t so sunny in Trudeauland these days.

article continues below

In the midst of all this, the government is pursuing its legislative agenda and urging Senators to pass Bill C-69 which seeks, among other things, to replace the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency with the Impact Assessment Agency and replace the National Energy Board with the Canadian Energy Regulator.

I bet many Canadians have never heard of C-69. Yet, this bill has the potential of totally disrupting our energy and natural resources sectors. I don’t fault anyone for disregarding this legislation since it’s rather technical in nature with more than 350 pages. Quite honestly, it would probably put most people to sleep.

However, I urge Canadians to pay attention to it because its impacts are far-reaching. Bill C-69 (along with government bills C-48 and C-68) will further erode Canada’s competitiveness in terms of attracting capital into our resource development sector. It threatens the very fabric of our Canadian prosperity.

If Canada can’t get major projects off the ground – like pipelines, high-frequency trains, bridges, clean electricity projects and transmission lines, marine terminals – we risk serious harm to our economy. Naturally, this implies less good-paying, family-supporting jobs for Fred and Martha – your everyday Canadians – and less revenues from royalties and taxes to fund our country’s many social, health and education programs. And don’t get me started on trying to reduce Trudeau’s year-over-year deficits.

Senators recognize the significance of this bill and the sweeping impacts it can have on our economy and our environment, which is why we have taken the extraordinary step to take this bill on the road. The Senate Committee on Energy, the Environment and Natural Resources is travelling to Western Canada for five full days of public hearings this week. So far, we’ve been to Vancouver and Calgary. Today, we are in Fort McMurray and then we will move on to Saskatoon and Winnipeg.

Some argue this decision to travel is unnecessary – like environmentalists who are likely concerned we will further expose the negative impacts of this bill. I, on the other hand, feel this was the right decision considering the witness testimony we’ve heard in Ottawa.

In fact, the Committee has already held more than 30 hours of hearings in Ottawa and heard from dozens of witnesses including premiers and ministers, industry, indigenous representatives, and other stakeholders. Some of the testimony is seriously troubling.

Over the course of our meetings, many issues have been raised and given us much to consider in terms of amendments including on matters related to predictability and certainty for proponents; assessment timelines; regulatory independence; inefficient bureaucratic red tape; ministerial discretion; the lack of a designated project list; factors to be considered when assessing a project; poorly defined concepts; the removal of the standing test; and more.

For those who argue that Conservative Senators are stalling the passage of this bill, or that the Committee doesn’t need to hear from so many witnesses, I would simply say that more than 40% of the witnesses who appeared at the House of Commons committee represented the Government of Canada in some capacity.

To my astonishment, there were no pipeline companies, no port authorities, no natural gas companies, and no resource sector service businesses or local Mom-and-Pop shops who would be impacted by the bill. The Liberal-dominated committee heard from zero provincial governments. Of course, this does not surprise me. Based on my calculations, 9 out of 10 provinces have concerns of various degree regarding this bill, some calling it unconstitutional and federal infringement on provincial jurisdiction, and others calling for its outright defeat.

It has become increasingly clear that this bill must be further amended and Conservative Senators are determined to make that happen – not as a delay tactic but rather as an attempt to partly satisfy some of the concerns we’ve heard and, ultimately, to try to make this work for Canada.

While the Ottawa bubble has been captivated by the SNC-Lavalin scandal (and rightfully so), the Prime Minister has another thing coming if he thinks the Senate’s Official Opposition will sit idle and let this high-consequence, high-controversy bill pass without putting the spotlight on its many flaws. After all, that’s the role of the Senate – to take a sober, second look at legislation and try to improve it.

Bill C-69 needs serious improvement and I’m committed to making it better because Canadians deserve better.

The changes would prevent asylum seekers from making refugee claims in Canada if they have made similar claims in certain other countries, including the United States — a move Border Security Minister Bill Blair says is aimed at preventing “asylum-shopping.”

Trudeau says Canada has been seeing larger numbers of refugee claims because of global instability.

He says his priority is to ensure Canadians retain confidence in the country’s asylum system, which means every person who comes to Canada must do so according to the law.

The Liberals say they're concerned about the framing of the event, but also say it's ""quite clearly an attempt to sell access to power,"" in the letter obtained by CTV News.

The event, scheduled in North York, Ont. next week, includes the tagline: ""healthcare reimagined, it’s time for change."" Based on the wording of the event website it appears geared towards people who work in the health-care field.

The fundraiser is being hosted by the Conservative candidate for Don Valley West, Ont. Yvonne Robertson, and was initially described as a policy forum and cocktail reception with Conservative MPs Pierre Poilievre, or ""our next finance minister"" as the event describes, and Marilyn Gladu, ""our next health minister.""

However, the reference to the two MPs as potential future ministers was removed after CTV News approached Robertson's campaign for comment.

""There is only one person that decides cabinet, and that’s the Prime Minister of Canada. As an opposition party, we have Shadow Ministers, not a cabinet, and referencing them as anything else is not representative of their actual position. That has been changed,"" Robertson's campaign said in an email.

The letter to Scheer—sent before the event webpage was amended—said that it’s ""alarming"" that the party is promoting attendees' ability to be able to bend the ears of Poilievre and Gladu, who are described as future ministers.

""That was one of the least offensive parts,"" Rob Oliphant, the Liberal MP who currently represents the riding, told CTV News after learning that the event description had been amended. He said regardless, the event is still troubling and should be cancelled. ""It's still cash for access,"" Oliphant said, because it is inviting people to donate to the Conservative Party to be able to help shape their policy.

He was one of the seven MPs—who all are either doctors, or represent GTA ridings—who signed the letter.

The event also lists deputy Conservative Party leader Lisa Raitt, MP Peter Kent, and senators Linda Frum and Nicole Eaton, as well as others who will be there to hear ideas about improving the Canadian health-care system related to small businesses and modernizing the Canada Health Act.

""Let us know how the current healthcare system affects your practice and which policy changes you think would have the greatest positive impact on you and your patients,"" the event page reads.

Nowhere in the event listing is privatizing health care stated, though the Liberals are calling on Scheer to ""prove you support public health care, by immediately cancelling this event.""

Oliphant said he found it ""worrisome"" that the event description states that health policy should be ""shaped heavily"" by ""dedicated practitioners."" Oliphant said that while doctors and nurses should be involved, so too should patients and public health officials.

In an effort to counter the event, he's planned an open townhall earlier in the week, featuring Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor.

""The concept that the business of health care comes over the patient outcomes… that's what worries me,"" Oliphant said. ""Health care is not a business, health care is about life and death.""

In response to the Liberals’ concerns about privatization and framing of health care as a business, Robertson's campaign spokesperson Matthew Poon said that the event was designed ""to bring together small business owners like doctors who were unfairly targeted by Justin Trudeau’s small business tax hikes and discuss ways to help them better deliver health services within the principles of the Canada Health Act.""

""Conservatives have always and will always support the principles of the Canada Health Act,"" the statement said.

After coming under fire, largely from the Conservatives, for holding ""cash for access"" events — where for sizeable donations, guests could rub shoulders with the prime minister or members of his cabinet—the Liberals changed the rules to set up more transparency around these events.

The new political fundraising laws came into effect at the end of 2018, requiring parties to advertise fundraisers in advance, and report back afterwards, if they're charging $200 or more per ticket and featuring the prime minister, cabinet ministers, party leaders, or party leadership candidates. Under these rules, there are no requirements for advertising or reporting fundraising events where MPs are the featured guests.

The motion, put forward by Conservative MP Michael Cooper, was for the committee to examine the leak of confidential information around Manitoba Chief Justice Glenn Joyal as a potential pick for the top court.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould reportedly disagreed on who to appoint to fill the vacancy left by retiring Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin in 2017, suggesting there were rifts in their relationship well before the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Liberal MPs said the committee was not an appropriate venue to hold such an investigation and that it would amount to hauling journalists in and forcing them to testify.

“This is really becoming an abuse of process, when we’re trying to politicize everything,” said Liberal MP Ali Ehsassi, who argued that a study would be “tantamount to investigating journalists.”

Cooper and other opposition MPs said hearing from journalists who received the leaks was nonsense and instead wanted to get to who did the leaking.

They questioned whether the Liberals were serious about the breach of confidentiality in the judicial appointments process since there is no other investigation into the leaks by the Prime Minister’s Office or justice ministerial officials.

The federal privacy commissioner, though, is investigating whether Joyal’s privacy rights were violated.

Cooper said after the meeting, which involved cross talk usually reserved for question period, that it wasn’t surprising the Liberals used their majority to vote his motion down.

“They just want to cover this up and hope that it’s going to go away,” he said. “We do need to get answers as to who was the source of a leak that has undermined the integrity of the appointments process and cast a shadow on a distinguished jurist.”

In late March, CTV and the Canadian Press reported that Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould disagreed on whether Manitoba judge Glenn Joyal should be named to fill a vacancy on the country’s highest court.

Joyal, Wilson-Raybould’s reported preference, later responded that he withdrew his name from consideration because his wife had cancer.

Justice Richard Wagner was eventually elevated to the chief justice role and Alberta judge Sheilah Martin was appointed to the top court.

The judicial appointments process is subject to extreme confidentiality in order to preserve its integrity, and the leak was immediately condemned by the legal community, Trudeau, Wilson-Raybould, Justice Minister David Lametti and opposition MPs.

Conservative justice critic Lisa Raitt suggested the Prime Minister’s Office was to blame for the leak, though Trudeau vigorously denied this. Wilson-Raybould also denied leaking the information and said the breach of confidentiality should be investigated.

The Globe and Mail later reported, citing an anonymous source, that Wilson-Raybould wanted Joyal to become chief justice of the Supreme Court in order to place a judge with progressive views on the top court and make way for Canada’s first Indigenous chief justice of a superior court.

The unfolding acts in the current Ottawa drama – SNC-Lavalin – are revealing and disturbing. Canadian taxpayers are paying millions to have 338 Members of Parliament and 100 senators earn a livelihood in the top two percentiles of Canadian incomes and then to observe their conduct as if they are the worst dregs of our society.

Apparently rules are for other Canadians, and conduct with integrity, what is that for our politicians? When a minister of the crown, Jody Wilson-Raybould follows the rules and protocol, she is panned as inadequate for her job and for her hidden native agenda. She cautions a minion, like Michael Wernick, the once Clerk of the Privy Council, that his arguments for the prime minister are beyond acceptable boundaries of her position and they would be political interference in the process. She did not accede, then she will have to pay the price.

Liberal MPs, mainly men, are now in full attack mode. Wilson-Raybould and her supporter Jane Philpott are unfit to be in the Liberal caucus. They will have to be purged. What is the message, honest, credible politicians like these two women must be kicked out of caucus for they have challenged the prime minister’s preference for SNC? She also legally taped a highly-explosive conversation to have evidence against lying men; therefore, she apparently has no honour. Are these attack dogs honourable men?

To discredit this woman for not caving to the prime minister’s bias, two additional items were leaked to the press to portray her with her own agenda. She proposed that Glenn Joyal, a jurist from Manitoba, be appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada so that a fellow Indigenous judge allegedly could be appointed to the Manitoba higher court. The prime minister ignored her advice and appointed an Albertan. Gerald Butts, the prime minister’s once principal secretary, filed that Wilson-Raybould argued that her removal from justice would have consequences with the Indigenous people. These so-called Liberal male feminists can’t seem to work with females as their equals.

If this way is how our country is governed, then we are in serious trouble. Our rules and procedures for governing are secondary to politics. The country be damned. And, this kind of happening is not limited to a single party.

We, Canadians, either tolerate this conduct, or we do what has to be done. That is why we have elections. We should hold all our elected representatives at the three levels of government to the highest standards of performance. If they fail, then out they go. We also fail when we ignore reality, and we continue to elect or re-elect these misfits. Our system of governance will only improve if the population demands better, and acts if better does not happen.

Norman has been accused by the RCMP of warning Davie that Liberal cabinet ministers wanted to derail the Asterix project.,"MV Asterix is now operating with HMCS Regina in Middle Eastern waters as part of a Canadian-led coalition task force.

The Asterix, a commercial ship converted by Davie shipyards in Quebec and leased to the federal government to perform a military supply role, has been going almost non-stop since it was launched. It has refueled both Canadian and allied warships.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said there is no need for a second such interim supply ship and the head of the Royal Canadian Navy, Vice Admiral Ron Lloyd, says he is happy with having the Asterix as the force’s only supply ship until 2023 when the first of two Joint Support Ships, to be built at Seaspan in Vancouver, is expected to be ready.

Davie, however, has offered to convert a second such ship, MV Obelix, to the same capabilities of Asterix and lease it to the government.

At one point the navy had three of its own supply ships supporting its vessels.

Information recently tabled in Parliament indicates that even though Asterix has been going full-tilt over the last year, there was still a requirement for Canadian warships to receive fuel and provisions from supply vessels operated by foreign navies or for Canadian ships to head to port to receive fuel and supplies.

Here are the details from Parliament:

The Asterix is also at the heart of federal government’s case against Vice Admiral Mark Norman. Norman has been accused by the RCMP of warning Davie that Liberal cabinet ministers wanted to derail the Asterix project.

That development leaked out to the news media and the resulting embarrassment was one of the factors that forced the Liberal government to back down on its plans and Asterix proceeded. Norman has denied any wrongdoing.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had twice predicted that Norman would eventually wind up in court, prompting concerns of political interference and concerns the Liberal government is punishing the officer.

Norman’s lawyers are in pre-trial trying to get documents they argue are needed so the officer can defend himself. Norman’s trial is scheduled for August.",The case for a second interim supply ship?

From the initial wrongdoing, through to the escalating bullying, clumsy cover-up, mounting casualties and fallout, this is the trajectory of major whistleblowing crises. History is littered with the fall of powerful politicians and corporate titans as testament that nothing is more powerful than truth.

But like so many authoritative and blundering bosses acting to extinguish “truth-tellers” — including using surrogates (former principal secretary Gerald Butts and Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick) to do the dirty work — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau woefully miscalculated the steely determination of now-independent MPs Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott. Betting his “righteous” outrage — contrived, or simply “his truth” — would contain the crisis, Trudeau was blind to their fortitude, trumping first his suspect intentions and latterly his blundering exculpations by the conscientious exercise of their own voices. This crisis challenges something profound and central to our national identity: the doctrine of judicial independence and equal rights under the law, and the sensibility of Canadians to tolerate, let alone trust, the public institutions on which we rely.

As other countries promote the value of public-interest whistleblowing, Canada remains a feudal fiefdom. This is the real scandal.

As other countries promote the value of public-interest whistleblowing, Canada remains a feudal fiefdom. This is the real scandal.

No political party in Canada has ever committed to a sustained and consistent campaign to protect whistleblowers: the Wilson-Rayboulds and Philpotts of the world. In this regard, Liberals and Conservatives are, always have been, just different names on the same coin, mutually and complicitly understanding that power is at risk when people are free to speak about wrongdoing and violations of public trust. While Andrew Scheer may appear in this scandal to be the more ennobled of the two, based on his effusive calls for Wilson-Raybould to be free to speak, history reveals both parties’ track records of stonewalling and hiding truth. From Jean Chrétien to Stephen Harper and through to Trudeau, all promised transparency, all practised secrecy. All promised whistleblower protection, all embraced restrictive and oppressive anti-free speech regimes.

Worse still, they made integrity the signature piece of their electoral platforms. Hope given, hope crushed, oppresses more than hope never given. Too often Canada masquerades as the gatekeeper of enlightened, free-speech democracy, when reality is darkly different.

Today, Trudeau and his “team” are working hard to characterize the expulsion of Wilson-Raybould and Philpott as a breakdown in “trust.” But the sin of these two women was not about acts of disloyalty but about committing the truth. The birthplace of scandal is not in environments of respectful and open dissent but in dark corridors of power and secret phone calls and communications. This scandal is not that Wilson-Raybould taped Wernick’s gut-heaving proselytizing but, rather, what Wernick was trying to achieve, and might very well have achieved but for the smoking-gun of that recorded conversation.

Yet Trudeau continues to vilify the messenger. While guilefully denouncing Wilson-Raybould’s recording as “unconscionable,” what is actually unconscionable is Trudeau’s feigned moral indignation, and his and his Liberal acolytes self-serving pronouncements that loyalty required Wilson-Raybould and Philpott to quit before Trudeau threw them out. People of courage and moral foundation don’t quit; they persevere.

The real and lasting scandal arising out of the SNC-Lavalin Affair is the retrograde and quiescent culture in Canada requiring silence about matters that threaten the public interest. Those in government who speak out are subject to swift and cruel punishment. Moreover, the SNC crisis shows just how difficult it was for two women of privilege — as Wilson-Raybould and Philpott were as ministers — to be heard. Imagine ordinary, honest, and dedicated public servants. They don’t stand a chance.

It is said that it takes courage to speak truth when challenging formidable power and institutions. But speaking truth is what we are born to do. Shutting up is what the powerful force us to do. Election 2019 exhorts Canadians to demand from those running a commitment — evidenced through action, not words — to lock in real and meaningful protection for truth-tellers and good-faith whistleblowers. Otherwise, the new norm will be successive governments cycling through perpetual crisis while lying and deceiving us.

The government-owned flagship news program, The National, sprang to attention. Host Rosemary Barton kicked off the Monday night show by cranking up the volume on “Canada’s Changing Climate Report” from Environment Canada scientists:

“Tonight a dire warning for Canada’s climate. The country is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world. According to virtually every climate scientist, climate change is already here. Temperatures have risen and are expected to keep rising with dramatic and increasingly disastrous impacts. And today we are learning that in Canada, that goes double. A government report from Environment and Climate Change Canada, years in the making, confirms that Canada is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the world. Far from being a safe haven, Canada has been directly in the climate crosshairs. And barring drastic global action, more is coming.”

As with much of climate science, there are reasons to doubt the worst predictions

Along with CTV News and other media, the CBC fell for the media manipulation trick. They gobbled down Environment Canada’s easy-to-digest “Headline Statements” which on quick reading gave the impression that Canada had become something of a global inferno. Warming in Canada is double global levels driven by human influence leading to thinning glaciers, storm surges, sea-level rising, more chance of devastating flooding.

The CBC then moved on to the official Liberal message: Bring on the desperately needed carbon tax! And — as we learned this week — bring on what promises to be a steady blizzard of climate announcements, like Monday’s news that the Loblaw grocery giant will receive a $12-million subsidy to retrofit its refrigeration systems and make them greener. As one wise-guy noted on Twitter, the Liberals will be giving a measly average $307 carbon-tax rebate to Canadian families but handing $12-million to Loblaw, which earns billions in revenue but has a history of pandering to green populism. Apparently the supermarket chain’s already-subsidized solar panels aren’t doing enough to make the store fridges sufficiently green.

There’s more to come. The Loblaw cash is part of a $450-million low-carbon economy “investment” fund now being distributed across the country. If they average $12 million each, that implies another three-dozen staged media events over the next few months leading up to the election.

The one-sentence justification for the carbon tax and coming corporate-subsidy bonanzas is the headline: Canada warmed at a rate double the magnitude of global warming. The claim is essentially meaningless, as Guelph University economist Ross McKitrick points out elsewhere in FP Comment today. Since most of the earth’s surface is ocean, the average temperature over any land mass is bound to be higher than the global average, since land gets warmer faster than water does.

That warming is taking place seems beyond dispute, but by how much from which cause and to what effect is unclear. It might be good for Canada. In Chapter Four of the new Environment Canada report, the authors predict that winter temperatures will increase more than summer temperatures. “There will be progressively more growing degree days (a measure of the growing season, which is important for agriculture) and fewer freezing degree days,” implying less severe winters. Sounds good.

Contrary to claims of insurers and others, Canada has not experienced increases in extreme weather events. There have been more hot days and fewer extreme cold days in recent years, but while future extreme-temperature days could increase fire and flood events in future, there’s little evidence of such events so far. “The observational record has not yet shown evidence of consistent changes in short-duration precipitation extremes across the country,” the report acknowledges.

The report reaches ambiguous conclusions on two major Canadian environmental events, the 2013 southern Alberta flood and the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire.

On the flood, the report states that while greenhouse gases increased the likelihood of extreme, flood-producing rainfall, “confidence in this attribution is low because of the difficulties in modelling precipitation extremes, which exhibit large variability at small scales, such as for this event.”

The report claimed “medium confidence” that climate change increased the wildfire risk associated with the Fort McMurray event. “The assessment of medium confidence balances high confidence in human influence on the increase in temperature, which affects fire risk strongly, with many other factors contributing to this event that are more difficult to represent in a climate model.”

The report turns sensational when it looks to the future, mostly based on a selection of climate models and projections that are beyond the ken of most humans, including some scientists. A good example is the projections of rising sea level to the year 2100.

Among the problems is the fact that in parts of Canada the land is rising, and in other parts it’s sinking. Around Hudson Bay, the “relative sea level” is falling because the “rate of uplift” in the land is increasing due to geological movements. In Atlantic Canada, where land masses are falling, the sea-level rise appears greater. The sea level at Halifax, where the land is falling, has been rising for more than a century.

As with much of climate science, there are reasons to doubt the worst predictions, especially about rising sea levels. While the media jumped aboard Environment Canada’s sea-level projections, the science remains highly speculative, some say improbable. In a paper last year, U.S. climate scientist Judith Curry warned “ extreme values of possible sea level rise are regarded as extremely unlikely or so unlikely that we cannot even assign a probability.”

And so it goes with climate science reports, where the worst extremes are routinely trotted out as the new normal.",Terence Corcoran: The Liberals manipulate a climate report to justify handouts to Loblaws,Leader-Post,https://leaderpost.com/opinion/terence-corcoran-the-liberals-manipulate-a-climate-report-to-justify-handouts-to-loblaws/wcm/a1e34a38-eacd-4205-a3ba-8266e98705d9

“Justin Trudeau and the federal government have made much-needed investments into Truth and Reconciliation initiatives as well as significant investments in the Northern Manitoba economy,” said Klassen in a press release. “Manitoba’s North needs these investments more than ever, and Justin Trudeau and the federal Liberals are the only choice to ensure that the North continues to see this much-needed investment and work needed for Truth and Reconciliation within our Indigenous communities.”

Originally from the fly-in northeastern Manitoba First Nation of St. Theresa Point in the Island Lake area, Klassen was elected in as Keewatinook MLA in 2016, defeating former NDP MLA Eric Robinson as one of three successful Liberal candidates in the election that brought Premier Brian Pallister’s Progressive Conservative government into power, breaking a 17-year hold on government by the provincial NDP.

Klassen’s press release announcing her intent to jump to federal politics said that she is known by some of her Manitoba legislature peers as the “Dragon Slayer” for her defeat of the long-time MLA and says she is up for the challenge of taking on Ashton, who has represented Churchill and then Churchill-Keewatinook Aski since 2008, though her margin of victory shrank considerably in the last election from the previous one. Ashton beat Liberal candidate Rebecca Chartrand, who doesn’t live in Northern Manitoba, by fewer than 1,000 votes in the 2015 federal election, while she beat Conservative candidate Wally Daudrich from Churchill by 5,000 votes in the 2011 election.

“This will be a challenging race, but I have the complete support of my community and my family,"" Klassen said. ""The continued commitment to the North by Justin Trudeau and the federal government is crucial in both achieving more Truth and Reconciliation initiatives as well as building our northern economy. The time of Ashton family representation in the North is over, and now is the time for representation and leadership that can get results for the North.”

The Churchill-Keewatinook Aski riding is 75 per cent Indigenous and many of its First Nations are accessible only by air or by winter roads.

Klassen’s move to the federal realm will put the Manitoba Liberal Party at risk of losing official party status, which it just regained last summer for the first time since 1995 when party leader Dougald Lamont won a byelection in Winnipeg’s St. Boniface riding to give the party four seats.

River Heights MLA Jon Gerrard and Burrows MLA Cindy Lamoureux are the Manitoba Liberals’ other MLAs.

Official party status gives parties access to funding, research staff and a guaranteed presence during Question Period and on committees.

The Liberal government has insisted it wants to find a scientific solution to the canola dispute, in keeping with ...","OTTAWA—Canola farmers whose livelihoods have been targeted by China in its feud with Canada say it’s time for the federal government to be aggressive at the political level in its fight against a growing number of agricultural trade barriers around the world.

Several producers told two parliamentary committees Tuesday that China’s recent rejection of Canadian canola-seed shipments is only the latest trade disruption that’s hurt the country’s agriculture sector.

They reminded MPs in Ottawa about a number of major trade obstacles faced by Canadian agricultural exporters in faraway markets like India, Italy, Vietnam and Saudi Arabia.

“Canada can feed the world but not if our government does not act strongly on our behalf, removing non-tariff trade barriers, enforcing existing trade agreements and removing political roadblocks,” Alberta canola farmer Stephen Vandervalk told the House of Commons agriculture committee.

Citing concerns about pests, China has rejected canola-seed imports from Canada and has suspended the licences of two major Canadian exporters.

The moves to cut off the critical Canadian export have been widely viewed as China applying economic pressure on Canada in response to the December arrest of senior Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver at the behest of the United States.

Any extended canola dispute with China, which imported $2.7 billion worth of canola seed from Canada last year, would deliver a painful economic blow to producers, the supply chain and the wider Canadian economy.

The price of canola has fallen since the dispute started last month. The late-winter timing of the disruption has been particularly difficult because it’s forced many farmers to suddenly rethink the planting decisions vital to their businesses.

On Tuesday, producers made it clear to MPs at the committees that even with the urgency around the China conflict, the pain is not only about canola. Canadian farmers, they said, are staring at other big trade hurdles in world markets.

Several of the witnesses mentioned issues that have affected Canada’s durum wheat exports to Italy, wheat sales to Vietnam, pulse exports to India and feed-barley shipments to Saudi Arabia.

Saskatchewan grain farmer Mehgin Reynolds (who is seeking a Conservative party nomination) told MPs that, for instance, her four-year crop rotation includes lentils, barley, canola and durum wheat—all products that face obstacles on foreign markets.

“The frightening reality is that almost every crop being grown in Canada is currently struggling with one trade barrier or another,” Reynolds said.

The Liberal government has insisted it wants to find a scientific solution to the canola dispute, in keeping with China’s insistence that the problem is tainted seeds.

The Liberals have established a working group that includes officials from Richardson International Ltd. and Viterra Inc.—the two exporters that have had their licences to sell canola revoked by China—and representatives from the governments of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau has requested to send a delegation of experts to China to examine the issue. She’s said officials are exploring options to support farmers by expanding existing programs.

Canola producer Mark Kaun told the committee it’s time for the Canadian government to start playing “hardball.”

“There’s a pile of imports that come into this country from China&mdash’and maybe some of their ships should sit and wait in the water,” Kaun said. “Canadian canola is contaminated—it’s contaminated with political dirt and bureaucracy.”

“This is a political issue plain and simple. Political problems need political solutions,” agreed Vandervalk, who’s also vice-president representing Alberta with the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association.

“If we must play the game of grain inspections, so be it. But in the meantime Canadian grain farmers are the ones paying the price for the political failings.”",Canadian farmers demand strong response to expanding trade obstacles,plant.ca,https://www.plant.ca/general/canadian-farmers-demand-strong-response-to-expanding-trade-obstacles-182787/

The announcement sparked ridicule and outrage on ...,"The environment minister also disagreed with opposition claims the Liberals only support corporations in the fight against climate change. She pointed to the carbon tax rebates being sent to people in provinces where the levy was imposed this month, which the government says will outweigh the expected extra costs of gasoline and other products for 80 per cent of residents. In Ontario, where the Progressive Conservative government has railed against what it calls a ""job-killing carbon tax,"" a household of four will get a $307 carbon tax rebate this year.

Loblaw is also one of 54 recipients chosen by officials at the environment department for the federal government's ""low carbon economy challenge."" The initiative includes $450 million for businesses, municipalities, Indigenous groups, not-for-profits and provinces and territories that apply for federal help with climate change initiatives. The idea is to ""leverage"" federal support with initiatives that reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change.

""We want to create incentives for people to do more, not less,"" McKenna said. ""We're going to continue to move forward on a plan that is going seriously reduce our emissions, doing it in an effective and affordable way.""

In an emailed statement, Loblaw Companies Ltd. spokesperson Catherine Thomas said the grocery chain plans to spend $36 million to reduce emissions from its fridges, and repeated McKenna's claim that this will be akin to taking 50,000 cars off the road. ""Our range of carbon-reduction investments is over $100 million as we work to reduce our carbon footprint by 30 [per cent] by 2030,"" she wrote.

The NDP and Conservatives have criticized the Liberals' climate change plan for favouring corporations before. Leaders from both parties have focused on how the carbon price applies to heavy industries like cement production, where firms are effectively exempt from paying the price for a portion of their emissions. The government has justified this as necessary to protect sectors that can't easily change their systems of production to reduce emissions, and those that compete with firms in other countries where a carbon tax doesn't exist.

The NDP has also accused the Liberals of stalling on a commitment to eliminate at least some federal subsidies to oil and gas companies, which a 2018 report from an environmental organization pegged at $3.3 billion per year.

Neither major opposition party has released the full details of their plans to fight climate change ahead of the federal election this fall.

Canada has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions to 30 per cent below their 2005 level by 2030 — a target that most environmentalists deem inadequate given the stark warnings from the United Nations and federal government scientists about the possible consequences of climate change in the coming decades. Canada is also on track to miss its reduction target, according to the government's own projections, though McKenna has argued future advances in green technology will make up for the projected shortfall.

Last week, federal scientists published a report that concluded Canada has warmed twice as fast as the world average because of climate change, and that efforts to reduce emissions can only now mitigate how much damage will be done. Among the consequences cited in their report was the ongoing disappearance of Arctic sea ice, rising sea levels, and an expectation that summertime water shortages and extreme weather like floods and forest fires will be more likely to occur because of climate change.

THUNDER BAY – Mayor Bill Mauro has sent a letter to Premier Doug Ford, urging the Ontario government to maintain Canadian content requirements in its subway procurements.

Mauro, who as a Liberal MPP helped usher in Canadian content legislation to help protect companies like Bombardier, said he’s concerned the multi-national company’s Thunder Bay plant could be in jeopardy once its latest round of contracts are up, potentially affecting as many as 1,200 high-paid employees.

The province recently announced plans to upload responsibility of Toronto’s subway system and Mauro reminded Ford, whose office has acknowledged the letter, that Bombardier is Thunder Bay’s largest private-sector employer that helps drive the local economy and the quality of life of the city’s residents.

“We all understand and appreciate how important Bombardier is to the local economy. We all are aware that we’re close to seeing the end of contract work at the plant, so we’re all very concerned,” Mauro said, explaining his decision to send a letter to Ford.

“We have sent a number of letters, we have had a number of conversations with the provincial government around the importance of Bombardier and the workforce to the economy. This was just one more example of outreach by us, and others doing the same thing, to try to reinforce how important this is to our economy here in Thunder Bay.”

Mauro said both Ford and his minister of economic development are aware of the issues.

The previous Liberal government required at least 25 per cent Canadian manufacturing content in order to provide funding for mass transit projects, which Mauro said often led to 50 and 60 per cent Canadian content. But a recent Via Rail contract was fully awarded to a German company and the trains will be manufactured in the United States, a country that has recently upped its American-made content requirements under the watch of President Donald Trump.

Mauro’s letter indicated that as recently as 2015 Bombardier had a network of more than 500 Ontario-based suppliers that benefited workers not only in Thunder Bay, but also Mississauga, Markham, London, Hamilton and Toronto.

He added he sees opportunity to continue existing contracts with both the Toronto Transit Commission and Metrolix for up to 231 more trains.

Mauro also noted he’s spoken with Toronto Mayor John Tory recently, who indicated plans for mass transit upgrades and expansion, work the Thunder Bay’s mayor believes Bombardier is perfectly suited to undertake.",Mauro asks Ford to continue Canadian content requirements,Tbnewswatch,https://www.tbnewswatch.com/local-news/mauro-asks-ford-to-continue-canadian-content-requirements-1357680

“I think the Queen just might be eating babies. Fuck, there’s all kind of circumstantial evidence that states she’s a Satan worshipping cannibal, which is kind of fucked up and weird isn’t it? I never did trust authority but I would’ve never bet on it being this weird.”

Murray Acton aka “The Cretin” is as an anti-authoritarian punk-rock anarchist and frontman of Canadian hardcore-punk outfit Dayglo Abortions. For nearly 40 years, Acton and his band of misfits from Victoria, B.C. have caused controversy all around the globe with their “fuck you” attitude and groovy heavy-rock riffs, garnering worldwide acclaim in the underground punk and hardcore scene.

The band’s highest selling record to date, Feed Us A Fetus, showcases former president of the United States Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan sitting at a table with a cooked fetus on a dinner plate. Their following record, Here Today, Guano Tomorrow, saw the band encounter obscenity charges from an Ontario police officer, who found great offense in his teenage daughter listening to tracks like “Fuck My Shit Stinks” and “Fuck Satan to Death” plastered alongside the image of a hamster brutalized by gunshot. The charges were dropped in in 1990 and Dayglo Abortions released their next album, Two Dogs Fucking, in 1991. The artwork is exactly as it sounds. Their latest album, 2016’s Armageddon Survival Guide, originally held a much different title that would have definitely landed them a date in court.

“Originally that was supposed to be out in 2012. This album was supposed to be called Kill Stephen Harper,” Acton says. “They really didn’t like it because it was provoking people to sue us again. I was gonna start a Stephen Harper popularity fund where we have this thing on Facebook that says ‘Would you pledge $5000 dollars to have Stephen Harper assassinated?’ and a thermometer would go up. Obviously that thing was gonna hit the roof in no time, eh.”

Though the album’s title changed, Acton still got a dig in on Harper with the song “Canadian Hate-Triot” where the frontman yells obscenities at our former Prime Minister, calling him a corporate whore and towel-boy for the global elite.

Acton isn’t too pleased with our current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau either. He calls Trudeau a “Fuckin’ elitist slob” who is “Just like his father. A fuckin’ lawyer looking out for himself and his corporate cronies.”

“He’s never come through with anything,” Acton says. “He makes like he’s gonna come clean with the aboriginals and stuff like that, and fuckin’ nothing. It was all just campaign smoke. The guy is full of shit and he’s ruined fuckin’ marijuana. I’m fuckin’ pissed about that. One of my favourite things to do and he’s fuckin ruined it.”

Acton admits that the upcoming Canadian elections are making him nervous. He doesn’t plan to vote for either the Liberals or Conservatives and will most likely cast his ballot for the Green Party. Acton usually votes Green regardless, but there’s a lingering fear of what this election could bring if Conservative leader Andrew Scheer becomes our PM.

“We could end up with a fuckin’ right wing nut bar want to be like Trump character the way things are going.”

The past U.S. election gave Acton a flurry of new material, and he says a new Dayglo Abortions album is written, and ready to record.

“It’s gonna raise a few eyebrows,” Acton concludes. “It’s not particularly politically correct, but I’ve never been politically correct anyways. I don’t go out of my way to hurt people’s feelings or anything like that, but sometimes you gotta hurt a few feelings just to get the job done, ya know? It’s like trolling in real life.”

In conclusion, Acton can forget about all of this when he’s on stage. He assures the band is tighter than they have ever been, and urges anyone who hasn’t seen the band to check them out at SBC on April 12.",B.C.

Quebec, by contrast, had 6.2 percent of sales and 23 percent of the population, while Ontario had 36 percent of sales and 39 percent of the population

(Bloomberg) — Canadian spending on legal pot will increase ninefold to $5.2 billion by 2024, but the market’s potential continues to be hindered by a patchwork of provincial regulations, according to a new report.

After becoming the first major economy to legalize recreational cannabis on Oct. 17, Canadian sales are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 44 percent to $5.2 billion in 2024 from $569 million in 2018, Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics said Tuesday. That’s down from a January forecast of $5.9 billion by 2022.

Competition from a well-established illicit market, limited product selection, a slow retail rollout and “languid online distribution” are all inhibiting the growth of the Canadian pot market, the report says.

This resulted in medical patients spending an average of $1,452 on legal cannabis in 2018 versus $3,634 in Colorado and $3,933 in Arizona, while per-person recreational spending is forecast by 2024 to only reach the low end of the $500-to-$1,000 range seen in some U.S. states.

In addition, spending will be “highly regional and tightly tied to provincial-level regulations that created vast gaps in business friendliness across the provinces,” the report says.

Alberta, for example, accounted for 38 percent of Canada’s pot sales in 2018 despite having less than 12 percent of its population. Quebec, by contrast, had 6.2 percent of sales and 23 percent of the population, while Ontario had 36 percent of sales and 39 percent of the population.

“Alberta’s comparatively liberal regulatory regime suggests it will rank among the fastest-growing provincial cannabis markets,” Arcview and BDS said. The western province, where retailers are privately run, is expected to open more than 200 licensed stores in the first year of legalization compared with fewer than 50 in each of the other provinces.

Ontario just opened its first 10 stores on April 1, nearly six months after legalization, while Quebec has 13 government-run stores open to date.

Product shortages have also restricted early sales, forcing Ontario to limit its initial number of retail licenses to just 25, while Quebec had to close its cannabis stores three days a week. This was typical of the U.S. states that legalized before Canada and should ease as more licensed production comes online, the report says.

In a report tabled in the House of Commons on April 9, the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities cited ballooning domestic passenger traffic as part of a global trend which will require more pilots–as many as 620,000 worldwide by 2036, 80 per cent of whom have yet to be trained.

The committee referenced a 2018 report by the Canadian Council for Aviation and Aerospace (CCAA) which pointed out that fewer than 1,200 new commercial licences are issued annually in Canada. Moreover, “a large proportion of Canadian licences (nearly half in 2015) are issued to international students and only 70 per cent of new pilots choose to remain in the aviation industry. As such, fewer than 500 new pilots become available to the Canadian aviation industry each year.”

The CCAA predicts that Canada will be short nearly 3,000 (fixed-wing and rotary-wing) pilots by 2025, a number it says does not consider the reality that even more will be needed to address the impact of Transport Canada’s new flight and duty time rules, announced four month ago.

The parliamentary committee warned that a pilot shortage presents “significant risks” to remote communities, particularly in the North, which often rely exclusively on air transport. In addition, the Auditor General found in Fall 2018 that the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) is grappling with pilot recruitment and retention issues as opportunities in the civil market become increasingly attractive.

The committee’s study was kick-started by British Columbia Liberal MP Stephen Fuhr, a former RCAF CF-188 Hornet pilot whose Air Force career also included flight training and standards and who also chairs the Standing Committee on National Defence.

Fuhr said in a statement that Canada has lost the ability to generate the pilots it needs. “Estimates are that Canada will need 7,000 to 10,000 new pilots by 2025, resulting in a projected shortage of at least 3,000 pilots, given our current production rate,” he said. “Some of the biggest challenges to pilot production in Canada are the high cost of training for new commercial pilots, the low starting salaries, and an industry that has evolved a non-linear career path.”

His private motion for the study was approved unanimously by the House in late November and the all-party committee began working on it the next day. In eight meetings between then and late February, the committee heard from 26 organizations, companies and individuals and received 13 briefs in which the common theme was that Canada needs to strengthen flight schools’ capacity to address the looming pilot shortage.

As of last week, Transport Canada listed 360 domestic flight training units offering options ranging from recreational to multi-engine training. Of those, 175 offered commercial training up to an integrated Commercial Pilot Licence – Aeroplane/Instrument Rating (CPL(A)/IR), an 18-month course the Air Transport Association of Canada (ATAC) says costs between $75,000 and $90,000. A further 139 schools offer flight instructor ratings typically costing around $10,000.

However, even after completing the CPL(A)/IR, pilots need an Airline Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL) for employment as a regional or national airline captain. That requires 1,500 hours of flight time and three written exams; many pilots accumulate the necessary time working as instructors.

Among other things, the committee calls on the federal government to co-operate with all stakeholders to “develop policies to support and encourage” growth of the flight training sector, and to work with other levels of government to “encourage flight instruction as a career path” with incentives such as tax credits for experienced pilots and loan forgiveness programs for new graduates.

The government also is urged to co-operate on “outreach activities” to encourage military veterans, women and Indigenous people to consider aviation as a career, and to increase “economic incentives” for flight schools in remote and northern communities, including help with capital costs and loan forgiveness programs for new pilots in the North.

Other financial challenges are covered by several recommendations, one of which is that the federal government work with the other levels of government on assisting flight schools with “the high capital costs” of setting up, operating and expanding. This would be augmented by increased funding through the federal Airport Capital Assistance Program, as recommended in 2015 by a panel which reviewed the Canada Transportation Act. The federal government also is urged to:

consider a 100 per cent bonus depreciation for certain capital assets, so schools can write off equipment purchases such as simulators and training aircraft;

amend the Canada Student Loans Program to include in-air instruction time for the purpose of loan eligibility;

extend the Student Work Placement program to flight training;

extend the Veterans Affairs Canada Education and Training Benefit to flight training for employment purposes; and

establish financial assistance programs, or amend existing programs, to assist professional students with the high cost of instruction through expanded eligibility criteria which recognize the integral role of Private Pilot’s Licence training in commercial training.

Transport Canada’s role is addressed in several recommendations. Among other things, the committee recommends a review of regulatory oversight, particularly of operations which rely heavily on recent graduates. The committee further recommends that:

the hours-based flight instruction regime be “modernized;”

more competency-based training as the primary reference for completion; and

intergovernmental co-operation “where safe and appropriate” on exemptions to the requirement for third-party training of instructors.

Another potentially contentious recommendation, given that it could be regarded by other countries as “poaching,” is that Canada should “simplify and encourage immigration by foreign pilots, particularly international graduates of Canadian flight schools.”

ATAC president John McKenna–whose organization represents 44 flight training members and was one of the earliest to appear before the committee–was still working through the report but took time out to chat with Skies about his initial impressions.

“The government seems keen on developing solutions with industry and the flight training community,” he said, explaining that there had been discussions with Transport Minister Marc Garneau “on the very subject of financing and finding ways to attract youth and Indigenous people and women to aviation.”

He said ATAC would continue to work on what he sensed as “a willingness there to act” because the government has realized the “drastic” nature of a pilot shortfall.

“We recently conducted a poll ourselves amongst our people here and the biggest problems that schools have right now are a lack of instructors and a lack of equipment.”

McKenna pointed out that “a lot of . . . the equipment is older than the people flying in them” and that if Canada is serious about benefitting from the international training market, upgrades are critical. “We always get a share but we could get a lot more. We need to increase our capacity, we need to be more modern. You can’t train people in dial cockpits when everyone now is working with glass cockpits . . . so there’s an investment that’s required and everyone is aware of that. Some of these recommendations touch that, so that’s good.”

When Skies noted that the Finance Minister’s recent budget had offered little in the way of added support for the flight training sector, McKenna suggested that Garneau had been “hoping for something in there” but it obviously hadn’t materialized despite vigorous lobbying.

That initiative will continue, including a push for changes to the Income Tax Act. “There’s a lot of things that we’re working on as far as that goes,” said McKenna, pointing out that while tax write-offs are appealing, “you have to have the money to buy things before you can write them off. [And] right now, even if you get the best equipment, you can’t get instructors.”

Asked how the instructor cadre can be increased if there’s a fundamental challenge of getting more students into the training pipeline to begin with, he replied that the committee’s report had “touched” on the question.

“You’ve got to give them something,” he said. “If you’re an instructor for five years, you should either get a credit for each of the years that you’re an instructor, if you’ve had a [flight training] loan or something, or you get interest forgiveness during that period. Something! They can pay off their loans because they’ve got an extra tax credit or a subsidy because they’re an instructor.

“There are definitely ways to do it. It’s just that there has to be the political will to do it.”

By The Canadian Press on April 10, 2019.

CALGARY – Alberta NDP Leader Rachel Notley is urging small-c conservatives to come on board because they share core values with her party and not Jason Kenney’s United Conservatives.

Notley says it’s clear from the policies and comments from some UCP candidates that a Kenney government wouldn’t protect some religions and LGBTQ groups.

Speaking in Calgary as advance polls remain open for Tuesday’s election, Notley also urged voters to cast a ballot for the NDP – instead of for the Liberals or Alberta Party – so as to join forces to beat the UCP.

Polls suggest the UCP is leading in the campaign, but Notley said she is spending more of her time in Calgary because the gap is closing as people focus their attention on Kenney’s policies.

Kenney has said his party believes in equality for all and he has touted his party’s ethnically diverse candidates.

But he has also promised to roll back some privacy protections for children who join gay-straight alliances at schools.

But the defeats in the legislature have given the Greens a chance to demonstrate how they differ from the province’s two main political parties, starting with their opposition to the $40-billion LNG Canada project in Kitimat.

“In the face of what to us looks like staggering... evidence about this being the worst possible direction to be taking, it was really important that we voice that opposition,” said Sonia Furstenau, the MLA for Cowichan Valley. “All of the evidence right now is telling us the last thing the world needs is a massive new point-source emitter of greenhouse gases.”

The LNG debate was the latest chapter in the ongoing story of the Green MLAs’ attempts to navigate their relationship with the NDP, which since 2017 has relied on their support on key votes to stay in power.

It comes following a poor showing in a January byelection in Nanaimo, where the party’s share of the vote fell by more than 50 per cent from the 2017 election.

The results left some inside and outside the party wondering whether the Greens were being overshadowed by their partners in power-sharing and in danger of losing relevancy. There were questions about whether the party could keep building momentum, or if it had peaked with three MLAs.

Green leader Andrew Weaver has emphasized the party’s different vision for the future of the province, but the opposition to LNG development has made that vision most visible.

Besides the greenhouse gas emissions, Furstenau said, supplying gas for the LNG Canada site will mean more fracking in the northeast of the province. A recent government report found there’s not enough data to understand fracking’s environmental impacts, though it is conclusively linked to an increase in seismic activity.

“I’m quite shocked,” Furstenau said. “Fundamentally the vast majority of British Columbians want to see governments making decisions that will move us away from increasing our emissions and will move us towards climate action.”

Nor would most British Columbians support providing what amounts to a $6-billion subsidy to the fossil fuel industry, she said.

Yet in the legislature, only the three Green MLAs made the case against the government’s direction.

NDP-Liberal agreement

Premier John Horgan has argued that the LNG Canada proposal fits with the CleanBC plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and that the provincial government stands to gain $23 billion from the project over its lifetime.

It will see thousands of jobs created in a part of the province that badly needs them, he’s argued.

In doing so, he’s contributed to the conclusion among many environmentalists that despite the Green role in the government, it values jobs over anything else.

An April 6 Globe and Mail article found there was little difference between the NDP minority government and the former BC Liberal government in policies on forestry, mining, LNG and Site C.

Longtime activist and Order of Canada recipient Vicky Husband offered a blunt assessment in an interview: “They haven’t changed a damn thing ... there doesn’t appear to be an environmental bone in their body.”

The message from Horgan’s office to his ministers is clear, she said. “If it’s a choice between jobs and the environment, jobs just win.”

That means it’s extremely important that the Greens keep building on their success, she added. “We have two major parties in B.C. who don’t care about the environment, no matter what they’re saying.”

Warren Bell, a Salmon Arm doctor and Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment board member, said the Greens are taking the right position given the threat of climate change.

“It’s not surprising this rift has developed,” he said. “What is surprising is the BC Liberals and the NDP are finding common cause around this particular matter... It’s turning the NDP and the Liberals into Tweedledee and Tweedledum on this particular policy area.”

The Greens have long argued that the BC Liberals and NDP have many policies in common.

“We were clear about this in the 2017 election campaign, that the other two parties were offering a pretty similar vision, and I think the Greens, what really sets us apart, is we have a very different vision for the future of B.C. than either of the other two parties,” Furstenau said.

“Both of them have a very, as far as we’re concerned, backward-looking approach to the economy and to the future of B.C.”

Stark contrast

Evan Pivnick, the chief of staff for the BC Green caucus, said the debate of the past few weeks was about climate change, the biggest challenge facing the world, and choosing how to build the provincial economy.

“I think it’s safe to say the LNG debate is absolutely the starkest difference that has come before the legislative assembly,” Pivnick said. “Our folks used every single tool they had at their disposal.”

While the LNG debate has been a defining moment for the Greens, it comes within a couple months of a Nanimo byelection where the party’s candidate finished a distant third.

Final results showed the NDP’s Sheila Malcolmson received almost 50 per cent of the vote and wasn’t far off the total number of votes Leonard Krog got in the 2017 general election. Krog stepped down as MLA to run successfully for Nanaimo mayor. Tony Harris, the BC Liberal candidate, increased his party’s vote count by almost 800 votes over 2017.

But the Green vote dropped to 1,783 for Michelle Ney, down from the 5,454 the previous Green candidate got in the general election.

In a mid-February interview, Weaver said the Green vote had collapsed in the byelection.

“Michelle’s vote was Michelle’s friends and family. We lost our Green vote. The Green vote did not exist. The Green vote went to the NDP.”

He attributed that collapse to voters’ fear that if the BC Liberals captured the seat, the NDP government would fall and the Liberals would return to power.

Weaver said the party knew from its own polling that the main question on voters’ minds in Nanaimo was whether they wanted to send the province into another general election.

Green donors and members were voting NDP because they liked the direction of the NDP government, with Green support, over the past two years, he said.

“The number of times I got hugged on the doorstep by people saying, ‘We like what we’re seeing, but we’re voting for Sheila.’ Very frustrating for me,” he said.

Weaver’s interpretation of the byelection is backed up by pollster Barb Justason with Justason Market Intelligence. “Much of the collapse in Nanaimo’s Green support can be explained by 2017 Green supporters’ strategic voting, largely to the benefit of the BC NDP,” she wrote at the time.

“But BC Liberals can thank right-leaning 2017 BC Green supporters for some of their support bump. As our poll illustrates, party support is mobile — increasingly so when strategic voting factors in a race empowered to take down the government.”

For every 10 people who voted Green in 2017, she said, four stayed with the party in the byelection, four voted NDP and two voted Liberal.

‘Work to do’: Weaver

One of the things Weaver took from the byelection was that many people don’t understand how the political system works or the role that an opposition party like the Greens play in a minority government. “Clearly we have some work to do to articulate what our role is,” he said.

“On top of that a lot of people didn’t know our contributions,” he said. The Greens had been influential in shaping of the CleanBC plan to reduce carbon emissions while growing the economy, as well as in reviews of the environmental assessment process and the professional reliance model for assessing resource projects, but failed to get credit, he said.

“We have not been good at telling our story, and I can tell you we’re going to be a lot better at that going forward.”

The Nanaimo result should have been sobering for Greens, said Matt Toner. A former NDP candidate, the Vancouver tech entrepreneur joined the Green Party in 2015 and served as deputy leader until the end of 2017. He was part of the backroom negotiating team when the Greens reached an agreement with the NDP that allowed the latter to form government.

The Nanaimo byelection was likely a preview of the dynamic that will shape the next general election, Toner said. “People were backed into a strategic voting corner, and we got clobbered,” he said.

“If I’m the Green Party, I’m looking at the byelection and I’m freaking out. It says something in a riding that seemed friendly to us exactly how people do the math internally when it comes to these decisions. It’s not in our favour.”

Success in the electoral reform referendum would have changed everything for the Greens, and it was a mistake not to be more closely involved in the process all the way through, Toner said.

“Now we’re forced back into playing the old game, and not one we’ve not been historically especially good at,” he said. It will make it harder to attract candidates and find support than it would have been. “It’s a pretty strong headwind in my opinion.”

Old dynamic remains

Pivnick said if there was a message in the Nanaimo byelection it was one that party has heard before.

“I don’t view it as anything particularly new,” he said. “The dynamic in the next election is going to be the NDP saying, ‘Vote for us, we’ll continue this agenda and we’re the only ones that can actually earn a place to do this, and we can do more of this with a majority.’”

“And the Liberals say, ‘If you don’t like that direction, we’re the only ones who can earn a majority and go the other direction.’ That’s nothing new. That’s what both parties have relied on for a long time.”

The NDP has always been strong in Nanaimo, and it was unsurprising that voters there agreed to keep the party in government, he said. “It was always going to be a fairly persuasive argument.”

The dynamic can benefit the Greens, Pivnick said. “Our view is that’s also kind of what people are sick of in this province. This dichotomy between two large parties that define so much of their identities based on being against what the other person is for and vice versa.”

For example, he said, the Liberals are now criticizing the NDP on the carbon tax, a tax that the Liberals introduced a decade ago and that the NDP then opposed.

It’s the Greens’ job to bring grey into what’s often been a black-and-white debate in the province, he said. “I think there is a real space there, and I think that’s what is different in a general election.”

“We’ve taken stock of this moment, and we’re very hyper-aware of the fact there’s two years left in this minority government,” he said.

‘Love ‘em to death’

Toner recalled a Georgia Straight article from 2017 that suggested the NDP might deal with the Greens the same way Vision Vancouver dealt with COPE on city council. The article quoted a senior official in the then-mayor’s office saying, “We’re going to love ’em to death.”

He worried that’s exactly what’s happening to the Greens provincially. “You can be a constructive partner,” he said. “You can also be a partner that should make the NDP kind of sweat through these decisions. I honestly think right now they kind of figure they’ve got things where they need to be and the Greens won’t risk overturning the apple cart.”

It’s great to be vocal on topics like LNG, and it was a good step to leave the legislative chamber on the final LNG vote last week, but the party’s MLAs should have been more adversarial from day one and need to do more to press Horgan and the NDP, he said. “The challenge for the Green Party is they haven’t really effectively exercised their veto in Victoria.”

The Greens need to ratchet up pressure on the NDP so that if they do bring the government down, the public will understand why, Toner said.

He referred to a recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report that found there are as few as 12 years to act to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. “If you really think we have 12 years to turn this around, then every minute counts,” he said.

“Maybe now is the time for the Green Party to say, ‘If this government goes down on this issue, that’s OK. We’ll risk a new election because we think the situation is serious enough to warrant it.’ People value authenticity in politics. They value courage.”

Adam Olsen, who represents Saanich North and the Islands for the Greens, said the party needs to keep highlighting areas the other parties would rather not touch, such as launching a public inquiry into money laundering.

“Our job over the next number of months is to continue to tell our story about our role in this parliamentary session,” he said. “We need to continue to define ourselves as being in large respect an alternative to the establishment.”

At the same time, the Greens need to take their role seriously and demonstrate that minority governments can be stable, Olsen said.

“People don’t need to inherently fear minority governments,” he said, adding he hears calls from advocacy groups wanting the Greens to bring down the government. “There is a balance we need to strike to be responsible in this place.”

It’s possible to achieve things without bringing the government down, Olsen said, pointing to success he had raising concerns about the survival of wild salmon that led to the appointment of an advisory committee on the issue.

“We have taken great steps forward,” he said. “There is no question the Greens have been influential... We have to continue to talk about the things that concern British Columbians and need to be relevant. We have a responsibility for our own fate.”

Different voices needed

In a general election, strategic voting will be a factor, but not to the same degree that it was in Nanaimo, said Sonia Theroux, a former political strategist who worked on election campaigns for Green candidates, including Furstenau and Jo-Ann Roberts.

“It was such a high stakes byelection,” she said. “There’s more complexity in a general election, and it’s not so pointy.” That leaves more room for people to make a “hopeful” vote, she said.

She said the Greens did well during the LNG debate. “It was the right move for them from a values perspective,” she said. “Why have Greens at all if they’re going to cave to things like an LNG tax break?”

On any given issue the Green MLAs have to decide where they stand, and also whether to support the government, she said. They need to be vocal in their opposition to LNG and to building the Site C dam, but on a pragmatic level they need to be looking ahead to what happens if the government falls.

In the wake of the Site C decision, for example, Weaver argued that bringing the government down over the issue would have led to an election that almost certainly would have been won by one of the two parties that support building the dam.

Theroux said that when the Greens appear to prop up the government, people don’t see the many hard conversations that are happening behind closed doors.

Fursteneau said there are a number of issues where Greens have brought a voice that would otherwise have been lacking in the legislature. She cited her work to address the overrepresentation of Indigenous children in government foster care, reforms to rules around lobbying and calls for a public inquiry into money laundering, plus all the constituency work MLAs do.

“We’ve been the only three on a number of files that have moved forward in the last two years, and without us there I would say that a lot of those files wouldn’t be moving forward, much less be on the radar,” she said.

“We are demonstrating the value of having a third party, of having different voices and the value of having MLAs that are going to work quite relentlessly on a number of files,” she said. “It’s not like there’s one thing and that’s the only thing that matters. There are dozens of things that we are collectively working on and making a difference on, and we’ll continue to do that.”

Furstenau said it’s positive for British Columbians to see that politicians don’t always have to be in a state of conflict.

308,Business,2019-04-11T03:43:00.0000000Z,This has helped lead to sharp reductions in Canadian oil and gas capital spending ... streamlining and reducing regulations. Kenneth Green is a resident fellow at the Fraser Institute.,"A new report by Ernst & Young, commissioned for the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association, should serve as a wake-up call for Alberta.

According to the report, the last several years have seen an increase in the “volume, complexity, and duplication” of regulations imposed on Canada’s energy industry.

This has helped lead to sharp reductions in Canadian oil and gas capital spending.

The report notes that U.S. capital spending in oil and gas increased 38% in 2017, reaching a new high of US$120 billion while Canadian spending fell to US$45 billion, a 19% decrease since 2016.

The report also documents the growth of regulation in a section on “Regulatory Layering” in Canada, and gives numerous examples of overlapping greenhouse gas regulations at the federal and provincial level.

Such layering occurs when redundant laws and regulations from multiple levels of government pile up over time including, according to the report, the “structure of the programs and compliance mechanisms, reporting thresholds, reporting mechanisms and verification requirements varies between provinces.”

Furthermore, different quantification methodology requirements and boundaries for reporting require companies to undertake “multiple approaches for calculating their Greenhouse Gas Emissions.”

The report also compares pipeline project approvals in Canada and the United States.

The data show that average approval timelines in Canada grew from 357 days in 2009 to 681 days but in the U.S. dropped from 561 days in 2015 to 336 days in 2017.

Finally, the report profiles changes to TransCanada Pipelines, which has cancelled several major Canadian projects in recent years.

It finds that “in 2016, TransCanada Pipelines capital investment in natural gas pipelines was evenly split between Canada and the U.S., but in 2017 nearly 60% of capital spend was based in the U.S.

Perhaps more alarming are the statistics on construction spend for new natural gas projects.

In 2016, 46% of spend was in Canada and 54% in the U.S. In 2017, only 20% of spend was in Canada an 80% was in the U.S.”

As we have previously observed, there’s an urgent need for regulatory reform, especially in Alberta, where red tape is steadily strangling a major contributor to Canada’s economy.

Certainly falling oil prices have contributed to Alberta’s troubles, but many other factors affect investment in Alberta and many of them are regulatory.

For example, respondents to the Fraser institute’s Global Petroleum Survey said the key deterrents to investment in Alberta are all regulatory — respondents point to uncertainty about environmental regulations and their enforcement, and the cost of regulatory compliance.

This was particularly true in the oil and gas sector, where 70% of respondents registered compliance costs as a deterrent to investment in 2017 compared to only 32% in 2013.

Clearly, more must be done to resolve regulatory duplication, lighten the overall regulatory burden in the oil and gas industry and position Canada to be competitive with its neighbour to the south that’s aggressively streamlining and reducing regulations.

Now both the numbers and the momentum are on Conners’ side, even though Canadian history isn’t. “He’s confident and ...","After the first hole Thursday at the Masters, Corey Conners had the lead, and the jokes came quickly. The Canadian was in the first group, and since he had made par, while the other two members of the opening trio made bogey, of course he was leading.

But no one was laughing after the native of Listowel, Ont., curled in an eight-foot eagle on the par-5 15th, giving him the solo lead late in his opening round.

Conners, who held the early clubhouse lead after a 2-under-par 70 (10 shots better than his Thursday round in 2015, when he played the Masters as an amateur), was the last guy in the field this week but the tournament’s first leader.

Twenty-three Canadians have played the Masters in the event’s history, and despite a Mike Weir victory 16 years ago, it’s rare to see the red-and-white near the top of the leaderboard.

And even though Conners wasn’t in the Valero Texas Open 11 days ago, let alone the Masters, he very much looked like he belonged.

“We didn’t really talk about ‘the Masters’ or anything like that,” Conners’ caddie Kyle Peters told Sportsnet by phone from Augusta of the first round. “We treated it like a normal day, a normal tournament.”

Peters said the one thing that was different Thursday was Conners having a front-row look at Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player’s ceremonial tee shots. Peters stood on a cooler on the practice green.

But while Peters’ is trying to keep things as similar as last week, at least in terms of his appetite (he ate a hot dog Wednesday in Texas and continued to eat one each day through Sunday, since Conners was playing so well. And so far this week, he’s kept up the hot dog order the last few days. Yes, even at Augusta National), there is, of course, a lot that’s different.

“The challenge is that this is not normal,” Canadian PGA Tour winner Richard Zokol told Sportsnet of Conners’ opening-round result.

Zokol, who played the Masters in 1993 but missed the cut, said Conners’ run up the leaderboard early was “abnormal, but wonderful to watch.”

He describes it as such because, although this is the 50th anniversary of George Knudson’s runner-up Masters result in 1969, the average best finish of the other Canadians who have played the Masters is 30th.

And 14 of the 23 golfers to tee it up at Augusta National at least once? Their best finish is a missed cut.

But the Masters, for Canadians, is a sure sign that spring is around the corner. There is always extra hype. Mix in a Canadian on the leaderboard – and one who is fresh off his first PGA Tour win – and the hype machine is in overdrive.

Now, said Zokol, it’s up to Conners to reign it in.

“When you qualify for the Masters with a victory you have maybe a year, or at least some time, to think about obtaining these childhood dreams of one day playing the Masters (as a professional) but he didn’t have time for that,” said Zokol. “If he’s able to compound this state of mind and state of presence and performance, he’s going to be building wonderful traction.

“And if he keeps doing this, there’s no reason he couldn’t handle this right through the weekend.”

It’s early, yes, and Thursday morning at the Masters is equal parts an indication of Sunday night (each of the last eight Masters winners were in the top-10 after round one) and a mere blip on the tournament’s radar (only five golfers in the tournament’s history have lead wire-to-wire), but on a day while some of the best players in the world struggled, Conners was as solid as ever.

Justin Rose was 4-over through his first nine holes. Ditto Jordan Spieth. Rory McIlroy shot a 1-over-par 73. Same with the defending champion Patrick Reed.

But there’s Conners, under par and on the first page of the leaderboard, having relied on his world-class iron game to set him up to score.

Augusta National is known mostly as a second-shot golf course, and this year on the PGA Tour Conners is third in greens in regulation and was the early leader in the strokes gained: approach-the-green stat (a measurement of the performance of approach shots) at the Masters. Field leaders of strokes gained: approach-the-green at the Masters the previous four years have finished 1st, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd.

Now both the numbers and the momentum are on Conners’ side, even though Canadian history isn’t.

“He’s confident and knows the golf course well,” said Peters, “so I’m sure he feels pretty good.”

“He’s on a wave and he should just let it ride,” added Zokol. “Because it’s working.”

So a Canadian is near the top of the leaderboard at the Masters, which is an oddity, at least as recent history indicates.

The analyst likes ...","Analyst Corey Hammill of Paradigm Capital says US cannabis company Green Growth Brands (Green Growth Brands Stock Quote, Chart CSE:GGB) has assembled a virtual dream team of retail expertise, with the analyst giving GGB a “Buy” rating in his coverage initiation on Thursday.

Columbus, Ohio-based Green Growth commenced listing on the Canadian Securities Exchange this past November and is backed by the Schottensteins of American footwear chain DSW fame, one of the wealthiest families in the US, Hammill notes.

The analyst likes the company’s makeup, which he says is comprised of a management team highly experienced in retail and brands and an R&D team that has a combined 70-plus years of experience in consumer goods.

Green Growth is focused on both CBD/wellness products and THC-based products, with Hammill asserting that there’s a tonne of runway ahead for the company.

“Green Growth Brands boasts the most experienced retail team in the North American cannabis space and has relationships to access a large distribution network at little to no cost. We believe this provides GGB with a fundamental competitive advantage, which, paired with the lucrative market opportunity, has the potential to generate half-a-billion in annual revenue for the company within the next five years,” Hammill said in his coverage launch.

Rather than providing an absolute target price, Hammill is giving a target range. He sees the cannabis space evolving into an industry similar to that of specialty retail, whose companies trade at 3-4x forward revenue, with the wellness space —where Hammill places GGB— trading at 2.5-3.0x revenue.

“Given the early stage but aggressive plan for GGB’s retail build-out, we believe it is appropriate to assign a higher near-term revenue multiple, moderating it over time. Our analysis values GGB using a 5x near-term revenue multiple, declining to a long-term 3x multiple in 2022,” he says.

That modelling puts GGB in a near-term share price of approximately C$5.00 per share, which the analyst puts as increasing to C$9.00-plus over four years. The C$5.00 rough target would translate into a one-year return of 17.9 per cent at the time of publication

Hammill thinks GGB will generate fiscal 2019 revenue and EBITDA of $27.9 million and negative $8.9 million, respectively, and fiscal 2020 revenue and EBITDA of $149.6 million and $51.5 million, respectively.

It also marked the first-ever Green Shirt Day in Canada, which honours the crash’s victims — including Broncos player Logan Boulet, a 21-year-old defenceman from Lethbridge, Alta. — highlights the need for organ donors across the country.

After being inspired by a coach, Boulet made the choice to sign his organ donor card and told his parents, Bernadine and Toby Boulet, about it.

Boulet’s heart, liver, lungs, kidneys and corneas were donated, saving or improving the lives of six people across Canada.

The impact his death had on the organ donation surge in the country was dubbed the Logan Boulet Effect — with more than 100,000 people registering, it’s the largest amount of people registering to become organ donors in Canadian history due to one event and one person, according to the Canadian Transplant Association.

The plan is to hold Green Shirt Day every April 7 — green because it’s the official colour of organ and tissue donation, and April 7 because it was the day Boulet died.

Lethbridge

In their hometown of Lethbridge, Boulet’s parents celebrated their son’s legacy with a skate at ATB Centre on Sunday. The pair said they are honoured that because of one “small decision,” Green Shirt Day has cemented Logan and the team’s legacy.

“The registration shot through the roof because of Logan Boulet but it also, at the same time, is because of the Humboldt Broncos,” Toby said. “Without the massive tragedy, it wouldn’t have been near the story [it was].”

Despite the family’s devastating loss, Bernadine said support from the city has been heartwarming.

“We just want people to wear green,” she said. “We want people to be inspired, to register and to have a conversation with their family about being an organ donor.”

“We wear green because it’s hope, it’s renewal, it’s for the Broncos, it’s for organ donation.”

In addition to upcoming speaking engagements, the Boulets have organized a sold-out golf tournament for Logan on June 22.

With the amount of attention organ registration has received, Bernadine said Logan is probably watching, saying, “That’s enough.”

“He’s not a limelight kind of guy… He’s the guy that supports people and from the background, makes sure people are included,” Bernadine said.

McKailyn Ives, Logan’s girlfriend, said not only is her best friend living on in six people, but he’s also inspired countless others.

“It was difficult to see all my friends moving on with their lives and doing things I thought Logan and I were going to do together,” she said. “But it’s also been nice to see how his decision has impacted so many people and [was] such a positive change, not only locally but nationally and worldwide.”

Calgary

Just north of Calgary, the Canadian Liver Foundation was at the CrossIron Mills shopping centre with volunteers who have all received liver transplants. They spent Sunday spreading Boulet’s message.

Twenty years ago, volunteer Celina Thibault was diagnosed with primary biliary cholangitis, an auto-immune disease. In July 2012, her wait for a liver was finally over. When the organ was ready, she shared it with a toddler who was ill and required a transplant too.

“I have a second chance thanks to somebody who donated their organs,” Thibault said Sunday. “There is life after transplant.”

While she’s seen progress in people signing up to be donors, nothing compares to what’s happened in the past year.

“The work that we’ve been trying to do for years, Logan did it for us in one day,” Thibault said.

“He’s such a beautiful young man and his parents are heroes as well because they’re passing that message to everybody.”

It’s easy to sign up and you can select which organs are donated, Thibault explained.

“You can check what you want to keep, what you don’t want to keep,” she said. “You can’t take it with you.”

Christina Osmond-Provencher’s 19-year-old son died after a Coliseum LRT Station stabbing two years ago, she said on Sunday. Brandon Provencher was declared brain dead on April 14, 2017.

“He had one stab wound to the heart and lung,” she said. “They were able to repair both, but because of the amount of time with a lack of oxygen to the brain, he was pronounced brain dead on Good Friday of 2017. And then, we donated his organs Easter Sunday.”

Four people were saved because of Provencher’s donation.

“It’s torn a lot of people apart because of the way that we lost him, but because we were able to donate his organs, it gives us a little bit of peace, that there’s part of him out there,” Osmond-Provencher said.

The recipient of Provencher’s lungs wrote to Osmond-Provencher, saying he’s able to do things with his grandchildren because of her son’s gift.

Since yellow pea exports dropped significantly in the middle of the year, “there’s going to be a lot of carryover in yellow peas for 2019,” Darwin Hamilton, president of Kalshae Investments in Winnipeg, predicted. “That will cause prices to drop.”

“Twelve months ago, we saw peas in the $10 per bushel range. Now they’re around $7, and some are contracting in the $6.50 range.”

Even with attractive prices for buyers, yellow peas aren’t moving very quickly. New-crop acreage for yellow peas in 2019 will likely decrease accordingly.

“They don’t want new-crop peas planted if last year’s crops are still in the bin,” Hamilton said.

A portion of acreage originally slated for yellow peas will likely transfer to their green counterpart, which are stronger price-wise.

“Green pea prices for new crops are around $12.50 per bushel to the grower, for farm gate pricing.”

If significant yellow pea acreage is switched to green, prices may correct back down to under $10 per bushel.

Green peas are in high demand in South American and European markets, though in the past, quality has been an issue. Unpredictable rainfall and drought impacted green pea quality in 2018.

“Green peas are a little more finicky to grow to get a high grade,” Hamilton said. “If you get rain during harvest, you’ll get bleaching.”

Canadian farmers seeded over 3.6 million acres to yellow and green peas in 2018.

Green party Leader Andrew Weaver says Alberta Premier Rachel Notley may be right with her claim that the controversial twinning of the Trans Mountain pipeline will get the go-ahead in May.

“(Justin) Trudeau has essentially been saying the pipeline will be approved all along,” Weaver told Postmedia News on Wednesday. “Cabinet has 90 days to make a decision after the NEB made their (February) recommendation and that brings it to May 22. (Rachel) Notley put two-and-two together. I suspect she is adding up what’s publicly available.”

On Monday, while campaigning for the April 16 provincial election, the Alberta premier said she expected the $9.3-billion twinning of the Trans Mountain pipeline to be approved by the federal government by the end of May.

“We are this close, this close to getting that pipeline back under construction,” Notley told students at a pipeline training school in Edmonton. “In fact, we expect an approval from the federal government by the end of the month.”

They also delve into the politics around B.C.’s money-laundering scandal, parties flip-flopping over gas taxes and criticism of the carbon tax, and the Speaker’s attempt to clean up heckling at the legislature.

The Trans Mountain pipeline from Edmonton to the Westridge Marine Terminal in Burnaby has been owned by the federal government since it bought-out Kinder Morgan last summer. Kinder Morgan had been trying for several years to get permission to increase the pipeline capacity from 300,000 barrels a day to 890,000 barrels a day. The pipe carries a variety of petroleum products, including crude oil from Alberta’s oilsands.

The Alberta government claims it needs the extra pipeline capacity so it can export more crude oil to Asia and beyond. The B.C. government and the cities of Vancouver and Burnaby are opposed, due mostly to the risk of environmental disaster and the impact on marine life and some First Nations bands, but also because of the economics of the project. Bitumen is expensive to extract from the oilsands and demand from Asia has so far been sporadic.

This year there has been four oil tankers that have picked up crude oil at Westridge, and one has gone to China. Twelve of 42 tankers that visited the terminal last year went to China, but at the time the price of a barrel of Western Canadian Select crude oil was falling to a record $14 a barrel from the low $50s, where it also sits currently. China imported no crude from B.C. in 2016 and 2017.

There have been a string of protests over construction at the Burnaby terminal, leading to jail for some protesters. B.C.’s First Nations community is split over whether they support the pipeline.

Weaver, who predicted Notley would win the election, said the B.C. government still had an active court case in which it was trying to determine whether it had the constitutional right to control the amount of crude oil shipped through the province.

In a prepared statement, a B.C. Ministry of Environment spokesperson said “The province maintains the project is unnecessary and continues to recommend the federal government abandon the project.”

“We continue to argue that an oil spill could seriously impact B.C.’s environment, economy and coast,” he said. “We remain convinced this project is not in the best interests of British Columbians and it puts the environment and southern-resident killer whales at-risk. We remain focused on defending the interests of British Columbians and protecting our environment, our economy and our coast.”

Weaver predicted trouble ahead for the Liberal government over the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.

“This thing is not going to go away,” he said.

AUGUSTA, Ga. – The biggest problem Corey Conners might have this week is pulling a muscle by smiling too much.

Still riding the improbable adrenaline high from his last-in as a Monday qualifier in Texas to first-off in the Masters, Conners found himself lost for words early Thursday morning before he ever found himself on the Masters leaderboard.

After watching Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player hit the honorary tee shots immediately before his grouping took the first tee, Conners suddenly found his hand in the mitt of the greatest champion of all time.

“He just congratulated me on the win, that felt pretty special,” said the hopelessly grinning Conners of his Nicklaus encounter. “Never thought in a million years that Jack Nicklaus would know who I am and it just felt pretty cool. I was able to stand on the back of the tee and watch he and Mr. Player tee off and really appreciate what they have done for the game of golf and it was a really cool experience to be part of. I just tried to soak it in and really enjoy it.”

Conners is still coming to terms with being here at all.

Ten days ago, he was the 196th-ranked player in the world facing a playoff in a Monday qualifier just to get into the Valero Texas Open. By Sunday, he was making 10 birdies to win his first PGA Tour event by one shot and book the 87th and final spot into the Masters. The odds – even for someone with a T3 and runner-up already on tour this season – were off the charts.

“I’m a math and stats guy and it was very unlikely that I was going to be here, I’ll say that, especially having to Monday qualify last week,” he said. “So, yeah, could have said almost certain that I wouldn’t be here, but it’s worked out really well and I’m really happy.”

Whatever magic the Listowel, Ont. native has going did not rub off on the six-time green jacket winner’s palm. He was coasting along with a birdie and two bogeys through 12 holes before catching fire. A two-putt birdie on 13 got him back to level par and he started throwing darts.

He stuck an 8-iron from 152 yards to three feet on 14 for birdie and then drew a majestic 6-iron from 202 yards to five feet on the par-5 15th and knocked in the downhill slider for eagle that vaulted him into sole possession of the lead at 3-under.

“That was the shot of the day for me, I would say,” Conners said of his eagle approach, which earned him his first piece of Masters crystal.

Not even a 3-putt from 46 feet on the bottom tier at 18 could wipe the smile from Conners’ face, as he walked off with the early clubhouse leader at 2-under 70. It was a significant improvement over the 80 he shot in his first round as an amateur in the 2015 Masters.

“Quite a lot better,” he said. “I had a great day out there, it was beautiful, it was fun to be first off this morning, felt pretty special to be out there on the tee and I am really happy with how I played.”

Mike Weir, the 2003 Masters champion, wasn’t surprised, having seen Conners shoot 80-69 in the two rounds they played together in 2015.

“Even back then I was very impressed with his game,” Weir said of Conners. “He drove the ball well and got on the wrong side of the hole a couple times and that’s what can happen around here. You can shoot 80 and actually not play that poorly. It can get away from you quickly here. I’ve always been impressed with his game and he’s continued to get better and work on his weaknesses and enhance his strengths. He’s really doing some great things.”

Conners’ wife, Mallory, gained notoriety with her expressive reactions during his dramatic final round in San Antonio, and her heart was still racing Thursday.

“It’s been a crazy whirlwind,” she said, “and we haven’t had time to process it. It doesn’t seem real.”

Conners received a warm welcome on the first tee Thursday.

“I think there’s way more Canadians or people pretending to be Canadians out there than I would have guessed,” he said.

Now he hopes to have a moment to settle down and sleep in before his 11:15 a.m. tee time for the second round as he sits firmly in contention on a tightly packed Masters leaderboard.

“It’s been wild, definitely unexpected but I’m playing some good golf and really excited to be here and honoured to be playing in the Masters and just trying to keep riding the good play,” he said. “Everything’s still high, I’m just having a lot of positive emotions. Didn’t really sleep much the beginning of the week, I felt energized with positive things that have happened. This is a great place to be and I’m just really enjoying it.”",Canadian Corey Conners continues to ride wave of success at Masters,Toronto Sun,https://torontosun.com/sports/golf/canadian-corey-conners-continues-to-ride-wave-of-success-at-masters

Environment Canada recently gave notice it has approved U.S.-based AquaBounty to grow the salmon at its site about 74 kilometres east of Charlottetown.

( HO-AquaBounty Technologies MANDATORY CREDIT / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

AquaBounty said in a release it would begin stocking its Rollo Bay facility “as soon as possible,” with the first harvest of AquAdvantage salmon estimated late next year. Sylvain Charlebois, director of the agrifood analytics unit at Dalhousie University, said it’s likely AquaBounty “production will be ramped up in Canada.” “It’s a huge advantage for AquaBounty to be allowed to produce this salmon in Canada,” he said in an interview.

AquaBounty, based in Maynard, Mass., has said its salmon will contain genetic material from chinook salmon that help it reach adult size faster, creating a less expensive product. Health Canada said it doesn’t see any need for a mandatory label to allow consumers to spot the genetically modified fish, but existing producers said they may call for that to change. “We are reviewing it,” said Tim Kennedy, executive director of the Canadian Aquaculture Industry Alliance. “Will there be a disruption in the ... entire salmon market? We hope not. But I will say if that’s a possibility, then the response will be: somebody has to label.” The Environment Canada certification has been most strongly opposed to date by environmental groups, who continue to argue there’s a risk to wild Atlantic salmon if there’s an escape.

However, the certifications in Canada and the U.S. could draw the traditional aquaculture industry and its lobbyists more closely into the debate, depending on how consumers react to the news of AquaBounty’s products entering the market sometime next year. The Canadian aquaculture alliance says its members don’t farm or sell GM farmed salmon and aren’t researching the practice.

Kennedy said a push for labelling could come next. “We are reviewing it. We recognize the United States is moving forward with mandatory labelling, as is the European Union,” he said. “Does it make sense from a trade perspective to align more closely with our major trading partners?” He said the industry could consider setting up a non-GM label, similar to the labelling of organic foods. The federal Health Department has repeatedly said it doesn’t favour mandatory labelling for the genetically modified fish. In a February letter to the Canadian Biotechnology Action Network - an active opponent of GM salmon - the department said it prefers “industry-led initiatives such as voluntary standards,” and “the government of Canada intends to maintain its current approach.” Kennedy said this leaves the question of who should pay for a massive labelling redo. “Who bears the burden of that transparency? I don’t think it should be our producers because we’re not the ones putting the new product into the market,” he said. Meanwhile, it remains unclear how significant the level of production in P.E.I. will be in the Canadian market. The company declined a request for an interview with its CEO about its plans going forward for production in Prince Edward Island, providing references to news releases. Over the past two years - as it awaited its Environment Canada licence - the company had shipped eggs to Panama for growing, before the salmon were imported back to Canada and other destinations. Charlebois says the federal decision means the firm can ship more directly to markets, particularly processors that might use the GM salmon in products ranging from sushi to pies to pates. Still, the arrival of a form of labelling in the U.S. could lead to increased pressure to create some form of labelling in Canada, he adds. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration has given the green light to the AquaBounty production in Indiana, subject to a new regulation that will require it to disclose when a food is genetically modified. That has come amidst a pending lawsuit by a coalition of consumer, environmental and fishing groups that still hopes to block the sale through the courts. Opponents have also criticized the upcoming U.S. labelling system, which they say uses the term “bioengineered,” a less familiar phrase than “genetically modified.” Also, under the rules coming in 2020, companies will be able to provide disclosure of the GM salmon through codes that people would have to scan on their smart phones. Lucy Sharratt, co-ordinator of the Canadian Biotechnology Action Network, says her group wants Canada to introduce a more transparent labelling system that consumers can easily see on any package. “The lack of genetically modified food labelling is just the most obvious transparency issue undermining public trust,” she told parliamentarians in a hearing last week. “Canadians are also asking for more transparent regulation of genetically modified organisms and opportunities for public engagement.” - Follow (at)mtuttoncporg on Twitter.",First genetically modified salmon to hit Canadian stores as Ottawa gives its OK,Toronto Star,https://www.thestar.com/business/2019/04/11/first-genetically-modified-salmon-to-hit-canadian-stores-as-ottawa-gives-its-ok.html

He says if you believe you are experiencing ...","A dense, green cloud of pollen was photographed hanging above the city of Durham, N.C., Monday morning, making sufferers of seasonal allergies cringe.

The pictures were taken by photographer Jeremy Gilchrist, who used a drone to snap aerial shots of the pollen blanketing the city.

READ MORE: Spring sniffles: Are you suffering from allergies or the common cold?

Gilchrist posted the photos on Facebook, calling it ‘Pollmageddon.’

“No tricks here,” he wrote. “Yes you are looking at a green haze made up of tree pollen from the pines of central NC!”

Gilchrist captured the photos during a spike in pollen concentrations in the area.

According to a pollen report from North Carolina’s Division of Air Quality, the pollen severity was set to “very high” in the nearby city of Raleigh for Sunday and Monday.

When is allergy season in Canada?

In Canada, the photos are a stark reminder that allergy season has arrived for some.

However, according to Global News Chief Meteorologist Anthony Farnell, when allergy season begins is dependent on geography.

“Because Canada is so big and we have so many different climates, allergy season can start as early as February in B.C., and as late as June across the north,” Farnell explained.

READ MORE: Allergy season is getting longer in parts of Canada. Blame climate change, experts say

Farnell says allergy season occurs in three stages.

“The first state of allergy season in tree pollen and this is about to begin across southern Ontario,” Farnell explained.

WATCH: What does pollen look like? Man with a backhoe will show you

Farnell says it will then spread north, but could be delayed by two or three weeks due to the cool spring and frequent snow events.

“Unfortunately this delays the season and doesn’t necessarily shorten it,” Farnell said.

READ MORE: Allergy season could be worse than ever in B.C. following lengthy delay: health experts

According to Farnell, grass allergy season occurs next.

“Grass allergies have already started in places like Vancouver, but the frequent rain keeps levels lower than in the prairies and eastern Canada,” he said. “As the grass turns green in late April and May, the grass allergy season begins.”

Next up is ragweed, but Farnell says this only becomes a problem later in August as the plants reach the flowering stage.

WATCH: Ask the Doctor: Dealing with seasonal allergies in Edmonton

According to Farnell, from Ontario through Atlantic Canada, this spring is shaping up to be very wet, which will limit pollen — at least for the next month.

“If you suffer from allergies, you should actually root for frequent showers,” Farnell explained. “This is Mother Nature’s way of cleaning the atmosphere.”

Mitigating seasonal allergy symptoms

Once allergy season is in full swing, there are a few ways people who experience symptoms can mitigate their suffering.

Dr. Harold Kim is the president of the Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. He says if you believe you are experiencing the symptoms of seasonal allergies, the first step is to see an allergist to identify the allergen causing the symptoms.

WATCH: Seeking relief during allergy season

And while the symptoms of seasonal allergies are sometimes confused with viral infections such as a cold or flu, Kim says there are several hints that help to differentiate.

“A cold will usually only last for five to seven days,” Kim said. “And most people with a viral infection will feel unwell on top of nasal and eye symptoms.”

According to Kim, people who suffer from seasonal allergies are often allergic to other things as well, such as pets.

The symptoms of seasonal allergies are often treatable, Kim said. “The first thing we recommend is non-sedative antihistamines.”

If those are not effective, Kim says prescription nasal steroids or eye drops may be prescribed.

In some cases, Kim says, if a patient is experiencing severe symptoms or other medications aren’t working, allergen immunotherapy may be offered.

WATCH: Spring sniffles: Allergies or the common cold?

According to Kim, allergen immunotherapy options, including an under-the-tongue tablet, are now available in Canada for dust mites, grass and ragweed.

As allergy season begins, Kim says another thing people can do is keep their windows closed.

“We don’t want people to decrease activity,” Kim said. “But it helps to keep allergens outside.”","Photos of U.S. pollen cloud a reminder that allergy season is on in Canada, too",Global News,https://globalnews.ca/news/5152140/pollen-cloud-photo-allergies/

John Chidley-Hill, The Canadian Press





Corey Conners was battling through qualifiers last Monday, winning a 6-for-1 playoff just to make the Valero Texas Open.

Less than a week later, the Canadian was on a charter jet with his wife Malory, flying to the Masters at the historic Augusta National Golf Club after winning his first career PGA Tour title on Sunday.

""It's been a bit of a whirlwind,"" said Conners, who added the organizers of the Valero Texas Open provided him with the flight and accommodation in Augusta, Ga. ""Not what I expected to be doing after this week ended but I'm really excited.""

The first Monday qualifier to win on the PGA Tour in nine years, the product of Listowel, Ont., birdied three of the final five holes for his second straight 6-under 66 and a two-stroke victory over Charley Hoffman on Sunday. Conners finished at 20-under 268 at TPC San Antonio.

Conners only had a partial PGA Tour card to start the season and had to earn his way into most tournaments in 2019, creating a gruelling schedule of getting to events early, playing his way on to them, and then playing the regular rounds over the weekend.

Winning the Valero Texas Open changes all that.

In addition to automatically qualifying for the Masters, the first major of the men's golf season, it also earned him a two-year exemption on the PGA Tour, a spot in the PGA Championship (the second major) and a US$1.3-million payday. He also rocketed up the FedEx Cup standings, landing at 13th.

""I haven't thought that far ahead, but I know that a win changes things big time,"" said Conners, who is now in a position to strategically pick what tournaments he will play in. ""Making my schedule -- something that I hadn't been able to do last year or this year -- I'm excited to be able to pick and choose the events I'll play in.""

Although this week's Masters is Conners's first as a professional, he did play in it in 2015 while still an amateur at Kent State University. He earned the right to play in the major after finishing as runner-up to Gunn Yang at the 2014 U.S. Amateur.

He joins Hall of Famer Moe Norman of Kitchener, Ont., as the only two Canadians to play the Masters as amateurs and professionals.

A popular figure in Canada's elite golfing community, Conners had an outpouring of support during and after Sunday's final round. His wife, as well as fellow PGA golfers Mackenzie Hughes of Dundas, Ont., and Nick Taylor of Abbotsford, B.C., waited for Conners at the 18th green with beers in hand. Malory Conners became a viral sensation online for her emotional reactions with every birdie that her husband sank.

After Conners sank his final putt, other Canadian golfers started tweeting their congratulations, including LPGA star Alena Sharp of Hamilton and Mike Weir of Brights Grove, Ont., who will be the only other Canadian in the field at the Masters as the champion in 2003.

""So happy for @coreconn great playing buddy! #Augusta bound,"" said Weir.

""Had a practice round with @coreconn last year(not a big dealllll). He's been a mentor for myself, and so many others over the past couple years. A guy that's paid his dues and done the right things for so long. Tough to not get a little emotional for the guy!

Launched in Paris on March 26, the P30 Pro has earned rave reviews and has instantly become the standard by which all other smartphone cameras will be measured. Influential Canadian tech writers are already considering it one of the best cameras of 2019.

""Initial reaction by Canadian writers is extremely positive - they're really liking the Leica Quad Camera System, the incredible night capture mode and the overall control they have over their image making,"" said Mr. Li. ""And the new 32 MP front-facing camera is a selfie game-changer.""

The HUAWEI P30 Series will change users' expectations of smartphone photography. Achieving a record-high overall DxOMark score of 112, the HUAWEI P30 Pro is equipped with a new Leica Quad Camera System, including a 40 MP main camera with the HUWAI SuperSpectrum Sensor, a 20 MP ultra-wide angle camera, an 8 MP telephoto camera, the HUAWEI ToF Camera and the 32 MP front camera.

The 1/1.7-inch HUAWEI SuperSpectrum Sensor looks at light in a fundamentally new way. The RYYB HUAWEI SuperSpectrum Sensor deviates from the traditional RGGB Bayer filter by replacing green pixels with yellow pixels, yielding a high maximum ISO rating of 409600 on the HUAWEI P30 Pro and 204800 on the HUAWEI P30. This fundamental shift in sensor technology, combined with HUAWEI AIS, OIS and the HUAWEI P30 Pro's f/1.6 wide aperture, delivers extraordinary photography and videography experiences across a wide range of scenarios and lighting conditions—including extreme low light—producing images with enhanced detail, colour and clarity.

The new SuperZoom Lens unlocks a superior level of zoom photography in a slim-line device design. Through a new periscope design, the SuperZoom Lens supports high fidelity magnification of five times optical zoom, 10 times hybrid zoom and 50 times digital zoom. A prism element in the telephoto camera bends light at a 90-degree angle to maximize focal length while minimizing camera height, without disrupting device design.

The HUAWEI ToF Camera unleashes the imagination. Unique to the HUAWEI P30 Pro is a HUAWEI ToF Camera that captures depth-of-field information to deliver accurate image segmentation. Precise distance measurement allows for the simulation of multiple levels of bokeh. The Super Portrait feature captures even the smallest details, such as individual strands of hair. It combines depth information and proprietary algorithms to produce outstanding images with defocused backgrounds and highlights the subject of the image in any scenario.

Huawei AI helps users bring it all together into the perfect shot. AI HDR+ enables the front and rear cameras to combine multiple photos taken in quick succession to eliminate overexposed and backlit images.

The Walrus

Trina O’Brien Leggott, a retired librarian, enjoys a breathtaking view of Pownal Bay and the surrounding countryside from her rural home outside Charlottetown. But she’s worried about climate change—and she says she’s grown tired of politicians who seem unable or unwilling to address it. “The way we’re doing things is not really working,” she says. “Surely there’s got to be better.”

Leggott has reason to worry. According to the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, global temperatures are rising faster than scientists previously believed. Even a pledge by world leaders to cap the rise at 1.5 degrees may not be enough to prevent floods, droughts, heat waves, and catastrophic species loss. According to research from a University of Prince Edward Island climate lab, incremental rises in temperature will exacerbate already powerful storm surges and increase shoreline erosion in the province. The Island currently loses an average of twenty-eight centimetres of coastline a year. By the start of the next century, 1,000 PEI homes and cottages will be at risk of disappearing into the ocean.

Leggott’s house is far enough inland that it likely wouldn’t be one of them, but she has a sense of what’s at stake. “We’re very aware, living on an island, how fragile our ecosystem is,” she says. She wonders how the decline of organic matter in Island soil, described in a report released last year, will affect local agriculture. She also worries about what will happen to Island fisheries should the Northern Pulp mill in Nova Scotia proceed with a controversial plan to discharge effluent into the Northumberland Strait, off the Island’s southern shores.

Those concerns have led Leggott to the Green Party of Prince Edward Island. She’s not alone. Nearly four in ten Islanders have suggested they might vote Green in the next provincial election, according to a recent poll from Corporate Research Associates. (The election has since been called for April 23.) Leggott, who has voted Liberal, NDP, or Green in every provincial election since moving to PEI eleven years ago, says she appreciates the party’s focus on supporting local businesses and protecting farmland. She’s also impressed with how the party connects directly with Islanders, hosting Green Drinks gatherings in pubs and cafés across the province.

The party is headed by Peter Bevan-Baker, and under his leadership, the Green Party has vaulted ahead of the governing Liberals into first place: the latest quarterly poll from CRA has the party at 38 percent, eleven points ahead of the Liberals. If these numbers hold, tiny PEI may be on course to elect the first provincial Green government in Canada.

Frank Graves, president of Ekos Research Associates, says renewed support for the Green Party reflects wider voter concern for the environment. At a time when the majority of Canadians—particularly younger Canadians—see climate change as a serious threat to the planet, a provincial victory would vault the party and its policies into the national spotlight.

In its own unassuming way, PEI has quietly and steadfastly advanced some groundbreaking environmental policies over the past two decades. The province launched a mandatory provincial waste-sorting program in 1999 and now diverts 65 percent of its waste from landfill. It tops the country in the percentage of households that compost. A province-wide ban on single-use plastic bags will take effect in July. And PEI is a global leader in wind power, with Island wind farms producing more than 25 percent of the Island’s energy needs.

Like other Canadian jurisdictions, PEI is currently addressing robust immigration, rising housing prices, and concerns about climate change—but the small scale of the Island makes its case unique among other provinces. Nevertheless, as Prince Edward Island gradually embraces Green politics, it may become a testing ground for a party that has always been seen as an underdog rather than a serious contender for power. And whether or not the Greens win the next election, their influence on PEI politics may offer Canadians a chance to reflect on the broader splintering of traditional party loyalty across the country.

Before the 2015 provincial election, no Green candidate had ever come close to winning a seat. But, since 2017, Bevan-Baker has been the preferred choice of premier. A former dentist and father of four, he made his way to the Island from Scotland, via stints in Newfoundland and Labrador and Ontario. He cut his political teeth running (and losing) nine times for the Green Party at the federal and provincial levels before a resounding win in his own rural riding in the 2015 election brought the Greens their historic breakthrough. A surprise by-election win in a Charlottetown seat in 2017 proved the party has momentum.

Don Desserud, a political scientist at UPEI, says the Greens’ appeal can be attributed not just to their environmental focus but also to the current electoral mood. The province’s Liberals are a three-term government with an unpopular leader. The Opposition Progressive Conservatives, on their sixth leader in as many years, have been languishing in the polls.

“There’s an underbelly of frustration with the standard parties doing the same things over and over again,” says Desserud. It’s a phenomenon seen in other recent provincial elections. In New Brunswick, neither the Liberal nor Progressive Conservative parties could eke out a majority victory as support for smaller parties increased. In Quebec, the upstart CAQ surged to power and Québec solidaire made huge gains, at the expense of the once dominant Liberals and Parti Québécois.

Although right-wing populist parties have garnered much media attention as of late, Graves, of Ekos Research, believes there’s an opening in Canada for a progressive, left-of-centre populist party that can speak to voter cynicism. According to a recent Abacus poll, nearly 36 percent of Canadians would consider voting Green in the next federal election, a number that’s remained relatively consistent in the firm’s polling since 2015. In other words, Canadians sympathetic to Green policies often vote for other parties—but, in the right circumstances, might cast their vote with the Greens.

Increased Green support on the Island follows a clutch of modest successes for the party in other provincial legislatures. The Green Party is in a position of strength in British Columbia, where it’s collaborating closely with the NDP. Ontario elected its first Green MPP in June. And, in New Brunswick, the September election saw three Green MLAs elected, giving them the balance of power. Elsewhere, however—particularly in the Prairies, where resource extraction plays a much larger role in the economy—provincial Green parties have struggled.

Nevertheless, Green legislators have taken full advantage of these wins to influence policy. The BC Greens were instrumental in providing input into the NDP government’s ambitious new carbon-reduction strategy, though it’s too early to say how successful the NDP-Green alliance will be in curbing carbon outputs. In PEI, the Greens recently managed to pass one of their own bills, aimed at recognizing the vital role of Island’s creative, cultural, and clean technology industries and designed to attract new investment, trade partnerships, and economic activity in these sectors. The Greens have also rolled out an integrated housing strategy, which calls for expanded seniors housing, tighter regulations on short-term rentals, and more dedicated housing for low-income families. By making climate change and access to housing two of their key priorities in the legislature—and possible planks in an election platform—the Green Party may be demonstrating that its politics are about much more than just saving the environment. Still, despite the party’s polling lead, Desserud isn’t optimistic it will win over the province.

On a federal level, the prospects are less clear. Under leader Elizabeth May, Greens are currently polling at historic levels of support, and Graves feels the timing may be favourable for a modest Green breakthrough in the upcoming federal election. His internal polling shows the Greens leading in three federal ridings, and in play in ten to fifteen more across the country. Yet provincial and federal voting intentions don’t always correspond. Even on PEI, the popularity of Bevan-Baker’s party has resulted in only a modest increase in the number of Islanders who say they plan to vote Green federally. Partly that’s the challenge of a first-past-the-post, winner-take-all system that often penalizes smaller parties. Under a system of proportional representation, if 10 percent of Canadians voted for the Greens, they’d end up with thirty-four seats in the 338-seat House of Commons—a substantive increase over Elizabeth May’s current lone seat, and enough to be a force to reckoned with in Parliament. But, even in the best-case scenarios under our current system, that outcome is highly unlikely. (Islanders have a chance to test-case electoral reform in April’s election. In concert with the provincial election, voters on PEI will be asked in a referendum to make a clear choice between the current first-past-the-post system and a mixed member proportional representation system of government.)

In the absence of electoral reform, it would take a powerful paradigm shift to elect a federal Green government, whose Vision Green platform would pair environmental protection with fiscal responsibility. Rising environmental awareness and disillusionment with the ruling Liberals may sway some voters, but these concerns have not yet positioned the federal party any closer to power. The nature of the current electoral structure, says Graves, is such that during a tightly fought contest—as in the 2015 election—what he calls “promiscuous progressive voters” rally around the candidate most likely to stave off a Conservative victory.

“I really think people are tired of the idea that we either have to vote red or blue,” says Jill MacIntyre, twenty-two. A recent graduate of Mount Allison University, MacIntyre grew up in Summerside and rallied behind causes such as gender rights and economic equality. After flirting with the Liberals and the NDP, she’s found her political home with the Greens. Voters like MacIntyre will be key to the next federal election. She and her millennial peers recently surpassed baby boomers as the largest voting bloc in the country. They voted in record numbers in 2015, and 45 percent of those parked their vote with the Liberals—as did MacIntyre.

Now she’s frustrated by what she perceives as the government’s lack of meaningful consultation with Indigenous communities, not to mention disregard for environmental impacts, in its support for the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline. MacIntyre’s concerns are shared by a growing number of Canadians. As the election approaches, the prime minister’s approval ratings have been declining among both the general population and the millennial voters who put him over the top the last time around. “People are just so tired of that,” MacIntyre says of her peers. “And they see that the Greens are doing politics differently.”

In a province that elected Canada’s first premier of non-European descent (Joe Ghiz) and Canada’s first openly gay male premier (current premier Wade MacLauchlan), Islanders have already shown a willingness to make political history. But a provincial win for the Greens would also mark a turning point in Canada’s relationship to the party, as ascension into government would expose the scrappy grassroots party and its leaders to a whole new level of scrutiny. “It would make me so happy to elect the most progressive government in Canada, coming from this tiny island,” says MacIntyre.",Will PEI Start a New Green Wave?,The Walrus,https://thewalrus.ca/will-pei-start-a-new-green-wave/

Right now, they are a trio of middle-aged men. And along with illustrator Frank Caruso, who is also a middle-aged man, they are launching this graphic novel. For women. By—in case we were not clear—four men. It’s utter nonsense, and Twitter agrees.

Perfect timing! I, a non member of Green Day, am writing my handbook for being in the band Green Day. Also due out 10/29 — Manny Santos (@DanuellaSantos) April 3, 2019

Genève Faranski, who has worked at Toronto comic shop The Beguiling for eight years, also agrees. “It has a certain aesthetic that seems dated,” she says. “And it’s by four men, so automatically it feels a little unpredictable in terms of the content.” Faranski also says that the world of graphic novels has historically been a boys club, but in the past 10 years, she’s seen an uptick in the number of women navigating the industry.

Does that mean she thinks Green Day could have found someone better to collaborate with on this project? “There are hundreds of women doing really popular work exhibited all over the world, and judging by the artwork, who could do a much more interesting and appealing job.” So… That’s a yes.

Here are some graphic novels that already exist, actually written by Canadian women, for women that Faranski loves. Full disclosure: we have not read Last of the American Girls, and probably never will, but we still bet these are much better.

Woman World by Aminder Dhaliwal

This novel is set in the near future, where all men have disappeared thanks to a birth defect. Earth gets a rebrand as Woman World, united under the flag of Beyoncé’s Thighs (seriously). “That’s what she said” jokes and Blockbusters are distant memories, and the biggest hurdle is continuing the species.

Available at Drawn & Quarterly, $10.

Somnambulance by Fiona Smyth

Faranski calls Fiona Smyth an “incredible figure on the Toronto comic scene.” The pages of her work are packed with images of feminism, sexuality and style. Somnabulance is a collection of her comics from the past 30 years, and while it’s NSFW, it’s also super empowering and sparks conversations that remain important, even decades after they were written.

Available at Indigo, $34.

XTC69 by Jessica Campbell

Jessica Campbell (in the novel) is from the planet L8DZ N1T3. She’s also the commander of a spaceship that’s traveling the galaxy, looking for men she and her crew can breed with. Jessica Campbell (the artist) is known for skewering gender politics, so it’s not surprising that XTC69 offers up hilarious commentary on the determination of women and non-binary folks who are constantly dealing with men who are trash.

Available at Amazon, $14.

Magical Beatdown Volume 1 by Jenn Woodall

Jenn Woodall, who Faranski says is one of The Beguiling’s best sellers, produced a series of graphic novels that’s like a feminist punk interpretation of Sailor Moon. It’s a revenge fantasy, lead by an otherwise average schoolgirl who changes into a magical being and takes down people who harass her in the street.

Available at Silver Sprocket, $6.

SuperMutant Magic Academy by Jillian Tamacki

This book is about kids in a high school for the supernaturally gifted, and all the bake sales, crushes and science experiments they experience along the way. It is geared towards a younger reader, and Faranski recommends it in case Green Day’s novel ends up being for younger women/girls, too. We truly have no idea at this point.

Available at Drawn & Quarterly, $23.

The Green Organic Dutchman (TGOD), one of Canada's fastest-growing pot producers, applied for a bylaw exemption last summer to allow a 123,000-square-foot cannabis greenhouse at the corner of Jerseyville and Alberton roads. The current rural size limit in Hamilton for pot is 20,000 square feet.

Council rejected the proposal last year over the advice of its own planners, spurring an appeal to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.

A hearing was expected later this year — but council voted late Wednesday to sign off on a settlement proposal, although with unspecified conditions.

Related Content Take a tour of Green Organic Dutchman as it tries to woo Hamilton

The organic pot grower celebrated the settlement in a release that said the decision will ""allow TGOD to operate its cannabis greenhouse in Ancaster"" and start growing by June with a staff of up to 85 people. The company embarked on a lobbying and charm offensive after the fall election in the hopes council would reconsider.

Details of the settlement and proposed city conditions are still secret, so it was not immediately clear if the original planned size of the contentious greenhouse — about one-fifth as big as Lime Ridge Mall — was endorsed by council.

Mayor Fred Eisenberger did not take part in the vote because he is an investor in the company.

TGOD originally earned criticism from some politicians, particularly Ancaster Coun. Lloyd Ferguson, for starting to build the big greenhouse before earning permission to do so.

Ferguson had pushed to fight the proposal, arguing ""monster"" pot greenhouses could pop up across rural Hamilton.

After the city issued a stop work order last year, TGOD applied for an alternate permit to continue building the greenhouse — only for potted mums.","Hamilton settles with medical pot grower, the Green Organic Dutchman, to allow ‘monster’ Ancaster greenhouse",The Hamilton Spectator,https://www.thespec.com/news-story/9246102-hamilton-settles-with-medical-pot-grower-the-green-organic-dutchman-to-allow-monster-ancaster-greenhouse/

“I think the Queen just might be eating babies. Fuck, there’s all kind of circumstantial evidence that states she’s a Satan worshipping cannibal, which is kind of fucked up and weird isn’t it? I never did trust authority but I would’ve never bet on it being this weird.”

Murray Acton aka “The Cretin” is as an anti-authoritarian punk-rock anarchist and frontman of Canadian hardcore-punk outfit Dayglo Abortions. For nearly 40 years, Acton and his band of misfits from Victoria, B.C. have caused controversy all around the globe with their “fuck you” attitude and groovy heavy-rock riffs, garnering worldwide acclaim in the underground punk and hardcore scene.

The band’s highest selling record to date, Feed Us A Fetus, showcases former president of the United States Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan sitting at a table with a cooked fetus on a dinner plate. Their following record, Here Today, Guano Tomorrow, saw the band encounter obscenity charges from an Ontario police officer, who found great offense in his teenage daughter listening to tracks like “Fuck My Shit Stinks” and “Fuck Satan to Death” plastered alongside the image of a hamster brutalized by gunshot. The charges were dropped in in 1990 and Dayglo Abortions released their next album, Two Dogs Fucking, in 1991. The artwork is exactly as it sounds. Their latest album, 2016’s Armageddon Survival Guide, originally held a much different title that would have definitely landed them a date in court.

“Originally that was supposed to be out in 2012. This album was supposed to be called Kill Stephen Harper,” Acton says. “They really didn’t like it because it was provoking people to sue us again. I was gonna start a Stephen Harper popularity fund where we have this thing on Facebook that says ‘Would you pledge $5000 dollars to have Stephen Harper assassinated?’ and a thermometer would go up. Obviously that thing was gonna hit the roof in no time, eh.”

Though the album’s title changed, Acton still got a dig in on Harper with the song “Canadian Hate-Triot” where the frontman yells obscenities at our former Prime Minister, calling him a corporate whore and towel-boy for the global elite.

Acton isn’t too pleased with our current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau either. He calls Trudeau a “Fuckin’ elitist slob” who is “Just like his father. A fuckin’ lawyer looking out for himself and his corporate cronies.”

“He’s never come through with anything,” Acton says. “He makes like he’s gonna come clean with the aboriginals and stuff like that, and fuckin’ nothing. It was all just campaign smoke. The guy is full of shit and he’s ruined fuckin’ marijuana. I’m fuckin’ pissed about that. One of my favourite things to do and he’s fuckin ruined it.”

Acton admits that the upcoming Canadian elections are making him nervous. He doesn’t plan to vote for either the Liberals or Conservatives and will most likely cast his ballot for the Green Party. Acton usually votes Green regardless, but there’s a lingering fear of what this election could bring if Conservative leader Andrew Scheer becomes our PM.

“We could end up with a fuckin’ right wing nut bar want to be like Trump character the way things are going.”

The past U.S. election gave Acton a flurry of new material, and he says a new Dayglo Abortions album is written, and ready to record.

“It’s gonna raise a few eyebrows,” Acton concludes. “It’s not particularly politically correct, but I’ve never been politically correct anyways. I don’t go out of my way to hurt people’s feelings or anything like that, but sometimes you gotta hurt a few feelings just to get the job done, ya know? It’s like trolling in real life.”

In conclusion, Acton can forget about all of this when he’s on stage. He assures the band is tighter than they have ever been, and urges anyone who hasn’t seen the band to check them out at SBC on April 12.",B.C.

Delores Syrota’s Saskatchewan women’s team from Wadena claimed its second gold medal in three years (to go along with a silver won last year), while Mickey Pendergast’s Alberta men’s team from Red Deer repeated as Canadian Masters gold-medallists after its victory last year in Surrey/White Rock, B.C.

On the women’s side, Syrota — backed up by vice-skip Beverly Krasowski, second June Campbell and lead Sylvia Broad — capped a perfect 11-0 performance in Saskatoon in front of friends and family with an 8-7 win over B.C.’s Janet Klebe. Syrota’s team trailed 7-5 going to the eighth and final end, but Syrota drew for the winning three to claim gold.

Klebe’s team, representing the Chilliwack and Richmond clubs, was rounded out by vice-skip Kerri Miller, second Jane Adam, lead Laurie Shimizu and coach Vic Shimizu.

In the bronze-medal game, New Brunswick’s Sharon Levesque (Fredericton), backed up by vice-skip Susan Jonah, second Shawn Stubbert and lead Eleanor Murray, was a 10-3 winner over Ontario’s Jan Carwardine (vice-skip Louise Germain, second Judy MacLellan, lead Sandra Thain, coach Roy Weigand; Toronto).

Pendergast, meanwhile, added a second straight gold medal to his collection by beating a familiar face — Northern Ontario’s Al Hackner (Sudbury) — 8-4 in the final.

Pendergast was backed up by vice-skip Rob Armitage, second Randy Ponich and brother Kevin Pendergast, while the Hackner team featured Eric Harnden, Frank Morissette (a longtime rival of Pendergast when he lived in Calgary) and Bruce Munro.

Brad Heidt’s Saskatchewan team (vice-skip Terry Marteniuk, second Randy Graham, lead Dan Ormsby; Kerrobert) captured the bronze medal with a 9-3 victory over B.C.’s Lyle Boyce (vice-skip John Lapointe, second Don Pennell, lead Tom Green; Campbell River).

The national event commemorated the first anniversary of the Humboldt Broncos bus crash, the traffic accident in Saskatchewan that resulted in the deaths of 16 passengers connected to the Humboldt Broncos junior hockey team. Thirteen others were injured.

Green Shirt Day’s aim was to “inspire more Canadians to register as organ and tissue donors,” according to a release. Broncos player Logan Boule registered before dying and six people received those donations. As the news about the donations spread, more than 100,000 Canadians registered as donors.

That act inspired Vancouver-based marketer David Peckham to launch the initiative, recruiting five other individuals to help him organize. Silverthorne, owner of the Roberts Creek graphics shop Vital Signs, was one of those five. He assisted with the initiative’s logo, graphics, banners, sourcing T-shirts and other materials. “[He] found me through an old employee,” said Silverthorne. One of his current employees, Brian Hubenig, created the T-shirt logo.

“I’ve been now schooled on one person can’t make a difference. One person and five other people can make a crazy-ass difference,” said Silverthorne of the experience.

Money raised from the T-shirt sales will be donated to the Canadian Transplant Association. So far $250,000 has been raised, according to Silverthorne. Businesses and organizations on the Sunshine Coast also participated, including TD Bank, which raised more than $2,800 and had 30 people register as donors.

Silverthorne was also inspired to act because of his own experience. Two years ago he was in need of a transplant and his brother-in-law donated the kidney. “Once you have a transplant, you’re embodied with gratitude. I never volunteered a day in my life and that’s all I’m for now, helping people get registered.”

In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration has given the green light to the AquaBounty production in Indiana, subject to a new regulation that will require it to disclose ...","HALIFAX—Genetically modified salmon raised in Prince Edward Island are poised for the leap to grocery shelves, a Canadian first that has left traditional producers concerned about setting their farmed fish apart.

Environment Canada recently gave notice it has approved U.S.-based AquaBounty to grow the salmon at its site about 74 kilometres east of Charlottetown.

AquaBounty said in a release it would begin stocking its Rollo Bay facility “as soon as possible,” with the first harvest of AquAdvantage salmon estimated late next year.

Sylvain Charlebois, director of the agrifood analytics unit at Dalhousie University, said it’s likely AquaBounty “production will be ramped up in Canada.”

“It’s a huge advantage for AquaBounty to be allowed to produce this salmon in Canada,” he said in an interview.

AquaBounty, based in Maynard, Mass., has said its salmon will contain genetic material from chinook salmon that help it reach adult size faster, creating a less expensive product.

Health Canada said it doesn’t see any need for a mandatory label to allow consumers to spot the genetically modified fish, but existing producers said they may call for that to change.

“We are reviewing it,” said Tim Kennedy, executive director of the Canadian Aquaculture Industry Alliance.

“Will there be a disruption in the … entire salmon market? We hope not. But I will say if that’s a possibility, then the response will be: somebody has to label.”

The Environment Canada certification has been most strongly opposed to date by environmental groups, who continue to argue there’s a risk to wild Atlantic salmon if there’s an escape.

However, the certifications in Canada and the U.S. could draw the traditional aquaculture industry and its lobbyists more closely into the debate, depending on how consumers react to the news of AquaBounty’s products entering the market sometime next year.

The Canadian aquaculture alliance says its members don’t farm or sell GM farmed salmon and aren’t researching the practice.

Kennedy said a push for labelling could come next.

“We are reviewing it. We recognize the United States is moving forward with mandatory labelling, as is the European Union,” he said.

“Does it make sense from a trade perspective to align more closely with our major trading partners?”

He said the industry could consider setting up a non-GM label, similar to the labelling of organic foods.

The federal Health Department has repeatedly said it doesn’t favour mandatory labelling for the genetically modified fish.

In a February letter to the Canadian Biotechnology Action Network – an active opponent of GM salmon – the department said it prefers “industry-led initiatives such as voluntary standards,” and “the government of Canada intends to maintain its current approach.”

Kennedy said this leaves the question of who should pay for a massive labelling redo.

“Who bears the burden of that transparency? I don’t think it should be our producers because we’re not the ones putting the new product into the market,” he said.

Meanwhile, it remains unclear how significant the level of production in P.E.I. will be in the Canadian market.

The company declined a request for an interview with its CEO about its plans going forward for production in Prince Edward Island, providing references to news releases.

Over the past two years – as it awaited its Environment Canada licence – the company had shipped eggs to Panama for growing, before the salmon were imported back to Canada and other destinations.

Charlebois says the federal decision means the firm can ship more directly to markets, particularly processors that might use the GM salmon in products ranging from sushi to pies to pates.

Still, the arrival of a form of labelling in the U.S. could lead to increased pressure to create some form of labelling in Canada, he adds.

In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration has given the green light to the AquaBounty production in Indiana, subject to a new regulation that will require it to disclose when a food is genetically modified.

That has come amidst a pending lawsuit by a coalition of consumer, environmental and fishing groups that still hopes to block the sale through the courts.

Opponents have also criticized the upcoming U.S. labelling system, which they say uses the term “bioengineered,” a less familiar phrase than “genetically modified.”

Also, under the rules coming in 2020, companies will be able to provide disclosure of the GM salmon through codes that people would have to scan on their smart phones.

Lucy Sharratt, co-ordinator of the Canadian Biotechnology Action Network, says her group wants Canada to introduce a more transparent labelling system that consumers can easily see on any package.

“The lack of genetically modified food labelling is just the most obvious transparency issue undermining public trust,” she told parliamentarians in a hearing last week.

“Canadians are also asking for more transparent regulation of genetically modified organisms and opportunities for public engagement.”",First genetically modified salmon to hit Canadian stores,plant.ca,https://www.plant.ca/general/first-genetically-modified-salmon-to-hit-canadian-stores-182781/

Later in the day, Kim was grabbing at his right upper body with an apparent injury. Conners was two strokes ...","SAN ANTONIO – Canadian Corey Conners claimed his first PGA Tour victory and earned an invite to the Masters on Sunday, winning the Valero Texas Open less than a week after qualifying.

Conners only entered the tournament field Monday, and he’s the first golfer to win on the PGA Tour after qualifying on a Monday in nine years. He made three birdies in the final five holes, shooting a 6-under 66. He was 20-under for the tournament, winning by two shots over Charley Hoffman.

Next stop for Conners: Augusta, Georgia, for next week’s Masters.

Hoffman, the 2016 Texas Open winner, shot 67 for 18-under on the weekend.

Ryan Moore closed with an 8-under 64, a shot off the course record, and was third at 17-under.

Si Woo Kim, The Players Championship winner in 2017, led the opening three rounds but dropped to a tie for fourth with Brian Stuard (15-under) after an even-par 72.

Conners, the 2014 U.S. Amateur runner-up, will play in his second Masters. Two of the top three finishers last year at Augusta missed the top 10 this week. Rickie Fowler was tied for 17th while 10 strokes back at 10-under with a final-round 69, and Jordan Spieth (72) was 7-under.

Incredible performance from @coreconn. What a battle, and what a champion 🙌🏼🍁 pic.twitter.com/PnembdLq9q — Golf Canada (@GolfCanada) April 7, 2019

Stuard finished with 66 to get to 15-under. Kevin Streelman closed with an 8-under 64 and was 14-under. He missed tying the course record when, after four-straight birdies, he hit his approach from the 18th fairway into the gallery and bogeyed.

Mackenzie Hughes (73) of Dundas, Ont., and Adam Svensson (70) of Surrey, B.C., tied for 42nd at 5 under. Nick Taylor (72) of Abbotsford, B.C., tied for 52nd at 4 under.

It was a wild round for Conners, a native of Listowel, Ont., who had not won on any of the PGA Tour’s affiliated circuits. He had 10 birdies and four pars that sandwiched four consecutive bogeys on the front nine.

He had a one-stroke lead when he rammed home a 34-foot birdie putt at No. 12, and stayed a stroke up with a tap-in birdie at the 14th.

Moore joined Conners at the top of the leaderboard with an 8-foot putt at No. 16 that was his fourth birdie in five holes.

Moore missed a birdie opportunity on the next hole when he couldn’t convert on a putt from inside 10 feet. Minutes later, Conners sank a 10-footer to save par at No. 15, then hit to four feet to set up a birdie at the 175-yard par-3 16th. His birdie at No. 17 gave him a three-shot lead walking up the final hole.

Conners looked like he would tuck this one away early. He birdied four of the first five holes at TPC San Antonio. Trailing by a shot going in the final round, he benefited from a three-stroke swing on the leaderboard on the third hole with a 10-foot putt on the par-3. Kim hit into the water fronting the green and double-bogeyed. Later in the day, Kim was grabbing at his right upper body with an apparent injury.

Conners was two strokes ahead, and with birdies on the next two holes he led by four over both Kim and Hoffman.

But Conners bogeyed the next four, and three of those came after tee shots put him in nice position either from the middle of the fairway or close to it.

The other bogey, on a par-3 at No. 7, he hit his tee shot into a bunker, then blasted over the green.

He made the turn and clicked off three consecutive birdies. The last player to qualify on Monday and win a PGA Tour event was Arjun Atwal in 2010 at the Wyndham Championship. That was the first time it had been done in 24 years.","Canadian Corey Conners wins Valero days after qualifying, will play Masters",Golf Canada,https://golfcanada.ca/article/canadian-corey-conners-wins-valero-days-qualifying-will-play-masters

In 2018, the House of Commons passed four environmental protection bills that would be the most in a generation. If also passed by the Senate, these new laws would:

Improve how Canada assesses the environmental and sustainability impacts of major development projects (Bill C-69).

Accelerate creation of marine protected areas and strengthen their ecological integrity (Bill C-55).

The question is: Will the Senate also go green and vote for stronger environmental laws before Parliament prorogues at the end of June?

Conservative senators are using a variety of procedural tactics (such as the circus of extraordinary cross-country hearings in western Canada this week and eastern Canada later in the month) to kill Bill C-69.

Bill C-48 is also at risk of death by delay.

Senators are actively considering amendments that remove important new protections for fish and fish habitat from Bill C-68, and create obstacles to more marine protection in Bill C-55.

The Senate has a constitutional duty to study legislation and refer any proposed amendments to the House of Commons for reconsideration.

But the Senate has no right to block environmental legislation duly passed by the democratically elected House of Commons, especially given that the Liberal Party’s electoral mandate in October 2015 made enactment of these stronger environmental laws a priority commitment.

Conservative and several independent senators have aligned themselves with the oil and gas industry in seeking to ensure that federal assessments of development projects do not consider greenhouse gas emissions and restrict public participation in hearings.

Bill C-69 is broadly supported by most environmental groups, including Nature Canada, the Assembly of First Nations, the Native Women’s Association of Canada and the Mining Association of Canada.

The Senate is skating on thin ice with Bill C-69 and these other bills; its very credibility as an institution with an ongoing role in our democracy depends on how it handles them.

Why? A recent AbacusData survey found that almost eight million Canadians are “extremely” worried about climate change, and that nine million say it will be the top issue, or one of the top two issues, that they vote on.

On March 15, children in 100 countries (tens of thousands in Montreal alone) went on strike from school because their politicians are doing so little to address climate change.

Meanwhile, WWF reports that global wildlife populations have declined by 60 per cent in 40 years.

Yet the Senate may well vote to weaken — or kill by delay — bills passed by the elected House of Commons that would help reduce GHG emissions and reverse the loss of wildlife in Canada.

In my view, this would be a major political blunder, but even worse, a moral failure that Canadians will remember.

If these bills are killed or weakened, I predict that Canadian children and adult Canadians who care about children will know exactly where to go to protest. The former train station across from the Chateau Laurier is conveniently located.

Canada’s children and Canada’s nature need the Senate to go green this spring.

HALLOWELL, Maine (AP) — A proposed 145-mile (233-kilometer) transmission line that would serve as a conduit for Canadian hydropower to reach the New England power grid cleared a major hurdle Thursday with approval of the Maine Public Utilities Commission.

The three-member panel unanimously approved Central Maine Power's $1 billion project, but further regulatory approvals will be necessary for the project to become a reality.

CMP's New England Clean Energy Connect would allow 1,200 megawatts of Canadian hydropower to reach consumers in Massachusetts to meet that state's green energy goals. Commissioners concluded that there are substantial benefits for Maine, as well, including reduced carbon pollution, lower electric rates and enhanced energy reliability, along with $258 million in incentives.

Commission Chairman Mark Vannoy said Thursday that the economic and environmental gains are needed in a region trying to balance the need for more energy with environmental stewardship.

""We're at a critical point here: It's needed, it's necessary, and the state of Maine is moving forward,"" he said, calling the outcome ""a good result for Maine ratepayers.""

But a staff attorney for the Natural Resources Council of Maine called the decision ""deeply flawed"" and accused regulators of siding with ""Central Maine Power's corporate interests over the best interests of the state of Maine and ratepayers of Maine.""

""This decision dramatically overstates the benefits while dramatically undervaluing the negative impacts to the state of Maine,"" Sue Ely said.

Though the project is being funded by Massachusetts, critics say it would destroy Maine's unspoiled wilderness without guarantees of environmental benefits. They also say it would snuff out homegrown green energy projects, like solar and wind power, in Maine.

Much of the project calls for widening existing corridors, but a new swath would be cut through 53 miles (85 kilometers) of wilderness in western Maine. It would cross the Appalachian Trail, 263 wetlands and 115 streams, according to the Natural Resources Council of Maine.

Further approvals are necessary. The Maine Department of Environmental Protection, the Maine Land Use Planning Commission and other regulators all have to approve some aspect of the CMP project. The Department of Environmental Protection will make the final decision on CMP's site permit and compliance with the state Natural Resources Protection Act, agency spokesman David Madore said.

Maine Public Advocate Barry Hobbins and Democratic Gov. Janet Mills both endorsed the project after CMP sweetened the deal with a package of benefits for Maine.

The utility's $258 million in incentives would provide $140 million for rate relief for retail customers, $50 million for low-income energy customers, $15 million to subsidize heat pump purchases and $15 million for electric cars and charging stations.

Supporters say the project would provide electricity for a million homes and drive down electricity rates for all of New England. An independent consultant, London Economics International LLC, concluded carbon dioxide emissions would be lowered by 3.6 million metric tons per year.

A subsidiary of CMP, which is part of Connecticut-based Avangrid, would be created to oversee construction of the power line to ensure Maine ratepayers are insulated from costs.

The utility hopes to receive all regulatory approvals by year's end and for construction to begin next year, said Thorn Dickinson, vice president for business development.",Transmission line for Canadian hydropower to Northeast OK'd,Houston Chronicle,https://www.chron.com/news/article/Maine-utility-regulators-to-deliberate-145-mile-13758533.php
334,Business,2019-04-11T19:25:00.0000000Z,"Current Canadian regulations only assess the food and environmental ... Sharratt disputed CBAN, a network of 16 organizations, including Green Peace, the National Farmers Union and No More GMOs, is anti-GM. “I would say we’re critical and we’re ...","Better regulations are needed to prevent contamination from genetically modified organisms (GMOs).

That’s what the Canadian Biotechnology Action Network (CBAN) and the SaskOrganics’ Organic Agriculture Protection Fund committee (OAPF) concludes in a report called GM Contamination in Canada: The failure to contain living modified organisms – incidents and impacts.

Why it matters: GMOs found where they shouldn’t be can have a big economic impact on farmers.

The report says before approving the release of GMOs federal regulators should assess the socio-economic impact of possible escapes, not release certain GM organisms in the first place, and deregister some already commercialized.

ADVERTISEMENT

Since 1996 when canola became the first GM crop released in Canada, GM canola, flax, wheat and pigs have been found where they shouldn’t be, hurting farmers financially.

“(T)he many cases of (GMO) escape described in this report show that the government needs to regulate segregation and containment measures for some GMOs and that the only way to prevent contamination from certain GMOs is to stop their release,” says the report, released March 26. “Some GMOs are too prone to escape and others have impacts that are too serious if escape occurs.”

The report lists all the GM escapes in Canada costing farmers millions of dollars.

“Farmers are the first to pay the price,” Marla Carlson of SaskOrganics said in a news release. “Our experience shows that GM contamination can cost farmers dearly. We encourage the federal government to take action to prevent GM contamination to protect farmers’ livelihoods and Canada’s economy.”

Because of GM escapes some farmers have temporarily or permanently lost export markets, suffered lower crop prices in the short or long term and lost access to non-GM canola and farm-saved canola seed.

The report says GM canola is so widespread in Canada organic farmers grow almost no canola. The only place they do are “a few isolated areas” where other farmers don’t grow GM canola.

GM flax contamination temporarily shut down export markets and prices remain low because Canada hasn’t regained higher-priced flax markets.

The discovery of a few GM wheat plants temporarily shut two export markets to Canadian wheat.

Now GM alfalfa, the first perennial GM crop in Canada, threatens all Canadian organic farms and puts alfalfa seed growers at risk because of potential GM contamination, the report says.

“The biology and use patterns of some crops, such as GM alfalfa, make their unwanted spread unavoidable,” the report says.

“GM alfalfa contamination has been found in the U.S. and U.S. government scientists have reported the wide dispersal of feral GM alfalfa.”

Just as non-GM and GM canola can’t coexist, neither can GM and non-GM alfalfa, CBAN co-ordinator Lucy Sharratt said in an interview March 26.

Alfalfa is an important crop to organic farmers because it fixes nitrogen, suppresses weeds and creates organic matter.

ADVERTISEMENT

CBAN and OAPF want GM alfalfa, currently only grown in Eastern Canada due to farmer opposition in the West, deregistered to help prevent GM contamination.

CBAN and OAPF are also wary of releasing GM trees, insects and salmon, Sharratt said.

Trees produce pollen that can spread long distances making it almost impossible to stop GM tree genetics from spreading, she said.

“The report says the production of GM salmon might not raise a huge risk of escape (especially if produced on land), but we know the consequences if escape happens would be very serious (because they would breed with wild salmon),” she said.

Current Canadian regulations only assess the food and environmental safety of commercializing GMOs, Sharratt said.

“There’s an assumption (if GMOs are deemed safe) that it’s all beneficial or the market will sort it out,” she said. “But when it comes to contamination the market can’t sort that issue out.”

If a GMO is not approved by a country there is zero tolerance for its presence.

That’s why Canola Council of Canada members voluntarily agree not to commercialize canolas with new GM traits until Canada’s major canola customers approve them.

The report notes one way to prevent escaped GM traits from undermining markets and trade is for countries to approve their presence at low levels — a policy Canada is pushing. But the quid pro quo is allowing small amounts of GMOs from other countries to be present without Health Canada first approving it as safe for human consumption.

Sharratt disputed CBAN, a network of 16 organizations, including Green Peace, the National Farmers Union and No More GMOs, is anti-GM.

“I would say we’re critical and we’re interested in a very robust debate about the use of the technology in food and farming… ” she said.

“It’s evident from 20 years where we have documented these incidents there’s a lot that can go wrong with the release of these organisms or the experimentation of these organisms. We think there needs to be stronger regulation and that includes an assessment of the contamination risk and inclusion of the potential economic impacts and that would include consultation with farmers.”

Terminator Technology tempting

One way to reduce the risk of GM traits escaping is to adopt Genetic Use Restriction Technologies (GURTs) — a.k.a. the terminator gene.

GURTs describe a range of technologies to genetically modify plants to produce sterile seeds at harvest.

The CBAN report says while it sounds good in theory, the reality is biological systems are not foolproof.

“If Terminator Technology is accepted as a containment strategy, it will facilitate the development and introduction of particularly dangerous GMOs (to produce pharmaceuticals or industrial chemicals),” the report warns.

“GURTs are complex systems involving multiple inserted genes that work together in a sequence. Scientists warn that the technology will not be 100 per cent effective and that the likelihood of system failure means it could never be a reliable tool for biocontainment.”

There is a global moratorium at the UN Convention on Biological Diversity on field testing or commercializing such technologies, however, GURTs continue to be discussed as a tool to stop GM escape, the report says.",Canadian GMO escapes common: report,Manitoba Cooperator,https://www.manitobacooperator.ca/crops/better-regulations-needed-to-prevent-contamination-from-gmos/

The woman who said this year that her goal was to be the happiest player on the course was thrilled about the first two.

“I still can’t believe,” Ko said. “I’m really happy.”

She wasn’t all that excited about the No. 1 spot in the world.

“I just try to focus on my game on the course,” Ko said. “It doesn’t matter about world ranking. I don’t like numbers like No. 1 or No. 2. I’m just playing on the course.”

She did that better than anyone else over four days on the Mission Hills course made more difficult by thicker rough, tighter fairways and some longer holes. On Sunday, the 23-year-old South Korean closed with a 2-under 70 in hot and mostly calm conditions for a three-stroke victory over Mi Hyang Lee.

“If ball goes right or left it doesn’t make me happy, but I’m still trying to be happy,” Ko said. “Also, I really try, don’t think about future, doesn’t matter. Just focus on my swing, on the putting. That’s why I win this week.”

After bogeys on 13 and 15 cut her lead to a stroke, Ko made a 6-foot birdie putt on the par-4 16th and closed with a 15-foot birdie putt on the par-5 18th. She also had a rough back-nine stretch Saturday, allowing In-Kyung Kim to cut a five-stroke deficit to a single shot going into the final round.

“Yesterday was a little bit hard for me,” Ko said. “I’m not robot. We are human.”

Ko won for the fourth time on the LPGA Tour, completing a desert sweep after taking the Founders Cup two weeks ago in Phoenix. She leads the money list and has five top-three finishes in six events this year.

Is she surprised by her start?

“No, no, no,” Ko said. “I had really hard practice in winter training off-season in Palm Springs.”

Ko gave caddie David Brooker his third victory in the event. The Englishman also leaped into Poppie’s Pond with Grace Park in 2004 and Lorena Ochoa in 2008.

“He knows this course,” Ko said. “He helps me all the time on the course. So really say thank you for my caddie.”

She finished at 10-under 278.

Lee parred the final six holes in a 70.

“This is really good momentum for me,” said Lee, also from South Korea. “I’m so happy with this week.”

Ko had a three-stroke lead at the turn and faced little pressure until stumbling with the two bogeys. Her drive on the par-4 13th jumped into the thick right rough and her long approach ended up short of the green in the left rough. After missing a 12-foot birdie putt on the par-3 14th, she hit into the left greenside bunker on the par-4 15th and missed a 12-foot par try.

“I had couple miss shot, but I think it will be fine,” she said.

It was.

Lexi Thompson was third at 6 under after a 67.

“My caddie, Benji (Thompson), helped out tremendously,” Thompson said. “I was getting down a little bit, but he just kept me right in there playing aggressively the whole day – making those birdies and just firing at every pin I could.”

Kim closed with a 74 to tie for fourth at 5 under with Carlota Ciganda. The 30-year-old South Korean lost a chance to win the event seven years after missing a 14-inch putt on the final hole of regulation and losing on the first hole of a playoff.

Kim declined to comment after the round.

Ciganda finished with a 68.

He's been charged with using a green-technology startup to fuel a $37 million fraud scheme. His investors say they have poured $200 million into ventures based on false claims. They say he mismanaged funds and used company assets to pay his personal debts.

But federal fraud charges and allegations of malfeasance were not enough wrest control of Advanced Green Innovations from Arizona developer Ken Losch.

Investors lost a bid to force the company into receivership as part of restructuring plan they said is the ""only clear path"" to recovering money from more than 1,000 people in several countries.

A Phoenix arbitrator ruled Losch can continue running the company because the criminal charges against him relate to conduct that occurred five years ago.

""The criminal indictment against Mr. Losch alleges no current mismanagement ... only acts constituting wire fraud during 2013,"" Shawn Aiken wrote in an April 2 decision.

Aiken also said if the government was concerned what impact the criminal charges would have on the company's current operations, then federal regulators would have called for a receiver.

For more stories that matter, subscribe to azcentral.com.

""But the government has not done so,"" he said in the decision. ""Apparently the government has not sought an injunction against the respondents (Losch) in the last five years.""

In interviews, investors called the decision mind-boggling. They said it ignored their allegations of recent financial mismanagement by Losch and the diversion of company funds for his personal use. On Wednesday, a group of investors challenged the ruling in court.

Company's future hinges on court fight

""I have no idea what the arbitrator was thinking,"" said Chris Haver, an equity investor who spearheaded efforts to force out Losch. ""It was almost like he was looking for a reason not to appoint a receiver.""

Haver, who was one of the first two investors in Advanced Green Innovations, said he and a group of friends and business associates put more than $60 million into the company. He said the arbitrator went to great lengths to give Losch the benefit of the doubt.

""Ken Losch was indicted on 17 counts of fraud by the U.S. Attorney's Office,"" Haver said. ""The arbitrator asked how the indictment would affect his ability to run the company .... Are you kidding me?""

Losch could not be reached for comment. He pleaded not guilty in March to 17 charges of wire fraud and denied bilking investors out of $37 million between 2013 and 2014.

Attorneys for Losch, AGI and his related companies did not respond to interview requests Wednesday.

In a series of motions filed in Maricopa County Superior Court, investors said they discovered in January that Losch had cut deals to use profits from the green company to pay for debts of his real estate development company Trillium Residential.

In other words, they said, Losch was signing away future profits from the green company to pay bills for unrelated real estate deals without the knowledge of investors.

""Losch had pledged the first $6,804,959 of revenues ... to a prior lender of Losch's to reimburse that lender for losses it had incurred with Losch on real estate projects preceding the formation of (Advanced Green Innovations),"" according to the motion.

Investors alleged Losch cut a similar deal for another arm of AGI, promising to give lenders ""a preferred distribution plus 10% for any and all losses incurred by lender from its prior financing of ... Trillium Deer Valley, Trillium Papago and Trillium North.""

Investors also accused Losch last year of diverting millions of dollars from AGI to a company called Cochise Investments that he alone controlled. They said Losch is paying himself $40,000 a month in compensation.

In court filings, Losch denied any wrongdoing.

Feds lay out details of green-fuel scam

Losch was indicted more than three years after agents of a federal Financial Crimes Task Force raided AGI's offices in Phoenix and Chandler.

Federal authorities said Losch sold investors on a revolutionary plan to convert semitruck engines to natural gas from regular fuel. They said he brought investors on tours of laboratories, gave them demonstrations of prototype fuel injectors and updated them on vehicle tests at the Yuma Proving Ground.

It was all a sham, authorities said: The technology Losch touted didn't exist; the lab equipment was a prop; the demonstrations were faked; and the road tests never happened.

Court documents and investors indicate the fraud charges represent a fraction of the $200 million investors have poured into AGI since 2009.

Federal authorities said AGI took in more than $133 million from investors without producing a marketable product. The company operated several subsidiaries, including ZHRO Solutions, ZHRO Power, H2 Energy and TDC Injectors.

The indictment focuses almost exclusively on ZHRO Solutions. ZHRO was supposed to develop fuel-injection technology that could be sold as kits to consumers for converting semitruck engines to run on natural gas.

The indictment said Advanced Green solicited U.S. and foreign investors to pool their money in corporations called distributors. The distributors were operated by managers who signed agreements with Advanced Green for ""the exclusive right to promote, market and sell the fuel injector product in specified geographic territories.""

By 2013, there were 40 managers representing hundreds of individual investors, according to the indictment.

AGI engineers told Losch at the time it would take about two years to develop a stationary diesel engine that could run on natural gas — and even longer to put one in an actual semitruck.

Despite the engineers' estimates, Losch told investors they would have a fully commercialized fuel-injector product by Dec. 15, 2013, according to the indictment.

""Losch told engineers working on the fuel injector product that they were prohibited from communicating with AGI business development personnel or having direct contact with investors and potential investors,"" the indictment said.

Are there assets worth saving?

Investors say the company has at least one piece of working technology with the ability to generate revenue, and it has nothing to do with fuel injectors.

Instead, it relates to a device that captures ""flare gas"" discharge from oil drills and converts it to methane. The methane is sold to generate alternative power than can be used to run engines.

In the their court motions, investors insist the receivership is needed to protect the profits from the sale of flare gas and prevent Losch from using them to pay his real estate debts.

The flare gas arm of AGI was structured similarly to ZHRO Solutions, according to investors. They said they pooled their money into regional distributorships operated by managers. Some investors said they put in $25,000. Others said they were in for $150,000 or more.

The motion to appoint a receiver describes AGI and its subsidiaries ""as deeply insolvent"" and say judgments and legal actions against Losch have rendered him judgment-proof, with little income or property that creditors can legally pursue.

""No plaintiff nor any other defrauded investor ... will ever be able to recover any further amounts he (Losch) diverts,"" the motion said.

Haver said Wednesday the way to protect all of AGI's investors is to restructure the company around the flare gas until a commercially viable fuel injector can be brought to market.

He said he is convinced the company has value, so long as Losch doesn't control it.

""I don't know how AGI can continue to raise money,"" Haver said. ""The AGI brand is so toxic. How can we go forward with Losch anywhere near the company?""

History of failed projects, violations

Losch is best known for a failed Tempe high-rise development called Centerpoint, a twin-tower condominium project that for years stood unfinished and abandoned at Sixth Street and Maple Avenue.

Construction began on the 30- and 22-story buildings in 2005. When the market crashed in 2008, Centerpoint went with it. The failed development exposed Losch and his partners to a chain of financial misery, including bankruptcy and allegations of fiscal mismanagement.

Losch, who has dual U.S. and Canadian citizenship, had faced earlier scrutiny over investments and real-estate projects.

Regulators in Canada sanctioned him in 1999 for securities violations.

Canadian Securities Administrators barred Losch's company from soliciting investments for two years and fined him $50,000 as part of a settlement agreement.

The agency said Losch's company mishandled funds from investors for apartment and condominium projects in San Diego and Phoenix.

The settlement noted that Losch's company ""never intended to deceive or otherwise mislead the investors and never intended to jeopardize the project,"" which was completed.

Arbitrator says key claims lack support

In his decision, Aiken said many of the claims against Losch were unsupported, including allegations he ""continues to treat AGI as his personal piggy bank.""

Losch, in court filings, denied being insolvent and maintained the company continues operating without issue and financial transactions were properly accounted.

Aiken pointed to AGI's assertion that ZHRO Solutions generated $5.7 million in 2018 and ""continues to work toward the commercialization of the injector technology,"" which is in ""the process of design verification.""

Aiken said Losch has agreed to a plan that removes him from day-to-day management of AGI, making the appointment of a receiver redundant.

""The appointment of a receiver in the teeth of that plan to remove Mr. Losch from daily operations (and install a management committee) makes little sense,"" he said.

The fight for a receiver is an offshoot of a 2016 lawsuit Losch filed against two original AGI shareholders.

Roy McAlister, who is the inventor and patent holder of key AGI technologies, and Richard Otto own a combined 49 percent stake in the company.

Losch, in his lawsuit, accused McAlister and Otto of jeopardizing the company's ability to raise capital. He demanded they relinquish their stakes. The pair fought back, sparking an expensive legal battle.

Enter Haver. About 18 months ago Haver said he became convinced Losch was going to bankrupt the company and the only way to stop him was by helping McAlister and Otto. He agreed to pay for their legal costs.

McAlister and Otto used their positions in the company to oppose Losch and sued to put the company in receivership. Several motions were filed under seal and are not available to the public.

Aiken, in his ruling, questioned if he had the authority to appoint a receiver under Nevada law, where AGI was officially formed. But he said the key issue was whether McAlister and Otto could prove Losch posed a danger to the company.

""Here, in any case, the question becomes what threat to (AGI's) ongoing business operations claimants have shown."" Aiken wrote, adding: ""In addition to the doubtful legal authority, and the questionable substantive grounds, the question is what would the receiver accomplish?""

Several producers told two parliamentary committees Tuesday that China’s recent rejection of Canadian canola-seed shipments is only the latest trade disruption that’s hurt the country’s agriculture sector.

Watch below: Some videos from Global News’ coverage of obstacles facing canola producers in Canada.

They reminded MPs in Ottawa about a number of major trade obstacles faced by Canadian agricultural exporters in faraway markets like India, Italy, Vietnam and Saudi Arabia.

“Canada can feed the world but not if our government does not act strongly on our behalf, removing non-tariff trade barriers, enforcing existing trade agreements and removing political roadblocks,” Alberta canola farmer Stephen Vandervalk told the House of Commons agriculture committee.

Citing concerns about pests, China has rejected canola-seed imports from Canada and has suspended the licences of two major Canadian exporters.

The moves to cut off the critical Canadian export have been widely viewed as China applying economic pressure on Canada in response to the December arrest of senior Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver at the behest of the United States.

Any extended canola dispute with China, which imported $2.7 billion worth of canola seed from Canada last year, would deliver a painful economic blow to producers, the supply chain and the wider Canadian economy.

The price of canola has fallen since the dispute started last month. The late-winter timing of the disruption has been particularly difficult because it’s forced many farmers to suddenly rethink the planting decisions vital to their businesses.

On Tuesday, producers made it clear to MPs at the committees that even with the urgency around the China conflict, the pain is not only about canola. Canadian farmers, they said, are staring at other big trade hurdles in world markets.

Several of the witnesses mentioned issues that have affected Canada’s durum wheat exports to Italy, wheat sales to Vietnam, pulse exports to India and feed-barley shipments to Saudi Arabia.

Saskatchewan grain farmer Mehgin Reynolds (who is seeking a Conservative party nomination) told MPs that, for instance, her four-year crop rotation includes lentils, barley, canola and durum wheat — all products that face obstacles on foreign markets.

“The frightening reality is that almost every crop being grown in Canada is currently struggling with one trade barrier or another,” Reynolds said.

The Liberal government has insisted it wants to find a scientific solution to the canola dispute, in keeping with China’s insistence that the problem is tainted seeds.

The Liberals have established a working group that includes officials from Richardson International Ltd. and Viterra Inc. — the two exporters that have had their licences to sell canola revoked by China — and representatives from the governments of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau has requested to send a delegation of experts to China to examine the issue. She’s said officials are exploring options to support farmers by expanding existing programs.

Canola producer Mark Kaun told the committee it’s time for the Canadian government to start playing “hardball.”

“There’s a pile of imports that come into this country from China — and maybe some of their ships should sit and wait in the water,” Kaun said. “Canadian canola is contaminated — it’s contaminated with political dirt and bureaucracy.”

“This is a political issue plain and simple. Political problems need political solutions,” agreed Vandervalk, who’s also vice-president representing Alberta with the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association.

“If we must play the game of grain inspections, so be it. But in the meantime Canadian grain farmers are the ones paying the price for the political failings.”",Farmers call for strong political response to expanding trade obstacles for Canada,Global News,https://globalnews.ca/news/5148957/canola-farmers-demand-political-response-april-2019-china-canada/

OTTAWA -- Rob Nicholson, the longest-serving Conservative member of Parliament, isn't running for re-election in the fall.

Nicholson, who was first elected in 1984 in Niagara Falls and held cabinet posts for more than a decade, says it's time for him to focus on his family.

The 66-year-old has spent 24 years as an MP under three Conservative prime ministers, beginning in the government of Brian Mulroney.

Nicholson won his riding six times, first in 1984 and again in 1988, 2004, 2008, 2011 and 2015, with a stint in local politics in the 1990s.

From 2006 until 2015, he was appointed by then prime minister Stephen Harper to several cabinet portfolios, including justice, defence and foreign affairs.

But Nicholson says one of his most memorable positions was that of parliamentary secretary to the justice minister earlier in his career, when he helped pass legislation making it illegal to possess child pornography.

""It was something that I believed was the right thing to do and it was in line with what was taking place in the world,"" the married father of three told reporters Wednesday as he entered the weekly Conservative caucus meeting in Ottawa.

""I believe it was the last piece of legislation of the Mulroney government, but I never forget how proud I was.""

Nicholson was appointed in January to the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians, which serves as a high-level review body for the country's security and intelligence agencies.

While he hasn't said what he will do after departing federal politics, Nicholson said he will do what he can to ensure Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is elected in October to govern the country.",Former Harper cabinet minister Rob Nicholson hanging up his federal political hat,CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/former-harper-cabinet-minister-rob-nicholson-hanging-up-his-federal-political-hat-1.4373850

Refugee advocates ... changes to Canada's asylum provisions is just a crass political move; it will come into force months before an election ...","The Liberal caucus would have had a collective aneurysm just few months ago if a senior political opponent had talked about ""asylum-shopping"" when referring to refugees who cross illegally into Canada. The implication, they'd cry, is that those risking their lives to seek refuge in Canada are simply economic migrants — not families desperate to find a safe place to call home.

The reality, of course, is that while many migrants might genuinely see Canada as the only safe place for them in North America — and perhaps that's true — many who have crossed into Canada at unofficial entry points have not met the criteria for refugee protection, for various reasons. Slightly more than half of finalized refugee claims from these applicants were rejected in the last quarter of 2018.

The situation is hardly straightforward; Canada has been forced to balance its humanitarian commitment to refugee resettlement with the practical limitations of a system unprepared for the recent wave of migrants.

The system has been under enormous strain, with asylum-seekers waiting up to two years for just a hearing. And the integrity of the process itself has been under intense pressure, based partly on the impression that migrants crossing into Canada illegally are using a ""loophole"" in the Safe Third Country agreement to qualify for a hearing, when they otherwise would have just been sent back to the U.S.

The situation is thus a fraught and messy one, which unquestionably makes it deserving of criticism and careful analysis. Yet that is something the Liberals have been fiercely intolerant of the past three and a half years.

Border Security Minister Bill Blair has defended the government's sudden overhaul of asylum laws as a measure to prevent ""asylum-shopping."" (Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press)

Back in July, Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen called the Ontario government's concerns about so-called queue-jumping ""un-Canadian."" During an end-of-year interview, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the Conservatives were trying to stoke fears over refugee claimants. In late January, the prime minister responded to a town hall question about Canada's migration policies with a diatribe lamenting ""the politics of division.""

And yet now, a few months later, Border Security Minister Bill Blair has defended the government's sudden overhaul of asylum laws as a measure to prevent ""asylum-shopping."" This language, apparently, is now tolerable.

Buried in this year's omnibus budget implementation bill is a series of amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act that essentially disqualify asylum-seekers who have made a claim for refugee protection in any other country. Once the bill receives royal assent, an asylum-seeker can be deported without a hearing, which would seem to violate the Charter as affirmed by Singh v. Canada, where the Supreme Court determined that Charter rights extend to everyone physically on Canadian soil.

Many Canadians will nevertheless welcome the Liberals' unexpected about-face on asylum-seekers. Two-thirds of respondents to an Angus Reid poll published back in August thought the border situation had reached a crisis point. More than half said that Canada was too generous toward asylum-seekers who cross into Canada illegally. A more recent Ipsos poll found that 47 per cent of respondents believe most migrants aren't actual refugees — they just want to come to Canada for its economic benefits. Perhaps Blair has that summary on his desk.

What's noteworthy about the timing of the planned changes is that the number of asylum-seekers crossing into Canada at unofficial points of entry is actually on the decline. In 2018, 1,517 people were intercepted by the RCMP crossing into Canada during the month of January. A year later, that number dropped to 888 for the same month. In 2018, 1,565 people crossed illegally into Canada in February. A year later, for the same month, the total was 808. Numbers haven't been that low since June 2017.

The number of asylum-seekers crossing into Canada at unofficial points of entry is on the decline: the RCMP intercepted 888 people during the month of January 2019, and 808 in February 2019, compared to 1,517 and 1,565, respectively, the previous year. (Charles Krupa/The Associated Press)

This is all to say — as if there was any doubt — that the Trudeau government's decision to enact sweeping changes to Canada's asylum provisions is just a crass political move; it will come into force months before an election, when illegal border crossing is actually on the decline, and right onside with public opinion in favour of toughening up asylum laws.

Tabling a stand-alone bill on changes to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act — as one would reasonably expect of policy changes of such enormous importance as Canada's treatment of vulnerable people fleeing persecution — would take too long, and be subject to debate and revisions and multiple readings and so forth.

By using an omnibus bill (something the Liberals vowed they would never do), these changes can go into effect right away, eliminating a potentially defining wedge issue. Sure, it is potentially unconstitutional, but that can and will be sorted out later.

Three and a half years is not a long time to go from ""Sunny Ways"" and 25,000 Syrian refugees to deportations without hearings and unconstitutional amendments. This type of realpolitik (on the backs of refugees, of all people) is the sort of soulless strategizing we're supposed to expect of the other guys — the ones who talk about ""queue-jumpers"" and Canadian values and shopping around for places to seek asylum. But without the sun lighting the way, it's hard to tell everyone apart.

“I think the Queen just might be eating babies. Fuck, there’s all kind of circumstantial evidence that states she’s a Satan worshipping cannibal, which is kind of fucked up and weird isn’t it? I never did trust authority but I would’ve never bet on it being this weird.”

Murray Acton aka “The Cretin” is as an anti-authoritarian punk-rock anarchist and frontman of Canadian hardcore-punk outfit Dayglo Abortions. For nearly 40 years, Acton and his band of misfits from Victoria, B.C. have caused controversy all around the globe with their “fuck you” attitude and groovy heavy-rock riffs, garnering worldwide acclaim in the underground punk and hardcore scene.

The band’s highest selling record to date, Feed Us A Fetus, showcases former president of the United States Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan sitting at a table with a cooked fetus on a dinner plate. Their following record, Here Today, Guano Tomorrow, saw the band encounter obscenity charges from an Ontario police officer, who found great offense in his teenage daughter listening to tracks like “Fuck My Shit Stinks” and “Fuck Satan to Death” plastered alongside the image of a hamster brutalized by gunshot. The charges were dropped in in 1990 and Dayglo Abortions released their next album, Two Dogs Fucking, in 1991. The artwork is exactly as it sounds. Their latest album, 2016’s Armageddon Survival Guide, originally held a much different title that would have definitely landed them a date in court.

“Originally that was supposed to be out in 2012. This album was supposed to be called Kill Stephen Harper,” Acton says. “They really didn’t like it because it was provoking people to sue us again. I was gonna start a Stephen Harper popularity fund where we have this thing on Facebook that says ‘Would you pledge $5000 dollars to have Stephen Harper assassinated?’ and a thermometer would go up. Obviously that thing was gonna hit the roof in no time, eh.”

Though the album’s title changed, Acton still got a dig in on Harper with the song “Canadian Hate-Triot” where the frontman yells obscenities at our former Prime Minister, calling him a corporate whore and towel-boy for the global elite.

Acton isn’t too pleased with our current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau either. He calls Trudeau a “Fuckin’ elitist slob” who is “Just like his father. A fuckin’ lawyer looking out for himself and his corporate cronies.”

“He’s never come through with anything,” Acton says. “He makes like he’s gonna come clean with the aboriginals and stuff like that, and fuckin’ nothing. It was all just campaign smoke. The guy is full of shit and he’s ruined fuckin’ marijuana. I’m fuckin’ pissed about that. One of my favourite things to do and he’s fuckin ruined it.”

Acton admits that the upcoming Canadian elections are making him nervous. He doesn’t plan to vote for either the Liberals or Conservatives and will most likely cast his ballot for the Green Party. Acton usually votes Green regardless, but there’s a lingering fear of what this election could bring if Conservative leader Andrew Scheer becomes our PM.

“We could end up with a fuckin’ right wing nut bar want to be like Trump character the way things are going.”

The past U.S. election gave Acton a flurry of new material, and he says a new Dayglo Abortions album is written, and ready to record.

“It’s gonna raise a few eyebrows,” Acton concludes. “It’s not particularly politically correct, but I’ve never been politically correct anyways. I don’t go out of my way to hurt people’s feelings or anything like that, but sometimes you gotta hurt a few feelings just to get the job done, ya know? It’s like trolling in real life.”

In conclusion, Acton can forget about all of this when he’s on stage. He assures the band is tighter than they have ever been, and urges anyone who hasn’t seen the band to check them out at SBC on April 12.",B.C.

In the Canadian political context, which has been dominated by coverage on the SNC-Lavalin controversy, Ms. MacCharles said she isn’t convinced that ...","Journalists can do more to appeal to the so-called “exhausted majority,” those who are ideologically flexible, amid this sense of increased political polarization, says a Toronto Star journalist.

“It is an option to try to define issues in such a way that we can speak beyond the black and white of stories and find commonalities and nuances … There’s space for us to do that job,” said Tonda MacCharles, a longtime Parliament Hill reporter, who spoke at political journalism panel, “The Fight for Truth,” hosted in Ottawa by the Canadian Journalism Foundation. Ms. MacCharles referenced a study, “Hidden Tribes,” which found that two out of three Americans are not as inflexible and divided on issues such as immigration as the dominant political discourse may suggest.

She spoke alongside Sarah Kendzior, a St. Louis, Mo.-based political commentator and co-host of the podcast Gaslit Nation, and Vassy Kapelos, host of CBC’s Power and Politics, in a discussion on how social media has changed the political climate, challenges political journalists face in digging for the truth, and trust in the media.

Ms. MacCharles said there’s a “hunger” for stories grounded in fact-based analysis, context, and perspective that can cut through the polarization that often characterizes the discourse on social media. “Journalists have to strive harder to support their analysis with facts. It’s very easy to get caught up in something that’s hot at the moment,” she added. “It’s important for us to put things in perspective.”

Ms. Kendzior agreed that in between this bitter divide with the left and right, there’s an exhausted majority in the U.S. that is “fed up” with the erosion of norms and threats to the rule of law, but is “not fed up with the facts.”

Digging for facts is made even more challenging, she said, when dealing with the Trump administration, which is at war with the facts and has dispensed with the long-running tradition of holding daily press briefings. “It’s challenging for access if you’re not willing to toe the party line,” Ms. Kendzior said.

In the Canadian political context, which has been dominated by coverage on the SNC-Lavalin controversy, Ms. MacCharles said she isn’t convinced that journalists have been able to dig up all the facts. She said it was somewhat “jarring” to hear someone in a position of power, like the former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould (Vancouver Granville, B.C.), use the phrase “speak my truth” in testifying on her allegations that she endured political pressure to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. “It’s like when Trump says fake news. It’s an attempt, I find, to frame what the facts are,” Ms. MacCharles said.

When there are competing narratives of an issue and that phrase is invoked, Ms. Kapelos, it’s hard to “disprove” her version of the facts.

Covering elections

With another vote looming for both Canada and the U.S., the panellists said journalists have an opportunity—as with every election cycle—to assess their coverage.

There should be less emphasis on horse-race politics and the personalities of political contenders, more coverage on policy and systemic issues, Ms. Kendzior said. “Reporters feel comfortable retreating in horse-race politics, polling data because they don’t want to look at things collapsing around them. They don’t want to look at systemic problems that are really painful evidence of decline. They’d rather say so and so is polling this way,” she said, noting there’s not enough coverage of threats to the democratic process, such as issues around election integrity. “It’s a lot more difficult [ground] to cover.”

Ms. Kapelos pushed back against the notion that journalists have ignored those issues, saying that part of her job is to report on the polls—to give people a “snapshot in time” of the horse race—and to look at other issues. “It’s not mutually exclusive. We can cover both the horse race and structural issues,” she said.

While he praised the move to send a technical delegation to China ...","Canola producers, including two Saskatchewan growers, appeared before the federal agriculture committee Tuesday to call on the federal government to do more to address its ongoing trade dispute with China.

Since China issued non-compliance orders on three major Canadian canola exporters, the price of canola has dropped significantly. With seeding around the corner, many growers are concerned about the status of one of their most profitable crops.

China has argued there are quality and pest concerns with Canadian exports. Canadian officials refute this, and many have suggested the move to block canola was made as retaliation to Canada’s decision to arrest a high-ranking Huawei official who is a Chinese national at the direction of the United States.

But it’s not just China that growers are concerned with. Over and over again, the committee heard from producers that the dispute with China already exacerbates issues seen in disagreements with Saudi Arabia, India and Italy impacting pulses and wheat.

“If canola was the only commodity we grew that was facing a trade barrier … we would be able to bunker down and take a few years of lower prices,” said Megz Reynolds, who farms on a family operation in southwest Sask.

“The frightening reality is almost ever crop being grown in Canada is dealing with one trade barrier or another.”

Reynolds said she stood beside a farmer at a local Co-op recently, and he was cancelling 160 acres of canola. If he wanted to keep his oilseed rotation it would be flax or mustard that would go down this year. But those crops are more niche markets, and the risk is those prices will suddenly drop as farmers scramble to find an alternative to canola to grow.

The producers who testified Tuesday all emphasized one point — that it’s incredibly difficult at this point in the year to think about changing what crop they plant. For some, seed has already been purchased, for as much as $500 or $600 per bag. Farmers also plant in a rotation, and canola is important to maintaining that rotation, which keeps the soil healthy.

For others, a difficult fall meant other seed crops are unavailable due to poor germination.

“It’s fine if one or two farmers change their decisions, but if the whole province all of sudden doesn’t want to grow canola, now there’s a shortage of … whatever else,” explained Mark Kaun, a third-generation farmer and authorized seed cleaner and grader.

“It’s really hard to change your rotations. If there’s no seed, you’re stuck.”

Kaun also explained that the cost also comes in a loss of profit from last year. Some grain from 2018 is still in the bin. The refusal from China to take Canadian canola seeds has pushed the price down, costing producers tens of thousands of dollars.

This information isn’t new to members of the agriculture committee. They’ve heard from politicians, officials, industry groups and now producers about how vital it is to resolve the trade dispute. What they wanted to know Tuesday is what steps growers want them to take.

For many of the farmers who spoke Tuesday, topics of international trade are beyond their level of expertise.

“We don’t have the answers,” one farmer told the committee. We’re here to grow the crop. It’s your job to ensure markets are open.”

But at least one producer who spoke Tuesday does have some experience on the topic.

Terry Youzwa farms near Nipawin. He’s a past chair of the Canadian Canola Council and formed part of a trade mission to China in 2014.

One of his frustrations is that lessons of the past have seemingly been forgotten as the canola crisis has worsened.

“Actions have consequences,” he said. “A lack of action … allows the problem to fester, grow and exacerbate. Trade relationships must be nurtured constantly to maintain functionality and predictability. We rely on our national organization and our federal government to constantly act on our behalf to keep trade functioning in a proper, predictable manner.”

He cited China, India, Saudi Arabia and Italy as examples of trading relationships that have suddenly gone sour.

“Even getting the CTPP agreed upon was more challenging than it needed to be,” he said.

Part of the issue, Youzwa argued, is lack of political pressure. He criticized the move to leave the ambassador to China position empty since January. While he praised the move to send a technical delegation to China to discuss what the nation says is a quality issue with the canola seeds, he is also calling for politicians to get involved.

“We can learn from experience,” he said. “There have been concerns before. I would suggest high-level negotiations are required. Strive to obtain a working arrangement immediately with a timeline to resolve this matter. We are overdue for a high-level political meeting to discuss what is ongoing and how to resolve it.”

He suggested that happen at the ministerial level.

He also urged the government to use its team of “world-class negotiators” to engage with the Chinese market.

‘China is a vital market,” he said. ‘They like and need our product. I am urging you to take actions on two fronts. One technical, and one political. Time is precious and our future and the economy of our nation is at stake.”",Producers call for political solution to Chinese canola blockade,Prince Albert Daily Herald,http://paherald.sk.ca/2019/04/09/producers-call-for-political-solution-to-chinese-canola-blockade/

Paradoxically, Google’s exit from political advertising shows the new law is working. It was put in ...","Google pulled out of political advertising in Canada because of a new law. The lesson is that governing online platforms is hard but necessary.

What happens when government tries to govern big tech? For Canada, the answer is that big tech packs up and leaves. Google recently announced it was going to ban political ads ahead of the next federal election because it could not comply with new legislation designed to bring greater scrutiny to online advertising by creating a political ad registry. Understanding who is advertising and how exactly they’re operating brings greater transparency and integrity to the electoral system, and might prevent the influence of malicious players.

This reaction by Google matters for Canada and for the rest of the world because online advertising is part of the numerous policy challenges involving big tech on the horizon.

Canada, like many countries, is trying to improve election advertising online by requiring better reporting and archiving. The Elections Modernization Act (Bill C-76) requires companies to create political ad registries. Ads must be added to the registry immediately, providing some real-time monitoring during elections. Hopefully, the registry enables journalists, researchers and government to understand what ads run during an election. Oversight ensures only legitimate actors are advertising and doing so within spending limits.

A registry also has the potential to expose platform-based micro-targeting, where candidates can run tens or hundreds of thousands of ads generated instantly using algorithms. The ads are custom-designed to appeal to specific voters and to manipulate their behaviour. While many are calling for this practice to be banned outright during elections, at the very least it should be made wholly transparent.

The law is not onerous. It requires all online platforms (defined as any website or app with 3 million monthly English users, 1 million French users, or 100,000 in another language) to keep a registry of election and partisan ads starting a year before the election and keeping them online for two years afterwards. The penalties are $2,000 for each inadvertent violation and $5,000 to $100,000 for each intentional violation or circumvention.

Bill C-76 is an important preliminary step in the direction of accountability and transparency in the horrendously opaque world of ad tech. It applies only to ads placed through a platform’s official channels – sidestepping paid amplification by bots, influencer marketing or paying staffers to build organic audience. Nor does it improve transparency around targeting or deceptive disclosure about who’s paying for the ads.

Google’s decision to pull political advertising tells us three things about the nascent space of platform governance.

Governing the Internet can work

Advertising companies, social-media platforms, civil society and governments largely want the Internet to help, not hinder, elections, and some collaboration toward this end is emerging. Bill C-76 was the product of public and stakeholder engagement designed to find a way forward. Months of evidence gathering, consultations (of which we were a part) and debate went into the bill, including inviting representatives from Google and other technology companies to offer their perspective. The result was a series of reforms to Canadian election laws and a package of initiatives to guard against digital threats to the integrity of elections.

Paradoxically, Google’s exit from political advertising shows the new law is working. It was put in place to address the total lack of information available to the public about online political ads. Whether a company complies with the law or pulls its services, the goal of the public policy is ultimately served. For example, to sell a granola bar in Canada, certain nutritional information has to show up on the label. If a company finds it too challenging to get an accurate calorie count, it does not have to sell its bars in Canada. In this case, the social harm that the government identified was mitigated. Google’s response shows that the threat of regulation can change behaviour.

Google’s exit might also have unintended benefits for the Canadian ad market. If Google can’t place political ads while maintaining sufficient transparency and accountability, someone else can step up to the plate. Google’s exit creates opportunities for other advertisers to take up its substantial share of advertising dollars. More compliant companies could enter the market and offer online political advertising that is less opaque, is more accountable and ultimately better aligned with Canada’s democracy. This could be alternative advertising companies or perhaps a return to news content being flanked by traditional elections advertising as journalism outlets work to scoop up advertising dollars.

Self-regulating is insufficient

No matter the upside, Google’s exit flags a substantial problem with the self-regulatory approach many platform companies have advocated for. One argument, for example, goes like this: Platforms are the ones that know best the technical structure of their tools and they should be allowed to ensure their tools are not harming people and their democracies.

Google might have picked the market exit strategy because it genuinely cannot technically come up with a compliant registry in time. We find that surprising. There is no doubt that the new Canadian law is imperfect, but Google is likely capable of building a world-class searchable registry of political ads. One would assume a search-engine giant would be capable. And the risks are low. The institution tasked with enforcing the law, Elections Canada, would likely be happy for Google to make any effort in greater transparency, even if there are flaws along the way.

Fixing advertising has vexed Google before. Google stopped running ads about the Irish referendum on abortion. In order to tackle potential cases of fraud and exploitation, it has also banned targeted advertising related to opioid rehab centers and to cryptocurrencies. Overall, it might simply be easier for Google to exit markets than admit that it has trouble coping with bad actors. In other words, Google might have created an advertising system that, by design, is not sufficiently transparent, accountable or good at sorting out quality information. These are attributes that are crucial for democratic systems.

Even if we accept Google’s argument that it would be too challenging to create the registry Canadian law requires, banning all Canadian political advertising from its platform seems equally difficult. In order to ban political advertising completely, Google needs to be able to identify the ads. If political ads show up on Google’s platform, which political actors of some sort will most certainly attempt, Google is still responsible for dealing with them. Either Google will have to take them down or change its mind about the ad registry in order to comply with the new laws. It is unclear how it plans to do this.

Governing platforms is going to be hard

Canada is a canary in the coal mine for the rest of the world trying to govern big tech. If Google leaves a market for an issue as small and relatively straightforward as a political advertising registry, how can we expect it to fix the even bigger challenges ahead? How will it react if governments regulate artificial intelligence, democratize smart cities, modernize their competition policies, tax the platform economy, or bring in new data privacy laws?

Google’s exit is also a warning about the limits of state power. For global platforms, it might be cheaper to exit the country than comply with its laws. This leaves Canada and other smaller markets with limited national solutions. The Canadian experience shows us it is indeed possible for governments to govern platforms, that we must move swiftly and definitively away from the notion of self-governance, and that countries, civil society and good-faith companies are going to need to find international solutions to the problems of technology and human rights.

We were testifying on behalf of PSAC member companies, offering their views on Bill C-69, which would enact the Impact Assessment Act and the Canadian Energy Regulator Act, as well as amend the Navigation Protection Act and a number of other acts.

In short, Bill C-69 is the federal government’s attempt to impose new “environmental assessment” measures on Canada’s resource sector.

It has been widely criticized as likely to further delay and discourage investment in Canadian pipelines, mines and other resource infrastructure. Its green agenda threatens to trump economic considerations, while adding new layers of bureaucracy, higher costs, longer delays and more uncertainty on Canada’s resource sector.

We felt it necessary to reiterate to the committee the issues of deep concern that had come to the fore in our assessment of the bill’s likely impact.

We pointed out that what began in 2014 as a downturn due to low commodity prices, a situation outside of the control of a federal or provincial government, has escalated into a dramatic flight of capital from Canada in response to factors that are within the control of governments.

These include competitiveness, regulatory uncertainty, the tanker moratorium, the clean fuel standard, methane emissions reduction regulations, carbon taxes and, finally, Bill C-69. At a time when investors are looking for regulatory certainty and firm timelines, Bill C-69 in its current form threatens the opposite. Canada will continue to sacrifice billions of dollars of economic prosperity and growth, even as jobs continue their flight to other countries.

One of the biggest problems with Bill C-69 is that it would give the federal environment minister added discretionary power on deciding whether a project goes ahead.

This politicization of the process has been roundly criticized by numerous commentators, including the four Atlantic premiers (including three Liberals), who told the prime minister that Bill C-69 in its current form “will not meet the dual objectives of environmental protection and economic growth.”

They went on to say that a particular concern is that the bill “places final decision-making power in the hands of the minister or governor in council and provides the opportunity to veto the results of thorough scientific assessment and review of evidence.”

What is new to the debate now is a key lesson from the ongoing SNC-Lavalin saga.

In that regard, we reminded the committee that one purpose of administrative law is to take political decisions out of the hands of politicians and place it in the hands of subject experts. That’s what we seek: subject experts able to move the process forward in an objective manner.

Legislators have the key responsibility of establishing the parameters for such quasi-judicial administrative bodies to exercise their authority. They then need to stand out of the way.

The problem with politicizing the process is that it will lead to lobbying by other ministers, MPs, and others with agendas. The clear danger is that issues of national interest may be forced to take a back seat to those of political interest.

Our advice to the committee? If you don’t want the Prime Minister’s Office, or ministers, or others exercising undue pressure upon an individual minister, then take away that possibility. The process must not be politicized.

Let’s take to heart what Prime Minister Justin Trudeau himself has said about the SNC-Lavalin affair:

“We will stand up and defend and create jobs, and we will always defend our institutions and rule of law.”

By all means, create new and better institutions and laws as they deal with resource development, but then stand out of the way and let them work to restore investor confidence and bring back those jobs for Canadians.

Yes, them. Born between 1980 and 2000, millennials are frequently described as lazy, self-centred, unfocused and lacking in basic life and workplace skills. They have been blamed for “killing” everything from bar soap to credit cards to Hooters to golf to dating to car ownership.

These much-maligned “kids” are also potentially the biggest voting bloc, accounting for 35 per cent of eligible voters. Yet right now, they are almost voiceless in parliament and legislatures, and nowhere are they so remarkably unrepresented as in British Columbia.

It’s important to acknowledge the less-remarked-upon things that have shaped this generation. They are better educated than previous generations, which has saddled them with debt that piled up because of higher tuition costs.

Many have had trouble finding jobs because they graduated during a global recession and a period of stagnant wages. They’re making do by living with parents longer and delaying having children. Those with jobs work harder than previous generations because most families need two incomes to keep roofs over their heads and food on the table.

Not since the return of Second World War veterans have young Canadians faced such a difficult housing market. Affordable rental housing is scarce, and home ownership is mostly beyond their reach, even for two working professionals.

Necessity has downsized dreams of home ownership to high-rise apartments from single-family houses with yards. Even then, home ownership often depends on having access to the Bank of Mom and Dad and/or Childcare by Grandma and Grandpa.

When the oldest millennials were born, the average house price was about six times the annual average salary, or just under $204,000 in 2016 dollars, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association. By 2016, the national average price was nearly $507,000, or 14.8 times average annual wages. In Metro Vancouver, the average house costs $1.4 million.

More than any generation since the advent of Old Age Security and the Canada Pension Plan, the millennials need to influence public policy for themselves and their children.

But to make a difference, they’ve got to find time to get involved with politics, which they have largely been loathe to do.

They are barely present in federal and provincial governments, according to a survey of 1,100 elected officials done by the Forum for Millennial Leadership. Justin Trudeau’s Liberals were big beneficiaries of millennials’ support in 2015. But only nine per cent of his cabinet and 11 per cent of his caucus were born after 1980.

Trudeau’s own cohort, Generation Xers, rule. While they are less than a third of the population, they account for 69 per cent of the cabinet jobs and hold 51 per cent of the seats.

B.C. millennials are startlingly scarce, given their population numbers. Only one of B.C.’s 42 members of parliament is a millennial, and only seven per cent of MLAs. All of the MLAs born after 1980 are New Democrats.

Taking time out for politics is tough for any generation, let alone one that is in its prime family-forming and career-building years. Federal politics is especially taxing for British Columbians because it means thousands of hours spent on airplanes and constant jetlag during the parliamentary sessions.

But as women have learned through the ages, if you’re not at the table, neither are the issues that affect you most.

For further proof, look south where Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is one of the most visible and vocal voices of her generation. At 29, she is fearlessly helping redefine political debate, including around climate change. She is doing it even though American millennials are even less likely to vote than Canadians. Only 31 per cent voted in the key 2018 midterm election, and 51 per cent voted in the 2016 presidential election.

In Canada, 57 per cent voted in the last federal election in millennials’ best showing so far. Still, they lagged every other age group, most notably baby boomers. Nearly 80 per cent of those aged 65 to 74 voted, as did roughly 75 per cent of the 55- to 64-year-olds.

Still, Trudeau’s Liberals played to them and won, even if they haven’t lived up to all of their promises. In the most recent budget, they made it clear millennials mattered by including an intergenerational analysis for the first time. They claimed that younger Canadians got nearly twice the benefits of older Canadians.

Economist Paul Kershaw disputes that, arguing that the government didn’t properly account for old-age security and health transfers. Had it done so, younger Canadians would have got only a quarter of the budget benefits, with older Canadians taking the lion’s share.

Conspicuously missing were greater investments in child care, parental leave, supports for post-secondary and housing.

“This pattern is consistent with four decades of Canadian public finance, which has seen Canadian governments grow social spending for our aging population at four times the pace of investment for younger generations,” Kershaw wrote on his blog.

But unless millennials get involved in politics from grassroots grunt work to standing for election, governments will continue to so. And if millennials don’t like things now, they might want to consider what some scientists are predicting: with technological advances, they may be the first generation never to die.

Norman’s lawyers are in pre ...,"MV Asterix is now operating with HMCS Regina in Middle Eastern waters as part of a Canadian-led coalition task force.

The Asterix, a commercial ship converted by Davie shipyards in Quebec and leased to the federal government to perform a military supply role, has been going almost non-stop since it was launched. It has refueled both Canadian and allied warships.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said there is no need for a second such interim supply ship and the head of the Royal Canadian Navy, Vice Admiral Ron Lloyd, says he is happy with having the Asterix as the force’s only supply ship until 2023 when the first of two Joint Support Ships, to be built at Seaspan in Vancouver, is expected to be ready.

Davie, however, has offered to convert a second such ship, MV Obelix, to the same capabilities of Asterix and lease it to the government.

At one point the navy had three of its own supply ships supporting its vessels.

Information recently tabled in Parliament indicates that even though Asterix has been going full-tilt over the last year, there was still a requirement for Canadian warships to receive fuel and provisions from supply vessels operated by foreign navies or for Canadian ships to head to port to receive fuel and supplies.

Here are the details from Parliament:

The Asterix is also at the heart of federal government’s case against Vice Admiral Mark Norman. Norman has been accused by the RCMP of warning Davie that Liberal cabinet ministers wanted to derail the Asterix project.

That development leaked out to the news media and the resulting embarrassment was one of the factors that forced the Liberal government to back down on its plans and Asterix proceeded. Norman has denied any wrongdoing.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had twice predicted that Norman would eventually wind up in court, prompting concerns of political interference and concerns the Liberal government is punishing the officer.

Norman’s lawyers are in pre-trial trying to get documents they argue are needed so the officer can defend himself. Norman’s trial is scheduled for August.",The case for a second interim supply ship?

350,Entertainment,2019-04-11T15:01:00.0000000Z,"Staring a generation of political wilderness in the face, May took a look at her twice-battered rump of a party and spoke a few home truths at its annual convention. “There’s a lot we need to ...","Given the current morass of Brexit, it’s hard to remember that Theresa May was once an agent of change inside the British Conservative Party.

First elected in the Labour landslide of 1997, May took over as chair of her party in the summer of 2002, in the wake of a second electoral drubbing by Labour’s Tony Blair, the then-young and clued-in purveyor of “Cool Britannia.”

Staring a generation of political wilderness in the face, May took a look at her twice-battered rump of a party and spoke a few home truths at its annual convention.

“There’s a lot we need to do in this party of ours,” May urged. “Our base is too narrow and so, occasionally, are our sympathies. You know what some people call us – the Nasty Party.”

And while May’s analysis went down like a cup of cold sick in the room, the message was eventually taken to heart. David Cameron’s leadership largely succeeded in repositioning the party as pro-environment, pro-minority and pro-moderate. Well, until Brexit anyway.

Which brings us to the question at hand: Who is the Conservative Party of Canada’s Theresa May? Who will bravely pipe up about the need to widen a base that, while uber-reliable, isn’t exactly trending in the direction of modern Canada?

The answer should be Andrew Scheer, but the Tory leader has been slow off his mark on questions of nastiness since becoming leader. Every time Scheer can’t say “Muslim” in the wake of a slaughter, or finds himself at the same events as Faith Goldy, or leads the charge against meaningless UN migration compacts, a little piece of the accessible vote dies. The Tory leader always looks like he would rather be somewhere else when placed in the middle of a difficult conversation.

This discomfort is what happens when the primary concern is keeping your natives from getting restless. At some point, however, Scheer will have to treat his party membership as a foundation instead of a roof. There are only 250,000 or so CPC members, compared with the roughly 5.5 million people who voted Conservative in 2015, which itself is still a long way from the nearly seven million who voted for Justin Trudeau. Speaking to that delta population of 1.5 million ought to be a priority.

Who will bravely pipe up about the Tories’ need to widen a base that, while uber-reliable, isn’t exactly trending in the direction of modern Canada?

But how to broaden the coalition is the discussion the Conservative Party ducked in its last leadership race by limiting the contest to the slim and unrepresentative segment of society already in possession of a party membership card. And it’s the discussion the Conservative Party will want to avoid at the very moment Justin Trudeau is running the gauntlet on SNC-Lavalin. But the party needs to tackle the question head-on before the country goes to the polls this autumn.

The pressures are two-fold.

On the one hand, we have Maxime Bernier – i.e. the man who lost to Scheer by a margin so thin Trudeau would feel comfortable hanging his latest SNC defence on it – courting the nativist elements of the Conservative Party’s support. And on the other, we have a wounded and desperate Trudeau and his Liberal Party who will be searching for every bit of white nationalist hate they can scrape off the internet to affix to Scheer. The Tory leader needs to move before they can tar him.

Yes, Bernier will be condescending and shameless in response. And yes, the Liberal tactics will be pathetic and desperate. But their criticism will be pushing on an open door.

Stephen Harper and Peter MacKay created the Conservative Party of Canada in the wake of Theresa May’s “nasty party” speech and quickly set about their own plan to make sure the label didn’t stick in Canada.

Harper quickly ruled out revisiting abortion. A gay marriage vote was brought forward when it was certain to lose. Immigrant communities were courted and celebrated. The government then did its job so well it received two more mandates. The nastiness label was traded in for competence.

But by the end of the third go-round, the nastiness had soaked back in and become the narrative. Snitch lines, burqa bans and relentless political attacks were then rebuffed by sunny ways. There’s a reason Trudeau still uses Harper as his favourite curse word: it sells.

The proxy issues for nastiness at the moment are white nationalism and climate. Scheer needs to be unequivocal in his condemnation of the former and much more detailed in his policy toward the latter. He needs to tell people like Ezra Levant to jog on and tell people like Michael Chong to come forward. And, while he’s at it, he should ban his MPs from calling people a piece of poo emoji on Twitter.

Because SNC is the gift that forces Trudeau into nasty. Scheer should counter with his own version of sunny ways.

Alex Wilner, a terrorism expert at Carleton University in Ottawa and the lead author of the report published this week, by the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, said it examines the phenomenon of Canadians joining and supporting terrorist organizations and militant movements associated with ISIS, Al-Qaeda, and other similar groups.

Wilner, who teaches International Affairs at the Norman Paterson School of International Affairs (NPSIA), said he and his assistant, Irfan Yar, developed a dataset of Canadian Islamist radicalization in order to provide a detailed sketch of Canadian jihadists and their supporters spanning a decade between 2006 and 2017.

Using open sources – media, government and academic reports – Wilner and Yar were able to find 95 such individuals with ties to Canada.

Uniquely Canadian jihadists?

They also examined existing literature and data on European and U.S. radicalization and compared it to Canadian findings.

“What we found was that the Canadians, generally speaking, are older, they’re more educated, they have less criminal motivation before the radicalization process, they’re more ethnically diverse than their European and American counterparts,” Wilner said.

“I think there is enough evidence there to suggest that there is a Canadian type or a larger Canadian biographical characteristic that informed this process that is distinct from the European and American models.”

The average age of Canadian jihadists identified by the study was 27, he said.

“When you compare that to the average age of many European cases, it’s quite a few years older,” Wilner said.

“And in terms of enrollment in post-secondary education, over half of our dataset had some enrollment in post-secondary education, including within CEGEP or university studies and graduate studies.”

A chance for rehabilitation?

The fact that Canadian extremist foreign travellers and foreign fighters are older augurs well for attempts to de-radicalize and rehabilitate them upon their return to Canada, Wilner said.

“There is corroborating evidence in terrorism studies suggesting that motivation in political violence wanes as you get older,” Wilner said. “It’s very much a young person’s activity, not exclusively but often it is.”

The flip side of that coin is that because these Canadian jihadists are older and better educated than their European counterparts, they are also well-suited to assume leadership positions in the global jihadist movement, Wilner acknowledged.

“We know that Canadians have been leaders in certain very dramatic, very damaging terrorist attacks,” he said.

“But all in all, the data would suggest that by and large there is at least potential for an opening for a very unique and a very Canadian-oriented repatriation and rehabilitation process that would be distinct from Belgian or German or American case because we have a Canadian narrative in this phenomenon and you would assume that our response should also have this Canadian lens to it.”","Canadian jihadists are distinct from other Islamist radicals, study finds",rcinet,http://www.rcinet.ca/en/2019/04/10/canadian-jihadists-are-distinct-from-other-islamist-radicals-study-finds/

OTTAWA – Rob Nicholson, the longest-serving Conservative member of Parliament, isn’t running for re-election in the fall.

Nicholson, who was first elected in 1984 in Niagara Falls and held cabinet posts for more than a decade, says it’s time for him to focus on his family.

The 66-year-old has spent 24 years as an MP under three Conservative prime ministers, beginning in the government of Brian Mulroney.

Nicholson won his riding six times, first in 1984 and again in 1988, 2004, 2008, 2011 and 2015, with a stint in local politics in the 1990s.

From 2006 until 2015, he was appointed by then prime minister Stephen Harper to several cabinet portfolios, including justice, defence and foreign affairs.

But Nicholson says one of his most memorable positions was that of parliamentary secretary to the justice minister earlier in his career, when he helped pass legislation making it illegal to possess child pornography.

“It was something that I believed was the right thing to do and it was in line with what was taking place in the world,” the married father of three told reporters Wednesday as he entered the weekly Conservative caucus meeting in Ottawa.

“I believe it was the last piece of legislation of the Mulroney government, but I never forget how proud I was.”

Nicholson was appointed in January to the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians, which serves as a high-level review body for the country’s security and intelligence agencies.

While he hasn’t said what he will do after departing federal politics, Nicholson said he will do what he can to ensure Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is elected in October to govern the country.

Regional cable giants Shaw ...,"Canadian wireless operators spent $3.47 billion on blocks of airwaves needed to power next-generation 5G networks, spending more than analysts expected in a spectrum auction structured so smaller providers such as Freedom Mobile and Videotron didn’t have to compete against the Big Three.

Innovation, Science and Economic Development released Wednesday the auction results for the 600 MHz band, an important frequency that penetrates buildings and works well in rural areas. Twelve qualified bidders went through 54 rounds of bidding over 18 business days before the government awarded 104 licences to nine participants.

In an interview, ISED Minister Navdeep Bains said the regional players did well in the auction.

“That’s really important because where there’s strong regional competition, Canadians pay one third less on their cellphone bills,” Bains said.

“From our perspective, we were able to achieve the goal of seeing more regional competition and more regional players.”

Rogers Communications Inc. dominated the auction, winning 52 licences in every province and territory for $1.725 billion.

“This spectrum is vital to the deployment of 5G in Canada and we are well positioned to bring the very best of 5G to Canadians,” Rogers chief executive Joe Natale said in a statement.

Telus Corp. spent $931 million on 12 licences.

BCE Inc., Canada’s largest telecommunications provider, did not win a single licence.

In a news release, Bell said it decided not to buy any 600 MHz spectrum because it already has enough in other bands.

“Given the supply of other low-band spectrum that Bell already possesses, 600 MHz is not required for Bell to deliver broadband 4G and 5G services,” Bell stated, adding its main peers in the U.S. also didn’t buy 600 MHz licences in the U.S. auction.

The Big Three were banned from bidding on three out of seven spectrum blocks (43 per cent), which were set aside for players with less than 10 per cent of the national market share in an attempt to spark competition.

We were able to achieve the goal of seeing more regional competition and more regional players

In the set aside competition, Shaw Communications Inc. and Quebecor Inc. won roughly the same amount of licences as Telus but for less. Shaw’s Freedom paid $492 million for 11 licences and Quebecor’s Videotron won 10 licences for $256 million.

Different licences have different value based on geographic location and the population they cover so it’s difficult to compare them outright. However, Rogers spent approximately $1.71 MHz per person in a coverage area, Telus spent $2.35 MHz/pop, Videotron spent $0.99 and Freedom spent $0.78.

Other winners included Iristel Inc., which serves the North under the brand Ice Wireless, Bragg Communications Inc., which is based in the Maritimes and operates as Eastlink, SaskTel, TBayTel and Xplornet. SSi Micro Ltd. and Novus Technologies were qualified bidders but did not win any licences.

Analysts had expected wireless operators to collectively spend about $3 billion on the airwaves, which are not seen to be as important for 5G as the 3500 MHz spectrum slated for auction in 2020 or 2021.

Analysts expected only moderate competition between the Big Three given the international preference for 3500 MHz and precedent from the U.S. In the American 600 MHz auction, AT&T spent about US$1 billion on spectrum while Verizon and Sprint sat out.

The Big Three already have 700 MHz spectrum, so “presumably now require less incremental spectrum,” Desjardins analyst Maher Yaghi noted to clients in his 2019 preview.

Plus, Verizon’s former CFO said the 600 and 700 bands “don’t play well together,” Yaghi noted.

Still, spectrum is critical for mobile providers. Both Freedom and Videotron got their start after the 2008 spectrum auction that set aside 40 per cent for startups thanks to a political push for more wireless competition. Regional cable giants Shaw and Quebecor eventually purchased the new entrants.

RBC analyst Drew McReynolds’ original forecast predicted the Big Three would spend roughly the same in the auction (about $750 million each). But he “would not read too much into BCE’s surprising lack of 600 Mhz spectrum or Rogers’ greater than expected cash outlay,” McReynolds wrote in a note to clients Wednesday.

It’s important to consider their existing spectrum portfolio, the upcoming 3500 MHz auction in 2020 and potential differences in approach to 5G architecture, he noted.",Canadian wireless operators spend $3.5B in 5G spectrum auction; Rogers buys most as Bell sits out,Calgary Herald,https://calgaryherald.com/telecom/canadian-wireless-operators-spend-3-5b-in-5g-spectrum-auction-rogers-buys-most-as-bell-sits-out/wcm/376e5073-4020-4dad-8340-b5658ec0ad81

Levine remains underweight on the sector — one that he said is ripe with political issues that are stopping him for now from investing any further.","A massive 87 per cent rally in Canadian crude oil prices since the end of 2018 has not been enough to convince skeptical investors to re-enter the challenging energy sector, leaving a few stocks trading below liquidation values.

Investors have traditionally used a rise in Western Canadian Select as a sign it is time to jump into domestic oil companies because a rally in the commodity usually results in a rally for the whole sector, according to Ninepoint Partners senior portfolio manager Eric Nuttall.

While most of Canada’s major energy stocks have rallied since the end of December, they are barely outpacing the TSX, suggesting that the bulk of their improvement can be attributed to the marketwide recovery as a whole. Suncor Energy Inc., Encana Corp. and Enbridge Inc. have each gained between 15 and 16 per cent in the new year, while the S&P/TSX Composite Index has seen a 14 per cent increase. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., meanwhile is up 18 per cent.

Other major names such as Imperial Oil Ltd., which is up eight per cent, and Husky Energy Inc., down one per cent, are lagging far behind.

“I’ve been invested in Western-Canadian-Select-exposed names all year, much to my extreme frustration, and the lack of participation has truly been bewildering,” Nuttall said. “When the underlying commodity doubles and the stocks up until recently have done nothing is a real source of frustration.”

Western Canadian Select prices have climbed back above $55 from a historic low of $13.27 in November, Nutall said, due to the production cuts put in place by Alberta Premier Rachel Notley and falling global output due to friction with Saudi Arabia and sanctions on Iran and Venezuela.

And yet there are no buyers at the moment for Canadian energy stocks, said Nuttall, who added that that’s reflected by trading volumes hovering at 70-80 per cent of their average levels.

The inability of energy stocks to gain any significant upward momentum has left some names trading at a discount to their liquidation values, Nuttall said, focusing on two in particular: Baytex Energy Corp. and Crescent Point. Baytex’s share price has only increased by two per cent since Dec. 31 and closed Tuesday at $2.45. Crescent Point has been one of the more successful names in the sector and is up 21 per cent in 2019, closing Tuesday at $5.02.

The lack of pipeline approval is still the great unknown

If both increased by 100 per cent, they would only be trading at five time their enterprise value and at a 13 per cent free cash flow yield, Nutall said. By historical standards, both would still be “incredibly inexpensive” even after doubling, said Nuttall, adding that he’s investing in both.

Norman Levine, managing director of Portfolio Management Corporation, said his firm has been invested in Suncor long-term but when oil prices began to take off, it was the cheap valuations in Canada that tempted them to invest in a second name: Cenovus Energy Inc. The stock is up 32 per cent in 2019, closing Tuesday at $12.73, but is still another 16 per cent climb away from reaching its 52-week high.

Even after investing in Cenovus, Levine remains underweight on the sector — one that he said is ripe with political issues that are stopping him for now from investing any further.

“The lack of pipeline approval is still the great unknown,” Levine said. “In the energy patch, Canada is not open for business and that’s why valuations have remained cheap.”

Without clarity, the failure to build pipelines that would allow for more crude to be shipped out of Alberta will continue to hang over the heads of potential energy investors, according to Matt Murphy, an analyst for Houston-based energy investment firm Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.

That’s made the rally in both Western Canadian Select and the U.S.’ West Texas Intermediate insignificant to skeptical investors because they’re unwilling to ascribe current oil prices into the value of energy stocks, he said. That’s particularly true of the small cap names in the sector, he said, as there’s a valuation gap between those producers and a company like Canadian Natural Resources. If a stock was trading at six times earnings a year ago, the market may only be willing to give it a multiple of five today, despite the oil boom.

Murphy is skeptical himself. It’s difficult for him to see Western Canadian Select prices maintaining their current levels and a tight differential to its U.S. counterpart outside the short-term.

“If you normalize for let’s say … a Canadian differential investors are willing to underwrite, perhaps it doesn’t make them look as attractive as spot pricing would suggest,” Murphy said. “The signals haven’t aligned to say it’s time to put capital to work in Canada.”",Investors staying away from energy stocks despite Canadian oil's huge rally,Calgary Herald,https://calgaryherald.com/investing/investors-staying-away-from-energy-stocks-despite-canadian-oils-huge-rally/wcm/9f0be0d4-26e3-4b61-b3a7-da1829819f20

As trauma surgeon at a downtown Toronto hospital, she sees them up close, toiling elbow-deep on the front lines of torn human flesh.

article continues below

But when she spoke out in favor of tighter gun control in Canada, a chorus of voices told her to pipe down: She wasn't qualified to comment - not on this.

An upstart Canadian gun group urged its members to file complaints about Ahmed to a professional board. And she was told on Twitter to ""stay in your lane"" - a slogan the U.S.-based National Rifle Association has aimed at American doctors.

""We were shocked by the ferocity of the response,"" she said.

The exchange says much about where the Canadian gun debate is heading.

Canada is often cast as a foil for the United States, a place separate and distinct, untouched by the social and political currents swirling to the south. That's increased since the election of Donald Trump.

But on guns, Canada is in many ways moving toward its larger neighbor, and away from its peaceful, prosperous Commonwealth peers Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

Though the United States remains an outlier among developed nations on gun violence and gun laws, the American debate is shaping the way Canadians think and talk about the issue.

Watching mass shootings in the United States and seeing the response of the American medical community helped inspire Ahmed and her colleagues to form Canadian Doctors for Protection from Guns.

The group that confronted them for speaking out is called the Canadian Coalition for Firearm Rights. The name is striking: In Canada, unlike the United States, there is no constitutional ""right"" to guns.

""New groups are using the language of rights in an effort to move talk toward talking about 'gun rights,' "" said Blake Brown, a historian at Saint Mary's University in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

Brown is the author of ""Arming and Disarming: A History of Gun Control in Canada."" In the past, he said, Canadians who supported private gun ownership didn't want to be seen as anything like American groups. Now, some are adopting NRA tactics and taglines.

The NRA didn't respond to a request for comment.

Rod Giltaca, theexecutive director of the Canadian Coalition for Firearm Rights, denied a direct link to the American group. He called the use of NRA hashtags ""an accident,"" but was proud to tout his group's assertive social media strategy.

""We are a public relations organization,"" he said.

Pro-gun groups say restrictions don't work because criminals won't obey them - an argument familiar to the American gun debate. Some argue that hunting is central to Canadian culture.

The Toronto doctors hope to shape the conversation, albeit in different ways. They're focused on guns and public health.

""This is an opportunity to inform the public discourse,"" Ahmed said.

Canada's gun debate is changing in part because Canadians are hearing a lot more about guns.

The country has restricted ownership of handguns and automatic weapons since the 1930s. The rules were expanded to include rifles and shotguns after a 1989 mass shooting in Montreal.

But more recent efforts to control gun access, including a bill currently up for debate in Parliament, have drawn substantial pushback, and the conversation has become uncharacteristically polarized.

Ahmed and her colleagues at St. Michael's Hospital, like many Canadians, have watched in horror as the United States was hit by shooting after shooting, from Columbine to Sandy Hook to Las Vegas to Parkland.

But while Canada was watching gun violence in the United States, it was becoming more common at home.

When Ahmed was a resident in the 1990s, young doctors in training would rush to the emergency room to watch gunshot wounds get treated because they were rare.

Now they're less novel. Firearm-related violent crime in Canada has increased 42 percent since 2013, according to Statistics Canada.

Mass shootings here have galvanized gun-control advocates. In 2017, a Canadian man carrying a licensed weapon fired 48 shots into a Quebec City mosque, killing six. Last summer, another shooter opened fire in Toronto's trendy Danforth neighborhood, killing six and wounding more than a dozen.

For Ahmed, who treated victims of the Toronto shooting, it was a turning point.

She and her colleagues, citing a growing body of medical research that treats gun violence as a public health crisis, are now calling for a ban on handguns and assault rifles.

They want Canadians to ask why the country compares its violent crime rates to those of the United States, a country with exceptionally high gun-related mortality, rather than places where regulation is stricter and rates are relatively low.

David Gomez, a trauma and acute care surgeon at St. Michael's, says the frequently cited response of Australia to a mass shooting in 1996 is worth considering.

After 35 people were killed in a 1996 shooting in the Tasmanian town of Port Arthur, the country sharply tightened restrictions on firearms and launched a buyback program that netted hundreds of thousands of weapons.

And after a shooter killed 50 people in March at a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, the country banned military-style semiautomatic weapons and assault rifles in days.

Gomez said Canada ""is 30 years away from where we could be.""

Lynn Wilson, the vice dean of the University of Toronto's faculty of medicine, co-chairs the doctor's group with Ahmed. She said comparisons with the United States have clouded the discussion in Canada.

""People were getting desensitized to all the shootings,"" she said. ""The horror happening there made people think, 'We are not so bad.' ""

Their campaign will be met with opposition from conservative lawmakers and gun groups, including the Canadian Coalition for Firearm Rights.

Duck hunters and sport shooters don't commit ""drive-by's [sic] in downtown Toronto,"" the firearm rights coalition says in a policy paper.

Gun-control advocates stress that it's not just about drive-by shootings. In Canada, as in the United States, much of the death and injuries by gun are intimate partner violence, or suicide.

Giltaca'scoalition wants to expand access to firearms. And the group wants new protections for concealed carry and shooting in self-defense - issues central to the U.S. debate.

In response to the doctors' call for a handgun ban, Giltaca posted a video on the coalition website describing how it might be enforced. He outlined a hypothetical scenario in which authorities in full military gear with ""semi-auto"" rifles come to seize weapons from Canadian homes. He warned that they might mistake a child's phone or a remote control for a gun and shoot the child ""through the neck.""

His group is not interested in hearing from doctors, whether those doctors pull bullets out of bodies, or not.

""I think they must have got talked into this and are probably thinking, 'Holy smokes, how did I get into this?' "" Giltaca said. ""But now that they are into this, this is never going to end.""

The doctors said they won't be intimidated from speaking out.

In a report released Monday, the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) said interference will likely come in the form of misinformation spread online through social media and untrustworthy websites.

""If a (news) report sounds implausible, maybe check it against a well-known Canadian news source to see if they are also reporting it,"" said Veronica Kitchen, an associate professor of political science at the University of Waterloo and Balsillie School of International Affairs.

""We still have enough good journalists in this country that they'll be reporting it.""

Canada is unlikely to see a repeat of Russia's widespread meddling during the 2016 presidential election in the United States. Instead, foreign adversaries could attempt to sway the ideas and decisions of voters in more subtle ways by focusing on polarizing social or political issues, or by promoting the popularity of one party over another, the report said.

""We recognize that foreign adversaries may use cyber technology to interfere and influence Canadians like they have done in other countries,"" Karina Gould, minister of democratic institutions, said in a news release that accompanied the report. Cyberattacks against elections in advanced democracies have increased threefold since the last federal election in 2015.

Voters are now the single largest target of cyber threat activity during elections, the report found, meaning voters need digital literacy skills to spot false or misleading information, Kitchen said.

""We should be skeptical of information, but deciding which information to be skeptical of is the challenge,"" Kitchen said.

The CSE believes voters will be the primary target because it's easier to change the mind of voters than it is to change the outcome of the election itself, especially with Canada's paper ballot system.

In a report issued this week, Al Mussell, research lead at Agri-Food Economic Systems in Guelph, Ont., noted that an outbreak of African Swine Fever (ASF) in China is also disrupting the global meat supply.

“We’re in uncharted waters,” Mussell said. “We’ve never had a structural bull market in agricultural products led by the protein complex, while at the same time experiencing an opposite trend in oilseed.”

Generic lean hog futures have shot up 40 per cent since the beginning of March as a result of the outbreak, one that could wipe out seven million sows according to Rabobank estimates cited by Mussell.

“There’s not enough meat in the world to fill the Chinese pork shortage that’s coming this year,” Mussell said, predicting that the demand for all kinds of meat would rise as a result.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency says ASF is a highly contagious viral disease of domestic and wild pigs. It causes high death rates in infected pigs and can infect swine herds in various ways. There is no treatment.

Mussell said that swine populations in other countries, including Canada, are at risk of infection and that the disease has already spread to Vietnam, Russia and some Eastern European and African countries.

There’s not enough meat in the world to fill the Chinese pork shortage that’s coming this year Al Mussell

According to a Bloomberg News report, China may increase U.S. pork imports to a record 300,000 metric tonnes in 2019 as part of a commitment to increase American farm imports to resolve the trade war – 81 per cent more than the 166,000 tons in 2017.

But Pan Chenjun, an analyst at Rabobank International in Hong Kong, noted that increased U.S. pork imports alone would not be enough to offset China’s shortage.

“All protein imports may rise,” as a result, she told Bloomberg.

Ray Price, president of Sunterra Farms in Acme, Alberta, is worried about ASF.

“The biggest risk is people bringing meat into Canada,” he said. “But we have a very high standard of health and biosecurity in this country.”

While the swine flu outbreak poses risks, high pork prices could also create an opportunity Mussell said, and bring about investment in pork production in China and Canada.

“This is an incredible earning opportunity for hog producers and processors,” he said.

That comes in contrast to the potential bear market in oil seeds.

On March 22, the Chinese Government placed a ban on all Canadian canola imports, with both Viterra Inc. and James Richardson International having their canola importing permits suspended for unspecified reasons.

According to the Canola Council, Canada produces 18 million tonnes annually — 10 per cent of which is exported. Approximately 40 per cent of Canadian exports go to China.

Mussell said farmers will need to rotate to different crops.

“This would increase the supply of wheat and other grains at a time when China is drawing down its supply of rice, which will lower the demand for imported feed grains.”

Jay Schultz, co-owner of a 7,000-acre Alberta grain farm, said the Canadian grain sector is in for a rough ride.

“Normally markets are driven by fundamentals, charts, supply and demand — now it might be politics,” he said.

“Right now, we should be locking in new crop pricing for harvest,” he said. “And we haven’t signed futures contracts for next year yet – something we normally do.”

Schultz explained that many farmers have already purchased seed, equipment and chemicals.

“It’s hard to change at this point,” he said.

Mussell’s assessment of the 2019 growing season was in line with Schultz’s.

“Farmers are getting their machines ready for seeding,” he said. “But how are they supposed to know what seeds to plant? What should they expect for fall prices? Who is buying?”

Canadian Government Reneges on Promise to Create Independent Human Rights Watchdog for Corporations Operating Abroad

It is clear that Canada needs an ombudsperson to help prevent Canadian complicity in corporate abuse and help ensure Canadian mining and garment supply chains respect human rights.

by Stacey Gomez





Ottawa, ON / Tatamagouche, NS / Guatemala City (April 8, 2019) - The government of Canada failed today to appoint an independent Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise (CORE) with real powers to investigate abuses and redress the harm caused by Canadian companies operating abroad.

Since 2004, Breaking the Silence Maritimes-Guatemala Solidarity Network (BTS) has been providing human rights accompaniment to communities in Guatemala experiencing grave human rights abuses associated with Canadian mining projects. For years, BTS members throughout the Maritimes have joined calls by the Canadian Network on Corporate Accountability for the creation of an effective Ombudsperson for the extractive sector.

Canadian companies operating overseas have been associated with widespread and egregious human rights abuses. In Guatemala alone, Canadian mining companies such as Hudbay Minerals, Goldcorp, and Tahoe Resources (now Pan American Silver) have been denounced in Guatemala, Canada and internationally for grave human rights abuses committed around their projects, including murder, threats, intimidation, gang rape, contamination and scarcity of water. In fact, this week marks the 5th anniversary of the murder of Topacio Reynoso Pacheco, a 16-year-old vocal opponent of the Escobal Mine, now owned by Pan American Silver. Her case remains in impunity to this day.

Fifteen months ago, the government announced that it would create an independent office with the power to investigate. Instead, it unveiled a powerless advisory post, little different from what has already existed for years. It is clear that Canada needs an ombudsperson to help prevent Canadian complicity in corporate abuse and help ensure Canadian mining and garment supply chains respect human rights.

“From our work in Guatemala, we see that human rights abuses associated with Canadian mining are actually are the norm, in contrast to what was shared by the new Ombudsperson at today’s press conference,” said Lisa Rankin, BTS Guatemala Coordinator. Rankin pointed to a 2017 report by the Justice and Corporate Accountability Project which documents many troubling incidents of violence associated with Canadian mining companies in Latin America.

An ombudsperson operates at arms-length from government and has the power to order those under investigation to produce documents and testimony under oath. The advisory position created today does neither.

“Individuals and communities harmed by Canadian mining companies still have no one to turn to for help,” said Emily Dwyer of the CNCA. “An ombudsperson in name only is not an ombudsperson. It is simply more of the same approach that has already been proven empty and ineffective.” The government announced that it has commissioned a review of the options of providing the advisor with investigatory powers.

“Fifteen months into this process, news of a review is outrageous. We don’t need more studies,” added Dwyer. “We need action.”

In the last three years, at least four United Nations bodies have called on Canada to hold Canadian companies to account for their actions. As recently as June 2018, the United Nations Working Group on Business and Human Rights called for the creation of an ombudsperson’s office in Canada to help stop abuses.

“The advisory role announced today has no real powers and will not operate at arm’s length from government -free from any political or corporate interference,” said Dwyer. “The government must take decisive action to stop corporate abuse. That was the promise made in January 2018. That is the promise that must be kept.”

WINNIPEG, April 10 (MarketsFarm News) – The following is a glance at the news moving markets in Canada and globally.

– Canadian canola farmers are in Ottawa this week, calling upon the federal government to fight against agricultural trade barriers. “Canada can feed the world but not if our government does not act strongly on our behalf, removing non-tariff trade barriers, enforcing existing trade agreements and removing political roadblocks,” Alberta canola farmer Stephen Vandervalk told the House of Commons agriculture committee, according to CBC.

– Oil prices continued to hit highs as the industry reports rapidly declining inventories. Further gains were capped by doubts regarding the strength of the world economy, which the International Monetary Fund predicted will see its weakest growth this year since the financial crisis, according to Bloomberg.

– The European Union has granted British Prime Minister Theresa May a second delay for Brexit. Originally postponed to April 12, May requested the EU to defer the exit until June 30. Currently, no exit date has been agreed upon. Experts surmised that a long delay jeopardizes Brexit entirely, leaving space for a second referendum and election.

Mark Zuckerberg tells @GStephanopoulos, “setting the rules around political advertising is not a company’s job.” https://t.co/A5xuUW0FH1 pic.twitter.com/58nfs8LAZV Without delving ...","Hear that, Mark Zuckerberg? Regulation of big tech and data sites like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Twitter has been a hot topic since 2016 when Facebook troll accounts and shady online advertising became a huge factor in the American election. While the United States appears to be dragging its heels on the whole thing, a number of other countries, including Canada, have decided it’s time Facebook got some government oversight.

Canadian Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould told Buzzfeed News and the Toronto Star that they are “actively considering” regulation and that “all options are on the table.”

“We recognize that self-regulation is not yielding the results that societies are expecting these companies to deliver,” Gould said. Social media companies have been left almost entirely to their own devices since they came into existence, with the government trusting them to enforce their own codes of conduct with the public’s interests in mind. If we’ve learned anything over the past two years, it’s that these companies haven’t been doing that.

Between the data mining schemes, hate speech, radicalization, fake news stories and more going on online, it’s about time the government stepped in for the good of its citizenry.

“We are actively talking to partners around the world. We’re actively talking to experts here in Canada as well in terms of what can be done,” Gould said. “And I remain open to many different options as to how we can ensure better behaviour.”

Gould’s “partners around the world” include Australia and the U.K. in particular, which have both made legislative moves to regulate, but the Buzzfeed/Star report notes that oversight of tech and social media companies needs to be done very carefully for fear of infringing on freedom of speech — something that can be awfully and confusingly subjective.

In Russia, for example, the government passed a law last month that will slap fines on “online news outlets and users that spread ‘fake news.'” Seems like a good step toward limiting the spread of false information, but the law also applies to journalism that “disrespects” the Russian government. Now, that is censorship.

Mark Zuckerberg himself made the case for government oversight of the internet in a column for the Washington Post last week.

“I believe we need a more active role for governments and regulators,” he writes. “By updating the rules for the Internet, we can preserve what’s best about it — the freedom for people to express themselves and for entrepreneurs to build new things — while also protecting society from broader harms.”

Zuck outlines “harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability” as the four areas which need regulation.

Without delving into intent and whether this was a PR move, Zuckerberg makes a good point.

And he might actually be delivering on it with his own site. Just this week, Facebook banned six Canadian pages over its extremism and hate speech policy. Those accounts include far-right former Toronto mayoral candidate Faith Goldy, white nationalist Kevin Goudreau, alt-right group Soldiers of Odin and the Canadian Nationalist Front.

First, US President Donald Trump is an egregious human being, totally lacking in any true decency. He cares about two things: himself, money and a little bit Ivanka.



The new Attorney General William Barr has declared him ‘exonerated on all counts’; but, that is what he was hired to do. Before being hired he sent a memo to the then attorney general declaring Trump to be immune from prosecution because of his presidency.



Barr can say anything he wants until that report is released. It was set up to look only into the campaign for signs of collusion. Apparently didn’t find any, presumably because “The Boys” were too stupid and/or smart enough to lose the folder the Russian lawyer wanted to give them.



It didn’t have to go through those goofs. Trump’s daughter was vacationing with Vladimir Putin’s girlfriend at the time. Nobody made much of that.



For those who find it inexplicable that so many hate Trump there are a lot of good reasons. Not having the fortitude to keep an eye on the military and their special ops. Remember after that SEAL got killed back in the early days? Grabbing all those kids at the border? I don’t want to hear any sass about them being where they were. They approached a legal entry point and begged asylum as per American law.



These people, Trump wants to come down on mostly because they are helpless, can’t fight back. Some of those kids will never see their parents again and at least one died.



The Trump admin had no intention of ever giving them back and a White House official admitted they didn’t think anyone would care. People try to excuse him saying this was Jeff Session’s doing. But Trump is the leader, it’s up to him in the end.



Now for Venezuela and its connections to Alberta! Our dirty oil goes all the way to Corpus Christi, Texas where it meets and mingles with dirty Venezuelan oil in the Koch Brother refinery that can’t process the sweet stuff. Guess how much the Koch Brothers pay for Venezuelan oil? Nothing! I don’t think the cost of Alberta oil is going up anytime soon.



The Americans are pushing for a regime change there.



Here in Canada in 1961, President Kennedy sent one of his people north and the guy ran the Canadian election out of the US embassy’s basement. As per Kennedy’s wishes Lester Pearson was elected.



Why would he do that to us laid back Canadians? John Diefenbaker wouldn’t allow nuclear missiles into Canada.



There were people who thought we would benefit from the side effects of Trump’s booming economy. Do you think we should all sit back and wait for Trump’s crumbs and all those jobs he is creating?



Last summer I found a TYT Politics piece stating there was something wrong with the July jobs report. The number of jobs he may or may not be creating may sound awesome to a country with one tenth of the population of the US but it’s kind of wimpy there. Not to mention, many are not really good jobs – you now the kind that you can make a living at without working two of them.



Now for United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney. I read an article about him and Premier Rachel Notley. Kenney used to be with the Canadian Taxpayers Federation. One thing Wendy Mesley [some of you may not know her, she is on the CBC] did allow was that he was ‘media savvy’. She made no statements about his intellect or his ideas.



I think he got his media chops from there. They have mastered the art of the soundbite. Say nothing but say it in a way that gets people’s backs up and fade into the background. Our government is getting rotten with them.



Now, I have nothing but respect for the old-fashioned conservatives: honest, hard-working people who live their ideals. These new guys are intellectually lazy and intend to rob the system blind with little peculations like double dipping.



If you are going to steal, steal big and get out of town. Don’t hang around like a Freedom Conservative trying to find other nipples.



I haven’t met UCP candidate Pat Rehn or saw him up there on TV so I can’t say much except that his running seems to be rooted in the assumption the oil companies are more important than anything else. They are important and I am not against it.



However, the timber industry and farming and any number of other industries are just as important, as are the social issues we face.



I have an idea that I have expressed before. We need to build every person in Alberta a house. This will pull massive amounts of our resources off the world market and away from tariffs. It will wean us all off a boom and bust economy. Building houses in every riding, every fair sized town year after year … it will free up tremendous amounts of cash that would go into mortgage payments, and be a boon to those people who can manage rent every month but can’t scrape together a down payment.



There would be a limit, of course, an average of the province. If you want it prettier go to a bank. If you already have one you would get the allowance to deduct from your mortgage.



The cost will take some fancy jigging but it will actually benefit every Albertan. Such a program can be tailored to so many needs and keep us from being held hostage to outside interests.



Am I a protectionist? I don’t see why taking down our national panties for Trump will do anyone any good.



And a last word on Kenny. I texted another Alberta resident about something he had done and the reply came back, “Kenny Who?”

It is this. For God’s sakes ...,"It’s surely the question on the lips of all those “Canadians” politicians keep mentioning with such transparently insincere fondness, us normal ones who aren’t up to our eyebrows in politics or indentured since birth to one particular party and whose political allegiances are rather more flexible.

It is this.

For God’s sakes, why are those other people — the muscled-out and muzzled Jody Wilson-Raybould, the booted and betrayed Jane Philpott, the deeply confused members of Philpott’s riding association in Markham-Stouffville, Ont., — all still proclaiming themselves to be proud Liberals?

According to CBC News, 10 of 16 association board members in Philpott’s riding resigned after a meeting Monday night.

I attempted to confirm the mass resignation with Stuart Young, still as of Tuesday listed online as the chair of the Markham-Stouffville Federal Liberal Association. But, asked for a few minutes of his time, he replied, “Thank you, but no.”

Thus, we are left with the remarks of the outgoing secretary, one Leea Nutson, to the mother corp.

The resignations, said Nutson, weren’t meant as a “protest” against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, heaven’s no.

Rather, she said, the board members, all volunteers, are disheartened; they “don’t have the energy to support another candidate.”

And, Nutson said, she didn’t resign because of the SNC-Lavalin controversy. (What was that business anyway? Was there a controversy?) Rather, she said, “it’s strictly about Jane Philpott,” whom she has supported since 2015.

And, of course, Nutson told the CBC, she still plans to vote for Trudeau and the Liberals in the October election.

Ditto, of course, JWR and Philpott herself.

From the moment Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet — because of the political pressure being applied to her by the PM, the PMO, the clerk of the Privy Council and anyone else they could draft in to give SNC-Lavalin a deal so the company could avoid prosecution on bribery and fraud charges for its alleged conduct in Libya — she announced her intentions to remain a Liberal, insisting she still “fundamentally” believed Trudeau shares her vision for the country and that she supports the Liberal platform.

And when Philpott resigned as Treasury Board president — she made it crystal-clear she was bloody well resigning because she’d lost confidence in how the government dealt with SNC-Lavalin and how “it has responded to the issues raised” — she, too, pledged to continue on in the Liberal caucus and pronounced herself “firmly committed to our crucial platform priorities, especially justice for Indigenous peoples and implementing a plan to tackle the existential threat of climate change.”

Wilson-Raybould even wrote a letter to the Liberal caucus, pleading with her colleagues to let her stay.

Naturally, instead she and Philpott were smartly kicked out the caucus door last week, meaning they now sit as independent members.

The caucus didn’t actually vote on the expulsions of the two women, that decision being made unilaterally by Trudeau, albeit after alleged “consultations” with some regional chairs which gave him, he said, a sense of the “will of caucus.”

Philpott raised the issue in the House of Commons Tuesday, suggesting that the PM broke the law.

It appears that back in 2015, the Liberals didn’t bother to have the vote required by the Reform Act — brought forward by Conservative MP Michael Chong two years before — on how to deal with expulsions.

These rules lay out a clear process for expulsion — 20 per cent of the members have to write the chair requesting an expulsion vote, and a majority of the caucus, in this case 90 Liberals, has to approve it by secret ballot.

Every party caucus is required to hold four such recorded votes — on expulsion, re-admission to caucus, the election or removal of caucus chairs, leadership reviews — after each general election and report the results to the Speaker.

The underlying notion, as Philpott told the House, is that MPs are not accountable to the leader, but he or she to them.

Put another way, MPs ought to have a say in how their organization — the caucus — is run.

Philpott apparently consulted Chong before rising in the House, and he told the National Post’s Marie-Danielle Smith that she’s right on the money — that failing to have the brand-new MPs vote on their own administration in 2015 and then failing to have a vote on the JWR-Philpott expulsions are inherently illegal acts.

Speaker Geoff Regan has promised to come back with an opinion.

It is, as with much about Jane Philpott, a principled, serious and important issue. Inshallah, there will be a miracle, and the Speaker, a Liberal of course, will agree with her, and then the Liberal caucus can vote, in secret, so that the PM doesn’t get to frog-march them into giving him the result he wants.

And what then — they’d be back in the Liberal caucus, in the warm Liberal embrace? How would that in any way (aside from the principle) be a victory, I wonder, to get back to work for a prime minister whose idea of the rule of law is setting the rules and laying down the law?

Lori Sigurdson garnered 60 per cent of Edmonton-Riverview’s votes in 2015, winning the seat away from the Progressive Conservatives, before she went on to serve in Rachel Notley’s cabinet.

She’s counting on her record from the past four years to push her into a second term.

“What I’m noticing at the doors is a lot of people are thanking our government,” said Sigurdson. “Certainly we have a very strong record on supporting people with public programs.”

Looking to unseat Sigurdson in a riding that has also voted Liberal and Progressive Conservative since its creation in 1996, are candidates from the other major parties and an independent candidate.

Katherine O’Neill, the riding’s Alberta Party candidate, said Riverview’s history as a swing riding helps her chances of winning.

“We see it’s a very centrist riding where people are very fiscally conservative but also socially progressive and that’s where we sit on the spectrum,” said O’Neill. “What we hear at many doors are people feel like it’s so polarized and it’s either too left or too right and they’re not comfortable.”

UCP candidate Kara Barker hopes the riding will swing back to the blue column in 2019. She said her story of becoming a crown prosecutor after struggling as a single mother shows her drive to improve the community.

“I was hired on as a crown prosecutor where I’ve been working, serving the community for the past 10 years,” said Barker. “I’ve always been very community-oriented and focused.”

Rob Bernshaw is the only candidate not affiliated with a party. He said Albertans are sick of the parties mudslinging and want a candidate who will work with all elected officials to solve issues in the province.

“The party systems are failing Albertans. They promise at the doorstep but once they get into the legislature they have to vote the way the party tells them to vote,” said Bernshaw. “The voice of the people of the riding is lost.”

Corey MacFadden with the Alberta Independance Party said voters are simply tired of being left behind.

“We’re the only party that stands by the people for the people,” said MacFadden. “We want to bring government back to the people and allow the resources to come back to Alberta.”

Indy Randhawa with the Alberta Liberal party wants Riverview voters to know they don’t have to choose between the two main parties.

“There is another alternative out there, an alternative that doesn’t believe moving our province forward means leaving some behind. That alternative is the Alberta Liberal Party,” said Randhawa in an email.

The candidates

Kara Barker, UCP

Age: 44

Occupation: Crown prosecutor

Reason for Running: “I am running as part of the United Conservative team because I am concerned about the struggling economy, in particular the increase in crime related to record unemployment. The staggering loss of jobs hits close to home because I am concerned that my 19 year-old son will not be able to find a job in Alberta when he graduates in three years. I want him to have the same opportunity for success that I had.”

Priorities: Get Albertans back to work by pursuing policies that catalyze growth and jobs, make life better for all Albertans by boosting our economy and protecting front-line services and stand up for Alberta within the federation by unapologetically defending our economy.

Website: karabarkerucp.ca

Rob Bernshaw, Independent

Age: 66

Occupation: Customer Service/consultant

Reason for Running: “As an independent representative, not beholden to any party … I am accountable only to the constituents of Edmonton-Riverview. I believe, in working together, we can and will make Edmonton-Riverview and Alberta a better place to live, work and play. With direct representative democracy, like in the territories for over 40 years, that will be accomplished here in Alberta.”

Priorities: For the voices of Edmonton-Riverview to be heard in the Alberta legislature; jobs and the economy; sustainability of our education and healthcare system.

Website: http://www.robbernshaw.com

Corey MacFadden, Alberta Independence Party

Age: 32

Occupation: Red Seal boilermaker

Reason for Running: “I am the voice for the people by the people. For decades Albertans have been working hard, and most when times get tough have nothing to show for it. We are over-taxed and over-worked and in return destroying our family unit. I want to change that by giving more opportunity and resources to the people of Alberta. I want to strengthen the family unit and create opportunity for those next generations to come.”

Priorities: Eliminate equalization payments, carbon tax and the GST; create a $45,000 base income that is tax free, and a 20 per cent flat tax on anything earned over and above $45,000; lower business tax to 8.5 per cent and international tax to nine per cent; reduce immigration to a 3.75 per cent unemployment rate.

Katherine O’Neill, Alberta Party

Age: 44

Occupation: Business owner & writer

Reason for Running: “Alberta is at a crossroads. I care deeply about public service, protecting human rights and bringing people together to get big things done for our province again. The fighting, finger-pointing and fear-mongering needs to stop. We should immediately address our serious financial issues head on and map out an ambitious, bold and forward-thinking plan for Alberta’s next century.”

Priorities: Restore fiscal management and investor confidence in Alberta, early childhood education and health, support for seniors and long-term care.

Indy Randhawa, Alberta Liberal Party

Age: 35

Occupation: Librarian/teacher

Reason for Running: “I believe political leaders have duty to represent the interests of all constituents, not just the most wealthy and influential, and this is something I promise to do. I believe this position calls for foresight, compassion and a willingness to work closely with the community.”

Priorities: Education is the best investment our province can make. Alberta’s schools must be safe, inclusive and effectual. Services for all must take priority over tax breaks for the wealthy. Moving forward does not mean leaving anyone behind. Public health care is a hallmark of Canadian society. I oppose any sort of two-tier healthcare system.

Website: www.albertaliberal.com/indy_randhawa

Lori Sigurdson, NDP

Age: 58

Occupation: Minister of seniors and housing

Reason for Running: “As a social worker for 25 years, I was frustrated to see public programs slashed due to Alberta’s boom and bust cycle. I am a single mom who suffered from conservative governments’ program cuts, and I saw that there were Albertans who didn’t have access to the supports they deserved. We on the other hand will make decisions that bring all Albertans health, happiness and prosperity for a long time to come.”

Priorities: An inclusive Alberta. Women, men, seniors, youth and people of all colours, sexual orientations and abilities benefit from prosperity. Diversify the economy. Grow the agriculture, forestry, technology and alternative energy sectors while continuing to support oil and gas. Create mortgage-paying jobs. Invest in needed infrastructure, retraining, apprenticeships, and new sectors like artificial intelligence.

Because you loved her, Céline Dion announces even more Montreal ...","Segal’s 2019/20 season will feature rocking Greek gods, an award-winning play about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and a musical survival story set during the Holocaust.

Segal Centre unveiled its 2019/20 season Wednesday night, with artistic and executive director Lisa Rubin, along with the participating creative spirits, supplying details of the six-show season. There will also be visits from guest artists, including a legendary screen veteran talking about his prostate.

First up is The Pianist of Willesden Lane (Sept. 8 to 29), which tells the true story of Jewish pianist Lisa Jura, whose prodigious talents helped her survive the Second World War. The one-woman show is performed by Jura’s daughter Mona Golabek, herself a piano virtuoso who will be enriching her mother’s remarkable story with renditions of pieces by Bach, Beethoven, Chopin and others.

There’s a change of tempo then with the North American premiere of the new musical Mythic (Oct. 27 to Nov. 17), a modern take on Greek myth and motherhood in which various gods are represented by pop-culture celebrities. Mythic is created by Marcus Stevens and Oran Eldor and will be directed by Brian Hill, whose adaptation of Belles Soeurs: The Musical played the Segal a few years back.

Also aiming to have them rocking in the aisles is the nostalgia-filled The Times They Are a Changin’ (March 1 to 22), which celebrates the music of great Jewish musical artists of the ‘60s such as Mama Cass, Bob Dylan, Simon and Garfunkel and of course, Leonard Cohen. This concert musical stars Louise Pitre, who brought us an unforgettable Piaf last year in The Angel and the Sparrow, along with her husband and co-performer from that show, W. Joseph Matheson.

Those looking for a little island of silence between these twin bursts of pop-rock exuberance need look no further than next door in the Studio Theatre, where Caitlin Murphy will be directing Small Mouth Sounds (Feb. 9 to March 1). A new play from Bess Wohl, it tells (largely without words) the awkward and funny story of six city people on a silent retreat in the woods.

J.T. Rogers’s marvelous Tony Award-winning docudrama Oslo (April 19 to May 10) is also set in the woods, but there’s not much silence as Israeli and Palestinian representatives try to hammer out the details of the Oslo Accord peace plan famously sealed by the Rabin-Arafat handshake. Rogers’s play, (which Théâtre Jean-Duceppe presented in French last year) is a rich feast of fast-paced, deadly serious yet unexpectedly funny back and forth. Marcia Kash will direct.

Taking us into the summer of 2020 is, aptly enough, Siberian Summer (May 31 to June 21), a world premiere from Paul Van Dyck. Ellen David will direct this sunny comedy about three women-of-a-certain age travelling aboard the Trans-Siberian Railway with one of their sons. The play is partly based on an actual trip Van Dyck took with his mother and her friends.

Guest companies visiting Segal’s Studio space in the new season will include Teesri Duniya with Rahul Varma’s Counter Offense, and “verbatim theatre” company Porte Parole, who will be reprising their fascinating round-table debate piece, The Assembly, which played Espace Go last year. And make sure you’re sitting comfortably for A Man and His Prostate, a solo performance from legendary Lou Grant (and Pixar’s Up) actor, Ed Asner, which is expected to play some time in October.

Asner once performed in Neil Simon’s The Sunshine Boys, and that classic comedy is just one of the productions that will be mounted by Segal’s resident community theatre company, the Dora Wasserman Yiddish Theatre.","Pop, classical piano and din of politics resound in new Segal season",Montreal Gazette,https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/arts/pop-classical-piano-and-din-of-politics-resound-in-new-segal-season

It’s just that there has to be the political will to do it.”","The federal government is being urged by a parliamentary committee to forestall a looming shortage of pilots by addressing serious shortcomings in how flight training is financed, managed and regulated.

In a report tabled in the House of Commons on April 9, the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities cited ballooning domestic passenger traffic as part of a global trend which will require more pilots–as many as 620,000 worldwide by 2036, 80 per cent of whom have yet to be trained.

Advertisement

The committee referenced a 2018 report by the Canadian Council for Aviation and Aerospace (CCAA) which pointed out that fewer than 1,200 new commercial licences are issued annually in Canada. Moreover, “a large proportion of Canadian licences (nearly half in 2015) are issued to international students and only 70 per cent of new pilots choose to remain in the aviation industry. As such, fewer than 500 new pilots become available to the Canadian aviation industry each year.”

The CCAA predicts that Canada will be short nearly 3,000 (fixed-wing and rotary-wing) pilots by 2025, a number it says does not consider the reality that even more will be needed to address the impact of Transport Canada’s new flight and duty time rules, announced four month ago.

The parliamentary committee warned that a pilot shortage presents “significant risks” to remote communities, particularly in the North, which often rely exclusively on air transport. In addition, the Auditor General found in Fall 2018 that the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) is grappling with pilot recruitment and retention issues as opportunities in the civil market become increasingly attractive.

The committee’s study was kick-started by British Columbia Liberal MP Stephen Fuhr, a former RCAF CF-188 Hornet pilot whose Air Force career also included flight training and standards and who also chairs the Standing Committee on National Defence.

Fuhr said in a statement that Canada has lost the ability to generate the pilots it needs. “Estimates are that Canada will need 7,000 to 10,000 new pilots by 2025, resulting in a projected shortage of at least 3,000 pilots, given our current production rate,” he said. “Some of the biggest challenges to pilot production in Canada are the high cost of training for new commercial pilots, the low starting salaries, and an industry that has evolved a non-linear career path.”

His private motion for the study was approved unanimously by the House in late November and the all-party committee began working on it the next day. In eight meetings between then and late February, the committee heard from 26 organizations, companies and individuals and received 13 briefs in which the common theme was that Canada needs to strengthen flight schools’ capacity to address the looming pilot shortage.

As of last week, Transport Canada listed 360 domestic flight training units offering options ranging from recreational to multi-engine training. Of those, 175 offered commercial training up to an integrated Commercial Pilot Licence – Aeroplane/Instrument Rating (CPL(A)/IR), an 18-month course the Air Transport Association of Canada (ATAC) says costs between $75,000 and $90,000. A further 139 schools offer flight instructor ratings typically costing around $10,000.

However, even after completing the CPL(A)/IR, pilots need an Airline Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL) for employment as a regional or national airline captain. That requires 1,500 hours of flight time and three written exams; many pilots accumulate the necessary time working as instructors.

Among other things, the committee calls on the federal government to co-operate with all stakeholders to “develop policies to support and encourage” growth of the flight training sector, and to work with other levels of government to “encourage flight instruction as a career path” with incentives such as tax credits for experienced pilots and loan forgiveness programs for new graduates.

The government also is urged to co-operate on “outreach activities” to encourage military veterans, women and Indigenous people to consider aviation as a career, and to increase “economic incentives” for flight schools in remote and northern communities, including help with capital costs and loan forgiveness programs for new pilots in the North.

Other financial challenges are covered by several recommendations, one of which is that the federal government work with the other levels of government on assisting flight schools with “the high capital costs” of setting up, operating and expanding. This would be augmented by increased funding through the federal Airport Capital Assistance Program, as recommended in 2015 by a panel which reviewed the Canada Transportation Act. The federal government also is urged to:

consider a 100 per cent bonus depreciation for certain capital assets, so schools can write off equipment purchases such as simulators and training aircraft;

amend the Canada Student Loans Program to include in-air instruction time for the purpose of loan eligibility;

extend the Student Work Placement program to flight training;

extend the Veterans Affairs Canada Education and Training Benefit to flight training for employment purposes; and

establish financial assistance programs, or amend existing programs, to assist professional students with the high cost of instruction through expanded eligibility criteria which recognize the integral role of Private Pilot’s Licence training in commercial training.

Transport Canada’s role is addressed in several recommendations. Among other things, the committee recommends a review of regulatory oversight, particularly of operations which rely heavily on recent graduates. The committee further recommends that:

the hours-based flight instruction regime be “modernized;”

more competency-based training as the primary reference for completion; and

intergovernmental co-operation “where safe and appropriate” on exemptions to the requirement for third-party training of instructors.

Another potentially contentious recommendation, given that it could be regarded by other countries as “poaching,” is that Canada should “simplify and encourage immigration by foreign pilots, particularly international graduates of Canadian flight schools.”

ATAC president John McKenna–whose organization represents 44 flight training members and was one of the earliest to appear before the committee–was still working through the report but took time out to chat with Skies about his initial impressions.

“The government seems keen on developing solutions with industry and the flight training community,” he said, explaining that there had been discussions with Transport Minister Marc Garneau “on the very subject of financing and finding ways to attract youth and Indigenous people and women to aviation.”

He said ATAC would continue to work on what he sensed as “a willingness there to act” because the government has realized the “drastic” nature of a pilot shortfall.

“We recently conducted a poll ourselves amongst our people here and the biggest problems that schools have right now are a lack of instructors and a lack of equipment.”

McKenna pointed out that “a lot of . . . the equipment is older than the people flying in them” and that if Canada is serious about benefitting from the international training market, upgrades are critical. “We always get a share but we could get a lot more. We need to increase our capacity, we need to be more modern. You can’t train people in dial cockpits when everyone now is working with glass cockpits . . . so there’s an investment that’s required and everyone is aware of that. Some of these recommendations touch that, so that’s good.”

When Skies noted that the Finance Minister’s recent budget had offered little in the way of added support for the flight training sector, McKenna suggested that Garneau had been “hoping for something in there” but it obviously hadn’t materialized despite vigorous lobbying.

That initiative will continue, including a push for changes to the Income Tax Act. “There’s a lot of things that we’re working on as far as that goes,” said McKenna, pointing out that while tax write-offs are appealing, “you have to have the money to buy things before you can write them off. [And] right now, even if you get the best equipment, you can’t get instructors.”

Asked how the instructor cadre can be increased if there’s a fundamental challenge of getting more students into the training pipeline to begin with, he replied that the committee’s report had “touched” on the question.

“You’ve got to give them something,” he said. “If you’re an instructor for five years, you should either get a credit for each of the years that you’re an instructor, if you’ve had a [flight training] loan or something, or you get interest forgiveness during that period. Something! They can pay off their loans because they’ve got an extra tax credit or a subsidy because they’re an instructor.

“There are definitely ways to do it. It’s just that there has to be the political will to do it.”

They refused.

The activists had been convicted the day before under colonial-era laws against inciting a public nuisance.

The nuisance in question was the Umbrella Movement — the pro-democracy protests that took in Hong Kong's streets for more than two months in 2014.

Martin Lee, a barrister and the founder of the pro-democracy Hong Kong Democratic Party, stood alongside the movement's leaders in 2014.

He spoke with As it Happens host Carol Off about the convictions. Here is part of their conversation.



Why are your friends and fellow activists not asking for clemency?

Because they knew they offended the law. And this is what civil disobedience is all about — when you commit a breach of the law, like Gandhi and other people, waiting to be punished.

So they are quite ready to go to prison to show that they believe in our cause, and they are prepared to pay the price for it.

You'e an opposition leader. You have been part of the protests. What is it like for you to see those people punished, convicted, and not you?

I felt pain in my heart, because to see these young people — these particular nine, they are not young — but then there were earlier convictions and sentences imposed on student leaders.

They arrested me twice, but they didn't prosecute me.

But I suppose once they start to prosecute offences committed by people like me, then there will be many, many more prosecutions. I don't know whether they will stop. They now say that ... this is not the end of it.

I'm quite happy to be charged.

I feel bad because, well, I don't put so much blame on the judges as the government — because they chose to prosecute under such obscure offences.

I think what they are guilty of is ... spreading hope in Hong Kong. - Martin Lee, founder of Hong Kong's Democratic Party

But are they sending a message? Is this to chill the protests?

Oh, yeah, sure — to kill a chicken to warn the monkey, as the Chinese saying goes.

And even students within the universities have conducted protests and so on. And some of them were thrown out of university recently. So they're using all sorts of measures to make sure that dissent will not be tolerated in Hong Kong.

And all these people, when they organize this Occupy Central movement — later turned into the Umbrella Movement — I think what they are guilty of is ... spreading hope in Hong Kong when people feel so, so much in despair, and a lot of people are thinking of immigration again.

They are trying to bring back hope to the people of Hong Kong by giving them democracy, which was already promised. If the government had done its bit, there would have been democracy in Hong Kong 10 years after the handover [of Hong Kong from Britain to mainland China in 1997].

But this is now 22 years after, and still nowhere in sight.

In fact, the chief executive [Carrie Lam] recently said again and again that she is not going to pursue it.

She's not even going to try.

Is the direction for these prosecutions — these convictions — is it coming from Beijing?

The government, of course, says it isn't.

But these harsh methods [are] clearly now consistent with the policies in China.

They believe in the rule by law, and they use the law as weapons against their political enemies.

What message would you give to Canadians — to [the] Canadian government — as it pursues trade with China, as it attempts to have have a relationship with China?

I'm not against that. But they have to remember that what is not being done in Hong Kong is in clear breach of [former Chinese leader] Deng Xiaoping's ""One Country, Two Systems,"" which is to give Hong Kong people a high degree of autonomy ... meaning the legislature and judges and all that.

In 2014, the Chinese government published a white paper in seven languages claiming to have comprehensive jurisdiction over Hong Kong.

The message is when you make a deal with China, how sure are you that it will stick to it?

372,,2019-04-11T03:28:00.0000000Z,According to the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives ... decades of austerity politics under a neoliberal system ensures that the government still refuses to see the poorest people and people ...,"$760. Wow, you might think. What a score for a bedroom in a shared house in East Vancouver. Or maybe a holiday flight to Toronto. $760. If you’re the type, maybe a fancy pair of shoes?

$760 is a lot of things, and sometimes it’s a lot of money. Except when it is literally everything you have to survive on in a month.

$760 is the latest amount that a single person receiving income assistance will get each month in British Columbia. This is after a decade of rates being frozen under the previous government and the first increase since an initial boost in September 2017.

Please show me a single place in the Lower Mainland where you can rent a one-bedroom or even bachelor suite for $760 a month, let alone the designated “shelter rate” portion of $375.

So often, the group I work with, Raise the Rates BC, encounters the misguided belief that being in poverty means you just need to budget better or pull up your bootstraps and get a job.

But when the total amount of money you have to live on leaves no room for adequate food, clothing, shelter, transit, hygienic care, a visit to the dentist or a cell phone (to look for that job you’re supposed to be trying to find), no amount of budgeting or individualized effort makes getting off of welfare possible.

And of course, that’s assuming you’re able to access income supports in the first place, considering the ominously long application.

The thing that really got me mad after the B.C. government’s 2019 budget and in the recent reveal of the province’s first-ever poverty reduction “strategy” is how overwhelmingly clear it is that there is loads of room for a far more significant increase to income assistance.

Every time the government announces a healthy surplus, it feels like salt in the wound: “Look at all the things we did, and we still have money to spare.” Meanwhile, those on income assistance continue to face severe deprivation and legislated poverty.

That $760 a month is what we call “deep poverty,” and many of the nearly 190,000 people surviving on income assistance in B.C. live deeply below the poverty line. Federally, the poverty line is measured at the “Market Basket Measure” of around $1,600/month for a single person. $760 is less than half that amount.

The obvious question is, “but why?” Why doesn’t the government understand the depths of poverty in which it is keeping people? Why don’t they do something to help, if the money is so obviously there?

According to the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives calculations (which echo similar numbers from the Ministry of Social Development and Poverty Reduction), it would cost a mere $365 million to raise everyone receiving income assistance (welfare and disability) to 75 per cent of the poverty line. It would cost $1.16 billion to raise everyone to that poverty line.

This is a fraction of the subsidies promised to, for example, the liquefied natural gas industry. It’s around one per cent of the GDP of our wealthy province.

There is an answer to this rhetorical question, “but why?”

For all the talk and show of the “TogetherBC” poverty reduction plan, decades of austerity politics under a neoliberal system ensures that the government still refuses to see the poorest people and people with disabilities as worthy, of support or even part of our society.

Budget’s Inequality Measures a Start — But More Progress Depends on Us read more

It’s because of the stigma we carry in our middle- to upper-class hearts about poverty: that it’s an individual’s fault and therefore an individual’s responsibility. If you can’t work, you don’t have worth.

It’s because in our so-called democratic system, minority governments focus mostly on staying in power and refuse to plan for long-term, sustainable benefits to our society.

I want to challenge the government and all of the ministers to prove me wrong. Show me not just that you understand that ending deep poverty benefits all of society (for the $8 to 9 billion that is saved in reduced strains on the system, and for the proven benefits of a more equal society), but that you will take action.

Do something about that $760 per month. Act like this is the crisis it is, and take action beyond incremental steps. The money is there, so show me, and the 190,000 people on income assistance that you truly believe people on welfare are human beings who deserve to live in dignity.","BC Is Thriving, Yet Our Most Marginalized Remain in Deep Poverty",The Tyee,https://thetyee.ca/Opinion/2019/03/29/Fair-Income-Assistance-Poverty-BC/

On April 1st, 2019, the TSX Venture Exchange gave EastWest Bioscience Inc. the green light to sell its products containing CBD in Kentucky, USA. Until recently, because of rules imposed by the TSX due to legal uncertainty regarding business operations involving any products derived from hemp, the Company was restricted from doing business in the USA. Now, with the TSX-V lifting those restrictions, the Company is free to manufacture and sell its CBD infused products under both US Federal and Kentucky State Law.

“This is a significant milestone for EastWest as it immediately makes available to the consumer market, all our existing product SKUs and sets the stage for strong growth across our CBD infused product lines,” states Rodney Gelineau, CEO of EastWest Bioscience.

EastWest is moving rapidly, incorporating a wholly owned subsidiary, EastWest Science USA to distribute its line of CBD products.

In accordance with its product roadmap, EastWest has been developing products in the USA for the CBD market. The Company now has a clear regulatory path to move these products from development, to manufacturing and distribution in the state of Kentucky. The Company has been in negotiations with consumer products manufacturers and distributors and will move products into consumer markets rapidly. The Company’s first CBD products will be six CBD infused supplements under the Natural Advancement PLUS brand and two CBD infused hemp pet treats under the brand Natural Pet Science PLUS.

“We started early with product development, a strategy which is now paying off,” continues Gelineau. “Our business and product development teams have been carrying on the planning and development work for our CBD infused products, and the Company is excited to have this regulatory hurdle out of the way so we can begin the real work of doing business in the US, starting with the state of Kentucky”.

EastWest is now able to finalize a key partnership for a CBD processing and consumer goods manufacturing facility in Kentucky which will give it the ability to manufacture CBD directly, in an in-house facility. This partnership will provide EastWest exclusive access to an 18,000 sq. ft. facility situated on 6 acres in Marion County the heart of hemp country in Kentucky, USA, an area known for its premium hemp, excellent growing conditions, and long history of industrial scale hemp farming. The partner also has CBD equipment and a Kentucky License for growing and processing hemp and CBD.

“Exclusive access to this facility will give EastWest a strategic US footprint in prime hemp country,” states Gelineau. “Not only is this facility strategically important to our plan it is also the next step toward export to the EU.”
