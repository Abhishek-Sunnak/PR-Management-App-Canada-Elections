Bill C-262 would require the federal government to ensure all laws are in harmony with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, or UNDRIP.

The declaration recognizes Indigenous Peoples' basic human rights, as well as rights to self-determination, language, equality and land, among others.

In 2016, Canada officially adopted the declaration, almost a decade after it was adopted by the UN General Assembly.

Bill C-262 would solidify Canada's responsibility to follow through on the declaration.

""The Constitution recognizes Aboriginal and treaty rights, but the concept of Aboriginal rights has been very vague,"" said Romeo Saganash, the Quebec NDP MP behind the private member's bill.

The bill has already made it through the House of Commons. If it passes a second reading in the Senate, Bill C-262 will head to a committee, before a final vote in the Senate would make it law.

Saganash said other countries are watching.

""In terms of legislation, this is going to be a first,"" he said.

""There are countries that include part of the UN declaration in their constitution and so on, but one piece of legislation that deals with the entire UN declaration — [there are] none.""

When you clarify the rules of the game, that allows us to move forward. - MP Romeo Saganash

The push is on now because there's a short window to get the law passed before the fall federal election.

""What worries me is that we might run out of time before the writ drops and the federal election is called,"" Saganash said.

Saganash — who was involved in the original drafting of the UN's Declaration in the 1980s — said the federal government spends an estimated $500 million to $1 billion every year fighting Indigenous rights in court.

""This bill has the merit of clarifying what those rights are, so hopefully that will avoid legal battles in the future,"" he said.

""When you clarify the rules of the game, that allows us to move forward.""

Saganash said the new law would also establish a set of guidelines for all future legislation.

""If we are to abolish the Indian Act, the UN declaration sets out the minimum standard to follow in terms of governance for Indigenous peoples,"" he said.

The Truth and Reconciliation Commission stated the UN declaration is the blueprint for reconciliation, and called on all sectors of Canadian society to adopt and implement it.

Jennifer Preston, with Canadian Friends Service Committee — the peace and social justice agency of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) Canada — has been working to get the bill passed.

""The declaration is giving us a roadmap to work our way into a more constructive future,"" Preston said.

""It also calls for annual reporting on how this work is being carried out.""

Preston said the law would provide concrete rules around the treatment of Indigenous people.

""This is about an awareness that Indigenous peoples have been denied basic human rights throughout the history of Canada,"" she said.

""We still see issues in Canada — things such as boil water advisories, the travesty with the child welfare system, the issues around Indigenous language and spirituality. All of those things speak to human rights violations,"" she said.

A rally for the bill was held at Canadian Mennonite University in Winnipeg on Tuesday night.

On Day 9 of the Alberta election campaign, the party leaders are spread out across the province as they continue along the campaign trail.

Here’s where the leaders are Wednesday on the campaign trail:

NDP Leader Rachel Notley

NDP Leader Rachel Notley is promising to spend $1.4 billion to expand Alberta’s network of roads that handle large and oversized loads.

Notley said the current 6,500-kilometre network is recognized as one of the best in North America, but more needs to be done.

She said a re-elected NDP government would work to increase the network to cover 10,000 kilometres over the next six years.

Notley said loads such as oil and gas equipment and prefabricated houses would move much faster, saving time and money.

It was one of two new NDP platform announcements in Fort McMurray Wednesday ahead of the April 16 election.

Notley is also committing to build a secondary highway out of the oilsands city to ease congestion and to give residents an alternative escape route in an emergency.

She said people will never forget how residents were forced to flee down Highway 63 through a tunnel of flames as a raging forest fire torched parts of the municipality in 2016.

The opposition United Conservatives have said they would explore user-pay initiatives, such as tolls, to help pay for new industrial infrastructure such as heavy-load roads.

The UCP has said it wouldn’t toll existing infrastructure.

The party has said with the provincial debt climbing to close to $60 billion, the government has to look at other financing options.

Notley reiterated Wednesday that an NDP government will not pass the costs on to road users.

“We’re going to keep Alberta toll-free,” said Notley.

United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney

United Conservative Leader Jason Kenney says if he were premier he would throw out an NDP policy that directs Alberta’s Crown prosecutors to abandon some criminal cases to make sure more serious ones get to court. Kenney says the policy flies in the face of justice and could be rectified with more resources and better planning.

“We will shred the triage memo,” Kenney said Wednesday at a campaign stop in Lac Ste. Anne County, west of Edmonton.

Kenney said a UCP government would hire 50 more prosecutors and support staff and would use alternative measures such as more drug treatment courts to move people through the system.

“The NDP seems to be able to find money for all sorts of things to waste it on — low-flow shower heads and light bulbs — but they are telling prosecutors to drop criminal cases that are ‘less important’ because they can’t afford to deal with them,” said Kenney.

“It basically means letting criminals go scot-free.”

Watch below: UCP Leader Jason Kenney unveiled the UCP plan for fighting rural crime on Wednesday. Fletcher Kent reports.

Two years ago, Justice Minister Kathleen Ganley gave triage guidelines to prosecutors because some serious cases were being tossed out for taking too long to get to trial.

Ganley’s memo urged prosecutors to consider plea deals or to abandon some minor charges or protracted white-collar crime prosecutions to make sure serious crimes didn’t fall through the cracks.

Ganley, running for re-election in Calgary, responded to Kenney in a statement. She noted that her office had to act quickly in 2017 because of a Supreme Court ruling known as the Jordan decision. It directed that cases be tossed out if they dragged on for more than 18 months in the lower courts and 30 months in superior courts.

“Court backlogs have been building across Canada for decades,” wrote Ganley.

“The Jordan decision represented a marked change in the law. When someone is caught shoplifting nail polish, jail time is not always the best solution. The triage protocol goes a long way to ensuring our criminal justice system is focused on serious and violent matters.

Ganley said that Kenney and the UCP have voted against funding for dozens of Crown prosecutors, more provincial court judges and more RCMP officers.

“Since 2015, (NDP Leader) Rachel Notley has added more than 50 Crown prosecutors across Alberta, and in each instance, the Opposition has voted against it.”

WATCH BELOW: UCP Leader Jason Kenney said his party will focus on reducing rural crime if his party is elected.

Kenney’s announcement is part of a UCP package of reforms to address crime and clogged courts.

He promised $10 million for new prosecutors and $20 million over four years for the Alberta Law Enforcement Response Teams, a consortium of police agencies that fight organized crime and other serious cases.

Kenney also said the United Conservatives would create an Alberta parole board for criminals serving provincial sentences of under two years.

“We’re tired of so many repeat offenders going through the revolving door of the justice system back out on the streets creating new victims.”

He said a UCP government would also lobby Ottawa to appoint more superior court judges and to change the Criminal Code to make crimes against rural residents an aggravating factor in sentencing.

He said that would address the reality that people living in rural area are more vulnerable because police are usually farther away.

Liberal Party Leader David Khan

Liberal Leader David Khan was in Edmonton Wednesday where he released his party’s urban municipalities platform, saying municipalities play an “increasingly important role in the life of Albertans but they are disrespected by higher orders of government.”

Khan said his party would amend the Municipal Government Act to formally recognize municipalities and their councils, to become a new order of government.

“We are committed to granting new revenue-generating powers to Edmonton and Calgary. Cities and their voters will be free to make decisions on taxes and spending. They will no longer need provincial politicians to make those decisions. Local decision makers know best about local issues,” Khan said in a media release.

If elected on April 16, the Liberals would also create an “equitable cannabis revenue-sharing model.”

“The NDP Government has unfairly compensated cities on cannabis sales relative to the costs they are incurring for legalization.”

The party would also give urban municipalities a veto over oil and gas drilling within their boundaries, Khan said.

On Wednesday afternoon, Khan unveiled his party’s platform on electoral reform.

If elected, Khan said the Liberals would move away from a “first-past-the-post” electoral system toward a “more democratic mixed member proportional representation (MMPS) system,” which would see voters cast ballots twice. They would vote once for a local constituency candidate and cast another ballot for a political party, Khan explained.

“Votes for constituency candidates work similarly to our current system. The vote for political parties will elect representatives from a published list of party candidates,” Khan said in a media release.

“Seat counts will more accurately reflect the percentage of political parties’ popular vote under MMPR. The legislature will more accurately reflect the will of Alberta voters and maintain the local representation Albertans value.

“We will establish an automatic sunset clause on the electoral reform measure. There will be a referendum after two elections under MMPR. Voters can then choose to keep the proportional representation system, or revert to the FPTP system.”

Khan said the Liberals would also ban union, corporate and foreign donations to political action committees (PACs). The party would also cap individual donations to PACs at $4,000 a year per person.

The Liberals would also implement fixed election dates.

Alberta Party Leader Stephen Mandel

Alberta Party Leader Stephen Mandel held a media event at Tiger Goldstick Park in Edmonton on Wednesday morning. He said he believes the environmentally-friendly way of getting Alberta’s oil to tidewater is by solidifying bitumen into pucks before transporting it by rail and then by sea.

Mandel also said the Alberta Party would increase funding to Alberta Innovates by over $300 million. He also said he would better utilize the province’s natural gas resources and come up with an initiative that would “take the royalty out of natural gas.” and support Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the North West Redwater Sturgeon Refinery.

Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press

The federal New Democrats’ fiscal plan for the fall election will be shaped by estimates of how much money Ottawa loses out on each year to international tax-avoidance schemes, the party’s finance critic says.

Peter Julian said the party intends to focus on Canada’s so-called “tax gap” to show it can finance big campaign commitments – in areas such as affordable housing and universal pharmacare – by cracking down on corporate tax avoidance, loopholes and offshore havens.

The tax gap, which one estimate said could be above $40-billion annually, is the difference between the amount of tax revenue that should have been collected in a year and what was actually brought in.

Story continues below advertisement

Julian said to reinforce its fiscal plan, the NDP is counting on the findings of an upcoming report from the independent parliamentary budget officer on the size of the tax gap.

“The whole issue of corporate taxation will be a stronger part of what we offer to Canadians, bolstered by the PBO report,” Julian said in an interview.

“You will hear us repeating what was found in the PBO report. Whether that number is $10-billion or $15-billion or $20-billion or higher … And we will be talking about the fair tax system as a foundation for making the kind of investments that will make a difference in people’s lives.”

Details about the NDP’s fiscal approach follow last week’s release of the final federal budget before October’s election.

The budget from the governing Liberals fed political debate on whether or not federal governments should strive to return the books to balance as soon as possible.

The document showed the Liberals are in no hurry. Their budget, which emphasized a need to continue making investments, projected annual deficits of almost $20-billion in each of the next two years and contained no timeline to balance the books.

A few days after the budget’s release, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer told a conference that a Tory government would bring books back to balance, but he didn’t say when.

The NDP has been less vocal about its pre-election fiscal vision thus far.

In the 2015 election, the NDP vowed to make major investments and still balance the budget by raising corporate taxes and cutting off tax havens.

Following the party’s poor results at the ballot box, former leader Tom Mulcair later laid part of the blame on the fiscal commitment, which he said overshadowed the NDP’s “social democratic economic vision.”

Julian declined to say whether the New Democrats will promise balanced books again in 2019 because NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh will roll out of the party’s plans over the coming months.

The NDP will renew its focus on corporate tax fairness – and he expects this time to be different.

“I think what we needed in 2015 is what we’ll have in 2019 – which is the PBO report on the tax gap,” Julian said. “In a sense, we’re coming with far more evidence to support what we’re saying about having to put in place a fair tax system.”

Story continues below advertisement

Other political parties have shown interest that the forthcoming tax gap report could be a source of new fiscal space for election promises, said Yves Giroux, the parliamentary budget officer.

But Giroux warned any federal government would need to make considerable efforts before they can turn the tax gap estimate into a source of revenue.

“We have to be somewhat prudent because even if we come up with an estimate that’s high – and I’m not saying it’s the case – it’s only the beginning,” Giroux said in an interview.

David Coletto, chief executive of the Abacus Data polling firm, conducted the survey for the Broadbent Institute, and will discuss its findings at the left-leaning think tank’s annual Progress Summit in Ottawa on Thursday.

David Coletto, chief executive of the Abacus Data polling firm, says a new survey points to a “common concern” that life is getting less affordable in Canada. ( Adrian Wyld / THE CANADIAN PRESS FILE PHOTO )

The national survey of 2,500 Canadian adults — conducted online between March 3 and 11 — found that 57 per cent of respondents named an affordability concern as the top issue that will determine their vote in this year’s federal election. These issues, identified as top concerns from a list of options, include cost of living, taxes, wages and housing affordability. A comparable, probability-based sample survey of 2,500 people would have a margin of error of plus or minus two per cent, 19 times out of 20. In a memo outlining the results, Coletto points to a “common concern” that life is getting less affordable in Canada, with 68 per cent of respondents saying the cost of things they use and consume daily has gotten “worse” within the last few years. At the same time, 59 per cent said they feel the difference between their personal salaries and those of the “richest one per cent” has gotten “worse,” while a majority — 62 per cent — said the profits of big corporations are better or about the same as they were a few years ago.

“This anxiety seems to be growing and fuelling the rise of populist movements — both on the left and right — which are responding to the pressure and frustration people are feeling,” Coletto writes. For instance, survey respondents who indicated they worry about the cost of living were more likely to agree the economy is creating more threats than opportunities to their quality of life, and that immigrants are a “burden” on jobs, housing and health care. These respondents were also more likely to agree that rich people don’t pay enough taxes and that the government is wasteful and inefficient.

“In short,” Coletto writes, “affordability anxiety causes people to feel like they are being left behind and distrust institutions.” Katrina Miller, director of research at the Broadbent Institute, said the survey tells a “cautionary tale” for political parties in this election year. Even if big picture data suggests the economy is doing well — with low unemployment, continued projected GDP growth, and Statistics Canada showing fewer people live below the poverty line — Miller said political parties should heed signs that many people feel life is getting tougher to afford. “There’s deep anxiety out there about the ability to pay for the things you need in your everyday life,” she said. “Political leaders, political movements, even corporate Canada — if they choose to ignore the very real affordability concerns people have in their lives, they do so at great risk.” In his memo about the survey, Coletto points to results that suggest avenues for political parties to tap into these sentiments. Most respondents who said they worry about affordability said they would choose lower costs over higher wages to assuage their concerns, indicating an openness to pocketbook policies that cut individual and household costs, Coletto writes. Forty-six per cent chose the government forcing companies to reduce the cost of goods as one of three responses to affordability concerns, followed by 45 per cent who said it can cut taxes, and 42 per cent who said it can extend public health care to cover more services. For Miller, some of this aligns with what a progressive party like the NDP — the party most closely associated with the Broadbent summit — can offer voters, whether it is creating a national pharmacare program or cracking down on tax havens used by the rich. But the survey also links almost a third of respondents most worried about the future — dubbed “anxious populists” — with higher levels of support for Conservatives, a finding that Miller said indicates progressives still need to find a way to connect with those most concerned about affordability. “What (the progressive movement) need to do is double down on those areas of alignment,” she said of the NDP. “If we go and listen to where this anxiety stems from, we’ll be better able to tune our offers and proposals.” Clarification: This story was edited on March 28, 2019 to reflect that Katrina Miller was speaking about the progressive movement and not the NDP, when she talks about finding ways to connect with those concerned about affordability.

Polls suggest the United Conservative Party is on course to win power in the province, Canada’s energy center, capitalizing on voter concerns about a struggling economy and lack of progress on new oil export pipelines.

However, UCP leader Jason Kenney, a former federal cabinet minister, polls behind New Democrat Party Premier Rachel Notley on a number of personal attributes such as honesty, likeability and trustworthiness, and is embroiled in a scandal over his successful party leadership bid in 2017.

Notley, whose late father led the NDP from 1968-1984, is polling well ahead of her party and seeking to profit from that edge.

To overcome that, the UCP is focusing on Trudeau, with repeated references to “the Notley-Trudeau alliance,” emphasizing her one-time close relationship with the prime minister, while images of their own leader are less visible.

Trudeau is an unpopular figure in Alberta, where many feel he failed to support the energy industry. The prime minister also faces a political scandal on whether he unduly pressured Canada’s former justice minister.

“If you look at the signs the NDP are putting up, their logos are not very prevalent, it’s all Rachel Notley,” said Gregory Jack, vice president at polling firm Ipsos. “The UCP signs are all about the UCP and their brand, and underplaying their leader to a certain extent.”

The UCP’s focus on Justin Trudeau may be effective with older Alberta voters who remember the unpopular National Energy Program in 1980, an effort by his prime minister father, Pierre Trudeau, that sought to give Ottawa more control over the oil and gas industry and a higher share of revenues.

“(The UCP) spin on it is Alberta has been mistreated by a Liberal government and the son of another prime minister who did not treat Alberta well,” said Jared Wesley, a political science professor at the University of Alberta.

Alberta’s energy industry contributes C$80 billion a year to Canada’s economy, but opposition from other provinces has shut down new pipelines like TransCanada Corp’s Energy East project and helped stall the Trans Mountain expansion plan.

Congestion on existing pipelines out of landlocked Alberta left crude bottlenecked in storage tanks and sent prices spiraling to record lows last year, prompting the NDP to mandate temporary crude production cuts.

Alberta has posted budget deficits since global oil prices started tumbling in 2014, and more than C$20 billion in foreign capital has fled its energy sector since 2017.

Notley and Trudeau came to power in the same year and initially forged a close partnership aimed at pleasing the oil industry and environmental groups with a dual strategy that supported new pipelines and introduced a carbon tax.

They fell out last year over delays to the Trans Mountain expansion project. Notley’s camp downplays the relationship that the UCP is working so hard to highlight.

“The job of premier is to work with anyone who has a stake in projects like pipelines. I wouldn’t call it an alliance,” said NDP campaign spokeswoman Cheryl Oates. “A lot of people feel Jason Kenney is stuck in Ottawa trying to rehash a battle that his party lost.”

TODAY:

Opponents of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi want to delay the release of a new film about his life until after the national election, saying it's just thinly disguised propaganda.

Diabetes, already a huge health problem in Canada, is on the rise and it has doctors worried.

India elections

The cinematography is stunning, the musical score is epic, and the sets, costumes and action sequences are all worthy of the biggest-budget Hollywood films.

But opponents of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are pretty sure that a soon-to-be-released biopic about his life is just thinly disguised propaganda meant to influence the country's looming elections.

And so they are banding together to demand that India's chief election commissioner push back the film's scheduled April 5 release date until after the seven-phase, six-week-long vote concludes on May 19.

The Bollywood production titled PM Narendra Modi has the tagline ""the story of a billion people,"" but its focus is clearly fixed on the 68-year-old leader of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party.

It traces his rise from railway tea boy to spiritual seeker to outlaw activist and ultimately politician, first as chief minister of Gurajat state, and then leader of all India. Although critics have been quick to note that the movie glosses over the more contentious parts of Modi's backstory, like the anti-Muslim riots that killed more than 1,000 people during his time as premier.

A newly released trailer shows Vivek Oberoi, the actor who plays Modi, in a variety of heroic poses, riding a motorcycle, pulling a body from some rubble, and boldly waving an Indian flag on a bridge while bullets whizz past.

Television channels are required to give all major political parties equal time under India's election laws, and there are also strict rules surrounding advertising, including posts on social media.

For example, this week both Air India and discount carrier GoAir have stopped distributing boarding passes featuring Modi's picture — paid third-party advertisements that were supposedly meant to promote a recent investors summit — for fear of running afoul of campaign regulations.

But films are not subject to the same type of restrictions.

In fact, in addition to the movie, a 10-part miniseries on Modi's life is set to debut on the Indian streaming service Eros Now at some point in April. Titled Modi: Journey of a Common Man, it appears to stick to the same script about his humble beginnings and selfless dedication to India, while downplaying his hard-edged nationalism.

In 2014, Modi won a landslide victory by borrowing from American presidential campaigns and packaging himself as the product.

Five years later, such efforts have only intensified.

As the vote approaches, Modi has become a ubiquitous presence in billboard, newspaper and television ads, and via ""NaMo Again"" t-shirts, mugs and other merchandise.

(Money Sharma/AFP/Getty Images)

There's even a new, free Modi smartphone app that allows the BJP to directly target supporters with campaign updates, speeches, photos and appeals for help.

The user reviews on iTunes suggest it might be the best innovation since sliced bread. ""Kudos to the thought of creating such an app,"" reads one five-star rating. ""Greatest thing is that our PM is sharing achievements and updates here and we can access at fingertips.""

Nonetheless, Modi and his BJP face a much tougher battle in the coming vote.

The Congress Party, led by the latest member of the Gandhi dynasty, Rahul, comes into the campaign with momentum after winning state elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh in December.

Polls suggest that Modi remains the top pick for PM, but that both main parties may find it difficult to win a clean majority of the 543 seats that are up for grabs in the Lok Sabha.

Which at the very least might provide some dramatic coalition-building scenes for the next political biopic.

Rise of diabetes

A special health panel on The National tonight looks at issues around diabetes, particularly the rise of Type 2, producer Perlita Stroh writes.

Diabetes is a huge health problem in Canada and it's on the rise.

Currently, 2.7 million Canadians live with diabetes and the major impact it has on daily life and overall health.

It's a disease in which the body can't produce or use its own insulin, making it hard to regulate the amount of sugar in the blood. Glucose fuels the body and brain, but too much or too little can cause damage and serious health complications.

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease treated by insulin injections and other medications. Type 2, which the vast majority of diabetes sufferers have, can be regulated and even cured through diet and physical activity.

In fact, Type 2 is preventable if people eat and exercise properly, but according to health professions, the disease is growing so fast that by 2020 the number of people with diabetes could double.

While health professionals stress the importance of living a healthy lifestyle, they warn that other factors are at play here too.

""Diabetes is also connected to socio-economic issues,"" says Dr. Danielle Martin, a family physician and VP at Women's College Hospital. ""It's not easy to live on a low income and eat healthy food and exercise.""

And while most people acquire Type 2 diabetes in middle age, the number of children being diagnosed in recent years worries the health community.

""It used to be rare for kids to get it,"" says Dr. Lennox Huang of The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. ""It has spiked with rates of obesity, though, and now we do see it more and more.""

Tonight on The National, we've assembled our panel of medical experts to explore the state of diabetes in Canada. Joining us will be Dr. Martin and Dr. Huang, as well as Dr. Samir Sinha, director of geriatrics at Mount Sinai and the University Health Network Hospitals.

Hope you'll join us to find out more about this serious and growing threat to the health of Canadians.

Jason Kenney in Calgary

UCP Leader Jason Kenney is in Calgary Thursday where he is making an announcement regarding “gaps” in the province’s health care system, and providing details of the party’s plan to tackle the opioid crisis.

Part of the UCP’s plan is to reduce increasing administrative costs, Kenney said, adding he expects to find 1-2 per cent of savings in doing a management review.

“We believe there are too many managers managing managers,” Kenney said.

In an effort to combat fentanyl and opioid use, Kenney said the UCP would fund a dedicated opioid investigation team and call on the federal government for mandatory minimum sentences for drug traffickers and stricter drug controls at the borders.

On safe injection sites, Kenney said the UCP would take a “sensible and compassionate” approach, and would only endorse new sites if extensive consultations with affected communities and socio-economic studies were conducted.

To the opioid epidemic. UCP would implement an action plan to tackle addiction & provide more supports for mental health focusing on drug treatment.

The party also committed Thursday to fully funding growing student enrolment each year, which would add an estimated 600 new teaching and support staff positions for the 15,000 more students expected to arrive in Alberta schools by the fall.

Notley also reiterated her party’s support for gay-straight alliances (GSAs) in Alberta schools.

“GSAs, quite frankly, are too important—they save lives” Notley said.

By Kevin Bissett, THE CANADIAN PRESS





CHARLOTTETOWN -- P.E.I. Premier Wade MacLauchlan called an early election Tuesday night, announcing an April 23 vote that polls suggest could produce Canada's first Green Party government.

""This is Prince Edward Island's time,"" MacLauchlan told a nomination meeting for a local candidate at a Charlottetown hotel. ""We are experiencing a sense of opportunity like never before in our long and distinguished history.""

The Liberal government didn't have to take voters to the polls until Oct. 7 under the province's fixed-date election provisions, but there was an apparent desire to avoid overlap with the federal election this fall.

""It's been four years. We had a mandate and fulfilled it,"" MacLauchlan told reporters when asked about the early call. ""This is an opportunity to ask Islanders for their confidence to build on that record.""

Despite a booming economy, polls suggest the Liberal party is likely facing a rough ride, with the Greens seen as a legitimate contender for power.

In his speech, MacLauchlan called the Progressive Conservatives a party of chaos and opposition -- saying they've had five leaders in four years -- and suggested the Greens would be too risky.

""The Green Party is untested, and the future of our province is too important to risk on uncertain expensive social experiments, led by a career politician,"" he said.

Green Leader Peter Bevan-Baker, a dentist, became the first party member elected to the legislature in 2015, and the Greens snagged a second seat in a 2017 byelection.

A Corporate Research Associates poll released this month suggests the Greens had a healthy lead, followed by the Progressive Conservatives, who picked a new leader, Dennis King, in February.

The Liberals were in third place, the poll suggests.

The Liberals have been in power since 2007, and there are signs MacLauchlan -- a longtime academic who began his political career in 2015 as premier -- is personally unpopular.

""It's about people. It's about you -- and it's about time that the government of the people of P.E.I. understand, respect and live by that message,"" the PC party said in a tweet as MacLauchlan was making his election call.

The Greens, meanwhile, posted a clip Tuesday night of Bevan-Baker playing ""First Call"" on his trumpet.

""What a wonderful way to begin the writ period -- with a blast from Peter's trumpet,"" the party said on Facebook.

In his speech, MacLauchlan touted advancements made by his government on housing, lower taxes and reducing child poverty by more than half.

""Prince Edward Island is working,"" he told the enthusiastic partisan crowd. ""There are now more opportunities for Islanders to get ahead and thrive.""

The standings at dissolution in the Island legislature were 16 Liberals, eight Tories, two Green and one independent member.

The Island has only ever been governed by the Liberals or Tories. The last time a minority government was elected in P.E.I. was 1890.

MacLauchlan said Tuesday night that he notified the other party leaders earlier in the day.

He is scheduled to make his first campaign stop Wednesday morning in Charlottetown.

The election will also include a binding referendum on electoral reform -- asking voters if they wish to stay with the current first-past-the-post system or change to a mixed-member-proportional-representation model.

It won't be the first time P.E.I. voters have been asked to consider electoral reform.

In fact, they voted 52 per cent in favour of switching to mixed member proportional reform during a plebiscite in 2016, but MacLauchlan rejected the results because of a low turnout of about 36 per cent.",Liberal premier calls Prince Edward Island election for April 23,Atlantic CTV News,https://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/liberal-premier-calls-prince-edward-island-election-for-april-23-1.4353298

He said after identifying how much money is escaping the public treasury, the Canada Revenue Agency ""has to have the willingness to get that money.""","The federal New Democrats' fiscal plan for the fall election will be shaped by estimates of how much money Ottawa loses out on each year to international tax-avoidance schemes, the party's finance critic says.

New Westminster-Burnaby MP Peter Julian said the party intends to focus on Canada's so-called ""tax gap"" to show it can finance big campaign commitments — in areas such as affordable housing and universal pharmacare — by cracking down on corporate tax avoidance, loopholes and offshore havens.

article continues below

The tax gap, which one estimate said could be above $40 billion annually, is the difference between the amount of tax revenue that should have been collected in a year and what was actually brought in.Julian said to reinforce its fiscal plan, the NDP is counting on the findings of an upcoming report from the independent parliamentary budget officer on the size of the tax gap.

""The whole issue of corporate taxation will be a stronger part of what we offer to Canadians, bolstered by the PBO report,"" Julian said in an interview.

""You will hear us repeating what was found in the PBO report. Whether that number is $10 billion or $15 billion or $20 billion or higher... And we will be talking about the fair tax system as a foundation for making the kind of investments that will make a difference in people's lives.""

Details about the NDP's fiscal approach follow last week's release of the final federal budget before October's election.

The budget from the governing Liberals fed political debate on whether or not federal governments should strive to return the books to balance as soon as possible.

The document showed the Liberals are in no hurry. Their budget, which emphasized a need to continue making investments, projected annual deficits of almost $20 billion in each of the next two years and contained no timeline to balance the books.

A few days after the budget's release, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer told a conference that a Tory government would bring books back to balance, but he didn't say when.

The NDP has been less vocal about its pre-election fiscal vision thus far.

In the 2015 election, the NDP vowed to make major investments and still balance the budget by raising corporate taxes and cutting off tax havens.

Following the party's poor results at the ballot box, former leader Tom Mulcair later laid part of the blame on the fiscal commitment, which he said overshadowed the NDP's ""social democratic economic vision.""

Julian declined to say whether the New Democrats will promise balanced books again in 2019 because NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh will roll out of the party's plans over the coming months.

The NDP will renew its focus on corporate tax fairness — and he expects this time to be different.

""I think what we needed in 2015 is what we'll have in 2019 — which is the PBO report on the tax gap,"" Julian said. ""In a sense, we're coming with far more evidence to support what we're saying about having to put in place a fair tax system.""

Other political parties have shown interest that the forthcoming tax gap report could be a source of new fiscal space for election promises, said Yves Giroux, the parliamentary budget officer.

But Giroux warned any federal government would need to make considerable efforts before they can turn the tax gap estimate into a source of revenue.

""We have to be somewhat prudent because even if we come up with an estimate that's high — and I'm not saying it's the case — it's only the beginning,"" Giroux said in an interview.

He said after identifying how much money is escaping the public treasury, the Canada Revenue Agency ""has to have the willingness to get that money.""","NDP to focus on 'tax gap' in election, says New West MP",New West Record,https://www.newwestrecord.ca/news/ndp-to-focus-on-tax-gap-in-election-says-new-west-mp-1.23771964

11,World,2019-03-27T23:13:00.0000000Z,"Neither Canada’s feminist-ally prime minister nor Ontario’s feminist ... But if we want the lives of women and girls to be a priority in this election, then we have to take those numbers and get loud. And to do that we have to work together.","A woman was murdered every 2.5 days last year in Canada.

This is just one of the many startling statistics contained in the first report issued by the Canadian Femicide Observatory for Justice and Accountability, an organization that was established in 2017 as a response to a call from the United Nations to monitor femicide rates around the world. The goal of this yearly report is to draw attention to the unique circumstances surrounding femicide in the hopes of preventing further violence.

But while the report received some attention when it was released in late January, it doesn’t appear to have riled up a single politician—which is alarming when you consider that all the major federal parties are gearing up for the fall election. Candidates of all stripes are hosting town halls, shaking hands, kissing babies and duking it out over SNC-Lavalin, international relations and border security. But no one seems particularly concerned that 148 women and girls were killed last year or that half of the women were murdered in their home by someone who claimed to love them or that the youngest victim was three weeks old. Not a single candidate has made femicide a talking point on the campaign trail.

As a longtime advocate for women and girls, and as a survivor of intimate partner violence and stalking, I’m outraged. What will it take for politicians to care about the lives of women and girls? During the 10 years that Stephen Harper was prime minister, funding for research on women’s lives ground to a halt. Cuts to Status of Women Canada’s budget along with his cancellation of the long-form census meant it became impossible to measure women’s experiences in the home, workplace and at school. It also meant we had no real sense of how many women were experiencing violence. Trudeau’s election and his commitment to feminism was a moment of exhilaration for advocates—it felt as though change was coming.



And in many ways, they have. Gender-Based Analysis was applied to the federal budget, Status of Women got a profile boost and a strong message was sent across the land that “Feminism is cool.” But the violence continued. At the height of the #MeToo moment, three years into Trudeau’s term, an act of misogynist terrorism unfolded on a sunny afternoon in Canada’s largest city when a man drove a van through the streets of Toronto, mowing down eight women and two men. There were hot takes and head shakes, but no concrete policy changes. Neither Canada’s feminist-ally prime minister nor Ontario’s feminist premier Kathleen Wynne called out the blatant misogyny of the act.

When the CFOAJ report launched last month, I was hopeful that hard data would make a difference. For years, we had been relying on patchwork statistical evidence and the qualitative stories of advocates to paint a picture of femicide in Canada. We finally have a better sense of what is happening across this country.

But if we want the lives of women and girls to be a priority in this election, then we have to take those numbers and get loud. And to do that we have to work together. When a candidate comes knocking at your door or when you find yourself at an election debate, here are some hard-ball questions you can throw their way:

How are you going to address violence against Indigenous women and girls?

Indigenous women make up only 5 percent of the Canadian population, but they were 36 percent of the women and girls killed last year. Does your candidate have a position on the Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women? Do they know that provinces, such as Ontario, are clawing back Indigenous education in schools and denying our youth the truth about colonization? Ask them how they plan to make Canada safer for Indigenous women and girls.

What’s your strategy for addressing the high rates of violence against rural women and girls?

Only 16 percent of Canadians live in a rural area, but 34 percent of the women killed last year lived rurally. Women in the north are particularly at risk, with the highest femicide rate in Nunavut and the Yukon. A triple femicide in Wilno, Ontario in the fall of 2015 highlighted the isolation and lack of support for rural women trying to flee violence.

My colleagues and I are re-thinking how funding should be allocated. Currently, funding for services like shelters and sexual assault centres happens per capita. Yes, there are technically fewer clients in a rural community but the lack of public transportation, patchy cellphone reception and the overall isolation means the cost per client is actually higher than urban areas. Ask your candidate if they’re thinking about the rural reality and if rural survivors are on their radar.

How are you going to make Canada safer for young women and girls?

Across all races and regions, young women are especially vulnerable to violence, with a quarter of femicide victims last year being women aged 25 to 34. We also know that women under 25 have the highest rates of sexual assault in Canada. Ask your candidates where they stand on mandatory consent education in schools, the creation of a national youth mental health strategy and funding for trauma-informed youth services.

The vulnerability of young women was recently made tragically clear with the Amber Alert across Ontario searching for Riya Rajkumar. She was a smart, vibrant girl who was killed on her 11th birthday. Her father was charged with first degree murder and died a few days later in hospital from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

We’re mere weeks into a new year and there have been at least four femicides across Canada already. It’s time for us to demand that the lives of women and girls in Canada be prioritized.",The Election Issue That Isn’t Even On Politicians’ Radar,Chatelaine,https://www.chatelaine.com/opinion/femicide-the-election-issue-that-isnt-even-on-politicians-radar/

This $5 billion represents 100,000 new jobs annually, each paying $50,000 – or half a million new jobs ...","Politicians talk about what they want to talk about and not what’s necessarily important and relevant to Canadians. There are taboo subjects that no political party will address. Tax laws that legally allow affluent Canadians to use tax havens to avoid paying tax are highly relevant to all Canadians. They’re also at the top of the list of taboo topics political parties refuse to talk about. Canada’s tax regulations have created a two-tier tax system, one for the rich and one for everyone else. Some have called this economic discrimination.

It’s estimated by some experts that the annual lost government revenue due to the legal use of tax havens by individuals is $5 billion, or $25 billion over five years. These billions could fund numerous elections promises without adding to Canada’s deficit. This $5 billion represents 100,000 new jobs annually, each paying $50,000 – or half a million new jobs over five years. It represents the funding of a national Pharmacare plan and investments in growth industries, and environmental and social programs. This lost revenue would enhance the lives of all Canadians, instead of benefiting only Canada’s affluent.

These affluent Canadians are not tax-cheats or tax evaders, nor are they abusing our tax system. They are adhering fully to Canada’s tax laws. These laws need to change.

These lost billions represent the funding of a national Pharmacare plan and investments in growth industries, and environmental and social programs.

The October 2019 election represents the only opportunity for Canadian voters to prohibit affluent Canadians from using tax havens to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. We need to demand political parties engage in discussions about this “taboo” issue before the October election. For instance, in next week’s federal budget.

Politicians don’t talk about the Panama and Paradise Paper disclosures, in which thousands of affluent Canadians were identified as having used tax havens to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. This represents only a fraction of the number of affluent Canadians who benefit from offshore tax havens.

The difference between tax evaders and tax avoiders is that tax avoidance is legal. Tax evasion is illegal. Tax evaders are hunted down by the Canada revenue Agency and face the possibility of going to jail.

By contrast, affluent Canadians who use tax havens are law-abiding citizens, free to continue doing the same year after year. This will only change if Canadians demand our government close tax loopholes. But we are reluctant to take to the streets and challenge political parties to address this issue.

Tax reform that prohibits the use of tax havens by affluent Canadians is not radical. U.S. citizens are forbidden to use tax havens to avoid paying taxes. It is a criminal offence. They respect the sacred principle of tax fairness, under which all citizens must pay their fair share of taxes. In Canada, we have a two-tier tax system, which is unfair and unjust.

The losers in all of this are “average” Canadians. Tax avoidance is a dominant factor for Canadians having inadequate health care and social programs. Investments are not being made to growth industries that would allow them to compete domestically and globally. “Average” Canadians are paying more taxes while our government debt is growing at a staggering rate. This should not be allowed to continue.

A 2017 Environics poll found that nine out of 10 Canadians say the use of tax havens is morally wrong, and 87 per cent said they would like to see tax-haven use criminalized. This poll is an indication as to how voters in October’s federal election might respond to a political party advocating for tax reform.

Both individual and corporate tax avoidance laws are crippling Canada. Solutions to tax avoidance by individuals can be addressed by voting for political parties committed to closing tax loopholes. The nature of corporate tax avoidance is complex and requires long-term solutions.

The goal of The Grassroots Coalition for Tax Reform, is to pressure political parties to address the use of tax havens by affluent Canadians, in their election platforms. Let’s all tell them how we feel. This policy issue should no longer be taboo.

To get you caught up on Alberta politics and to give you a taste of what to expect from the newsletter, here are some of our recent Maclean’s features and articles:

This is Notley and her NDP on pre-election footing, polling well behind Jason Kenney’s United Conservatives and their more aggressive posture toward pipelines and anyone who dares not to advocate for them. She’s largely denied critics the opportunity to label her anti-pipeline, and perhaps it’s her best shot at regaining acceptance—Notley has taken the NDP’s old reputation for Prairie pragmatism and dunked it in oil.

In question period, the governing side often attacks more than it defends, as if it’s auditioning to be the official opposition. With this massive advantage, Kenney plans to test how much of a rightward correction Albertans are willing to make. More than just angling to erase the NDP’s four-year imprint on Alberta, he wishes to roll back the political moderation of the Progressive Conservatives before that, too.

Jen Gerson: We may yet see another oil boom, or two. There will probably be applications for oil and plastics over the next century, and Alberta should be doing everything within its power to supply that demand. But it’s a pretty safe bet that global demand for oil is going to abate within my lifetime, as climate change policies, decarbonization efforts and new technologies come to the fore. These shifts are already starting to happen. My child—a toddler today—will probably drive an electric car. He may never learn to drive at all. So what, exactly, is the plan?

For nine years, Kenney sat in a Harper cabinet beset by competing impulses: on one hand, avid conservatism, on the other, incrementalism—the idea that Canadians had to be brought along gradually to accept the Conservative agenda on taxes and programs. A deﬁning question in the run-up to Alberta’s next election is how much cautious incrementalism Kenney will employ, or how free he’ll feel to untether his conservative id.

As a midterm examination of sorts, Maclean’s interviewed dozens of voters in some parts of Alberta where NDP support surged in 2015. In those pockets of give-them-a-shot open-mindedness, many feel whipsawed by the degree of change Albertans got, and fairly certain some corrective action must loom ahead.",Alberta Politics Insider: Special newsletter edition for the petro-province’s election,Macleans.ca,https://www.macleans.ca/politics/alberta-election-2019-politics-insider-newsletter/
14,Politics,2019-03-28T19:32:00.0000000Z,"“Under Stephen Harper, Canada had the worst growth rate we’d had since the ... Trudeau pitched the upcoming election as an opportunity for all Canadians to step up and start talking about the kind of country they want to leave for their children ...","VANCOUVER — Justin Trudeau delivered a feisty, campaign-style speech in Vancouver-Kingsway Sunday night as he introduced former TV news anchor Tamara Taggart as the riding’s Liberal candidate in the fall federal election.

The prime minister fired off a flurry of verbal jabs at Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer, and also former prime minister Stephen Harper, giving a glimpse of what could be a heated campaign for the October election.

“Investing in people and communities is the way to grow the economy. Stephen Harper and the Conservatives still don’t get it. Andrew Sheer doesn’t get it either,” he said to a gym full of enthusiastic supporters.

“Under Stephen Harper, Canada had the worst growth rate we’d had since the depths of the Great Depression under R. B. Bennett.”

Trudeau then accused Sheer’s Conservatives of hoping to continue Harper’s policies by giving tax breaks to the wealthy while cutting programs for the middle and lower classes.

“They still think the way to create economic growth for everyone is to cut programs and give advantages and benefits to the wealthiest,” he said. “Well, that doesn’t trickle down to anyone and it didn’t work for 10 years.”

Trudeau pitched the upcoming election as an opportunity for all Canadians to step up and start talking about the kind of country they want to leave for their children and grandchildren.

“Do we want to invest in the middle class — shine on the world stage,” he asked, before warning that Canada “is seeing the rise of populism, aggressive, fear-based politics, just like the rest of the world.”

The crowd roared its approval when the prime minister suggested the best way to counter divisive populism is by recruiting “strong, compassionate people who’ve focused their lives on bringing people together and on empowering people.”

He lauded Taggart as one of those people from all walks of Canadian life who have invested in their communities in various ways to grow the economy, respond to the challenges of climate change and put Canada on the world stage.

Taggart admitted feeling a bit overwhelmed and emotional at being on stage, especially seeing her children holding up signs that read, “Team Tamara.”

The Order of British Columbia recipient said she wants to be the people’s voice in Ottawa, adding that her media career made her a good listener.

While Taggart steered clear of talking about the specifics of her campaign platform at the event, she has previously said that she wants to focus on affordable housing, protecting the environment while boosting the economy, and women’s health and safety.

She’s likely to face a tough challenge in Vancouver-Kingsway, which has been held by New Democrat MP Don Davies since 2008.

Scroll through your Facebook feed and you’ll see it’s the Wild West for political advertisers on Facebook, communication experts say. As Alberta heads to the polls on April 16, political parties and third-party advertisers are corralling votes through mobile apps and online advertising.



All of this comes as online advertisers and platforms face increasing scrutiny from federal regulators concerned with interference that could ultimately influence election results.

Going Mobile

However, new federal rules won’t impact Albertans who will see their fair share of targeted political messages this coming provincial election.Targeted Facebook AdsFacebook ads are excellent for reaching audiences advertisers want to connect with. But, it’s the ability to target ads at specific demographics that has some experts, like analyst Sara Bannerman, worried.“What’s concerning to me is the lack of transparency. That we really don’t have a tool for monitoring what kind of advertising is out there,” says Bannerman, the Research Chair in Communication Policy and Governance at McMaster University.Bill C-76, introduced by the federal government last December, is attempting to force online platforms to maintain a sharable database of political advertisements.Google Canada has already decided they won’t be hosting political ads for the next Federal Election due to that requirement. In the U.S., U.K., India, and Brazil, Facebook maintains ad libraries that track who purchases political ads, how much they paid, and how the ads performed.Facebook promises to launch a Canadian ad archive in June, before the next federal election, but after Alberta’s provincial election.Under Alberta law, political advertisers only need to disclose their expenses to Elections Alberta. However, Bannerman insists more information, including how organizations are aiming particular messages to certain groups and which groups are being targeted with specific ads, should be shared with the public.“If ads are only seen by the people who [are meant to] see them, then we’re not even participating in the same conversation.”

Mobile apps are one of the newer tools being made available by political parties. Apps can be used to communicate directly with supporters, gather data, and organize campaigns.

Peter Ryan, public relations professor at Mount Royal University, says Albertans should be concerned about how easily these apps collect users’ private information.

The Alberta NDPs app Forward is the only mobile app made available to the general public.

“If they’re downloading a partisan app, we don’t know what information is getting collected by that party … we don’t know how [the data] is being used, and what effect it will have on the election.”



Ryan added there is also no way of knowing what security is in place in the event of a hack.



So far, the Alberta NDP’s app, Forward, is the only one available within the Google Play and Apple app stores.



The app requests biographical information such as name, constituency, phone number, and email.



However, as of March 14, the app wasn’t completely accessible to the public, as users who provided basic information, and granted notification and text message permissions were never sent the invitation code needed to access any in-app content.

Third-party advertisers

While political parties will be doing their share of advertising online, they’re not the only ones with a stake in this election.

Organizations not affiliated with political parties can spend up to $150,000 on advertising, per legislation introduced by the current government back in 2017.

Third-party advertisers and other groups not directly linked to political parties have the capacity and legal ability to advertise as well, which Ryan says is going to show us a lot about their role in our politics.



“We will learn which political parties will be able to leverage the third-party space to effectively amplify their messages to strategically frame their opposition and drive voters to the polls to support their election policies.”



While these third parties can advertise, they are required by law to register with Elections Alberta but can spend no more than $150,000 on advertising.



The Alberta Federation of Labour, the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees, and political-action organizations like Shaping Alberta’s Future are three examples of groups registered as third-party political advertisers with Elections Alberta.

Unregistered groups

Public Facebook groups with thousands of members can spread suspicious news articles to non-members through sharing.

While registered third parties will have their spending monitored by the province, Ryan raises the issues of groups who may not be receiving or spending any money at all, but still exerting great influence.



“If you aren’t receiving any money you can still have a [Facebook] group and post away,” says Ryan.



“A huge group right now is the Yellow Vest movement online, over 100,000 people are following it. That could influence a provincial election.”



Yellow Vests Canada identifies itself as a group that supports the building of pipelines and opposes carbon taxes, globalists and ‘treason’ committed by Canadian politicians. The group’s Facebook page is filled with posts by members sharing from sources such as Debate Post which makes unsubstantiated claims, often about immigration or Prime Minister Trudeau.



Ryan encourages voters to be critical of posts they see online and attempt to verify what they see with trusted media outlets and official government sources, like Elections Alberta.



“If it’s not the mainstream media reporting or circulating information to you, I would say consumers beware of that information.”

Nearly 25 years later, Alberta finds itself in a similar situation.","Albertans go to the polls on April 16, choosing between Don Getty and Ralph Klein for premier. Or close enough. The incumbent New Democrats are Don Getty come back to life, with a side serving of Trudeau-esque identity politics. The United Conservative Party might be the return of Ralph Klein.

That’s more or less the message of one of the most interesting books on fiscal policy I have read. Yes, I grudgingly concede that it is possible that some of my readers may not find fiscal policy quite as interesting as we economists do, but I would recommend giving Mark Milke — an old Calgary friend of mine — a try. His latest, Ralph vs. Rachel: A Tale of Two Alberta Premiers, is a relatively easy read; it is not impenetrable academic prose. A newspaper columnist who can write for a wide audience, Milke challenges a lot of what we think we know about recent fiscal policy.

The United Conservative Party might be the return of Ralph Klein

The heart of Milke’s argument is that historically profligate Alberta — which still has the highest per-capita government spending in the nation — cannot, when energy revenues fall, tax its way back to fiscal responsibility and greater business investment. Spending restraint is the answer.

Milke submits that Getty’s Progressive Conservatives, 1985-1992, attempted the former and failed. Klein, 1992-2006, implemented the latter and succeeded. The Rachel Notley New Democrats have followed the Getty model, Milke argues, with the same results.

“In 1993 and 2015, two Alberta premiers faced similar economic and fiscal challenges: low or declining energy prices, a weak economy and relatively high government spending by their predecessors,” writes Milke of the situations facing Klein in 1993 and Notley in 2015. “The differences: Notley was forced to grapple with a steeper oil-price drop just as she entered office and anti-Alberta policies from politicians elsewhere in the country; Klein played cleanup for every fiscal problem the Progressive Conservatives let lapse or exacerbated since 1986 and faced significantly higher interest rates.”

Klein and Notley provide about as close a comparison as one can get in the real world of economic fluctuations. Klein was helped by modestly recovering oil prices but hammered by high interest rates on accumulated debt; Notley’s deficit spending has been with cheap debt and more slowly recovering oil prices. Call it a wash and compare the results.

Klein introduced deep spending cuts, as much as 20 per cent. Many Albertans howled, though Alberta’s cuts were simply a return to what most other Canadians, per capita, had long been accustomed to. The fiscal results were impressive.

Klein introduced deep spending cuts, as much as 20 per cent. Many Albertans howled

“Candidate Klein promised a balanced budget in four years and Premier Klein delivered in two,” notes Milke. “Candidate Notley promised three deficit years and then a $25-million surplus by 2019. Premier Notley’s commitment was dead on arrival once the NDP gained power. In power, the NDP modified their balanced budget promise to 2020 and then 2023. It was the late 1980s Progressive Conservative Getty government all over again.”

Klein’s balanced budgets and then surpluses permitted the government to go debt-free by 2005. A government free of debt-service costs can keep taxes low, attracting investment and economic growth, or expand spending. In his first years as premier, Klein faced annual debt-service charges of close to $3 billion. When Alberta became debt-free, that was $3 billion more that Albertans had in tax savings or new spending.

The extravagant spending of Klein’s PC successors — Ed Stelmach, Alison Redford and Jim Prentice — left Alberta with a debt service cost of $722 million in 2015. By 2018, with expanded NDP spending and higher taxes — corporate taxes and carbon taxes — the debt service was up to $1.9 billion. By 2021, it is projected to reach $3 billion. By way of comparison, that would be 15 per cent of health spending, or nearly 50 per cent of social service spending in 2021.

Debt service is a killer of public confidence — it drives a wedge between revenues raised and services delivered, a guarantee that taxpayers do not get what they pay for. If oil prices rise sharply, Alberta’s finances will recover quickly. But if interest rates rise even modestly, Alberta’s fiscal health will be dealt a mortal blow.

While Milke’s book focuses on Alberta, the lessons of Klein after Getty had national implications. Canada’s national finances, which were headed into desperate territory, were saved by the Chretien/Martin cuts of 1995. Nearly 25 years later, Alberta finds itself in a similar situation.

Wernick said he is concerned somebody will be assassinated in the upcoming ...","On Monday, Trudeau appointed former Justice Minister Anne McLellan as a ""special adviser"" to examine the question of whether or not the two roles should be made separate.

""The events of the last few weeks have raised important questions about the relationship between the federal government and the minister of justice and Attorney General of Canada,"" a statement from Trudeau's office read.

""Ms. McLellan will assess the structure that has been in place since Confederation of a single minister holding the positions of minister of justice and Attorney General of Canada … She will also analyze the operating policies and practices across the cabinet, and the role of public servants and political staff in their interactions with the (minister).""

Opposition MPs also took issue with Wernick's alarming statements on foreign interference in the upcoming election, as well as the tone and tenor of political discourse in Canada.

Wernick said he is concerned somebody will be assassinated in the upcoming campaign. He also tabled seven angry messages sent to him after his first committee appearance, saying they constituted ""intimidation of a witness.""

As clerk, Wernick was the most senior member of a five-person committee tasked with assessing possible foreign intervention in the upcoming election — and whether or not the Canadian public should be warned.

Last week, the opposition parties expressed no confidence in his ability to do that.

The task now falls to Ian Shugart, who Trudeau named as Wernick's replacement on Monday. Shugart is a lifelong bureaucrat and the current deputy minister of foreign affairs.

Global Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters that Shugart is ""someone I trust completely, someone who is 100 per cent devoted to the Canadian national interest, and someone with excellent judgment.""

""I can't think of a better person to fill the role,"" Freeland said.

""I want to thank Michael Wernick for his extraordinary service to Canada over many, many decades,"" Trudeau told reporters outside the House of Commons.

""We've accomplished a lot as a government over these past three and a half years, and it was definitely in large part because of extraordinary public service and Michael Wernick's leadership.""

The finance minister was faced by a raucous opposition, as the Conservatives shouted down the speech in protest over the ongoing SNC-Lavalin dispute. The Conservatives are demanding that former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Reybould be returned to the Justice committee in order to reply to statements she made to the committee following her resignation from cabinet—allegedly over her transfer to the Veteran’s Affairs ministry, a move she categorized as a demotion not intervening in the criminal case against the massive Quebec engineering corporation.

“Today, I am happy to share our government’s fourth budget: ‘Investing in the Middle Class’,” said Minister Morneau as he began to address the House. “The title should come as no surprise, Mr. Speaker, because investing in the middle class began with our first day in office… and it’s what we’ve been doing every single day since.”

- Advertisement -

Leader of the Official Opposition Conservatives, Andrew Scheer, derided the Liberal budget as a prop to deflect attention away from the SNC-Lavalin controversy. But it has become a regular function of all federal governments in recent years to release a budget in the early spring.

“This budget shows how disconnected Trudeau’s Liberals are from Canadians’ everyday reality,” said NDP leader Jagmeet Singh in response to the budget. “There is no sense of urgency to act on skyrocketing housing costs, unaffordable childcare, expensive prescription drug costs and senior poverty rates. Canadians were counting on this Liberal government to meet their basic needs, and sadly, they were let down. We will have the courage to make different choices.”

“This is a disappointing budget for Canadians who need help right now to make ends meet,” said Algoma-Manitoulin-Kapuskasing NDP MP Carol Hughes. “This budget is disconnected from most people’s reality and the challenges we are facing together.”

“There are lots of half-measures and nice words, but the money being spent isn’t enough,” continued Ms. Hughes. “The money going into broadband is a good example. The dollar amount sounds great until you realize it’s being rolled out over the next 13 years. The North needs that infrastructure now.”

The NDP maintains that the federal budget also does not address critical issues facing the First Nations, essentially pushing off dealing with them until further down the road.

“‘Investing in the Middle Class’ has demonstrated the important strides the Liberal government has taken to remedy First Nations historical inequity,” reads a statement from the Anishinabek Nation. “I am pleased to see funding committed towards post-secondary education and skills development and training, with a particular focus on supporting our youth. This all aids in unhinging the First Nations labour market,” said Acting Ontario Regional Chief Glen Hare (speaking in that capacity on the federal level, as opposed to his role as Anishinabek Nation Grand Council Chief). Critical funding was left unaddressed, the release goes on to qualify, specifically regarding child welfare and additional housing and infrastructure supports. “This is a missed opportunity for the Trudeau government,” said Acting Ontario Regional Chief Hare, “and something the Chiefs of Ontario will continue to advocate to rectify, especially given the current crises in Ontario communities, such as in Cat Lake First Nation. When the chiefs see children covered in rashes and people dying because of inadequate housing and infrastructure quality, we expect the federal government to do the right thing and rectify these immediate issues.”

Among the budget measures impacting First Nations is $1.2 billion over three years to continue to implement Jordan’s Principle and help ensure that all First Nations children can access the health, social and educational services; $327.5 million over five years to enhance the Post-Secondary Student Support Program while the government engages with First Nations on long-term First Nation-led post-secondary education models; more than $1 billion over five years to improve essential services on-reserve, such as clean drinking water, fire protection, emergency response and supports for residents with disabilities or chronic illnesses; $40 million over five years to help First Nations research and develop their Specific Claims and a commitment to renew and replenish funding for the specific claims Settlement Fund for a further three years; and up to $100 million to establish an Indigenous Growth Fund to further encourage investments in Indigenous-led businesses by aboriginal financial institutions (such as Waubetek Business Development Corporation), including for First Nations entrepreneurs.

“While there was no mention in the budget of child welfare funding commitments,” noted Acting Ontario Regional Chief Hare, “we see hope through the funding commitment to implement Jordan’s Principle over the next three years.”

Budget 2019 proposes to invest an additional $739 million over five years to continue to tackle boil water advisories, beginning in 2019/2020, with $184.9 million per year ongoing. This investment will support ongoing efforts to eliminate and prevent long-term drinking water advisories, funding urgent repairs to vulnerable water systems and providing water operator training and support programs notes the Anishinabek Nation release.

“There is no doubt that the work done to end boil water advisories is a reflection of the legacy of former (Indigenous Services) Minister (Jane) Philpott’s commitment to systematic change in Canada’s approach to First Nations’ service delivery,” he continued. “There is still much work ahead. Though Minister O’Regan has only held the portfolio a short while, he has picked up where Minister Philpott has left off. While Budget 2019 is short on specifics, I was encouraged by the proposed investment in economic development through the Indigenous Growth Fund. With proper input from First Nations, such a venture should provide more opportunity to create sustainable revenue and business ventures for First Nations in Ontario. I look forward to working with this government and chiefs in Ontario to ensure commitments made will be properly implemented.”

“CARP (Canada’s largest advocacy organization for older adults) has been calling for significant changes to safeguard Canadians as we age—the government has listened,” said Laura Tamblyn Watts, CARP’s chief public policy officer. “CARP applauds the federal government for taking decisive action in reducing the GIS claw-back, increasing federal pension protections, supporting deferred annuities for seniors, a new EI caregiving benefit and housing supports for low income seniors.”

“We also are very pleased to see some funding for a National Dementia Strategy, increases to the New Horizons for Seniors Program and automatic enrolment in CPP for adults over 70. Investments in digital connections and municipalities will also reduce social isolation and improve aging in place.”

On the senior front, the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) weighed in on a positive note. “Canadian workers, their families and their communities will benefit from new budgetary measures that lay the groundwork for curbing exorbitant medicine prices, income inequality, and climate change,” said CLC President Hassan Yussuff. “We are pleased to see a budget that acknowledges some of the most pressing issues facing Canadians, because these are the issues that voters will be taking to the ballot box in the federal election.”

The Royal Canadian Legion announced itself “pleased to see a range of investments for veterans and families but awaits additional information on the mechanisms to be used and the programs the funding will support.”

In highlights, the budget also includes: $22.8 billion in new spending over six fiscal years; a 2018-19 deficit projection of $14.9 billion, down slightly from the fall; a 2019-20 deficit projection of $19.8 billion (with a $3 billion risk adjustment); With debt of $685.6 billion, projected to rise to $761.7 billion by 2023-24. This will bring the debt-to-GDP ratio to a projected 30.8 per cent, falling to 28.6 per cent by 2023-24.

As an election goodies budget, the plan includes some $1.25 billion over three years on a shared-equity mortgage program for first-time home buyers; a RRSP withdrawal limit for first-time home buyers rise to $35,000 from $25,000; $3.25 billion to Indigenous Services for water quality, child welfare, education and other supports; $2.2 billion for one-time doubling of Gas Tax cash for cities’ infrastructure spending; $1.2 billion over five years for border security and modernization, and for the asylum system; a Personalized Canada Training Credit of $250 a year (up to $5,000 lifetime) for job retraining; a credit of up to $5,000 for purchases of electric vehicles; the interest rate on Canada Student Loans will be lowered to prime and will be interest-free for six months after graduation; the creation of a Canadian Drug Agency for bulk-buying of drugs and a national strategy on high-cost drugs; the airport security screening agency CATSA will become an arm’s-length agency, with additional funding of $597 million over two years; $553 million more over the next three years—$374 million of it by next April—to fix the failed Phoenix pay system; low-income working seniors will be able to earn more without giving up GIS benefits and $595 million will go to support journalism (including a 15 percent tax credit for digital news subscriptions).

Posted on March 27, 2019 by Sunny South News

Government budgets often offer some benefits for voters, but when the budget precedes an election, there’s a lot in common with Christmas — there are plenty of gifts, and you try not to think about having to pay for them later.

So it is with the Liberal government’s federal budget tabled last week that will dole out billions of dollars in new spending on all sorts of goodies for Canadians — many of them aimed at helping middle-class voters save money.

The Liberals were aided by the fact that a stronger economy has produced higher-than expected revenue — a projected extra $27.8 billion over the next six years.

Based on Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s plan, the Liberals will spend $22.8 billion of that additional money.

The budget includes: $1.7 billion over five years, and $586 million a year after that, for a Canada Training Benefit to help workers upgrade their skills and learn new ones while staying in their current jobs; $1.18 billion over five years to tighten border security, including hiring more judges to handle judicial reviews of asylum applications; $3.9 billion for farmers (the majority of them in the vote-rich provinces of Ontario and Quebec) in supply-managed industries affected by new trade agreements with the U.S. and Asian countries; $2.2 billion for municipalities’ and First Nations’ infrastructure projects; $950 million for municipal governments to make their buildings more energy-efficient and to provide subsidy programs to help homeowners do the same; $300 million over three years for rebates of up to $5,000 on electric or hydrogen-fuel-cell vehicles.

The budget also calls for putting money toward lowering the interest rate on Canada Student Loans to the prime rate, and to create a new Canadian Drug Agency to centralize evaluations of new drugs and to buy in bulk nationwide, instead of province-by-province.

The provisions include measures to make housing more affordable, particularly for first-time buyers, by increasing the amount they can borrow from RRSPs and by having the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. contribute a small share of equity for down payments.

The budget also provides new rules that will let working seniors keep more of the money they earn before triggering a claw-back in the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS).

The Canada Training Benefit will provide a tax credit of up to $250 per year to help with covering up to half the cost of job training, such as fees for a college course or other professional training programs. Such training is increasingly becoming crucial to help workers keep their skills up to date in a fast-changing workplace.

Similarly, helping working seniors keep more of their earnings in their pockets will be useful in a world where more seniors are having to remain on the job in order to make ends meet.

Of course, all these goodies have to be paid for, and the money for that ultimately comes from taxpayers’ pockets.

The Canadian Press points out the new budget will result in a 2019-20 federal deficit projection of $19.8 billion, including a $3-billion “risk adjustment,” an increase of $200 million from last year’s forecast. The Liberals’ plan includes a gradual reduction in the deficit, but that will happen more slowly than the government anticipated last year.

Morneau’s 460-page budget is titled “Investing in the Middle Class,” but it could perhaps be more appropriately called “Investing in Middle-Class Voters.”

Rather than using the unexpected windfall to reduce the debt or balance the budget, the Liberals have opted to spend the money like a carefree Vegas vacationer who just got lucky at the slot machines.

China’s plans will depend heavily on what happens in the fall federal election. “If we have a change in government, everything could change ...","Atlantic Canadian seafood exports could be the next target in growing trade tensions between Canada and China, something experts say would deal a huge blow to the industry.

China, a major market for Canadian canola, is no longer importing the product, citing contamination concerns, something producers say is unwarranted.

But some have suggested that the block has more to do with Canada’s decision to arrest Meng Wanzhouin in December, vice-president of Chinese tech giant Huawei and daughter of the company’s CEO.

“Right now the focus is very much canola because it’s so symbolic. . . . It is the one commodity that is so linked to the Canadian brand across the world, but I wouldn’t exclude embargoes or measures affecting other commodities like beef pork, wheat and of course lobster or seafood,” Sylvain Charlebois, a professor in food distribution and policy at Dalhousie University, told The Chronicle Herald.

Though technically countries cannot issue embargoes for political reasons, Charlebois said it’s a tactic many countries, including China, employ.

“China can’t go out and say because you arrested Ms. Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver we no longer want your product. It’s illegal. ... You’ll be warned by the World Trade Organization or you could even be fined and reprimanded,” he explained. “You have to [cite] other reasons and food safety is often the safe way to do it.”

Charlebois said he expects China’s plans will depend heavily on what happens in the fall federal election.

“If we have a change in government, everything could change, but if we actually stick to what we have now I think a lot of people in Ottawa will need to go back to school and take some diplomacy 101 classes as soon as possible,” he said.

According to government figures, of the $1.5 billion in Atlantic Canadian goods exported to China in 2017, over 43 per cent were seafood, fishing and aquaculture products, with lobster topping the list in terms of value.

“... I think a lot of people in Ottawa will need to go back to school and take some diplomacy 101 classes as soon as possible."" - Sylvain Charlebois

And governments have been putting significant effort into keeping that relationship strong — a joint trade mission to China in the fall that included Atlantic premiers and federal ministers saw a major focus on seafood exports.

Speaking with The Chronicle Herald, Fisheries Minister Keith Colwell said ,while Nova Scotia’s seafood industry hasn’t seen any reduction in sales in China, his department reached out to some key Chinese purchasers as recently as last week to put forward some of these concerns surrounding tensions between China and Canada. Colwell said the conversations were encouraging.

“[According] to discussions we’ve had with them it’s business as usual. ... We’re here to do business, that’s the message we’ve delivered and they’ve told us the same thing,” Colwell said.

“We don’t want to be part of the continuing issues that are happening between the U.S. and China and Canada and China. We look at China as a preferred customer for our products and we really enjoy working with them, it’s been a very good experience for us and we hope it stays that way.”

In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for International Trade Minister Jim Carr said the Canadian government is “committed to expanding opportunities for Canadian businesses of all sizes to compete and succeed in fast-growing markets around the world, and that includes China.”

A perfect storm?

The Canadian seafood industry benefited significantly from the trade war between the U.S. and China, as tariff-free Canadian lobster and other seafood products are now significantly more affordable. In Nova Scotia alone, seafood exports to China increased by 36 per cent in 2018 to $524 million and remains the second-largest market for seafood exports after the U.S., the provincial government said in a news release this month.

But, Stewart Lamont, managing director of Nova Scotia-based Tangier Lobster Company, warned that all could change.

Lamont said, because of China’s retaliatory tariffs on American seafood, which have created an unprecedented 25 per cent comparative advantage over American lobster since they were imposed in July, Atlantic Canada has become extraordinarily dependent on the mainland China market.

“We have priced Chinese demand into our shore pricing for live lobster since October. We are paying fishers two to three dollars more per pound on average above more recent pricing. This is terrific as long as we can pass the greater cost to the marketplace,” Lamont said. “Unfortunately from December to this minute all markets have struggled to pay the new pricing. Canada, America, Europe and Asia all take the position in the marketplace that our pricing is now too high for their clients.”

“We have priced Chinese demand into our shore pricing for live lobster since October."" - Stewart Lamont

Sooner or later, Lamont said, China and the U.S. will end the trade and tariff war that is costing both counties trillions, and live lobster exports from America to China would resume overnight. And because American live lobster is dramatically less expensive than Canadian, U.S. suppliers would go from having a 25 per cent disadvantage to a three dollar per pound advantage almost immediately.

Lamont said he wouldn’t be surprised to see an embargo placed on seafood similar to the one China has placed on canola, as both industries have a similar value. He said if China and the U.S. resolve their trade issues at the same time, the result could spell disaster for Atlantic Canada’s seafood industry.

“If we had a ban, 40 per cent of our international market, in theory, would disappear immediately, the worst nightmare is if the two things happen simultaneously,” Lamont said. “We would not be serving ourselves well in Atlantic Canada if we didn’t factor these [geopolitical concerns] into our model going forward. We should try and mitigate our risk, and we should try to pursue additional markers so we’re not so reliant on any given market.”

Affordability expected to dominate federal election campaign

New research has found that affordability will likely dominate the upcoming federal election.

A new public opinion poll has found 48 per cent of Canadians are worried about the rising cost of living and not having enough income to cover their expenses.

A total of 57 per cent listed issues of affordability, economic inequality, wages and taxes, as their top vote drivers for the upcoming federal election. Pharmacare and healthcare costs also rated highly. When shown options to improve affordability, good jobs, healthcare costs, fairer taxes, reducing costs of products and services received the strongest level of support

The survey also found a strong link between affordability anxiety and broader opinions and attitudes about the future economy, immigration, tax rates for the rich, and government regulation of corporations.

The poll was conducted by Abacus Data and presented at the Broadbent Institute’s Progress Summit in Ottawa to shed light on the roots of rising populism and explore progressive solutions to the problems that worry Canadians most.

“Most Canadians believe that while the cost of living and income inequality has gotten worse over the last few years, corporate profits are doing fine,” said David Coletto, CEO of Abacus Data. “What’s quite striking in the results is that both political leaders and corporate Canada are being held responsible for the worsening financial circumstances many Canadians are experiencing.”

“It’s clear both from the polling and from events here and around the world, ignoring rising affordability fears comes with great risk,” said Katrina Miller, Program Director for the Broadbent Institute.

“Many of the affordability concerns people have are natural ground for progressives,” and stagnant wages,” said Miller. “The research tells us we need to offer concrete proposals on issues like housing, healthcare, good jobs, fairer taxes to address affordability in the short and long-term.”

“We have to be careful. If affordability anxiety grows and people feel left out of the economic shift underway, they will be suspectable to divisive rhetoric that pits people against each other,” said Coletto. “There’s a growing group of what I call ‘anxious populists’ who will have a big influence of the next election. They are the least partisan and most persuadable group, so in a sense, they are up for grabs for whoever can make them the best offer.”

“We can’t stand by and allow the politics of division to take hold,” said Miller. “Progressive movements and leaders must listen closely to what ‘anxious populists’ are saying and provide a well-marked path to economic inclusion that gives them hope for the future.”",Affordability expected to dominate federal election campaign,Blackburn News,https://blackburnnews.com/midwestern-ontario/midwestern-ontario-news/2019/03/28/affordability-expected-dominate-federal-election-campaign/
25,Business,2019-03-28T10:35:00.0000000Z,"The motivation to procure votes in Quebec for the upcoming election was extremely obvious ... also known as the United States, Mexico and Canada Agreement. This is likely the Liberals' way of stating that the deal is damaging for many agricultural sectors ...","Most people expected an electoral budget, and that is exactly what Canadians got. For the agrifood sector, the budget was underwhelming at best, and provided little hope for the near future.

Let's start with supply management. It was interesting to see that the Liberals opted to do exactly what the Harper government did in the middle of an election campaign, back in 2015. At the time, the Conservatives hastily announced an out-of-nowhere $4-billion compensation package for supply-managed sectors, amid signing the defunct Transpacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, now known as Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). As in 2015, the Liberals provided no hint as to how they intend to make our supply-managed sectors more competitive in the future. Monies will be allocated based on speculation and presumptions, just to buy peace, since no timeline for the compensation was provided.

This time, the sum of $3.9 billion in funding is budgeted, which includes $2.15 billion in direct compensation. The sum also includes another $1.5 billion for a Quota Value Guarantee Program that would be applied on an on-demand basis when the quota has been sold. In other words, Canadians will be acquiring quotas back from farmers, initially given out years ago, and at no charge. The motivation to procure votes in Quebec for the upcoming election was extremely obvious. To do this right, the budget should have also looked beyond supply management, to support other sectors that are also negatively affected by trade.

So, this is the path chosen by the Liberals. We get to keep an outdated system while subsidizing farmers who have prided themselves for years on not accepting public subsidies. Compensating farmers without a plan for the future of supply management is the worst possible scenario for everyone, starting with the farmers themselves. They will only see their sector shrink further, especially in dairy, and many more farms will disappear with no strategy for less populous regions in the country, like the Prairies and the Atlantic. This will be a slow and painful way to go.

Nothing is planned for other commodities, including canola, pulses and others, affected by quasi-embargoes and trade disputes. There is a small budget, at least, set aside for African Swine Fever, a disaster-in-waiting for our hog sector. It is just a matter of time before the disease hits North America. Once it does, we'll need to brace ourselves for another mad cow type of scenario.

What was interesting is that the compensation program does not extend to concessions made under NAFTA 2.0, also known as the United States, Mexico and Canada Agreement. This is likely the Liberals' way of stating that the deal is damaging for many agricultural sectors and therefore stands little or no chance of being ratified. This is as good an admission as we will get from the Liberals, and we should not expect more. It is also probably the only thing which made sense for the agrifood sector in this budget.

Some provisions were made for a food strategy. If Canada wants to make good on the aspirations of our newly-minted Food Guide, our agricultural landscape will need to change, and follow a new, much needed strategy. We need more fruits and vegetables in this country. However, a budget of $134 million over five years toward this end is hardly anything. Quebec, a province with a population of under nine million and which has just adopted its own food strategy, is spending more than double that sum, in this year alone.

Our food processing folks, who represent the largest manufacturing sector in the country, were given peanuts. The budget plans to award $100 million to support innovation and plant upkeep projects. Given that the cradle of food innovation has always been food processing, that sum is almost insulting to the 250,000 people working in this sector.

A total of $24 million is dedicated to food fraud, in support of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)'s effort to crack down on the cheaters. It is estimated that food fraud is costing our agrifood sector anywhere between $10 to $30 billion a year. This problem is massive, so the CFIA needs all the help it can get.

For agrifood, this budget regrettably doesn't accomplish much, other than admitting that the USMCA trade agreement was a bad deal. But everyone knew that already. For the rest, the budget feels like the Liberals, an urban-focused government, are simply checking boxes to please a sector that it barely understands. But Canadians are smarter than that.",Sylvain Charlebois: Federal budget leaves Canada’s agrifood sector with worst possible scenario,The Hamilton Spectator,https://www.thespec.com/opinion-story/9235612-sylvain-charlebois-federal-budget-leaves-canada-s-agrifood-sector-with-worst-possible-scenario/

This scene has been repeated around the world; in Nigeria, Ecuador, Indonesia and elsewhere. In what economists call the “resource curse,” countries with minerals or oil are exploited by foreign powers and end up with damaged land, poisoned waters and sullied air.

In a new twist to an old tale, however, the foreign power in this case is Canada, and the indebted nation is the United States. Specifically, Boulder County, Colorado.

It began in October 2015, when the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), the $368 billion behemoth that invests payroll withholding taxes from Canada’s workers on behalf of 20 million contributors, announced a $609 million USD deal to purchase all of the oil and gas assets in the Denver-Julesburg Basin owned by Canadian oil and gas giant Encana.

Many of Encana’s holdings were located in rapidly growing suburban areas near homes and schools north of Denver astride the Interstate 25 corridor between Colorado’s capital and its fourth-largest city, Fort Collins. Others were in communities that had banned hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, such as Broomfield and Boulder counties. The oil and gas industry challenged those bans, and the legal fight reached the Colorado Supreme Court as the Encana deal was being negotiated. The fracking bans were overturned, and when the dust settled, CPPIB had picked up a chunk of sub-surface Colorado real estate and wells producing approximately 30 per cent less than had been announced just months earlier.

It was moving full-steam ahead into a Colorado firestorm of opposition. With all the investments in the world available to them, why would widows in Winnipeg, retirees in Richibucto and teachers in Toronto choose to invest in Colorado’s escalating fracking wars?

TOXIC ASSETS

It may simply be that the CPPIB was willing to go where other companies wouldn’t – the pension board thought they scored a deal from a distressed seller that would yield strong long-term results for their beneficiaries.

The fact that the CPPIB created a new oil and gas company in Colorado, the CPPIB-registered Crestone Peak Resources LLC, rather than simply investing in an existing Canadian-owned one added another quizzical twist to the deal.

John Bennett, a senior policy advisor at the environmental group Friends of the Earth Canada, suggests it may be because fracking is highly controversial in Canada, where three of 10 provinces have banned the practice.

“I don’t think they would ever have invested in a fracking company in Canada,” says Bennett. “Most Canadians would be surprised to know they own a fracking oil company in Colorado.”

Denise Melanson, 70, is one such Canadian. A retired medical social worker who lives in Richibucto, New Brunswick, Melanson had been involved in passing the moratorium in the province. Melanson also receives two pensions from the CPPIB: one that she paid into during her years of employment, and the other she calls an “old-age” benefit that she started receiving when she was 65.

When she learned that some of her benefits might be coming from fracking operations in Colorado, she said in a phone interview, “I was horrified. I’d much rather not be receiving money that was earned by making other people miserable.”

Most Coloradans would also be surprised to know that Canadian pensioners are invested in drilling operations in suburban backyards.

“I have to wonder if the beneficiaries of the pension fund’s investments understand what they’re investing in,” says Boulder County Commissioner Elise Jones. As far as she knows, virtually every elected official in the county – including those from its municipalities – as well as the overwhelming majority of people who live here, oppose the kind of residential drilling plans Crestone is proposing.

Concerns range from the planned drilling around homes and schools, to negative health effects from the industrial facilities’ emissions, to the oil and gas industry’s impact on the Denver metropolitan area’s persistently poor air quality.

FOLLOWING THE MONEY

Along with its purchase of these controversial assets, Crestone was also invested in Colorado’s 2018 election.

Oil and gas issues figured prominently up and down the ballot, from the governor’s race to several ballot initiatives. And Crestone contributed $607,500 to support groups that directly or indirectly opposed Proposition 112, the failed initiative that would have required new oil and gas development to be placed at least 2,500 feet from homes and schools.

Crestone, for example, donated to the pro-industry group Protect Colorado, which campaigned to defeat 112, and other political groups backing Republican state legislature candidates that unswervingly support the oil and gas industry.

Austin Graham, legal counsel for the Campaign Legal Center in Washington, DC, reviewed Crestone’s contributions for their legality.

Federal law requires that foreign-owned companies’ contributions to state campaigns meet a two-part test: the contributions must be drawn from money made from U.S. operations; and the person making the decision to donate must be a U.S. citizen.

But since Crestone is a privately held, Canadian-owned company, it is not obvious where the money came from or who made the decision to contribute to the election.

Crestone states in an email that it follows all state and federal laws, and as a company operating in Colorado, “Crestone allocates a certain amount of funds each year to dedicate to organizations and initiatives that are important to our team. Crestone leadership ultimately makes the decision on which organizations these funds are donated to.”

Those organizations include “independent expenditure committees,” which are also allowed to receive contributions from foreign-owned corporations.

“Regardless of whether any laws were broken,” says Graham, the CPPIB “spent a substantial amount of money trying to influence Colorado voters.”

RESIDENTIAL IMPACTS OF OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT

Crestone has applied for a Comprehensive Drilling Plan (CDP) to move into Boulder County, but the applications for drilling permits are still awaiting approval from the Colorado Oil & Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC), which is slated to meet about Crestone’s CDP in late April in Boulder.

If approved, the plans will have to survive an ongoing lawsuit filed by Boulder County that a judge recently ruled must wait for the COGCC’s final approval to move forward. The company will be subject to Boulder County’s new oil and gas regulations that went into place in March 2017. A bill that would impose greater regulation upon the industry, in part by beefing up local control of drilling, may bolster Boulder County’s position. However, industry representatives have vowed to develop their mineral rights in accordance with whatever Colorado law permits.

Although Boulder County has not seen any new drilling since its ban was lifted in 2016, the impacts of residential oil and gas development are plain to see.

In Weld County, there are 21,694 active wells, according to COGCC. At the same time, new homes have been built within 120 feet of existing oil and gas facilities.

Pressure has been mounting for years around the state to put some brakes on the industry. There have been repeated fires at oil and gas sites, as well as a deadly explosion in 2017 from an abandoned pipeline located less than 200 feet from a home in Firestone, which killed two people. Recent scientific reports state that Weld County’s hydrocarbon production is sullying Boulder County’s air and contributing significantly to pollution in the Denver metro region, which has placed Colorado in the crosshairs of the Environmental Protection Agency for its worsening “non-attainment” of federal clean air standards.

WELCOME TO ""EERIE""

Perhaps no place illuminates these conflicts better than Crestone’s operations in Erie, a former farming community in Boulder and Weld counties with a population of about 2,000 that has grown to a bedroom community of about 25,000 residents today. The first citizen complaint against Crestone’s operations with the COGCC was filed just three months after the CPPIB/Encana deal was finalized.

Noise from a drilling operation smack in the middle of Erie was so loud it was “like a huge semi truck parked in our driveway,” according to one complaint. Others reported rumbling and shaking of Erie homes, pictures falling from walls and disturbing vibrations night and day for weeks on end. Dank smells emanated from the drilling sites, which were just a few hundred feet away from rows of homes, parks, schools, a skate park and even the city offices. Residents joked that their town should be renamed “Eerie.”

Monica Korber who works from her Erie home as a consultant, recalls trying to sleep while her bed was shaking through the night. Soon dozens of people were sharing stories on social media and asking what Crestone was doing to rattle their lives so viscerally. “We never got a straight answer,” Korber said.

After the rumblings stopped the project, Crestone pressed on. Soon, Erie residents were complaining at COGCC meetings and on the agency’s website about noxious smells, leaks, nosebleeds, headaches, industrial noises and lights burning all night outside their bedroom windows.

Erie’s experience with Crestone isn’t isolated. More than 1,000 complaints against Crestone’s operations were filed with the COGCC between November 2016 and February 2019 – almost twice as many as the next five oil and gas companies conducting business in Colorado combined.

Crestone spokesperson Jason Oates has repeatedly stated that residents have abused the complaint process in Erie by organizing complaining campaigns.

In its email response to my questions, Crestone’s public relations department says that, “while none of the complaints resulted in a violation of state standards by the COGCC or the CDPHE [Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment], we knew we needed to make some changes in our operations. We took an above-and-beyond approach to further lessen the temporary impacts that we may have on neighbouring communities.”

One flurry of complaints came after Crestone’s operations caused a release of toxic gases at a site in Erie just 25 yards from the Aspen Ridge Preparatory School playground in September 2017. Crestone was plugging and abandoning a set of wells, and had been venting large quantities of volatile organic compounds before a resident smelled noxious fumes and complained to the COGCC. Those toxic emissions wafted directly onto the school playground of the Kiddie Academy Childcare Center and the elementary school, according to the COGCC’s report on the incident.

The COGCC ordered Crestone to cease operations until the problem was fixed, but parents say they didn’t hear about the leak for months. Mark Kadlececk, who has three children who attended Aspen Ridge, found the “Notice of Alleged Violation” posted on the COGCC website more than six weeks after the violation.

The COGCC fined Crestone $10,000, according to Mike Leonard, the agency’s community relations manager.

Christiaan van Woudenberg, one of Erie’s newly elected trustees, says that when companies like Crestone come into small communities such as Erie, dangling potential tax revenue and arguing (as Crestone spokesman Oates told a community meeting) that there are “no health impacts” from fracking, it is almost impossible not to be steamrolled. He says local elected officials are also hamstrung by state laws that limit their ability to say no to new oil and gas development.

“Erie is fracked,” van Woudenberg says. “We lost. We’re the cautionary tale.”

INVESTMENT QUESTIONS

Besides the fact that Crestone is seeking to operate in communities that oppose it, there’s a larger question for the CPPIB: is residential drilling in Colorado a smart investment?

Crestone continues to face legal challenges that are increasing the cost of doing business in Colorado. The company has been involved in lawsuits, protests, leaks and alleged violations of state regulations in multiple communities. Crestone, in turn, has sued the state and at least one other oil and gas company, alleging interference in its operations.

While Crestone is private, there are several clues that the CPPIB’s Colorado investment may be problematic. As of last month, the CPPIB’s website stated that the value of the investment had dropped to $543 million from the purchase price of $609 million.

Analysts are also divided about the future of shale development, with some predicting slow growth in 2019 and others convinced that many parts of the industry are burdened with debt and uncertainty regarding future regulatory regimes, international price fluctuations and the increasingly competitive cost of renewable energy technology. Other investors remain bullish on oil stocks but are moving away from riskier investments in politically volatile countries such as Venezuela, Russia, and Saudi Arabia, and are looking to U.S. fracking operations as a safer alternative. Both Noble Energy and Anadarko reported record Colorado oil production in 2018.

Then there’s climate change. Canada, a signatory to the Paris climate agreement, faces some cognitive dissonance with the CPPIB’s fossil fuel portfolio. Financial and legal analysts as well as climate activists point out that Canada cannot export its fossil fuel investments and still claim it is moving to reduce its carbon footprint.

In a report released in January entitled Time To Act, Canadian law professors Janis Sarra (University of British Columbia) and Cynthia Williams (Osgoode Hall Law School at York University) conclude that, “The CPPIB has enormous potential to help shift governance practice to meet the issues discussed in this report.”

That potential has yet to be unleashed, says Williams in an interview. Canada is heavily invested in the oil and gas sector, and all recent indicators are that those investments “already have a lot of risk,” she says, partly exemplified by the drop in value of the Canadian dollar and declining returns from oil and gas investments in comparison to other sectors. “Why would the CPP double down on oil and gas developments?”

Various organizations in Canada have tried to push the CPPIB towards a more sustainable, lower-carbon portfolio, without much success, says Bennett. The CPPIB has expressly avoided committing itself to environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments, stating that, “Consistent with the CPP Investment Board’s belief that constraints decrease returns and/or increase risk over time, we do not screen stocks or eliminate investments based on ESG factors. The CPP Investment Board considers the securities of any issuer all of whose businesses are lawful, and would be lawful if carried on in Canada, as eligible for investment.”

As many of the affected residents have noted, what is lawful in Colorado isn’t necessarily admirable. Many state laws were written in an earlier era of oil and gas exploration. They never anticipated new horizontal drilling and fracking techniques that allow companies like Crestone to build pads of 10, 20 and 30 wells and drill underneath hundreds of people’s homes for miles in every direction. These well pads are accompanied by rows of storage tanks, condensers, combustors and separators, as well as thousands of truck trips a day in and out of these mini-industrial complexes.

BURNING UP THE PLANET

Groups looking to aggressively address climate change are targeting pension funds around the world. As concerns resonate across the globe, investments in fossil fuel companies are increasingly seen as bad bets. Viable alternatives are emerging – with better financial rewards.

In the U.S., the divestment movement has made great strides in the past few years ever since Stanford University made headlines by selling off its coal stocks in 2014. Clara Vondrich, global director of DivestInvest – a philanthropic movement that encourages large institutional investors to move away from fossil fuels in favor of more sustainable investments – says that since 2014, more than 1,000 institutional investors have committed to fossil-free investments, with growth of capital investments rising from $52 billion to more than $8 trillion today.

Various backdated investment comparisons such as those done by the U.S. divestment advocacy group As You Sow confirm that portfolios without fossil fuel investments would have performed better than those with them. Says Vondrich: “These are underperforming assets that are also burning up the planet.” Now, she says, the CPPIB and other large investors “increasingly have a fiduciary duty to explain why they don’t divest, rather than the other way around.”

CALLING EDMONTON

At a January 2019 conference hosted by the Rocky Mountain Mineral Law Foundation, Crestone’s Oates told the audience that the company had met all of the requirements laid out by the COGCC for its drilling plans, and Crestone would forge ahead into Boulder County despite resident and local governments’ objections. “It is how, not if, we are going to drill,” Oates told the audience.

Sara Loflin, executive director of the League of Oil and Gas Impacted Coloradans, attended the conference and was taken aback by the “arrogance” of Oates’ remarks. In response to multiple communities’ concerns ever since it started doing business in Colorado, Loflin said, Crestone has only proposed moving “closer to homes, in higher risk areas, in larger scale developments.”

In its email to this reporter, Crestone disputes this and says it aims “to operate safely, responsibly, efficiently and with minimal impact on local communities, while acting as good stewards for the land, air and water. This is a priority for us because as Coloradans, we value these natural assets, and we live here, too.”

Back in Erie, grandmother Monica Korber says that she and her neighbors suffer not just the proximity of the industrial operations, but also from the discord that they have unleashed on her community. She has joined a lawsuit against her elected officials for not doing more to protect Erie citizens.

They say that instead of repaying the federal government, that money can now be reinvested in programs, wellness, governance and youth.

Chiefs from the Dehcho, Inuvialuit, Gwich’in, Sahtu, Tlicho and South Slave regions were in Detah on Tuesday to meet with Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations Carolyn Bennett.

The Liberal government earmarked $1.4-billion over seven years for loan forgiveness across Canada in the 2019 federal budget.

Yellowknives Dene First Nation Chief Ernest Betsina said the decision is welcomed.

“This forgiveness grant will be provided to our future generations … and provide more opportunities that can support First Nations,” he said.

Betsina said past federal cutbacks under previous governments affected core funding, negotiations, language planning and housing.

Loan system to negotiate land claims not ‘successful’

In 2018, the federal government adopted a grant system to capture the “actual costs of self-government,” Bennett said.

The 2019 budget also sets aside $40 million over five years for First Nations to research and develop claims.

“Getting to self-government shouldn’t be based on loans anymore. People spending 20 years and then $30-million in debt to not quite get there, has just not been successful,” she said.

Negotiation on a loan basis was a hard-sell for communities, she said.

“If people don’t feel that things are fair then it’s pretty hard for them to get their communities behind them to do the work,” Bennett said.

‘Long ways to go’

Tlicho Grand Chief George Mackenzie told Bennett self-government will improve the future for young Indigenous people.

“Us in the Aboriginal world have a long ways to go yet, but we will not get there if we don’t have the federal support that we are seeking,” he said.

As the federal election approaches, Mackenzie said people will be looking for a party “committed 101 per cent to make things happen.”

“Our young people today, everywhere, are crying for help … we lack resources … we lack the funding,” he said.

Other negotiations proceeding

Yellowknives Dene Chief Ernest Betsina announced that Akaitcho First Nations could have an agreement in principle this year. They have been negotiating since 1992.

Grand Chief Gladys Norwegian reminded Bennett that the Dehcho First Nations have been in talks with Canada for nearly 20 years, and negotiations are stalled over surface and subsurface resource rights.

The Dehcho First Nations want to temporarily set aside land and resources and work on issues like education and self-government, Norwegian said.

“We are trying to decide how that looks like for us. It is a struggle and we really would like to move forward, but make sure that it is on our terms, that we are moving toward self-determination,” Norwegian said.

Meanwhile, K’atl’odeeche First Nation Chief April Martel says the community is leaning toward self-government, but has concerns about keeping reserve status under the Indian Act.

“That’s really powerful to our people because we don’t want to lose that. I want you to recognize that,” she said to Bennett.

The monthly Business Barometer index, by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, increased by 1.8 points in the province but Alberta business owners remain the least confident in the country.

“With a provincial election in full swing, Alberta’s entrepreneurs are looking for the parties to make meaningful policy commitments to help our province’s small and medium-sized business sector shake off the recession and start growing again. Having solid economic policies will be key to reinvigorating Alberta’s business confidence” said Richard Truscott, Vice-President, Alberta and BC, in a statement.

While small business confidence rose to 42.1 points in March, it continues to fall short of the national average of 55.9. The CFIB says the 65 to 75 point range (on the 100 point scale) indicates a healthy and growing economy.

The CFIB survey in Alberta also found that 11 per cent of business owners are expecting their full-time employment levels to go up in the near future, representing a two-point increase from February’s results. Also, 60 per cent expect their full time employment level to remain the same, and 29 per cent expect it to decrease.

The provincial numbers for March were: Nova Scotia (66.8), Quebec (65.3), Prince Edward Island (59.7), Ontario (59.5), New Brunswick (56.6), British Columbia (55.9), Manitoba (51.4), Saskatchewan (50.8), Newfoundland & Labrador (48.7), and Alberta (42.1).

“Small business confidence continues to disappoint. The index moved sideways, near 60, for most of 2018, but has averaged 57 so far in 2019. This subdued performance is consistent with a moderating economy and downwardly revised growth forecasts. Reinforcing this point is an easing in indicators of capacity constraints, including lower gauges of inflationary pressures and reduced incidence of labour shortages as a factor limiting production,” said Omar Abdelrahman, an economist with TD Economics.

“The resource-heavy provinces and natural resource sectors continue to weigh down on the index’s performance. With Alberta’s (oil producation) curtailment plan supporting prices in the near term, some of this weakness should be reversed. That said, confidence in the sector and the province are likely to remain weak for some time given structural issues related to market access, uncertainty related to global oil prices, and weaknesses in the outlook for some other commodities that will impact the Prairies more broadly.”

Issues of law and order are always ripe for political debate. But in recent years, there’s been much discussion of an increase in rural crime across the province.

In March 2018, the provincial government issued a seven-point plan, along with $10 million in funding, to mitigate rural crime.

Brooks-Medicine Hat NDP candidate Lynn MacWilliam says this plan created specialized Rural Crime Reduction Units and adds 39 new RCMP officers, 40 civilian staff and 10 prosecutors to focus on rural crime.

According to her, there’s been a 16 per cent reduction in rural crime between December 2017 and December 2018, with 480 fewer homes broken into, 3,500 fewer thefts and 1,200 fewer vehicles stolen.

“I need to stress that not every community has seen the same level of decreases and the problem won’t be solved overnight, but Rachel Notley and the RCMP have been making real progress,” said MacWilliam.

Michaela Glasgo, the UCP candidate in Brooks-Medicine Hat, says combating rural crime would be a major priority of a UCP government, pointing to their July 2018 report, “A Safer Alberta: United Conservative Strategy to Tackle the Rural Crime Crisis.”

“The recommendations contained in the report are actions that can be taken to strengthen police response capability, effectively deal with repeat offenders, improve data collection, combat court delays, improve services for victims, strengthen crime prevention efforts, and reduce property crime in rural communities,” said Glasgo.

She says a UCP government would also introduce a bill modelled after “Clare’s Law” in the U.K., which allows police to notify women if their partner has an abusive past.

According to Statistics Canada, Alberta has the third-highest rate of reported domestic violence in the country, behind Saskatchewan and Manitoba.

The riding’s Alberta Party candidate Jim Black – a former police officer – says the Alberta Party’s shadow budget includes funding for policing in rural municipalities.

“We’ve been saying this for over two years as part of our policy platform, so I think we’re ahead of the NDP in this area by a substantial margin,” he said.

Black says many rural police forces are understaffed and overwhelmed, which makes it harder to dedicate the resources necessary to effectively fight crime.

“That’s not a very pleasant position to be in, when you’re running from scene to scene. You end up chasing your tail because you don’t have enough manpower to support the community’s needs,” he said.

Todd Beasley, the independent conservative candidate for Brooks-Medicine Hat, says he wants to “re-allocate resources so we can improve the response times” for police in rural areas.

“I think we need to put law and order first, and law breakers second,” he said. “Our criminal justice system seems to have it wrong at times.”

He called it “ridiculous” that rural landowners who shoot intruders are criminally charged, the result of a “liberal law system that is protecting the criminal over protecting people in rural areas.”

Beasley says the province should pressure the federal government, which is responsible for amending the Criminal Code, to take a more “punitive” approach.

“I stand by the landowners,” said Beasley. “If you break the law, I’m not on your side. In fact, I’m your enemy.”

He said he likes the UCP’s plan, but “maybe it needs to be a little bit tougher.”

The proposed law sets the province's right-leaning Coalition Avenir Qubec (CAQ) government on a collision course with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who promotes religious freedom, in a federal election year with Quebec a vital battleground.

“It is unthinkable to me that in a free society we would legitimise discrimination against citizens based on their religion,” Trudeau told reporters in Halifax on Thursday.

Take a look: Is the niqab going to determine Canada’s next prime minister?

The legislation, which is expected to pass, will cover public workers in positions of authority, including teachers, judges and police officers. It exempts current government employees and civil servants in the mainly French-speaking province.

Governments in Quebec have been trying for years to restrict civil servants from wearing overt religious symbols like headscarves and Jewish skullcaps at work in an effort to cement a secular society.

A ban on full face coverings on anyone giving or receiving public services in Quebec passed in 2017, but was suspended by a Canadian judge last June and remains in legal limbo.

Examine: 'It is not their faces they're hiding, it is their fears'

The CAQ was elected late last year in part on pledges to restrict immigration and impose a secular charter.

Quebec Premier Francois Legault told reporters on Thursday the bill “represents our values and it's important.”

But condemnation was quick, with Jewish advocacy group B'nai Brith calling the bill “an assault on the fundamental rights and freedoms of Quebecers,” while the National Council of Canadians Muslims said it will make Muslims and other minorities “second-class citizens” and overwhelmingly impact Muslim women.

Like France, which passed a ban on veils, crosses and other religious symbols in schools in 2004, Quebec has struggled to reconcile its secular identity with a growing Muslim population, many of them North African emigrants.

While the Quebec legislation does not single out any religion by name, Muslim headwear have long been a source of public debate in Quebec.

Quebec's minister for the status of women drew condemnation from opposition politicians earlier this year after she said the hijab is a symbol of female oppression.

And a Montreal-area municipal politician faced backlash this weekend after she wrote a Facebook post expressing her anger over being treated by a doctor wearing a hijab, calling the headscarf a symbol of the “Islamification of our country.”

WINNIPEG, March 27 (MarketsFarm) – ICE Futures canola contracts were weaker at the end of trading on Wednesday, as tensions between Canada and China has continued to weigh on values.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday he will consider sending a high-level delegation to China to discuss the ongoing situation between the two countries. His announcement came after China banned Viterra from selling canola to the country.

China took the action against Viterra yesterday in the same fashion it banned canola shipments from Richardson International earlier this month – in that Chinese authorities alleged they found hazardous pests in the shipments.

The dispute stems from the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou by Canadian authorities in December at the request of United States authorities. Meng is now facing extradition to the U.S., where she faces fraud charges.

The Canadian dollar was down at 74.57 U.S. cents by mid-afternoon on Wednesday, which provided some support.

Support also came from canola now being more competitive with other vegetable oils and improvements in the crush margins.

About 13,555 contracts were traded on Wednesday, which compares with Tuesday when approximately 24,000 contracts changed hands.

SOYBEAN futures at the Chicago Board of Trade were weaker on Wednesday.

Trade talks between the United States and China are set for Thursday and Friday in China, with a Chinese delegation travelling to the U.S. next week for further negotiations. While a final deal is still expected by the end of April, there are indications it might be delayed. U.S. President Donald Trump wants a deal completed no later than the 2020 Presidential Election, which kicks off early next year.

There are indications that tariffs the U.S. and China have imposed on each other in their trade war will not cease immediately with a final agreement. Rather, the tariffs could be gradually eliminated.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture releases two reports on March 29, its Prospective Planting report and its Grain Stocks report. Traders have been positioning themselves ahead of Friday.

The American Farm Bureau has estimated there is US$76 billion of corn and soybeans in the Mississippi and Missouri River basins that could be at risk to flooding. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has forecast unprecedented flooding this spring in those basins.

CORN futures were also weaker on Wednesday, as Ukraine’s exports are up. As of March 21, Ukraine’s exports stand at 302.3 million tonnes for an increase of 22.7 per cent year-over-year.

Conservative Party of Canada seats in the ...","David Anderson figures he’s put around three-quarters of a million kilometres on a succession of vehicles, and flown a couple million more, over his 19-year career in federal politics.

Now, Saskatchewan’s longest-serving Conservative Member of Parliament — and one of just a few left from the Canadian Alliance days — says he won’t stand for re-election when Canadians go to the polls in the fall.

“We’ve put in six terms and at some point there’s a reason to go back to a normal life, particularly around family life,” Anderson said, adding that he spends about two-thirds of his time away from his wife, Sheila.

“It’s time that we started living our life together, not apart, and really enjoying our time together.”

Anderson was first elected to represent Cypress Hills — Grassland in 2000, and was re-elected with wide margins in five subsequent elections. In 2015, he won more than 25,000 votes, good for 69 per cent of the total.

In an interview on Monday, the veteran MP — among current members, only Liberal Ralph Goodale has held a Saskatchewan seat for longer — said he is most proud of the role he played in dissolving the Canadian Wheat Board.

At the time of the still-controversial decision, Anderson was Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture and the Canadian Wheat Board, a supporting role for former agriculture minister and Saskatchewan MP Gerry Ritz.

It is not immediately clear who will seek the nomination in the riding, one of the safest Conservative Party of Canada seats in the country. A party spokesman said the date for a nomination meeting has not been set.

“David — thank you for your dedication and your service to SW Sask and to the country. It has been an honour to work with you over the years,” Anderson’s friend, former Premier Brad Wall, said in a tweet on Monday.

Anderson, meanwhile, said he looks forward to spending less time on the road, but leaving public life behind won’t be easy.

“I don’t think anybody leaves easily. There’s a lot of really good things about this job; it’s an incredible privilege to be able to serve. So yeah, I expect there will be some days where it’ll be difficult, but it is the right thing … for us.”

THUNDER BAY – With an eye on this year’s federal election, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau found a friendly reception in Thunder Bay.

Trudeau capped his first visit to the city in nearly three years with a two-hour town hall style meeting at the CJ Sanders Fieldhouse on Lakehead University campus on Friday night, being joined by hundreds of mostly supportive city residents.

The prime minister fielded 17 questions from audience members, ranging from the environment, education, infrastructure and the economy.

Trudeau forecasted the environment and climate change as a potentially key election issue as his Liberals seek a second term while a coalition of provinces prepare to challenge a federally imposed carbon tax.

“There’s a few things we have to all agree on. I can’t believe I have to say this, but climate change is real and it’s a massive threat to our lives, our ecosystems, our well-being and our futures,” Trudeau said.

“Unfortunately, there are four provinces so far, coincidentally or not all led by conservative politicians including right here in Ontario, that refuse to move forward and put a price on pollution. They want to make pollution free again.”

Two of the environment-related questions also levelled criticism at Trudeau for last year’s decision to acquire the stalled Trans Mountain pipeline for $4.5 billion, with one person telling him that “climate leaders don’t buy pipelines.”

Trudeau responded that as long as the economy remains reliant upon fossil fuels, the government needs to ensure that Canadian oil can be sold at a fair price.

“Since we do have oil resources, the choices are putting them on tanker trucks, putting it on trains or putting it in a modern pipeline,” Trudeau said. “Pipelines remain the safest way to export our oil resources.”

While most of the questions hit on priority points for the Trudeau government, the prime minister could not dodge the SNC-Lavalin scandal that has resulted in the resignation of two cabinet ministers, a key staffer and the clerk of the Privy Council.

“You were saying how you were protecting the jobs. That’s been the common narrative, that you’re protecting the 9,000 jobs that SNC employs across Canada and in Quebec,” Michael Coccimiglio said. “Well, the SNC-Lavalin CEO said this week he never raised the issue of jobs with you and your team, yet that’s what everyone seems to be saying that’s the reason for all of this.”

That question drew a smattering of applause throughout the audience and launched Trudeau into a nine-minute answer, where he deflected the defections and took aim at the Conservatives for this weeks’ marathon vote in the House of Commons.

“Jody Wilson-Raybould, Celina Caesar-Chavannes and Dr. Jane Philpott have made decisions about their own positioning and their own perspective on this that I absolutely respect, but to a certain extent I disagree with,” Trudeau said.

“We have a situation where the Conservatives don’t even want to talk about (the budget) right now. They don’t want anyone else talking about it, so they’re trying to amplify this particular discussion.”

The crowd, which began filling the venue two hours prior to the start of the event, was largely appreciative of having the opportunity to share a room with the prime minister.

Meagan Harris, a Trudeau supporter in 2015, said she supports his government’s work with Indigenous people.

“I feel like he’s done a lot to focus on strengthening Indigenous relationships in Canada, which I think in our demographic is super important,” Harris said.

“I think it’s gotten better. For me personally, only under Trudeau’s government was my community (Missanabie Cree First Nation) granted their land back in June after 112 years.

Despite not being able to vote for another seven years, 11-year-old Parmida Akbari said she wanted to hear about the Trudeau’s plans for the upcoming election.

“I think that we should have a chance to understand what’s happening in our world,” she said. “I’m hoping to hear about his plan for the economy and about immigration.”",Upcoming election apparent during PM's town hall,Tbnewswatch,https://www.tbnewswatch.com/local-news/upcoming-election-apparent-during-pms-town-hall-1336746

Bottom line: Either ...,"Stephen Skyvington is on a mission to have an adult conversation about the dire state of health care in Canada and the need for revolutionary change.

Hired as manager of government relations by the Ontario Medical Association in 1995, Skyvington opened his own PR company PoliTrain Inc. in 2001 — he’s a lobbyist, consultant, pundit, veteran of the health care wars.

“Unfortunately, my detractors would have you believe I have a hidden agenda, that my goal is to foist on Canada a U.S.-style, two-tier health care system,” he quipped.

“The irony, however, is that if we continue to keep our heads buried in the sand like we have for the past 50 years, trying to prop up a system that simply isn’t sustainable, then we’ll indeed end up with exactly what our neighbours to the south have: a health care system that’s a bloody mess.”

In his new book, This May Hurt A Bit: Reinventing Canada’s Health Care System, Skyvington concludes it is time to properly fund Medicare or “free it,” citing the long-running Cambie constitutional trial as a potential watershed moment that might prompt the long-needed transformation.

Or not.

With the face of the challenge, Dr. Brian Day, founder of the private Cambie Surgery Centre and a former president of the Canadian Medical Association, supplying a cheerleading foreword, Skyvington offers a 200-odd-page indictment of the current health care system.

He has nothing but scorn for the present crop of politicians — too mealy-mouthed to tell the truth and too spineless to act.

“Remember those kids who used to sit at the back of the classroom?” Skyvington asked. “The troublemakers? The slow learners? The social misfits? Well, guess what? They’re the ones in charge now.”

In his view, the most vulnerable are put at risk and governments dodge responsibility.

“The solutions are seen in best practices of the many countries that deliver universal care far more effectively and efficiently than we do in Canada. Governments have, with the support of special interest groups, abrogated their duty to care for patients,” Skyvington said.

He pointed to Walid Khalfallah, from Kelowna, a paraplegic thanks to his encounter with the health care system.

“All because those running the show felt it was a reasonable risk for a young boy of thirteen to wait 27 months — that’s right, I said 27 months — for surgery on his spine. By the time Walid had the surgery in 2012, at Shriners Hospital in Spokane, Wash., it was too late.”

Young people better pay particular attention, he warned.

“Baby boomers like me will get $4,000 more health care services than we pay for in our lifetime through taxes, Millennials will pay $18,000 more in taxes than in services received for health care, and the iGens will pay $27,000 more in taxes than in services received because we are always paying for our parents, the generation ahead of us,” Skyvington said.

“The problem is there are too many of us (baby boomers), not enough of the iGens and Millennials, plus they have all this school debt, they’re working two jobs, they’re living in their parents’ basement instead of having a house and building equity.”

How many ministries of health do we currently have in Canada?

“Believe it or not,” he fumed, “the answer is 14! Ten provincial, three territorial, and one federal. Each province and territory has a health minister and a health ministry chock full of civil servants, most of whom never see a patient. That’s a hell of a lot of dollars being spent on things other than frontline patient care.

“How much sense does it make to have all these different ministries negotiating separate deals with Big Pharma? Is it any wonder the cost of prescription medicines is eating up so much of our health care budgets?”

With all the surety of a scientist lamenting climate change, Skyvington is convinced Medicare’s doomsday is around the corner.

“We’re going to have a U.S.-style, two-tier system by 2030 because that’s what happens if we don’t make the changes I’m talking about now.”

He identified three treatment “tsunamis” — diabetes, obesity and dementia — that will swamp the system.

Introduced in 1968, Medicare is showing its age and there is not enough money to keep it from collapsing under its own weight, Skyvington explained.

Canada’s population has more than doubled — from 18.2 million in 1961 to 36.6 million in 2017 — while per-capita spending on health care increased more than 60 fold: From less than $100 per person in the early 1960s to a whopping $6,604 in 2017.

Even with all that money, there are historically long queues for care: Nearly a million patients waiting for treatment in 2016 lost $1.7 billion in wages alone.

Skyvington has a program of 10 solutions, but his book’s strength is not so much his prescription but his etiology and diagnosis.

And he hopes his analysis will spur a realistic discussion: “We have a bad insurance scheme masquerading as a working health care system, a system that is broken and unsustainable because it wasn’t built right in the first place.

“The reality is it puts the vulnerable and disadvantaged in our society in a much worse place than if we actually had a hybrid system. The government should either properly fund health care or — if they can’t or won’t — free it.”

In 2017, he said the Fraser Institute released a report estimating that some 63,000 Canadians traveled abroad for medical care, a 40-per-cent hike from 2016.

“The rich don’t need a second tier,” Skyvington noted. “They already have one. It’s called America.”

Australia, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, and Switzerland all provide universal health care, he said. Unlike Canada, none prohibits user fees or ties the funding of health care to “some kind of sick, perverse ideal of patriotism.”

Instead, each expects patients to share in the costs of health care and imposes either deductibles, co-payments or both on everyone except the poor and most vulnerable.

“If Canada’s health care system is so good, so worth fighting for and preserving, then why hasn’t anyone else copied what we’re doing?” he asked.

“The answer, my friend, is simple: Our system sucks. While we’ve been standing around for the past 50-plus years, admiring our collective navels, everyone else has been embracing not the status quo but change. Real change. Real innovation. Real solutions for an ever-evolving world.”

He hopes to make the crisis a key campaign issue this fall. “We haven’t talked about health care during an election for years. It’s high time we did. This is catastrophic. Bottom line: Either we accept this new reality and change or we’re doomed.”

But it’s what we heard in Monday’s question period, rife with snarling over past arrests and political ties to radicalism, that really gave us a clue as to what the October 2020 provincial election campaign may be like.

Scott Moe and Ryan Meili may not personally dislike each other. But it’s pretty clear the Saskatchewan Party and NDP don’t share much love.

And when the premier and Opposition get into issues like the yellow vest rallies, it’s only likely to fuel that political animosity until the writ is dropped.

Interestingly, the one whose image is likely to suffer the most from this is Moe, which makes one wonder why he wouldn’t see the wisdom of abiding by Meili’s reasonable request that the Saskatchewan government cut all ties to potentially image-harming elements like the yellow vest movement.

Why Moe wouldn’t do this anyway is confounding.

After all, the Sask. Party is an alliance of old PCs and Liberals, and keeping that alliance intact requires occasionally leaning at bit left, as they may have done in Wednesday’s budget.

While it’s a shoddy excuse for failing to always immediately denounce right-wing racism or other extremism, it can be argued that federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer may have to worry about bleeding far-right support to Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada. Moe has no such problem.

This week, the right thing for Moe would have been to at least start messaging that extreme views like the ones we are seeing on the yellow vest Facebook page are both unwanted and actually detrimental to the Sask. Party government’s central message that should be focused on the need for pipelines.

Instead, Moe opted to bicker with reporters whether Facebook messages on the yellow vest page — messages he said he hasn’t seen — were all that reflective.

In politics, when you are apologizing for extremist views that aren’t even really your own, you are losing.

Moe then made matters worse by tapping his designated political enforcer — in this case, Energy Minister Bronwyn Eyre — on the shoulder and sending her over the boards to do battle with Meili over his two-decade-old arrest at the 2001 Summit of the Americas in Quebec City.

One gets why there may be a burning desire in the Sask. Party ranks to paint Meili in the far left corner of Saskatchewan politics — a task eased by Meili’s own desire to hang around that corner, anyway.

So was it really all that necessary or advisable for Eyre to prattle on about Meili hanging around radically dangerous elements — the Sierra Club — at a legitimate public protest where people weren’t threatening harm? Should it have been all that tough for Jeremy Harrison — responsible for immigrant investment — to say this week the yellow vesters’ obsession with with the UN migration compact is a little deranged?

And how smart was it for Eyre to bring up Meili’s “criminal record” when Moe and few other backbench MLAs have a more lasting criminal record involving driving under the influence?

Sure, Eyre and company have had success at getting under Meili’s rather thin skin, evident in his complaints about the Sask. Party’s political ads. And, yes, it was maybe a little greasy of Meili to draw the longbow between Highways Minister Lori Carr and Rural and Remote Health Minister Greg Ottenbreit attending yellow vest rallies and those who would “celebrate” last week’s Christchurch attacks where a white suprematist gunned down 50 innocent people in New Zealand.

But in end, it was Eyre, Moe and the Sask. Party who came out looking the worst. If the Sask. Party is playing the long game, how did this help their own brand?

There again, maybe this is just what Saskatchewan politics is destined to be like for the next 19 months. Buckle up, folks.

""For people who are looking towards that election they should assume that they will get more of what they decided to hire us for in 2015 — a focus on people, a focus on investing in our collective future.""

Morneau also continued to make the case for more spending, saying now is ""exactly the wrong time"" to balance the budget quickly as the federal Tories believe.

He said to do so would bring higher unemployment and bigger economic problems.

Morneau said the Liberal government's goal is to spend while reducing the amount of debt as a result of a growing economy.

""We have the best balance sheet among G7 countries,"" he said. ""We are less than half the debt as a function of our GDP than the average among other countries in the G7, and we've reduced that debt as a function of our economy every single year. And we are going to keep doing it.""

The budget tabled on Tuesday projected a deficit of $19.8 billion in 2019-20.

Morneau said the budget is part of meeting many of the economic and social challenges that are evident in countries such as France, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

He said Canada faces challenges similar to its allies around making sure the economy works for everyone, while the immigration system also works the way it is intended to.

""But we have a lot of good fortune in this country that means that we are in a better position than many other places,"" he said.

Still, Morneau said he worries about things such as high household debt and the challenge of dealing with the country's aging demographic.

""We need to make sure we have as many people as possible getting success from our economy,"" he said.

To that end, Morneau highlighted several budget measures including preparing students for the job market through so-called integrated learning initiatives.

By Emily Macdonald, Staff Writer



Federal election time is coming up quickly here in Canada and every vote matters. A recent poll following the SNC-Lavalin affair has placed the Conservatives in the lead, 7 points ahead of the Liberals. So how does leader Andrew Scheer, leader of the federal Conservatives since 2017, stack up as a potential Prime Minister?



A quick background on Scheer: he spent four years on Parliament hill during Stephen Harper’s majority government as Speaker of the House of Commons. Scheer is currently a member of Parliament as he holds the riding in Regina and is the leader of the opposition. He attended the University of Ottawa before switching to the University of Regina to finish his degree in history and political science where he met his wife. Scheer and his wife together have five children and he is often referred to as a “family man.” He was originally in the insurance business before entering politics 2004.



Not straying from the norm for any conservative government, Scheer hopes to balance the books within two years if voted in. However, he has not specified how this will be done, leaving Canadians to wonder where the cuts would be coming from. The deficit is estimated to be at 15.8 billion dollars by 2021-2022.



Other plans include a cut to HST/GST on home heating bills and the introduction of a tax benefit for those who send their kids to private school or chose home-schooling to help families who wish to educate their children outside of the public system.



A controversial item on Scheer’s to-do list is to recommit the Canadian Forces to the fight against “radical Islam,” something that the Trudeau government has pulled away from. An anonymous first-year student who is in the military commented on the issue, telling The Argus: “I don’t mind if we provide [a] small logistical support role or even assist with air support by sending CF18s, but boots on the ground would be a terrible idea.” He went on to say, “basically we are too busy and it would be a waste of our resources.”



PC – Municipalidad de Cipolletti – Flickr Creative Commons

Scheer has also insisted on the Free Speech mandate, something floating around since early 2018. In Ontario, universities and colleges have already been told to create and implement policies, but he would like to make it nationwide within the post-secondary education system. He has taken a similar approach to Ford, saying that funding will be cut for universities who do not have a full range of free speech. Scheer would also like to cut the unified carbon tax that the Trudeau government, this policy will be implemented in April.

Scheer has been known to be against abortion and same-sex marriage. He voted in favour of a private member’s bill in 2016 that would make it a criminal offence to cause injury or death to a fetus when committing a crime against a pregnant woman and voted against the same-sex marriage bill in 2005. He has stated however, that he will not reopen either issue for debate.



Scheer does not seem to divert from the conservative norm — he wants to make family life easier and balance the books.



No matter how you choose to vote, be sure to do your research. Remember, every vote counts and it is a privilege to choose our government.

TORONTO – A newly arrived refugee who once helped shelter whistleblower Edward Snowden in Hong Kong is calling on Canada to welcome others who helped the American fugitive.

Vanessa Rodel says five other people, including her daughter’s father and her two step-siblings, remain in Hong Kong after their refugee claims were rejected.

She says all her fellow members of a group known as Snowden’s “Guardian Angels” are like family and says she hopes they can join her in Canada, where she secured refugee status two months ago.

Rodel’s comments came at a news conference held after she and her daughter Keana landed in Toronto on Monday night.

They will head to Montreal later today to move into their new home.

Snowden is also calling on Canada to grant refugee status to others like Rodel, who helped him when he fled to Hong Kong after exposing the scope of surveillance operations at the U.S. National Security Agency.

In less than two months, B.C. will have a new MP to fill the seat vacated by new NDP MLA Sheila Malcolmson.

Today, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that a by-election in Nanaimo-Ladysmith will be held on May 6.

Whoever is elected will only sit as an MP for just over five months before a general election will be held on October 21.

The NDP has not yet nominated a candidate.

There are two high-profile declared contestants:

* Lauren Semple, the event director for the last three Nanaimo Pride festivals, a former Nanaimo Pride president, and former riding assistant to Malcolmson;

* and Bob Chamberlin, vice president of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs and elected chief of the Kwikwasut'inuxw Haswa'mis First Nation.

Chief Bob Chamberlin is also trying to win the NDP nomination in Nanaimo-Ladysmith. Amanda Siebert

Four other parties already have nominated candidates:

* Financial-services worker Jennifer Clarke for the People's Party of Canada;

* Management consultant Michelle Cornfield for the Liberals;

* Sun Life Financial manager John Hirst for the Conservatives;

* Filmmaker Paul Manly of the Green Party of Canada.

Last year, Hirst soundly defeated Clarke to become the Conservative candidate.

Paul Manly ran for the Greens in 2015 after being rejected by the NDP.

The Green candidate, Manly, ran in 2015 and is the son of former NDP MP Jim Manly, who represented Cowichan-Malahat–The Islands from 1980 to 1988.

In 2014, Paul Manly said the NDP federal executive denied him the chance to seek a party nomination because of concerns over his position on Israeli-Palestinian issues.

Manly's father was arrested in Gaza in 2012 after being part of group of protesters aboard the MV Estelle that tried to break through an Israeli blockade.

“We had hoped that the New Democrats and other parties also would speak out. Not particularly for me but for the people of Gaza and of Palestine,” Jim Manly told the Straight in 2015. “And they didn’t and this has never been Paul’s central issue. It’s been a very important issue for Eva—my wife—and myself. But it’s never been Paul’s central issue.”

In 2015, Jim Manly said that his son would have done very well as an NDP candidate, ""but he was not approved by the Ottawa apparatchiks"" in the party.",Prime Minister Justin Trudeau calls by-election in Nanaimo-Ladysmith in midst of NDP nomination race,The Georgia Straight,https://www.straight.com/news/1218361/prime-minister-justin-trudeau-calls-election-nanaimo-ladysmith-midst-ndp-nomination

By Keith Currie, President, Ontario Federation of Agriculture

There’s something in this year’s federal budget for everyone, at least that’s the government’s intent ahead of a federal election this year. The good news for Canadian agriculture is the emphasis on food, developing a food policy and new school food programs. Dedicated funding support for farmers in supply managed sectors in response to recent trade agreements and the promise of rural broadband also highlight the 2019 budget announcement for farmers.

Listen here:

The Ontario Federation of Agriculture (OFA), along with the Canadian Federation of Agriculture (CFA) submitted budget recommendations outlining what we believe the agri-food sector needs to be competitive and sustainable. A number of these requests were included in the March 19 budget announcement.

Food security is a must for Canadians and the budget allocation to create a National Food Policy is a welcome promise. OFA is especially encouraged by the 3-year agricultural immigration pilot that will help address year-round agricultural labour shortages, the development of a national school food program and a $25 million commitment to a buy Canadian promotional campaign that are all included in the proposed strategy. A National Food Strategy is a landmark announcement for Canadian agriculture and together, OFA and CFA will be working directly with the federal government to understand how this program will be implemented in support of the whole agri-food sector.

OFA maintains rural access to reliable, high-speed broadband is a must. The federal budget announcement unveiled a plan to implement targets of 95% of Canadians to have high speed internet by 2025 and 100% by 2030. As likely the last 5% to get the service, many farmers and rural communities are looking at another 11 years before being able to actively participate in the digital age. This is not acceptable and defies the real economic potential of rural Ontario.

The $3.9 billion allocated to assist supply managed sectors responds to the market access concessions made through recent trade agreements signals the federal government understands the significant impact our farmers make to the Canadian economy. This monetary support is meant to sustain the incomes of eligible dairy, poultry and egg farmers. While this revenue recovery announcement is good news, relief for those farmers affected by the US-China trade war is missing from the federal budget. It’s hard not to look south of the border where US grain farmers are receiving billions in compensation from their government and not ask Canada’s leaders why they aren’t supporting Canadian farmers.

The housing initiatives aimed at housing affordability and incentives for first-time home buyers will appeal to many Canadians. However, OFA is concerned the real impact of these incentives will see a rise in housing prices in areas where very limited housing supply is already an issue. The housing crisis in Ontario’s Golden Horseshoe will only get worse. OFA maintains the best solution to help Ontarians realize home ownership and alleviate the housing crisis is to enable opportunities across Ontario. Investment in rural areas including realistic broadband targets will create jobs, attract new residents and see our communities outside of the Greater Toronto Hamilton Area flourish.

OFA believes some of the 2019 budget investments in Canadian agriculture will see economic returns for all Canadians. Many budget details have yet to be determined but together, OFA and CFA will work closely with government to ensure effective policies and programs are implemented that will benefit our agri-food sector, one of Canada’s largest economic industries.",OFA: Federal election budget fuels investments in agri-food,Blackburn News,https://blackburnnews.com/agrimedia/commentaries/2019/03/25/ofa-federal-election-budget-fuels-investments-agri-food/

So the top guy at SNC says they never mentioned any numbers for job losses to anybody … so that means someone made up the 9,000 jobs lost if SNC moves, and would that not mean someone lied at the justice committee on the record? More than once that story was uttered as truth. But how can it be the truth if it is denied by the top man at SNC-Lavelin? Justin’s lies just keep catching up with him day after day. Even his most staunch supporters are running into huge logic conflicts that they cannot even deflect away with stupid, repeated talking points and slogans. Maybe someone in Liberal land needs to get his attention and confront the reality before us all? Or is Canada and its well being as a nation just not that important?

JUST MAKE IT UP

It’s possible Jason Kenney did make a mistake in the leadership race but come on Rachel Notley, how can you expect anyone to take you at your word when you turn the truth, eg. a single toll road to be built for heavy oilsands traffic, who will also be the only ones paying the toll, into a complete lie by telling people they will be paying a toll to get anywhere. Let’s see what the investigation comes up with to see if Mr. Kenney is half the liar you are.

TOUGH CHOICES

I will not, nor have I ever voted for the NDP. As for the Liberals, as long as we have a bleeding heart, apologetic for everything, throw tax money away prime minister, the Liberals will never get my vote. As for the UPC and Jason Kenney, I have not voted for him when he was running in my riding, and the candidate that is now running in my riding will probably not get my vote. It’s too bad that the politics in this country both provincially and federally have fallen to the low credibility it has. It’s not about running the province or country, it’s about finger-pointing, the childish bickering, the accusations, the opinions the other guys are wrong and we are right, the my-way-or-no-way attitude, and it’s all BS, political BS that costs us taxpayers. If the UCP wants my vote, then they need someone that can be trusted, honest, accountable, responsible, and has integrity. Unfortunately the last person I feel that fit this bill was Danielle Smith of the former Wildrose Party. Too bad she didn’t stick it out as she would have probably been premier and we probably wouldn’t be in the mess we are now. If the UCP are going to win this election, they need to get someone in position that the voters can support and respect, now!

Hopefully after these clowns are voted out, the signs will stay up for awhile so we know which neighbours to avoid, like the plague!

NO DEBATE

It’s too bad that Caylan Ford resigned from the Calgary Mountain View election race. It is quite apparent that if one offers a legitimate contrary perspective to any liberal leftist view you are branded a racist, a bigot or an Islamophobe. The irony is that the Liberals claim to be tolerant and inclusive of all ideas when in fact the opposite is true. The leftists in this country are so intolerant, such that when you have dissenting opinion they are unable to debate and can only resort to a fallacious argumentative strategy avoiding discussion of the topic and instead attacking the character or motives of the person making the argument. The leftists are only interested in being right and disinterested in healthy democratic debate. By suppressing genuine free speech democracy dies and all of us will suffer in the end.

UNACCOUNTABLE

There is something terribly and fundamentally wrong with Canada’s justice system when the Liberal government under Justin Trudeau can shut down the SNC-Lavalin inquiry when they know they have been caught with their fingers in the cookie jar. Now the whole truth will never be made public. It’s like asking a caught-in-the-act bank robber how many years he wants to spend in prison and he replies, “none!” That’s exactly what the Liberal Party did when they shut down the inquiry. There should be some world court to hold a country’s government accountable for their actions and allow the truth to be heard. This fall’s federal election is when Canadians can have their say like the song goes, “Nah, nah, nah, nah, hey, hey, hey, goodbye.”

How many tens and tens of thousands of families have lost their livelihoods and homes, not to mention their families, while our natural resource sector struggles under the fumbling of Justin and Rachel. Where do these union types think the money comes from? How tough can these double- and triple-dipping pension types have it. Taxpayers deserve much better. The smartest thing the City of Calgary could do is start trimming the fat to get back to the real world. But that won’t happen so up, up, up go the taxes while the downward spiral of living standards continue. Keep up the good work, D’arcy.

HATE BREEDS HATE

I’m very saddened by the events that occurred in New Zealand, I honestly feel for those innocents and their families. Things like that should never happen. However, I believe it is a double edged sword. Hate breeds hate, this man had an agenda (even if it was misguided) because of Islamic actions in other parts of the world. I don’t condone it at all, but I also notice how the entire world is up in arms about this killing, but when an Islamic radical goes on a killing spree it’s just another news day, nobody is up in arms, nobody is protesting, especially within the Islamic community. It’s very sad, but it’s the truth. (I know you will never print this because it’s the truth.)

(Attacks are not ignored and are not ‘just another news day.’ All violence and threats of violence must be condemned.)

SHARE SOME LOVE

In light of the horrific Christchurch shootings, here’s my take on the hatred and violence we face in the world today. I was just contemplating about the shootings in two mosques in New Zealand as well as all the other recent shootings in places of worship. If you visit these places of worship, you’ll notice that there’s no hatred being preached in any of them. However, if you look at the world today, you’ll notice there’s less unity among people. I believe the culprit for all this hate is divisive politics, polarizing media, and lack of understanding between people. Many have lost the ability to listen to those who’re different from them. This is where all hate begins. When one person feels they don’t need to hear the other side. Let us all show each other love and unity. If you know someone of a different race or culture or faith, reach out to them, show some love and make sure you stand up for them.

BUT WHAT IF …

So Jody Wilson-Raybould is seeking re-election as a Liberal so that she can change the culture of conflict, partisanship etc. in government, which was one of her goals the first time. This is providing PM Justin Trudeau accepts her nomination and allows her to run under the Liberal banner, and we have heard that many times before from all kinds of political hopefuls. She claims that she never expected the national focus even though she is an accomplished lawyer. If she would have agreed to an independent, high-level retired judge advising her on the SNC-Lavalin affair, the end choice would still be hers but any controversy may not have been. She might still have her old job but now even if re-elected it could take a while to get off the backbench.

WAGE DISPUTE

Ricky Leong: Teenage workers deserve same minimum wage as adult. This article was written by someone with zero business experience. Came out of college indoctrinated with the lefty, socialist ideologies pushed throughout our school system. Everyone should be paid the same, why keep score during a game, someone’s feelings might get hurt, give him a good grade for doing bad in school. It really makes me sick. Not one thought of common sense in this article. All he keeps saying is it’s not fair. Well, whaaaa! Go cry in your beer. He mentions nothing of experience. Only age, race and gender. Typical liberal talking points. As an employer, I put huge stock in experience. I don’t want to retrain a new employee if I don’t have to. I will pay good employees more money to stay but you have to show me you’re worth the added investment. The article says “teenagers deserve the same wage” based on what? Why do they deserve the same wage? What have they done to show they deserve the same wage? What responsibilities do they have that requires the same wage? The writer suggest that kids need to earn more money to support their families? Really! That’s your MO. Do you know how silly that sounds. This thought process is a socialist ideology. People should be paid what they are worth to an employer and for a youth with zero experience and zero responsibilities, it’s worth very little.

DAVE SMITH

(Plenty of people would agree with you. And Ricky.)

A ROUGH GAME

So the NDP wants to make a mountain out of a molehill regarding the PC leadership campaign that saw Jason Kenney win. I have a news flash for them, that’s how the game is played. Remember Ed Stelmach? Third place on the ballot behind Jim Dinning and Ted Morton. Morton threw his support behind Stelmach and boom, Dinning is out. Too bad, really, Jim Dinning would have made a hell of a good premier. Look at B.C. The NDP were losing and the Green Party throws in behind them and it’s bye bye Liberals. As I said, it’s just the way the game’s played and all the parties do it. I’m not saying it’s right, but that’s just how it is. Don’t let Notley’s misfits get in your head over it. They’re sucking in the polls and will try anything to gain some traction.

JOHN HANCOCK

(When your track record is dismal, you need to find a shiny object.)

DON’T BLAME RACHEL

Hilarious to see Roy Peterson say “on election day, vote as you please, but for the sake of our kids, not NDP.” So somehow the Notley NDP government has been detrimental to the youth of Alberta? The government that finally got shovels into the ground on many badly needed schools? The government that raised the minimum wage to help bring the youth and working poor out of poverty? Somehow Jason Kenney’s racist and bigoted policies will better serve the youth of Alberta? Kenney really needs to pick up a book on how trickle down economics has never worked. Perhaps reading a book on being a decent human being might be a boost for Jason, too.

MARTIN KOSIK

(Have you noticed how much debt our children will be responsible for down the road? Thought not. And racist policies? What utter nonsense.)

OUT TO LUNCH

This whole mess with the added fee for every bag of garbage outside of your bin is insane. The fact that the citizens of Calgary are becoming jaded sheep is beyond insane. The reason why I say this is because in the March 18 issue, people actually said that they agree with people paying more who generate more trash, 62% in fact. Are these 62% of the people forgetting that our lovely council downtown slashed the service in half while keeping the price the same?! Take my extra $3 out of the money that you are keeping for doing half the job, better yet, go back to collections every week and we won’t have to worry about extra bags. Not to mention the green cart (which I don’t use) also had its service cut in half over the winter but the rates also stayed the same. It’s always so easy for council to just charge more money instead of thinking of ways to make the system more efficient and doing their jobs properly. I wonder if they have put very much thought into how much it will cost to clean up all the illegal dump sites in ditches and such that will pop up because of this. It already exists as there is scum out there too cheap to take their garbage and dispose of it properly so this will only increase the problem further and they will be kidding themselves if they don’t think this.

""I met a mom in Burnaby. She bought a home, but cannot afford to live there anymore. Her daughter has a good job, but only gets by because she lives in the basement. Her son does not see a future. Like too many Canadians, he has lost all hope,"" Singh said.

""However, the prime minister is telling families like theirs to wait for help. I believe that better is possible. Will the government commit to building half a million new affordable homes?"" he said.

Prime Minister Trudeau responded by congratulating Singh for his entry into the Commons, before touting the government's record on fighting poverty.

Singh's remarks echoed the mood of the House on a crucial day when the prime minister beleaguered by the resignations of his two key cabinet colleagues.

The long-standing Premier of Alberta has seen a sharp jump in favourability over the past year, shooting up from 33% last March to 40% — landing her sixth out of Canada’s nine premiers, according to a recent study from the Angus Reid Institute.

In case you were thinking “hey, aren’t there 10 provinces in Canada?” You would be right — however, the Angus Reid Institute decided that, because of its small population, data from PEI could not be released on account of its inability to draw discreet samples over multiple waves.

BC’s John Horgan dropped down to third place (even though he sustained his 52% rating from last year) as newly elected Quebec Premier François Legault and Saskatchewan’s Scott Moe took the top two spots with 60% and 59% respectively.

The Angus Reid Institute is pulling these numbers from an online survey they conducted between March 11 and 24, using a representative, randomized sample of 5,807 Canadians.

Bringing up the rear is Nova Scotia’s Stephen McNeil, who has seen a significant dip since his high at 66% back in June 2014.

Given that the general trend shows a decrease in approval within the first year of premiership, Notley hasn’t done too bad a job of holding onto what approval remained after her dip back in 2015 — though she’ll need every bit of favour she can get heading into the provincial election this April.

The normally suave prime minister was speaking at a Liberal Party event in Toronto on Wednesday when the activists unfurled a banner and began chanting slogans against mercury poisoning in a river where they fish.

""Thank you very much for your donation,"" Trudeau called after the Grassy Narrows First Nation demonstrators as they were being thrown out, aware that they would have had to pay to get in.

""As we know, the Liberal Party is filled with different perspectives and different opinions and we respect them all,"" Trudeau immediately added, an apparent acknowledgement that he had overstepped.

He was shouted down by angry audience members before he could finish, however.

The reaction -- caught on a video which went viral on social media -- was in stark contrast to Trudeau's usual show of compassion and grace when confronted by protestors.

""From time to time, I'm in situations where people are expressing concerns or protesting a particular thing, and I always try to be respectful and always try to engage with them in a positive way,"" Trudeau told reporters in Halifax on Thursday.

""I didn't do that last night. Last night I lacked respect towards them and I apologize.""

The government pledged in late 2017 to help fund the construction of a mercury treatment facility for people exposed to the toxic metal over the past 50 years.

TransAlta will “review Mangrove’s notice and consider the suitability of its nominees and ...","(Bloomberg) -- Brookfield Asset Management Inc. will invest C$750 million ($559 million) in power producer TransAlta Corp. and nominate two directors to its board.

Brookfield could also increase its stake in the Calgary-based utility to about 9 percent under certain conditions, according to a statement Monday. The deal allows Brookfield to convert its investment into an equity interest in TransAlta’s Alberta hydro assets at a later date.

The investment is being made through Brookfield’s publicly traded renewable-energy arm, Brookfield Renewable Partners. Shares of TransAlta rose 3.9 percent in Toronto trading Monday, closing at the highest level since July 2015 and giving the company a market value of about C$2.7 billion.

The two parties have held conversations over the years about various transactions but ultimately decided to proceed with the deal because it allows TransAlta to crystalize the future value of hydro assets and speed up its transition to clean energy, said Dawn Farrell, TransAlta chief executive officer, in an interview.

“Brookfield is a big and sophisticated company that has huge ownership in renewables and hydro,” Farrell said. “No amount of pressure would make this kind of transaction come together. It requires people who understand the industry, understand infrastructure, and understand each other.”

Clean Energy

Brookfield holds a 4.9 percent stake in the company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The deal will see the Canadian asset manager’s vice-chairmen, Harry Goldgut and Richard Legault, nominated to TransAlta’s slate of director nominees at its annual general meeting. Robert Flexon, the former CEO of Dynegy Inc., will also be added to the slate.

The move comes as Calgary-based TransAlta faces pressure from investors Mangrove Partners and C. John Wilder’s Bluescape Energy Partners, which disclosed a 10 percent stake in the company this month and said they planned to push for changes including a potential board revamp. The deal with Brookfield had nothing to do with the activists knocking at its door and is in keeping with its strategy to transition to clean energy, Farrell said.

In a statement on Monday evening, TransAlta said Mangrove plans to nominate five candidates for election to its board at the upcoming shareholder meeting. TransAlta will “review Mangrove’s notice and consider the suitability of its nominees and communicate more fully with its shareholder in due course,” the power producer said in the statement.

Share Buyback

TransAlta began selling shares in its renewable-energy unit in 2013, forming TransAlta Renewables Inc. as a separate company. It’s still the biggest investor in that company, with a stake of about 51 percent -- held jointly with a generation partnership -- that’s valued at about C$1.8 billion based on current share prices.

TransAlta will use about $350 million of the proceeds from the investment to advance its strategy to move from coal to gas generation by 2025, and as much as $250 million on a share buyback, it said.

“We look forward to contributing our capabilities, particularly our long-term expertise in the hydro sector, to enable the company’s growth over the long-term,” said Sachin Shah, Brookfield Renewable Partners’s chief executive officer.

Shares in TransAlta fell about 25 percent last year, but have made a rapid recovery since the start of 2019 as the company generates cash after reporting two straight years of net losses. The stock is up 69 percent this year.

After the court case is ... top two candidates in last October’s mayoral election. In its own presentation to city council ...","A case that has implications for the cost and distribution of electricity in eight Northwest Territories communities, including the capital Yellowknife, is now in the hands of a judge.

The N.W.T. Supreme Court case is part of an ongoing battle by the town of Hay River to transfer Northland Utilities’ power distribution franchise for the town to the Northwest Territories Power Corporation.

The town made the decision to switch three years ago but, so far, breaking up with Northland has been complicated and costly.

And promises of rate reductions — the whole point of the switch — have softened since the town decided to go with NTPC.

In a joint press release issued that day, March 3, 2016, the corporation and town council stated unequivocally the switch would result in an overall reduction of 20 per cent on electricity bills.

A few months later, Louis Sebert, the minister responsible for the corporation, told CBC the price of power with NTPC as distributor was “somewhat of a moving target, but we’re optimistic that once this process is concluded, rate payers in Hay River will see significantly lower power rates.”

In an email last week, an NTPC official said the corporation “continues to believe it can provide lower overall rates in the town of Hay River than the current distributor.”

The power corporation refused CBC’s requests for an interview for this story, saying the town was in the best position to comment on the corporation’s involvement and its ability to deliver on the 20 per cent reduction.

The town did not respond to CBC’s requests for an interview.

Deal-breaker

The central issue Justice Andrew Mahar must decide in the case is how to set a price Hay River must pay to get out of its franchise agreement. Under the agreement, the town must buy all of the infrastructure (power poles, transformers, buildings, vehicles, etc.) that are part of Northland’s distribution system.

Northland is challenging an arbitrator’s decision to allow Hay River to pay market value, plus a 30 per cent premium to recognize the business revenue Northland would lose through the transfer.

“The decisions of the arbitrator are entirely inconsistent with what the case law says,” said the company’s lawyer in court last week. Loyola Keough said one example of that inconsistency was taking into account the cost impact on the town and its ratepayers, “which the courts have said is not relevant.”

Northland argues the price the town should pay is how much it would cost to build a brand new system — including everything from constructing new buildings, transporting and installing generators, and the cost of setting power poles and stringing lines — less depreciation. That method yields a figure of about $40 million, almost three times what the arbitrator suggested.

The lawyer for Hay River said there is nothing in the court decisions Northland referred to that suggests the method it’s proposing is the one that should be used.

Thomas Marriott said using Northland’s formula would render the clause allowing the town to buy out of the agreement meaningless.

“Is it appropriate to say: ‘you have the right to purchase those assets but, if you do, you have to use this methodology that requires you to pay three times book value?'” Said Marriott.

“Why would anybody exercise that right? That has no practical application.”

The town has said if the court decides Northland’s methodology must be used, it will not terminate the franchise agreement.

Whatever the judge decides, Northland will continue distributing power in Hay River for the foreseeable future. Each side has the right to appeal any decision to the N.W.T. Court of Appeal and, after that, the Supreme Court of Canada.

After the court case is decided, the public utilities board will have to approve the cost, the transfer of the franchise agreement and the setting of new rates, if any, for the town.

Other cities to come?

In a presentation to Yellowknife city council earlier this year, NTPC said part of its three-year strategy is to complete the merger of its generation and distribution functions in Hay River and pursue more distribution franchise opportunities.

The only other power distributor in the N.W.T. is Northland, which delivers power to homes and businesses in Yellowknife, Ndilo, Enterprise, Fort Providence, Samba Ke, Wekweti and Kakisa, as well as Hay River.

Yellowknife is the biggest distribution franchise in the territory and one Northland has held for decades. It generates about $45 million in revenues annually.

The city’s franchise agreement with Northland expires on Dec. 31, 2020. Reducing the cost of power (the N.W.T. has the highest in the country) was a campaign commitment of the top two candidates in last October’s mayoral election.

In its own presentation to city council, Northland pointed out that the money it pays to NTPC to purchase the power it distributes in the city accounts for 77 per cent of the price Yellowknifers pay.

Another cost is the $1 million franchise fee Northland pays the Corporation of the City of Yellowknife annually, a cost that is passed on to residents and businesses in their monthly power bills.

Northland says the best system for Northerners is one in which it and the power corporation combine forces. It says that will reduce duplication and, ultimately, lower costs to customers.

Others, including previous ministers responsible for the power corporation, have suggested another way would be to eliminate Northland — and the need to return a profit to its shareholders.

Liberal Party released its health platform in Charlottetown Thursday morning, and it includes a proposal to provide benefits for some workers who do not have health plans through their employer.

The Liberals are promising a $200 million increase in spending on health care over the next five years, noting that from 2014 to 2018 spending increased $117 million.

""We are making these investments because we know that when Islanders need medical care, they are reasonable about it, and our priority as government should be to make that as accessible as possible,"" said Liberal Leader Wade MacLauchlan during an announcement Thursday.

A number of promises, and more to come

As part of its platform, the party proposed a pilot initiative to work with employers to provide health benefits to workers in seasonal industries who are currently uninsured.

Most of the new spending would go toward mental health and addictions care, the party said in a news release. The party would dedicate $50 million to recruitment, retention and training of health-care professionals.

Other initiatives include:

A ""renewed health facility"" at Kings County Memorial Hospital.

Travel cost support for patients receiving treatment off-Island.

Elimination of ambulance fees.

Increased capacity at walk-in clinics.

Targeted compensation to increase the number of doctors in rural areas.

Five new specialists, including for orthopedic surgery and cataract surgery.

A new primary health-care clinic in Queens County.

During the announcement, MacLauchlan did not say where the new clinic would be, but he said it would include family physicians and nurse practitioners, and would provide services to 8,000 Islanders.

District 17 New Haven-Rocky Point candidate Judy MacNevin, who is also a nurse, hinted that the clinic could be in that district.

""Read between the lines everyone in District 17,"" MacNevin said during the announcement.

""You will not be surprised to hear that I have been an advocate for health-care services in the south shore of Queens County, and specifically in Crapaud.""

The Liberals said they will be making further announcements on health later in the campaign, with further details on mental health and addictions care, as well as care for seniors.

Premier Wade MacLauchlan called an early election Tuesday night, announcing an April 23 vote that polls suggest could produce Canada’s first Green Party government. “This is Prince Edward Island’s time,” MacLauchlan told a nomination meeting for a local candidate at a Charlottetown hotel. “We are experiencing a sense of opportunity like never before in our long and distinguished history.”

The Liberal government didn’t have to take voters to the polls until Oct. 7 under the province’s fixed-date election provisions, but there was an apparent desire to avoid overlap with the federal election this fall. “It’s been four years. We had a mandate and fulfilled it,” MacLauchlan told reporters when asked about the early call. “This is an opportunity to ask Islanders for their confidence to build on that record.” Despite a booming economy, polls suggest the Liberal party is likely facing a rough ride, with the Greens seen as a legitimate contender for power.

In his speech, MacLauchlan called the Progressive Conservatives a party of chaos and opposition — saying they’ve had five leaders in four years — and suggested the Greens would be too risky. “The Green Party is untested, and the future of our province is too important to risk on uncertain expensive social experiments, led by a career politician,” he said. Green Leader Peter Bevan-Baker, a dentist, became the first party member elected to the legislature in 2015, and the Greens snagged a second seat in a 2017 byelection. A Corporate Research Associates poll released this month suggests the Greens had a healthy lead, followed by the Progressive Conservatives, who picked a new leader, Dennis King, in February. The Liberals were in third place, the poll suggests.

The Liberals have been in power since 2007, and there are signs MacLauchlan — a longtime academic who began his political career in 2015 as premier — is personally unpopular. “It’s about people. It’s about you — and it’s about time that the government of the people of P.E.I. understand, respect and live by that message,” the PC party said in a tweet as MacLauchlan was making his election call.

The Greens, meanwhile, posted a clip Tuesday night of Bevan-Baker playing “First Call” on his trumpet. “What a wonderful way to begin the writ period — with a blast from Peter’s trumpet,” the party said on Facebook. In his speech, MacLauchlan touted advancements made by his government on housing, lower taxes and reducing child poverty by more than half. “Prince Edward Island is working,” he told the enthusiastic partisan crowd. “There are now more opportunities for Islanders to get ahead and thrive.” The standings at dissolution in the Island legislature were 16 Liberals, eight Tories, two Green and one independent member. The Island has only ever been governed by the Liberals or Tories. The last time a minority government was elected in P.E.I. was 1890. MacLauchlan said Tuesday night that he notified the other party leaders earlier in the day. He is scheduled to make his first campaign stop Wednesday morning in Charlottetown. The election will also include a binding referendum on electoral reform — asking voters if they wish to stay with the current first-past-the-post system or change to a mixed-member-proportional-representation model. It won’t be the first time P.E.I. voters have been asked to consider electoral reform. In fact, they voted 52 per cent in favour of switching to mixed member proportional reform during a plebiscite in 2016, but MacLauchlan rejected the results because of a low turnout of about 36 per cent.

Grassy Narrows First Nation held a protest and demonstration in Toronto on Wednesday evening during a Liberal Party fundraiser to press the Trudeau government on its promise to fund a specialized mercury treatment facility in the northwestern Ontario community that's about 100 kilometres northeast of Kenora.

During the event, the protester appeared to be escorted out of the room while Trudeau thanked her for her ""donation.""

""From time to time, I'm in situations where people are expressing concerns or protesting a particular thing, and I always try to be respectful and always try to engage with them in a positive way,"" Trudeau told reporters in Halifax on Thursday morning.

""I didn't do that last night — last night I lacked respect towards them and I apologize.""

Grassy Narrows also is pushing for federal help for remediation of the polluted English-Wabigoon River system and better compensation for people affected by the toxic element.

In a video posted to the Council of Canadians' verified Facebook page Wednesday evening, a woman is shown standing in front of the stage where Trudeau is standing; she appears to unfurl a banner that references the prime minister and compensation for the ""mercury crisis."" She is heard saying ""people in Grassy Narrows are suffering from mercury poisoning, you committed to addressing this crisis,"" while appearing to be removed from the room.

Trudeau, still on the stage, is heard saying, while facing the direction in which the woman was taken out of the room, ""Thank you for being here, thank you very much for your donation tonight, I really appreciate it,"" which draws cheers and applause from the crowd.

The Grassy Narrows protest in Toronto was at the Omni King Edward Hotel, where Trudeau was scheduled to appear at a Laurier Club donor ""appreciation event.""

Former Indigenous services minister Jane Philpott pledged in late 2017 that Ottawa would fund the development and construction of a treatment facility for people exposed to mercury-related illnesses in Grassy Narrows. A number of studies have linked the comparatively poor health of people in the community to the dumping of mercury-contaminated effluent by Reed Paper, former owners of the mill in Dryden, into the river where members of the First Nation have traditionally fished.

The dumping also affected Wabaseemoong, another First Nation, about 100 kilometres northwest of Kenora.

""The situation in Grassy Narrows is one that we have been following for quite awhile,"" Trudeau said Thursday. He said representatives from his office will be in touch with the office of Indigenous Services Minister Seamus O'Regan.

Grassy Narrows submitted a feasibility study for the treatment centre in late 2018, said the community's environmental health co-ordinator, Judy Da Silva. But the community is now waiting for Ottawa to commit to funding a detailed work plan — the next step in the project, she said.

""We're really worried this promise won't be fulfilled,"" Da Silva said, with the 2019 federal election drawing closer. ""The crunch is coming ... and we need something concrete in place ... for the mercury home to be a reality.

""As we speak, our people are having to suffer in the Kenora hospital, or in Thunder Bay or in Winnipeg, and the numbers are growing,"" Da Silva said.

Judy Da Silva was in Toronto to help protest what the community is calling a lack of action by the federal government on the Grassy Narrows mercury treatment centre. (CBC)

""We're hoping that ... [Ottawa] will put something in place that will fulfil that promise for a mercury home and for mercury justice for our people.""

Da Silva said Grassy Narrows has also yet to secure a visit from Trudeau, despite chief and council requesting he come to the community.

William Olscamp, a spokesperson for Indigenous Services Canada, said in an email to CBC News that the department has reviewed the mercury treatment centre's feasibility study ""and is actively engaged with the community, the province and other technical experts to continue to effectively map out the required services against the technical requirements of the building.

""Once the requirements have been finalized, the next steps can get underway.""

The elevated levels of mercury in the river that runs adjacent to Grassy Narrows also closed a once-thriving fishery in the 1970s, decimating the local economy. Community leaders have called on senior levels of government for better compensation, saying the existing Mercury Disability Board, established in the 1980s and under provincial jurisdiction, has only resulted in about six per cent of Grassy Narrows members getting any compensation.

While the province has committed to indexing payouts to inflation, there's been little talk about changing the eligibility criteria.

Grassy Narrows highlighted by Amnesty International

The situation in Grassy Narrows was highlighted by Amnesty International on World Water Day in March as one example in Canada of ""environmental racism.""

""There are communities, particularly communities of colour and Indigenous peoples, who daily have to live with threats to their health and well-being from environmental contamination that would be unthinkable for so many other wealthier communities,"" said Craig Benjamin, Amnesty International Canada's Indigenous rights campaigner.

""Really, there's no clearer example of this than Grassy Narrows.""

Amnesty International has been working with the community for close to 20 years, he said, adding specialized health care should have been on the table years ago.

""This isn't something that should be delayed.""

Olscamp said in his email that Indigenous Services Canada ""continues to work collaboratively with the communities of Grassy Narrows First Nation, Wabaseemoong Independent Nations and provincial partners to address the specific health needs in these communities and reform the Mercury Disability Board.

""The timelines for completion of the treatment facility will depend on the project requirements and the final design agreed upon by the federal and provincial project participants and the Grassy Narrows community,"" he added.

Grassy Narrows is about 100 kilometres northeast of Kenora, Ont. (CBC)

""It is too early at this point to provide a definitive date for the project completion.""

Benjamin acknowledged the commitments made by both the federal and provincial governments as being much-needed positive steps that need to be adhered to.

""We also have the fact that there have been these long struggles for justice that, at this point, we finally see them bearing fruit,"" he said.

This, according to a new analysis of public opinion polling data by the non-profit Angus Reid Institute. The data was donated to ARI by Angus Reid Global Public Affairs.

The Conservatives capture 37 per cent of the decided and leaning vote – essentially unchanged from where they stood last month – but it is the governing Liberals who have dropped three points to 28 per cent as the SNC-Lavalin affair has remained in the headlines.

The principal beneficiaries of this decline in Liberal support appear to be the New Democratic Party and smaller parties, including the Green Party and the People’s Party of Canada.

These parties are seeing their fortunes rise as the Canadian public expresses unfavourable views of the main parties and their leaders.

More Key Findings:

More Canadians have a favourable view of CPC leader Andrew Scheer (44% do) and New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh (39%) than Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (36%)

A third of B.C. residents who voted for the Liberals in 2015 also believe a different party leader would do things better in Ottawa than Trudeau.

“As long as Trudeau is their leader, the party is bound to suffer big time.”

“B.C. is critical to the Liberals’ fortunes, as their strength in Quebec seems to be waning and in Atlantic Canada they’re grossly under attack. They have to look for where they can gain seats,” Brown said in an interview.

And that animosity toward Canada’s current prime minister is pervasive across the province, though strongest outside of the Metro Vancouver region, said Mario Canseco, president of Research Co.

“That’s the danger the Liberals are facing,” Canseco said. “This is more worrisome in urban areas where you can see people gravitate more to the NDP, which places a lot of seats in jeopardy.”

Meanwhile, half of British Columbians think a different party is needed to lead in Ottawa. Notably, a majority of all age groups polled — from millennials to boomers and beyond — felt that way, as well as a quarter of 2015 Liberal voters.

Prior to 2015, the Liberal party held two seats in British Columbia. But after “Trudeaumania” took the country, the Liberals went from third place in the House of Commons to holding a majority government. Now, they hold 17 seats in B.C.

Canseco questioned whether they could sustain that momentum.

And while there wasn’t much of a gender gap in 2015, men are now more likely to be critical and dissatisfied with the Liberals.

Canseco is closely following the millennial reaction to Trudeau, as the previous election saw a significant spike in the youth vote. For Canseco, the big question ahead of the fall election will be exactly where those votes go.

“It’s no longer the idea of Trudeau as a great unifier, and if they find a shinier object out there, will they support it?” he said. “If you’re disenchanted because of environmental decisions, or maybe electoral reform, or the SNC-Lavalin affair, do you stay home or vote Green or NDP?”

Poll results were based on an online study from March 8 to 10 among 800 adults in B.C., with a margin of error of +/- 3.5 percentage points 19 times out of 20.

Left-leaning progressives offended by the SNC-Lavalin affair may be tempted to vote for the NDP or Greens, Brown said, while centre-right leaning and “swing Liberals” will now be swayed to vote Conservative.

Disenchantment with Trudeau — particularly in B.C. — has risen because he has “failed” on so many files, according to Brown, such as proportional representation, balancing the budget, reconciliation and the purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline.

“(All that has) dramatically reduced his party’s fortunes in Greater Vancouver on progressive, environmentally conscious voters,” he said. “On so many files, he’s proven himself to be the opposite of what he purports to be.”

Braeden Caley, a Liberal party spokesperson, says Trudeau and the Liberals are focused on a strong plan for British Columbians “to build more affordable housing, invest in better roads and transit, grow the economy and protect a healthier environment for our kids and grandkids.”

A decline in support for the Liberals is exaggerated, according to Caley. He says grassroots support for the party continues to grow.

“More than 15,000 British Columbians have singed up as new Liberals in the past two years alone,” he said in an email. “The Liberal party is also continuing to be approached by a variety of talented community leaders interested in becoming Team Trudeau candidates throughout British Columbia, building on the strong growth that we’ve seen in our B.C. team and caucus in recent years.”

Brown has been publicly calling for Trudeau to step down to improve the Liberal party’s chances in October, amid the ongoing SNC-Lavalin affair which he said has “dramatically undercut” Trudeau’s personal brand of having the ethical high-ground.

He predicts an RCMP probe on the matter in the near future and told the Star the Liberal party will only have a chance in October if they find a new leader. Brown said that would be in their best “political self-interest,” especially with the support of Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott.

“If they went into an election with those two women behind them saying we’re cleaning up our act and we mean it,” Brown said, “it would suddenly turn the table and make the new Liberal leader potentially the voice of a new ethical government instead of the opposite.”

A long-time federal Liberal in B.C. has stated he's in ""full agreement"" with former cabinet minister Jane Philpott's assertion that Canadians would like to know the whole truth about the SNC-Lavalin affair.

In a letter to the Georgia Straight (see below), chartered professional accountant Elbert (Bert) Paul also declared that he strongly supports the creation of an independent public inquiry.

""The powers pursuant to the Inquiry Act permit summoning of witnesses to provide testimony under oath, requiring them to give evidence and produce documents,"" Paul wrote in his letter. ""A non-partisan inquiry can then address the issues of bearing false witness, contravening the Shawcross Doctrine and Section 5 of the OECD Convention as it relates to anti bribery provisions.""

Paul also chaired FLAC's audit committee.

""It is vital we protect the public interest relating to the rule of law and address these serious allegations including contravention of our international obligations,"" he wrote. ""Canadians deserve the best government possible.""

Paul's letter was written in response to an article by Martyn Brown called ""Pardon my French, Prime Minister, but you’re f#*ked”.

In the 1990s, Paul was one of the earliest and foremost public critics of the B.C. NDP government's fast-ferry scandal. During this period, a $210-million capital program ballooned into a $460-million expenditure for three vessels that were taken out of service shortly after being built.

Dear Editor,

I am writing this letter in response to Martyn Brown’s insightful article dated March 21 entitled ”Pardon my French, Prime Minister, but you’re f#*ked”.

I am a former thirty-year director and chair of the audit committee of the Federal Liberal Agency of Canada ""(FLAC)"". FLAC, is the Chief Agent of the Liberal Party of Canada.

I am in full agreement with the comments of former cabinet minister Jane Phillpott. She justifiably complained in MacLeans about “an attempt to shut down the inquiry”. I agree with her assertion that “Canadians would like to know the whole truth.” It is obvious that as Martyn Brown quoted ""There’s much more to the story that should be told.""

I would strongly support that an independent public inquiry be initiated. The powers pursuant to the Inquiry Act permit summoning of witnesses to provide testimony under oath, requiring them to give evidence and produce documents.

A non-partisan inquiry can then address the issues of bearing false witness, contravening the Shawcross Doctrine and Section 5 of the OECD Convention as it relates to anti bribery provisions.

It is vital we protect the public interest relating to the rule of law and address these serious allegations including contravention of our international obligations. Canadians deserve the best government possible.

Sincerely,

Elbert King (Bert) Paul

We’ve all seen the video of the Viking Sky cruise-ship disaster.

The water rushing in. The chaotic scenes from the bow as the ship is tossed to-and-fro. The helpless tub, dead in its tracks, threatening to crash on the rocks.

Ah, yes. The Leaky Ship Liberal.

Perilously listing. Its passengers screaming for help. A showpiece of negligence and neglect, going nowhere fast.

With Captain Trudeau asleep at the wheel and his first mate Lametti lounging as it leaks. Both are completely confounded by the sudden turn of events that has set their once proud and seemingly invincible ship-of-state reeling.

Holy crap. Now we learn that the former chair of the Liberal Agency of Canada audit committee is bolstering calls for a public inquiry into the LavScam debacle.

Do they even know how ridiculous they look, trying to maintain a stiff upper lip while doing diddly squat to respond to their government’s latest self-inflicted catastrophe?

Do they have the faintest clue how inept, insensitive, and foolhardy they appear in posing as mere bystanders in the accident-in-the-making in the name of the partisan flag now in tatters?

I am referring of course to the appalling attempt by some unknown miscreant to discredit former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould by leaking confidential information aimed at painting Chief Justice Glenn Joyal of the Manitoba Court of Queen’s Bench as an avowed enemy of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

If you are not yet quite up to speed on that fiasco—perhaps, because you’ve been too busy throwing up from the other endless sickening swells in the LavScam disaster—you can learn all about it here, here and here.

The attacks on Justice Joyal were vicious, malicious, and possibly criminal in their motivation, in their abuse of power and position, and in their potentially defamatory content and design.

They were enough to prompt him to respond with remarkable self-restraint, “I fear that someone is using my previous candidacy to the Supreme Court of Canada to further an agenda unrelated to the appointment process. This is wrong.”

They were enough to prompt Conservative MP Lisa Raitt to write to Marc Giroux, Commissioner for Federal Judicial Affairs, urging him to investigate the matter.

He responded by stressing that “The release of any such confidential information is wholly inappropriate,” but that “in light of [his] particular role and [its] enabling statute, he is “not in a position to accede to [Raitt’s] request to investigate”.

The deputy leader of the Conservatives, Lisa Raitt, wants an investigation into the leak concerning the chief justice of the Manitoba Court of Appeal.

And what of the intended target of the Liberals’ scurrilous leaks intended to present her as a de facto anti-Liberal, whose own first choice as chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada was supposedly someone who stood to undermine Trudeau’s father’s proudest legacy?

Puglaas has proved yet again that she is a woman of dignity, sound bearing, and righteous resolve who is not to be trifled with or so easily disparaged by those on her Liberal “team” (“more united than ever!”) who are so intent on doing her harm.

She forcefully responded with a call to investigate the breach of confidence, to find the leaker, and to hold him or her or them duly accountable. We should expect no less of her, as someone who could give current attorney general David Lametti lessons in what the office she held really demands in its leader.

“I do feel compelled to say that I have not—as some have suggested—been the source of any of these stories, nor have I ever authorized any person to speak on my behalf,” she said.

“I strongly condemn anyone who would speak about or provide information on such sensitive matters. Any commentary/reporting in this regard with respect to a SCC [Supreme Court of Canada] appointment(s) could compromise the integrity of the appointments process, our institutions and potentially sitting justices.”

And JWR and Raitt were far from the only persons sending out an SOS.

Others called out the nefarious leakers and urged the prime minister and Lametti to act.

The Canadian Bar Association offered this condemnation:

“There is a process to get informed input about the merits of the applicants. It rightly goes on behind closed doors. Keeping the deliberations confidential respects the privacy of applicants and guards against interference,” said CBA president Ray Adlington.

“Breaching confidentiality by releasing the names and commenting on the suitability of the other applicants after the appointment demeans the selection process and ultimately all those who hold the office of judge.”

The Law Society of Manitoba issued this statement:

“The Law Society of Manitoba is very concerned when circumstances arise that will weaken the public’s confidence in the administration of justice. A highly confidential process has been established to encourage the best and brightest candidates to put their names forward for appointment to all levels of courts.

“The integrity of that process is called into question when the confidentiality of deliberations and discussions about candidates appears not to have been maintained.

“Confidentiality is critical to protecting the reputation of all applicants including sitting judges, who are not able to respond to unjust criticism. The aspersions cast in recent media reports on Chief Justice Glenn Joyal of the Manitoba Court of Queen’s Bench represent an unwarranted attack on a distinguished judicial career.”

Oh, yes. Trudeau’s leakers also had no compunctions about compromising CTV’s journalistic best interests in choosing that esteemed forum as the most suitable outlet for their spurious counter-rationale for JWR’s supposed longstanding friction with the prime minister.

A false twist on the true treachery, as it were, that was supposed create new cover for Trudeau’s firing of the main person who could be trusted to protect the rule of law and the independence of her office as Canada’s first Indigenous attorney general.

David Lametti was sworn in as attorney general and justice minister at Rideau Hall as Justin Trudeau looked on. Adam Scotti/Prime Minister's Office

Yet despite that crescendo of outrage crying out for action, echoed by so many pundits, columnists, and others, what have we heard in response from Trudeau and Lametti?

After three days, no less?

Absolutely nothing of hard consequence.

Neither Trudeau nor Lametti apparently have any intention of investigating that wanton breach of public trust.

They have so far failed to take any action to investigate that egregious violation of personal privacy and that calculated smear on a sitting justice and on JWR, which is at its core yet another deliberate affront to justice.

Lametti’s Twitter response was pathetic.

It was as weak as Trudeau’s mealy-mouthed prattle that could be interpreted as he damn well knows or suspects that the leaks came from within his own office. And it seems he won’t be doing anything to try to identify and potentially prosecute the person(s) responsible.

Video of Raitt demands investigation into SCC appointment leaks Watch Lisa Raitt tell CTV why she thinks there needs to be an investigation.

This, from the guy who only last month waxed on about his father’s deep commitment to justice.

Who bleated that “those principles of justice are fundamental to me in what we are as a country, what we want to be as a society. And I have spent my entire political career fighting for justice and for people … the SNC-Lavalin file was not an exception.”

Some fight. He has done more in his single term in office to erode Canadians’ confidence in justice and the rule of law than any other prime minister in living memory.

Meanwhile, the whole Liberal crew hides behind the ludicrous tweets of Sheila Copps, who seems to be quite comfortable debasing herself with no end of attacks aimed at discrediting JWR and former treasury board president Jane Philpott and driving them both out of caucus.

The party that once held itself above all others as a moral force of international repute is now a rudderless vessle awash in its own bilge water.

It doesn’t look, act, or smell anything like its former “renewed” post-Adscam, self. And that won’t change as long as the guy with the real dirt on his hands is at the helm.

His arrogance knows no bounds, as he demonstrated yet again at the Liberal fundraiser in which he laughed off protesters from the Grassy Narrows First Nation who were concerned about mercury contamination in their communities with the sarcastic dismissal: “Thank you very much for your donation tonight. I really appreciate the donation to the Liberal Party of Canada.”

This is what it’s come to, really? Making jokes aimed at disparaging Indigenous peoples whose health is being threatened by mercury poisoning and tainted water supplies that successive governments have done nothing about?

Yeah, that’ll go a long way to advancing the goal of reconciliation.

Despite his belated apology after getting pounded by all who watched the clip, that type of “leadership” goes a long to explaining why Trudeau’s approval rating is now lower than Donald Trump’s, according to one new poll.

I say again, it ought to be Trudeau who walks the plank if his battered ship is to have any chance of winning back the public confidence needed to convince Canadians it’s safe to ride for another term in government.

And if the contrast between Puglaas and Lametti previously flattered the former, the latter is now also looking like he might be unworthy of the independent office that he was invited to uphold.

Get off your sorry butt and at least pretend that you are not so afraid to offend your sinking captain by getting to the bottom of this matter that was so wrongly initiated under his watch and in his perceived partisan interests.

Like the greater LavScam scandal that gave rise to this new wrongdoing, this fiasco threatens to corrode and degrade all it touches in its filthy wake.

Anyone involved in it deserves to be royally keelhauled.","Martyn Brown: Lametti lounges on the Leaky Ship Liberal, as Puglaas issues an SOS",The Georgia Straight,https://www.straight.com/news/1220131/martyn-brown-lametti-lounges-leaky-ship-liberal-puglaas-issues-sos

Within minutes Monday afternoon, two good reporters had stories (here and here) about the Chief Justice of Manitoba, who was a candidate to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada and who, later, wasn’t. Both reporters unfurled similar yarns about a lone Prime Minister standing athwart the tide of conservatism by blocking—shudder—a Harper appointee from sitting on the top court. Jody Wilson-Raybould plays the role of villain in the piece.

Both reporters decorously neglect to mention that Trudeau’s choice for Chief Justice, Richard Wagner, was a Harper appointee.

There are many things we can say about this story, working outward in concentric rings from the thing itself. First, Glenn Joyal’s views, as expressed in speeches that were said to alarm the prime minister, are almost comically orthodox. I first became aware of the notion that Charter litigation systematically airlifts important matters from the parliamentary arena and into the realm of jurisprudence in a Chantal Hébert column in the late 1990s. If I had paid more attention to literally any of my Canadian public administration profs a decade earlier I would have caught the argument then, because it is canvassed in every Canadian political science class. This is not wild-eyed Hayekism.

Second, perhaps the many thousands of Canadians who have applied for federal government appointments under what they thought was a confidential process, introduced by this prime minister, will want to contemplate a class-action suit against him. Because it is now radiantly clear to each of them that their CV is being held hostage by a claque of embattled sorcerers’ apprentices who will cheerfully wheel it over the transom to any waiting scribe if anything about them—their opinions, a fallen political star’s unfortunate decision to argue for their advancement—becomes politically inconvenient. This is the very stuff of the police state.

It was immediately fashionable to wonder on social media how everyone would react if Stephen Harper had done such a thing. It’s germane to note that Stephen Harper never did. Because he had more class. Welcome to the Tet offensive of Charter rights: This was the week it became necessary to destroy the village of good government in order to save it.

Third, Justice Joyal’s wife was in poor health. Apparently we are to believe that 9,000 jobs depended on your knowing that.

If the Trudeau government is not the source of the leak, I assume we will see spectacular efforts deployed in the next 36 hours to find the leaker. Mark Norman-scale efforts. But I’m pretty sure that we needn’t hold our breath, because the government is the source of the leak; that the amiable chap who currently sits in the office once occupied by the Attorney General of Canada will not bestir himself to question Monday’s sickening attack on due process; and that the leak will actually be roundly applauded by the ambient cloud of Liberal and Liberal-adjacent opinion, which became self-aware this weekend and decided Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott are a virus endangering the party’s re-election chances and must therefore be stopped.

That’s right, it’s Judgment Day. As early as March 5, it was possible for Andrew Cohen to publish a column identifying Philpott and Wilson-Raybould as enemies of the (right-thinking) people. But not for the first time, Andrew was ahead of the moment, and when that column ran, he found few takers. The news that the Criminal Code had been amended in ways SNC-Lavalin found congenial as it faced a criminal trial for serious alleged misdeeds was interesting to millions of Canadians, including many Liberals. Justin Trudeau’s slow, tentative response was worrisome to lots of people who support the government, just as it was to many others. It was still possible for many minds to find room for both general support for Liberal re-election and general interest in what Wilson-Raybould and Philpott — recent Liberal rock stars, after all — had to say.

Then Maclean’s published my interview with Philpott last Thursday morning. On Thursday night’s At Issue panel, Chantal said that with Gerald Butts and Michael Wernick no longer working in government, Philpott and Wilson-Raybould were clearly looking for someone else to lose a job, and it must be Justin Trudeau. This interpretation became popular quickly (and probably would have even if Chantal hadn’t given it voice). By Saturday it was easy to find Liberals and friends of Liberals — pollsters, the odd political scientist, about half the party’s Ontario caucus — attributing the worst motives to the two former ministers. They were “infatuated with ephemeral attention,” said Frank Graves. They were committing “an attempted coup d’état,” wrote a lawyer with impressive credentials, Ishat Reza. This behaviour is, she added, “disqualifying.” This is understatement: Historical penalties for coup plotting have been harsher than exclusion from a governing caucus.

Qui veut noyer son chien l’accuse de la rage, we say in Quebec. When you want to drown your dog you say it has rabies.

This SNC-Lavalin business has been bewildering — honestly bewildering, in ways that are surely easy to understand — for many Canadians with good hearts since it began. It is an odd scandal by many standards. No money changed hands illegally, or at least not after the Qaddafis were executed. None of the assorted Liberal staffers and high officials who came at Jody Wilson-Raybould was seeking personal advancement, except insofar as many of them wanted to be on the winning side in an election and, she asserts, kept telling her so. They kept asking whether she’d seek outside advice on a decision that was the public prosecutor’s to make and the AG’s to review. When they were done asking, the prosecutor’s decision held. That would have been the end of that, if she hadn’t been shuffled. Then it became a duel of assertions and interpretations.

It’s easy to understand why all of this would seem minor and technical. An interesting theological debating point, but surely not worth more than a month of headlines and anguished commentary. So it didn’t get real, for many people, until Conservatives took the lead from Liberals in the polls — and Jane Philpott, whom Trudeau had been busy promoting in cabinet, announced that she too doesn’t like whatever she says she knows.

This puts the stakes high indeed. Everything Trudeau advocates is endangered, not by his own increasingly conspicuous limitations as a public administrator, but by the shorter route of a possible Conservative election victory this autumn. So it is all Liberal hands on deck. All of this is easy to understand.

I felt something like this was coming when I wrote, near the bottom of a column I wrote last November that was published in December, that an election is “the crudest possible instrument” for fixing serious shortcomings in public administration. It’s simply not true that if you don’t like something a government does you must replace it. But nor should re-electing the Liberals mean endorsing Justin Trudeau’s increasingly obvious flaws. The issues raised by the SNC-Lavalin controversy shouldn’t be settled by an election. Some misdeeds are worth dealing with as themselves, when they come up. And then let the election settle the election.

What is at stake in this affair is whether you can get the rules changed in mid-stream if you have the right friends or can hire them. Whether the decisions of competent professionals — beginning with an experienced prosecutor and defence lawyer, Kathleen Roussel — should be trumped by appeals to a preferred electoral outcome. This sort of system-rigging has been at the heart of, for instance, Poland’s confrontation with the European Union over judicial “reforms” that systematically benefit associates of the current regime. Reforms that are immensely popular among people who agree with the ruling party that they tilt the balance back toward fairness in a confrontation against political opponents they judge to be moral failures. Because it’s not only in Canada that you can win many arguments by saying, “Of course this helps our side, but that’s okay because our side is right.”

There’s a neat symmetry here. Jody Wilson-Raybould claimed she was approached, again and again, by people who said things had to work out a certain way because it was an election year. The emerging Liberal argument this month has been, not that this claim was untrue, but that of course it is true and should be. Wilson-Raybould and Philpott have sinned against a higher virtue so sure of itself that it cannot be troubled with the fine print. This sin is deemed disqualifying. They will soon be disqualified by their fellow Liberals, for the (synonymous) good of the party and the nation. And if you’ve sent your CV to Ottawa, have no fear. It probably won’t get leaked until it needs to be.

But for me to publicly criticize the government as a Liberal would undermine the government and ...,"The Walrus/flickr

On September 17, 2018, Parliament’s first day back from summer break, Leona Alleslev, the Liberal MP from Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill, rose in the House of Commons to announce her defection from the governing Liberal Party of Canada. “The government must be challenged openly and publicly. But for me to publicly criticize the government as a Liberal would undermine the government and, according to my code of conduct, be dishonourable,” she said. “After careful and deliberate consideration, I must withdraw from the government benches to take my seat among the ranks of my Conservative colleagues.”

New to politics when she was first elected in 2015, Alleslev is a hard-nosed and plain-spoken air force veteran. Before her dramatic exit, her time in office had been somewhat unexceptional, save for her early career appointment as parliamentary secretary to public-services and procurement minister Judy Foote—a notable promotion for a rookie MP. Still, she was, until she switched sides, little known outside of political and military circles.

The media immediately scoured her social media for signs of dissent but turned up nothing—no instances of serious disagreement with the party, no off-the-cuff clashes with Liberal colleagues, no pretension of sticking it to the man for the sake of her constituents. Rather, by all appearances, Alleslev had fallen in line with the party. Throughout her tenure, she offered reassurances that team Trudeau was on the right track. In July, two months before switching sides, she fawned over the prime minister, foreign-affairs minister Chrystia Freeland, and defence minister Harjit Sajjan in a private email, calling them “truly awesome.” Nine days later, she praised Trudeau’s leadership at a fundraising event.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer wasted no time taking advantage of her move. “For all those Canadians who supported Justin Trudeau in 2015 and are dissatisfied or even angry about the leadership that he’s been giving,” he told a room full of reporters, “the Conservative Party needs you.” He had apparently forgiven her previous anti-Conservative criticism. During a 2015 election debate in her riding, Alleslev lamented having watched the country under Stephen Harper “become something I barely recognize—socially, politically, economically, and internationally.” But the Trudeau government, in the end, apparently fared just as poorly in Alleslev’s eyes. Bidding adieu to her fellow caucus members, she referenced wide-ranging failures on tax reform, trade, foreign policy, defence, and security. She assured everyone who asked that it was never only one issue.

The act of switching teams requires a flexibility uncommon among twenty-first-century politicians. Alleslev considers herself among that rare breed of lawmaker. “As a member of Parliament, it’s my job to listen to everybody,” she told me. “I’m not sure that’s always the most widely held opinion.” She sees in modern politics a tendency to characterize all debate as conflict and worries about where that will lead. “If you look where we are, not only in Canada but in the world, where we’re becoming far more divided, far less able to have conservations with those that we have differing opinions with, we’re at risk of losing the value of debate.”

The resignations of two high-profile cabinet ministers over the Liberals’ mishandling of the SNC-Lavalin affair have since brought the question of debate within parties into greater focus. Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former justice minister and attorney general, and Jane Philpott, the former Treasury Board president, two of Trudeau’s most respected ministers, brazenly stood against the prime minister and his office and still remain in the Liberal caucus. Their actions lend credibility to Alleslev’s story while undermining the necessity of her departure. She chose to keep her quarrels with the party silent, she says, because dissenting openly would jeopardize its ability to govern.

But, in keeping quiet for so long, Alleslev has opened herself up to accusations of political opportunism. “Did you put your finger in the air to see which way the wind was blowing,” pressed CTV’s Don Martin, “and figure it was going to go Conservative in 2019, so you might as well join the parade?” If she hopes to regain her seat in 2019, Alleslev will need to prove those accusations wrong. She will need to convince her supporters that switching sides was more than simply self-interested politics, despite what the opposition says. And the Liberals will come armed with stories spun by former staffers and Liberal hard-liners with an incentive to discredit her. All voters have is her word. Whether she honestly acted in their interest or not, the fallout that ensued suggests intentions are moot. Few things are as politically isolating as crossing the floor.

Since Confederation, 340 MPs have changed party affiliation, willingly or not, between elections. Those who leave tend to opt for independence, with many soon switching again to join another party or to return to their former caucus. While some forty countries have laws pertaining to crossing the floor—in most cases, defecting legislators are forced to give up their seats—there’s no federal convention, legislation, or parliamentary rule regarding it in Canada. Manitoba and New Brunswick have enacted laws forcing outgoing caucus members to sit independently for the remainder of the term. But both the Liberals and Conservatives seem less keen to hamstring members’ freedom. In 2005, the federal government defeated a bill proposing that changes in party affiliation be followed by a by-election. Similar legislation has been introduced regularly in parliamentary sessions since; all have failed to pass first reading.

However, a series of ethics inquiries suggests floor crossers came under greater scrutiny beginning in the early 2000s, as crossing grew in popularity. Some forty-four MPs switched sides between 2001 and 2005, which, according to a 2006 study, outpaced the previous eighty-year average of twenty-three crossings per decade. In 2005, former ethics commissioner Bernard Shapiro was asked to determine whether a member had contravened the Conflict of Interest Code in switching parties. The following year, his attention turned to investigating Prime Minister Stephen Harper. In question was whether Harper had bribed Liberal MP David Emerson into leaving his party with the perks of a cabinet position with the Conservatives. Shapiro found no wrongdoing, but noted, “The discontent expressed by Canadians on this matter cannot be attributed merely to the machinations of partisan politics. Fairly or unfairly, this particular instance has given many citizens a sense that their vote—the cornerstone of our democratic system—was somehow devalued, if not betrayed.”

A number high-profile defections have been viewed as politically expedient, such as those of Belinda Stronach, in 2005, and Eve Adams, in 2015. Stronach left the Conservatives and was granted a cabinet seat with the Liberals, a move she made, some suspect, to help keep Paul Martin’s minority government in power ahead of two important budget votes. Adams deserted the Conservatives over their “mean-spirited leadership” six months after dropping out of a nomination-race in a new riding and was welcomed by Trudeau’s Liberals with open arms.

In Alleslev’s case, journalists and political pundits raised the possibility that she was reacting to the Ontario Liberal Party’s defeat in June 2018. During that provincial election, the riding of Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill saw Conservative Michael Parsa win by more than twice as many votes as the Liberal runner-up. By comparison, in 2014, each of the predecessor districts that now make up the new riding—Newmarket-Aurora, Oak Ridges–Markham, and Richmond Hill—had voted Liberal. The losses are notable, but they offer little insight into the projected electoral outcome for the region in October. According to the CBC, the federal party that has won the most seats in Ontario has been different in 52 percent of elections from the one currently in power provincially.

At the federal level, the ethnically diverse riding of Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill remains a toss-up between the reds and blues. It would be foolish to think Alleslev had special insight, more than one year out, into how the election will unfold. What we know is this: in Ontario, the parties have been neck and neck in the polls since early 2018, and an analysis of polling numbers by the website Calculated Politics, taken only weeks before Alleslev’s defection, projected the Conservatives were on par to win Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill by a margin of just 2 percent.

What seems to set defectors apart is an ability to exploit the divisive nature of politics today to their own advantage. It’s a quality Alleslev seems to have put to work during her 2014 nomination race. Clayton Haluza, president of the federal Liberal riding association in Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill, hadn’t the faintest idea who she was when she approached him at a fundraising event that year. Haluza found her straightforwardness refreshing for a political hopeful. But Alleslev had no ties to the Liberal party, hadn’t served in municipal politics, and wasn’t particularly involved in the community.

Alleslev’s aloofness was the result of having, as she says, “never, ever considered” a life in politics. Instead, she envisioned spending her entire career in the military—a calling she says teaches you to put country first. Her father retired as a two-star general from the Royal Canadian Air Force; his father had resisted the Nazis in Denmark as a member of the Danish underground. She came to believe that “serving one’s country is an honourable profession.” In 1991, she joined the Canadian military as a second lieutenant, logistics officer in Comox, BC, having studied history and political science at the Royal Military College in Kingston, Ontario. A decade later, following her retirement from the military, she worked as a consultant, at times within the federal government, and eventually landed in the private sector at IBM and Bombardier Aerospace.

Alleslev says it was Harper government that motivated her to join the Liberal Party in 2014. She thought their policies weren’t positioning Canada competitively and that, in contrast, the Liberals were making bold promises on everything from foreign policy to infrastructure spending, which she found appealing. Sitting in her Richmond Hill office late last year, she told me she began to sense, around four years ago, that “some pretty dramatic things” were unfolding at home and abroad. She was unsure about running for office, however, until she met Jason Cherniak, who was seeking the nomination. A lawyer based out of Richmond Hill, then in his midthirties, Cherniak was as faithful as they come: a card-carrying Liberal since high school, he went on to serve on the Young Liberals of Canada national executive and later as president of the Richmond Hill federal riding association and as president of the Liberal Party of Canada (Ontario) Central Region.

“Considering how significant the challenges facing the country and world are right now, I’m not sure he’s the right guy to represent me as a member of Parliament,” she said, thinking back. “Ah rats—I’m going to have to run.”

With existing ties to the Liberal Party, Cherniak was confident he had a shot at the nomination. But he began to suspect party upper brass were favouring Alleslev. “That part of it has been very difficult for me,” Cherniak says, “because after all these years of volunteering, I really thought that at the very least I had earned a chance at a fair race.” Alleslev had virtually no political experience, but she was a veteran and strong leader who stood in contrast to Conservative incumbent, Costas Menegakis. She played right into the optimistic, feminist narrative the Liberals were hoping to tell. As the Globe and Mail’s Adam Radwanski has noted, Trudeau “made a point of recruiting a diverse array of candidates who, despite impressive professional credentials, often did not have much partisan political experience.”

So intent was the party to win the riding that it overlooked what one former staffer now considers several “red flags.” Alleslev’s sister Caroline vied for the Conservative seat in Beaches–East York in 2008. And, throughout the nomination race, Alleslev could be found in tow of Greg Beros, a staunch Conservative and Richmond Hill city councillor. “You know that Leona’s a good, dear friend,” Beros would say when introducing her to members of local community groups. “While I can’t vote for her, because she’s with the Liberal Party, she is a great individual and would represent us well.” Beros recused himself from supporting her come the election. “Some people are candidate first, party second,” he says. “I’m always party first, candidate second.”

Alleslev succeeded at connecting with influential members of the riding’s Muslim community, whose support, both financial and otherwise, was “key to her getting the nomination,” says Haluza. She was later able to leverage constituents’ unhappiness with the Conservatives’ anti-immigrant rhetoric over “Canadian values” to garner widespread approval among members of the Muslim community. Without their support, many Liberals believe she would have lost in the general election. In the end, a combination of Alleslev’s own political abilities and the Conservatives’ hardline tactics helped mobilize the Muslim community at the polls, and she clinched the seat by fewer than 1,100 votes.

Following the win, a different picture of Alleslev began to emerge, one the Liberals could attempt to resuscitate during the upcoming election. In several instances, sources speaking on background say Alleslev was reluctant to credit the Muslim community for its role in her electoral success. This, they say, left some supporters feeling hurt and embittered. (In a request for comment, Alleslev apologized. “I like to think of myself as being sensitive,” she said. “So if I have been in any way insensitive, then I’m very sorry for that.”). According to the sources, that resentment was amplified by Alleslev’s decision to join the Conservatives, a party which has shown itself—most recently through its promise to withdraw Canada from the UN’s Global Compact for Safe, Orderly, and Regular Migration—to be less open to refugees and immigrants. In 2019, Alleslev will have to grapple with having alienated a group that fervently supported her only four years ago.

“A political party is made up of the people who are in it at the time and must be judged by what the country needs at the time,” Alleslev has said, in explanation of her actions. By this, she appears to suggest that political parties aren’t monolithic entities but rather are born out of a particular time and place and defined by their caucuses, which presumably have voters’ best interests at heart. This logic enables Alleslev to argue it’s not her principles but rather the needs of Canadians that have changed since she first entered politics.

Her position reveals a grey area, rarely acknowledged in federal politics, that can be exploited by politicians willing to see beyond fervent partisanship. The Liberals and Conservatives may have the tendency to disagree, especially during election years, and their rhetoric may be different, but their track records suggest they’re more similar than they’re wont to admit. “To this day, if you go down line by line and look at what the Conservative and Liberal party stand for,” Haluza says, “at least on paper, it’s shades of grey.”

Alleslev seems to have leveraged this dynamic to her own advantage. Justifying her defection, she accused the Liberals of failing to meet the NATO target that members spend at least 2 percent of GDP on defence, even though Trudeau campaigned on maintaining previous spending levels. The truth is, no sitting government has met NATO’s targets since they were enacted in 2006. Alleslev also rebuked the Liberals’ diplomatic track record, citing tensions with Saudi Arabia, China, and India. This critique ignores the Conservatives’ own failings, such as in 2010, when Canada was forced to withdraw from pursuing a seat on the UN Security Council, a move interpreted by an article in OpenCanada as a “stinging rebuke of Harper’s anti-UN foreign policy.” (Trudeau has pledged to vie for a seat on the council in 2020). Their similarities extend to the economy, where both parties are quick to talk about more free-trade agreements and tax relief for the middle class.

But, if the parties are so alike, why would Alleslev leave one for the other? To the former colleagues who are quick to mention Alleslev’s ambition, it’s easy to craft a tale of opportunity. Alleslev’s political career was off to a strong start when, in late 2015, she was named Foote’s parliamentary secretary. The public-services minister’s mandate included replacing the country’s fleet of aging CF-18s and supporting a national shipbuilding procurement strategy—two areas that would seem to be of strong personal interest to Alleslev. As parliamentary secretary, she supported these files. But she also worked on Phoenix, the payment system for the federal civil service, the deployment of which has been riddled with complications.

According to a 2018 Senate finance committee report, more than half of the Canadian civil service has not been properly paid since Phoenix’s implementation in 2016. The report notes that the project will likely amass $2.2 billion in unplanned costs by 2023, making it an “international embarrassment.” When questioned about Phoenix on Foote’s behalf, Alleslev would assure legislators the system would soon be fixed. But the situation remained chaotic, and following a cabinet shuffle in January 2017, she was demoted from her role as parliamentary secretary. Historically, such appointments have been used to prepare (or rather to test the readiness of) future cabinet ministers. Alleslev would later cite the Liberals’ failure to resolve Phoenix as among her reasons for leaving the party.

Throwing herself in with the Conservatives has, conveniently, allowed her to regain lost momentum. National media attention has made her a familiar face and a champion of the Conservative cause. And, with Scheer swiftly appointing her shadow cabinet secretary for global security, she has reclaimed a prominent role in the House. It may prove to be an important career pick-me-up, given that she was ousted as chair of the Canadian NATO parliamentary association one month after defecting. Like the majority of floor-crossing MPs before her, Alleslev could have ridden out her term as an independent, thereby limiting speculation on her motives, but she says she decided against it, believing that the Canadian system is not “structured for independence.” Independent members rarely sit on committees, are not recognized as often during Question Period, and lose the support of a caucus. They are, in other words, less influential.

Alleslev has always been focused on maximizing her influence. She entered politics with her mind set on transforming the country and, after three years, came to believe she couldn’t do it as a Liberal. An early party switch meant trying to make the most of what could be her last year in office, she says, noting she had the support of her family and many constituents. But it also meant alienating supporters and staff who fought to get her elected and who now have reason to want to see her lose. Later this year, they will get their say on whether her actions were genuine and, above all, justified.",The Politics of Switching Parties,The Walrus,https://thewalrus.ca/the-politics-of-switching-parties/

The Nanaimo-Ladysmith seat became vacant after New Democrat MP Sheila Malcolmson stepped down to successfully run for a seat in the provincial legislature in January.

article continues below

Corfield has served as chair of the Nanaimo Port Authority, chair of the Legislative Council of the Ucluelet First Nation and as a founding member of the Ucluelet First Nation Settlement Trust.

The Conservatives have selected 32-year-old financial manager John Hirst. Jennifer Clarke, who lost the nomination to Hirst, will represent the new People’s Party of Canada, led by Quebec MP Maxime Bernier.

They’ll be running against Green candidate Paul Manly, a researcher, filmmaker and communications specialist who placed fourth in the 2015 election. The son of former NDP MP Jim Manly, he campaigned on Gabriola Island and downtown Nanaimo with Green Party Leader Elizabeth May on Sunday. “This byelection is your opportunity to vote without fear or compromise — because the outcome is not going to change the government. A vote for any other party is a vote for the status quo,” he said in a Twitter message.

The New Democrat candidate has yet to be chosen, but two are seeking the nomination. Bob Chamberlin, the long-serving chief councillor of a First Nation based in the Broughton Archipelago off northeastern Vancouver Island, will face Lauren Semple, a former constituency assistant to Malcolmson.

Semple is a women’s rights activist who has been director of the past three Nanaimo Pride festivals. She also helped organize the Nanaimo Women March On event.

In announcing his bid for the nomination, Chamberlin said he has spent much of his life in the Nanaimo area and understands issues important to the riding such as affordable housing and childcare, and a workable pharmacare system covering prescription drugs. He said in his roles leading the Kwikwasut’inuxw Haxwa’mis First Nation and as vice-president of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs, he has worked with Liberal and Conservative governments, served as chair of several agencies and boards, and advocated on a range of issues.

“We can get better results for Canadians from coast to coast to coast, but it’s not going to happen under a Trudeau government that continually overlooks the practical needs of Canadians just looking to get by and needing to make their lives more affordable,” Chamberlin said.

Michael Prince, the Lansdowne professor of social policy at the University of Victoria, said this byelection is the NDP’s to win or lose.

“The NDP are third in the national polls, but this byelection is not going to be a two-way race between the Liberals and Conservatives,” said Prince. “This is for the NDP to hold and I don’t think they’ll take anything for granted.”

Late last fall, Trudeau held his Liberal cabinet retreat in Nanaimo, Prince noted. “He’s been holding cabinet retreats in various parts of the country. I think the idea of holding one on Vancouver Island was to wave the Liberal flag and show a presence. He also held a town hall meeting. He has been to Nanaimo twice and this is a government which has no seats on the Island. He’s coming into an area that, historically, has either voted NDP or Conservative. There’s some thinking there’s potential on the Island,” said Prince.

Prince wonders if Vancouver Islanders will see Bernier in the riding. The People’s Party of Canada took 10.6 per cent of the vote in last month’s Burnaby-South byelection.

Malcolmson was one of several NDP MPs, including Victoria’s Murray Rankin, who decided not to run again in October’s federal election.

“I hope that our candidates will represent our country, but … we won’t do anything to attract people with different backgrounds. I think these people are coming right now,” Bernier told reporters in Ottawa.

Bernier said he “hopes” that the PPC has a “huge diversity” of candidates, but that it won’t impose any diversity requirements on those who run.

In comparison, part of the Liberal Party’s nomination process is to ensure that a “thorough search” has been conducted for women candidates or others who reflect the demographics of the riding they hope to be nominated in. The NDP have also instituted diversity-based rules recently, requiring that leadership candidates in 2017 collect 50 per cent of required signatures from women in the party, and 100 of the required 500 signatures from traditionally marginalized groups.

Bernier and Johanne Mennie, the party’s communications director, held a press conference on Monday to announce that the PPC had opened its online selection process. It will be open until April 23, with candidate selection meetings to follow between May 7 and May 13.

“The PPC is on target and will be ready for the general elections,” Mennie said.

Bernier said that the party will conduct thorough background checks of potential candidates, similarly to what they did for the executives of the party’s electoral district associations (EDA). The party’s leader said it conducted background checks of EDA presidents, as well as checks of their social media accounts.

Bernier said it’s important that candidates share the values of the party, in order to be nominated.

“That’s most important to us; these people must share our values,” Bernier said.

“People who don’t share our values, they can create their own party, they are not welcome in our party,” Bernier said.

The PPC leader also said he hasn’t called any of his former colleagues in the Conservative Party in the House of Commons or the Senate, to try and convince them to join the PPC as candidates. He maintained that his party will field a full 338 candidates in fall’s general election.

The People’s Party ran its first three candidates in the Feb. 25 byelections in Outremont, York–Simcoe and Burnaby South. Jennifer M. Clarke, who was beat out of the Conservative Party nomination in Nanaimo—Ladysmith, is the People’s Party candidate in the byelection in the riding that was recently announced to be held on May 6.

The Hill Times reported Monday that single-term former Conservative MP Corneliu Chisu would be running as a candidate for the People’s Party in the next election.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Ben Nelms The prime minister fired off a flurry of verbal jabs at Conservative Party leader ...","VANCOUVER — Justin Trudeau delivered a feisty, campaign-style speech in Vancouver-Kingsway Sunday night as he introduced former TV news anchor Tamara Taggart as the riding’s Liberal candidate in the fall federal election.

The prime minister fired off a flurry of verbal jabs at Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer, and also former prime minister Stephen Harper, giving a glimpse of what could be a heated campaign for the October election.

“Investing in people and communities is the way to grow the economy. Stephen Harper and the Conservatives still don’t get it. Andrew Sheer doesn’t get it either,” he said to a gym full of enthusiastic supporters.

“Under Stephen Harper, Canada had the worst growth rate we’d had since the depths of the Great Depression under R. B. Bennett.”

Trudeau then accused Sheer’s Conservatives of hoping to continue Harper’s policies by giving tax breaks to the wealthy while cutting programs for the middle and lower classes.

“They still think the way to create economic growth for everyone is to cut programs and give advantages and benefits to the wealthiest,” he said. “Well, that doesn’t trickle down to anyone and it didn’t work for 10 years.”

Trudeau pitched the upcoming election as an opportunity for all Canadians to step up and start talking about the kind of country they want to leave for their children and grandchildren.

“Do we want to invest in the middle class — shine on the world stage,” he asked, before warning that Canada “is seeing the rise of populism, aggressive, fear-based politics, just like the rest of the world.”

The crowd roared its approval when the prime minister suggested the best way to counter divisive populism is by recruiting “strong, compassionate people who’ve focused their lives on bringing people together and on empowering people.”

He lauded Taggart as one of those people from all walks of Canadian life who have invested in their communities in various ways to grow the economy, respond to the challenges of climate change and put Canada on the world stage.

Taggart admitted feeling a bit overwhelmed and emotional at being on stage, especially seeing her children holding up signs that read, “Team Tamara.”

The Order of British Columbia recipient said she wants to be the people’s voice in Ottawa, adding that her media career made her a good listener.

While Taggart steered clear of talking about the specifics of her campaign platform at the event, she has previously said that she wants to focus on affordable housing, protecting the environment while boosting the economy, and women’s health and safety.

She’s likely to face a tough challenge in Vancouver-Kingsway, which has been held by New Democrat MP Don Davies since 2008.

63,Politics,2019-03-26T22:39:00.0000000Z,Toronto MP Nate Erskine-Smith was the only Liberal who spoke during the ethics committee meeting. Although Erskine-Smith has a track record of challenging the party line ... “No one in Canada believes that the justice committee is going to revisit ...,"OTTAWA — Liberal MPs have blocked the latest attempt to provide a venue for former cabinet ministers Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott to testify on the SNC-Lavalin affair.

On Tuesday, the battleground moved to the Commons ethics committee, which considered a Conservative motion to launch a study after the Liberal-dominated justice committee voted to conclude its investigation without calling more witnesses.

But the six Liberals on the ethics committee out-voted the Conservatives, who had two votes, and the NDP, who had one, and the motion failed.

Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre called the result especially ironic given recent comments from some Liberal MPs that it was time for Wilson-Raybould to just say her piece, rather than dribbling out news day-by-day. In the most prominent example, Liberal MP Judy Sgro said in a radio interview over the weekend that Wilson-Raybould needed to “either put up or shut up.”

“Today, the Liberals got together and voted against giving her the chance to say it,” Poilievre told reporters. “You know, this is a cavalcade of contradictions and cover-up.”

Parliament has been seized by the SNC-Lavalin affair for nearly two months now, after The Globe and Mail published an allegation on Feb. 7 that Wilson-Raybould had been politically pressured while attorney general to intervene and defer the corruption prosecution of the construction company.

Toronto MP Nate Erskine-Smith was the only Liberal who spoke during the ethics committee meeting. Although Erskine-Smith has a track record of challenging the party line, and had even previously cast a vote in favour of holding a public inquiry on the matter, he told the committee he felt launching the study was premature.

He noted Wilson-Raybould planned to provide a written submission to the justice committee that included further evidence, including text messages and emails.

“To me, it makes far more sense to see what is said in that public statement, to see how justice (committee) reacts to that, frankly, and whether they think any of that new information is something worth reconsidering their previous decision to close off their study,” Erskine-Smith said.

The NDP’s Tracey Ramsey rejected that, saying the Liberals blocked multiple attempts to keep the investigation going. “No one in Canada believes that the justice committee is going to revisit that,” she said. “There is absolutely no indication that they will entertain any further conversation.”

The Conservatives offered an amendment to call Wilson-Raybould only after her submission to the justice committee, but Erskine-Smith said it was too early to make decisions before seeing what she provided. It is not known when Wilson-Raybould will make her submission, but justice committee chair Anthony Housefather has said it will be made public.

Erskine-Smith also pointed out that Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion is already studying the matter, and said the committee should support Dion’s study rather than launch a parallel process.

Finally, Erskine-Smith argued that the waiver provided by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Wilson-Raybould on cabinet confidence privilege and solicitor-client privilege only covered testimony to the justice committee, not the ethics committee.

That waiver has become its own source of conflict, however. Wilson-Raybould has pointed out it does not apply to events after she was removed as justice minister, and opposition parties have demanded Trudeau provide an expanded waiver to cover that time period. Philpott also said in an interview in Maclean’s magazine last week that there was “much more to the story that should be told.”

This breach of the confidentiality of what is supposed to be a highly confidential judicial appointment process is serious enough to require an investigation on its own

After the meeting, while other Liberal MPs left without making their position clear, Erskine-Smith stayed and said he believed an expanded waiver may be necessary — depending what Wilson-Raybould’s evidence to the justice committee showed.

“If still, to get at the truth, there is additional information that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott need to provide that they are unable to provide because of the confines of the existing waiver, then yes, to get at the truth there should be a broadening of that waiver,” he said.

He said he believed that was only a fair position, given the comments from some of his colleagues that “we should get all of this information out in the open as quickly as possible and deal with it and move on.”

Both the Conservatives and NDP — and even Erskine-Smith — condemned two stories that came out Monday that contained leaks about the Supreme Court of Canada appointment process. The stories cited confidential sources to allege that tension had arisen between Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould when she recommended the appointment of Glenn Joyal, a Manitoba judge who Trudeau felt to be too conservative.

“This breach of the confidentiality of what is supposed to be a highly confidential judicial appointment process is serious enough to require an investigation on its own,” said Conservative MP Peter Kent during the meeting.

Speaking earlier in the day, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau did not respond directly when asked by a reporter whether his office leaked the story.

“Canadians can have confidence in our government’s respect for the institutions, for the Supreme Court,” he said. “Canadians have confidence in the strength of our judiciary in this country. And I have no further comment to make on this issue.”

The protesters would have had to pay $1,500 to get into the room at the fundraiser at a downtown Toronto hotel; Trudeau says those funds will be returned to the protesters.

Trudeau says he will follow up with Indigenous Services Minister Seamus O’Reagan to encourage progress on the problem of mercury poisoning in Grassy Narrows.

""Thank you very much for your donation ...","Ottawa (AFP) - Canadian leader Justin Trudeau apologized Thursday for a rare lapse in his unflappable, everyman persona after responding with heavy sarcasm to indigenous protestors who interrupted him at a party fundraiser.

The normally suave prime minister was speaking at a Liberal Party event in Toronto on Wednesday when the activists unfurled a banner and began chanting slogans against mercury poisoning in a river where they fish.

""Thank you very much for your donation,"" Trudeau called after the Grassy Narrows First Nation demonstrators as they were being thrown out, aware that they would have had to pay to get in.

""As we know, the Liberal Party is filled with different perspectives and different opinions and we respect them all,"" Trudeau immediately added, an apparent acknowledgement that he had overstepped.

He was shouted down by angry audience members before he could finish, however.

The reaction -- caught on a video which went viral on social media -- was in stark contrast to Trudeau's usual show of compassion and grace when confronted by protestors.

""From time to time, I'm in situations where people are expressing concerns or protesting a particular thing, and I always try to be respectful and always try to engage with them in a positive way,"" Trudeau told reporters in Halifax on Thursday.

""I didn't do that last night. Last night I lacked respect towards them and I apologize.""

The government pledged in late 2017 to help fund the construction of a mercury treatment facility for people exposed to the toxic metal over the past 50 years.

But the protestors said their community in northern Ontario is still waiting for that money 500 days later and worry that with an election drawing closer the promise will not be fulfilled.

Wilkinson starts by saying “British Columbians have seen right through Premier Horgan’s last minute “public consultation” on caribou recovery efforts. It is clear that staging a half-hearted public engagement was the only thing the NDP deemed necessary to move forward with their pre-determined plan. Forget listening to local residents with years of experience and deep knowledge of the wildlife and land base, this sham consultation is meant simply to placate every rural and northern British Columbian who lives, works, and plays in the backcountry while ignoring their voices.”

The B.C. Government shared in a press release Tuesday, March 26th, 2019 they have scheduled community engagement sessions allowing the public to provide their feedback on two draft agreements to conserve southern mountain caribou populations.

“Thankfully, nobody is buying it. For months, regional districts and provincial MLAs begged the provincial government to hold meaningful public consultations on how British Columbia would work with Ottawa to put together an effective plan to increase the dwindling caribou population. Despite promises to engage the public, the Horgan government announced that a draft plan had been reached between the province, some First Nations, and the federal government before any consultation occurred. With a draft plan already agreed to, the NDP declared a short five-week consultation period ending on April 25th only a few days before Ottawa’s deadline.

It is said that staff from the Provincial and Federal Governments as well as the Saulteau and West Moberly First Nations will share information about the draft agreements and will answer questions.

Wilkinson shares his concern of this plan will have a major impact on the forest, mining, and tourism industries, noting recreational users may also find themselves unable to access the backcountry as a result.

“We all want caribou numbers to rebound to a healthy level, but this can only be achieved if the public becomes an active part of the conversation.

John Morris/The Canadian Press

Prince Edward Island’s Green leader is contemplating making history – as the party’s first Canadian premier.

Islanders will go to the polls April 23 in a provincial election announced late Tuesday.

Recent polls have put the Greens out in front, and Leader Peter Bevan-Baker believes his party can win a province that has only ever been governed by the Liberals or Tories.

“That possibility is there. Emotionally, politically and intellectually, I feel like I’m ready for that challenge, in a way that I wasn’t perhaps a year ago,” he said.

“This could be a truly historic moment not only in Canadian politics but for the future of our grandchildren.”

Bevan-Baker, 56, grew up in Scotland and immigrated to Canada in 1985, living in Newfoundland and then Ontario before settling in Prince Edward Island in 2003. He became a Canadian citizen in 1992.

A dentist by profession, he became his party’s first member of the P.E.I. legislature in 2015, following nine unsuccessful bids provincially and nationally for the party.

Since then, the Greens captured a second seat on the Island, and have been successful in getting members elected in other provinces, including three during last year’s New Brunswick election.

Bevan-Baker – who celebrated Tuesday’s election call by playing “First Call” on his trumpet at a nomination meeting – said he believes the time for the Green party has arrived.

“That sort of global movement away from conventional politics and unimaginative politicians, you see that expressed everywhere,” he said, citing recent elections in U.S. and Ontario as expressions of disgruntlement with conventional politics.

“I think what’s happening on P.E.I. is a local expression of that global phenomenon,” he said.

A Corporate Research Associates opinion poll released this month suggests the Greens had a healthy lead, followed by the Progressive Conservatives, who picked a new leader, Dennis King, in February.

The Liberals were in third place, the poll suggests.

Bevan-Baker said that both delights and surprises him. He said he has to accept the possibility of forming government.

“We’ve crafted a platform, that for perhaps the first time ever in Canada, a Green platform that might have to be implemented. You come at it with a different lens. You can’t be just aspirational and vague and uncosted. You have to have a detailed and costed platform, which we have,” he said.

But Liberal Premier Wade MacLauchlan has issued a caution about the Green party, saying the province’s future is too important to risk on uncertain expensive social experiments.

Bevan-Baker said he’s not sure what MacLauchlan is referring to, but believes it could be his suggestion that P.E.I. would be a good place for a pilot program for a universal basic income. He said that would be expensive at first, but pay off in the long run.

For his part, MacLauchlan used the first full day of the campaign to promise at least 3,500 new jobs over the next four years.

He said that’s in addition to the 5,000 full-time jobs added over the last four years.

“As I have said numerous times since I became premier, the creation of jobs and job choices for Islanders has to be the number one priority of government.”

“Our record in this field is strong. However, our present success is no reason to take the foot off the gas. Support for workers, for employers and for the next generations of workers needs to continue.”

The announcement includes a $4.5 million P.E.I. Worker Benefit to assist 12,600 low-income Islanders.

The Liberals would also spend $750 million on infrastructure programs to improve roads, bridges and schools, with a focus on job creation.

MacLauchlan said money would also be spent on a number of training programs, including new vocational facilities at Island high schools, and the small business tax rate would be reduced to 2.5 per cent by 2020.

Repeated calls requesting an interview with Progressive Conservative Leader Dennis King were not returned Wednesday.

Bevan-Baker said his party’s platform will be released in its entirety – likely next week.

While the parties have begun to pitch their issues, Don Desserud, a political scientist at the University of Prince Edward Island, said he believes the election will come down to personalities.

“It’s going to be an election based on the personalities of the leaders and people are going to vote according to whether they like or dislike the leaders of the parties,” Desserud said.

“The Progressive Conservatives are rising in the polls. The Liberals are falling in the polls and the Greens are staying quite steady high in the polls. I think it all has to do with the leaders and how well they’re liked,” he said.

The Island economy has been strong and the Conference Board of Canada recently said P.E.I. would lead the country in economic growth for the year ahead.

Desserud said voters blame the government when the economy is bad, but unfortunately for the Liberals, they don’t often credit the government when the economy is good.

“The Green party has been prudent in the way in which they have presented themselves and their policies and have appealed to the small ‘c’ conservatism of the Island. That’s worked really well for them, but I think right now they’re benefiting from the fact they are the alternative,” Desserud said.","PEI Green Leader says he is ready to form government, make party history",The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-pei-green-leader-says-he-is-ready-to-form-government-make-party/

Meanwhile, the battle to win the federal Conservative party’s nod in the Cambridge riding has yet to play out, with three candidates vying for the nod, including Waterloo Region District School Board trustee Cindy Watson, former TV reporter and meteorologist Tyler Calver and small business owner Sunny Attwal. Former Cambridge mayor Doug Craig originally threw his hat in the ring in the nomination race, but bowed out, throwing his support behind Calver.

The nomination vote is set for April 8 at the Armenian Community Centre of Cambridge.

The Conservative Party of Canada has, however, named its candidate in the Kitchener South-Hespeler riding. Alan Keeso, who earned master degrees in biodiversity and business at Oxford University, decided to venture into politics upon his return from the United Kingdom and worked on Kitchener South-Hespeler Conservative MPP Amy Fee’s campaign.

Keeso plans to focus on fiscal responsibility and economic strength.

“Primarily there is a big concern on fiscal responsibility, tax dollars going toward servicing the debt, versus services people need, so there is a real call for return to fiscal responsibility (for) future generations, as well and what that debt is going to do them,"" he said in a recent interview.

Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners Suddenly, New Attention for List of Harper-Era Abuses Traffic surges for Tyee’s 2015 compilation of 70 Tory law and ethics breaches.

That piece is “Harper: Serial Abuser of Power, The Evidence Compiled: The Tyee’s full, updated list of 70 Harper government assaults on democracy and the law.”

You can find it here.

The article lists dozens of serious abuses of power racked up by former prime minister Stephen Harper and his Conservatives from the time they formed government in 2006 until the date the article was published, Aug. 10, 2015.

The list was not concerned with Tory laws, policies or positions disagreeable to people whose politics don’t lean right.

Instead, The Tyee defined abuses of power to be the opposite of good government, acts ranging from “scams to smears, monkey-wrenching opponents to intimidating public servants… some offences are criminal, others just offend human decency.”

The article drew on suggestions from Tyee readers as well as journalists. Each carefully researched item in the list is linked to credible journalistic sources, including newspapers such as the National Post and the Globe and Mail whose editorial boards had backed the Conservatives in the previous election, and would do so in the fall of 2015.

The article quickly became one of The Tyee’s most read ever, and was one of the most widely read pieces by any news organization covering the federal election. After the contest was won by the Justin Trudeau-led Liberals, traffic for the article faded and it resided in The Tyee’s digital archives.

With another election coming, Trudeau and his party deny improper pressure was applied to former minister of justice and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould in hopes of stopping a criminal trial of Montreal-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board president Jane Pilpott, who say the political interference was real, have resigned from cabinet. Trudeau’s top advisor Gerald Butts and Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick have quit their posts, as well.

After Wilson-Raybould gave testimony to the House justice committee on Feb. 27, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh called for an independent investigation into the affair.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer was more aggressive, demanding that Trudeau step down.

Trudeau had “lost the moral authority to govern,” he charged, and was a “prime minister who allows his partisan, political motivations to overrule his duty to uphold the rule of law. A prime minister who doesn’t know where the Liberal Party ends and where the government of Canada begins.”

Perhaps not coincidentally, that’s when The Tyee’s rap sheet on the last Conservative government began gaining a lot of new readers.

In the past month, the piece has received more than 14,000 page views, a near 2,000-per-cent jump over this time last year. Its numbers topped almost all other Tyee stories this month.

Who is suddenly reading and sharing the article and why?

It’s not hard to imagine why members of both the federal Liberals and NDP would find it apt to promote. The Liberals could point to the bad record of the Conservatives as evidence they were just as scandal-plagued when in power, or more so. The NDP might offer the piece to people souring on the Liberals as proof their party offers a cleaner alternative to the Tories.

Scheer was a Conservative MP throughout the Harper government, rising high in its ranks before becoming House speaker. He was first elected as a Saskatchewan MP in 2004, after accusing his opponent of being soft on child pornography because, in Commons debate, he’d warned against censoring art such as Nabokov’s novel Lolita.

A recent tweet by Tyee web director Bryan Carney noted the article has been popular of late.

This four-year-old Harper power abuses story almost kept up with SNC-Lavalin stories in traffic last weekhttps://t.co/y7z2rcmTjF — Bryan Carney (@bpcarney) March 4, 2019

The story has never flatlined, but Carney points out that the day after Wilson-Raybould’s testimony, traffic began to ramp up. First, the hits came from Google.

Keywords like “did Stephen Harper break campaign rules”, “Harper + ethics violations”, “Harper government members with criminal convictions”, “Harper government scandals” and “what lies did Harper tell the Canadian people” started to show up from Google traffic.

Next, the traffic started to arrive from social media.

The LNG industry would pay the same income tax and BC Hydro rates as any other industry, the government said.

article continues below

But enabling legislation introduced today, March 25, on the government’s new LNG tax regime appears to give large projects like LNG Canada a subsidy in the form of a special tax break.

The legislation grants large projects that have project development agreements with the province – like LNG Canada – a special 3% tax credit on the cost of natural gas. This will bring the company’s corporate income tax rate down from 12% to 9%.

It appears smaller projects like Woodfibre LNG won’t be eligible for the tax break, since it only applies to projects that have signed agreements with the province.

Even before the legislation was tabled, Green Party Leader Andrew Weaver slammed the tax incentives being offered the industry as a “general sellout.”

He said the Green Party will not vote in favour of the legislation, which means the NDP government will need at least a few Liberal MLAs to vote in favour of it.

“I think it’s pretty clear the Greens will not vote in support of this legislation,” B.C. Finance Minister Carole James said in a press conference.

“But this is an important investment for British Columbia, and I think certainly the comments that I’ve heard from the BC Liberals show that they’re in support of LNG. You’ll have to ask (Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson) about that, but I expect that this legislation will go forward.”

Asked to defend what amounts to a subsidy, James said other industries also get special tax breaks.

""Whenever government takes a look at industry for British Columbia – whether we're talking about the film industry, whether we're talking about other industries – you take a look at how you can remain competitive to ensure that you continue to see continue to see investments in your province. That's exactly what we did with the LNG industry. We sat down with LNG Canada, we looked at how we could ensure our competitiveness as a province, which meant incentives...when it comes to the LNG tax credits.""

Business groups welcomed the new legislation for taxing the LNG industry.

“Today's announcement acknowledges the competitive realities facing many B.C. export industries,“ Greg D’Avignon, CEO of the Business Council of British Columbia, said in a press release.

The changes being made to the Liberal LNG tax regime not only eliminates a special LNG tax, it also offers the industry the same industrial rate for power that other industries pay, and it provides a $596 million deferral on PST on the project's capital costs.

The deferral applies to the capital spent on the LNG plant in Kitimat, export dock, storage facilities and work camps.

The company will only start paying PST back after the LNG plant in Kitimat is operating, or within seven years, whichever comes first, with payments starting out small and getting larger towards the end of the 20-year payback period. Other manufacturing facilities in B.C. get PST exemptions on capital investments, with no obligations to pay it back, government officials said in a technical briefing.

Despite the incentives being offered, the government estimates it will generate $23 billion in taxes and royalties over a 20-year period.

Under the NDP government's new CleanBC plan, LNG plants that are able to demonstrate that they meet or beat low emissions benchmarks, will also get a break on carbon taxes. They will still pay $30 per tonne. But as the carbon tax rises, they will be eligible for the incremental amount they pay to come back, if they demonstrate their plants meet or beat certain emissions intensity benchmarks.

Work is already underway in Kitimat and along the Coastal GasLink natural gas pipeline. According to the provincial government, as of December, 600 people were employed on the LNG Canada project in Kitimat.",LNG Canada to get a 3% corporate income tax cut,Alaska Highway News,https://www.alaskahighwaynews.ca/business/lng-canada-to-get-a-3-corporate-income-tax-cut-1.23770242

Former Supreme Court of Canada judge Frank Iacobucci, who is now senior ...","The SNC-Lavalin scandal has proven to be an insatiable beast with tentacles reaching deep into the political and legal worlds — perhaps even as far as the Supreme Court of Canada.

Politically, the allegations of interference with the justice system have deeply damaged the “sunny ways” Liberal brand and catapulted the Conservative Party ahead of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in pre-election opinion polls. And, as most scandals do, the SNC affair has led to a series of high-profile resignations. Former minister of justice and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould may have been the first out the door, but her departure was quickly followed by the principal secretary to the prime minister, Gerald Butts, the president of the Treasury Board, Jane Philpott, and, most recently, the clerk of the Privy Council, Michael Wernick.

The government, in its scramble to defuse the political crises, launched a half-hearted study into the allegations before the Liberal-controlled justice committee appointed Anne McLellan to advise the PMO on the role of justice minister and attorney general in cabinet.

But none of this, rightly so given that the rule of law is at stake, has quieted the continuing questions about Trudeau’s integrity and his leadership.

And now there seems to be a rising grumbling that the legal profession should consider what activities former judges can be permitted to engage in after retirement.

After all, the short history of the SNC scandal does reveal a who’s who of the legal profession.

Former Supreme Court of Canada judge Frank Iacobucci, who is now senior counsel at the law firm Torys, was actively involved in SNC-Lavalin’s defence — even signing his name to a letter to the Public Prosecution Service advocating for a deferred persecution agreement.

Wilson-Raybould hired former Supreme Court justice Thomas Cromwell to provide her with legal advice about the scope and application of solicitor-client privilege.

Even the PMO got into the former judge game by floating the idea of retaining former Supreme Court Chief justice Beverley McLachlin to provide a legal opinion on deferred prosecution agreements.

The re-examination of permissible post-judicial activities may all just be a convenient distraction for those who wish to turn the channel away from the actions of the prime minister and his office. But there may be some merit considering what activities judges should be permitted to engage in during their golden years.

Should judges go gently into the good night of retirement? Or should they rage, rage against the dying of the light?

Should former judges have been involved in the SNC case at all?

Well, there are rules about what activities a retired judge can undertake after returning to practice.

In Ontario, a lawyer who was formerly a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada, the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the Federal Court of Appeal or the Superior Court of Justice is barred from advocating in any court or before any administrative board or tribunal absent special permission that can only be granted in exceptional circumstances. Former judges of the Ontario Court of Justice are unable to appear before a court for a period of three years from the date of their retirement.

The Federation of Law Societies has also released a discussion paper on post-judicial returns to legal practice.

But none of the rules — proposed or on the books — would have applied in the SNC case. And that may actually be a good thing.

Prohibiting retired judges from practising law carries hidden costs. Restrictions may limit the pool of qualified lawyers who would want to apply for judicial appointment — many potential applicants won’t want to view the bench as the end of their career. Limiting post-retirement work may indeed encourage judges to serve until mandatory retirement, which risks ossifying our courts and discouraging younger applicants. And limitations on post-retirement work ignores the fact that judges, even after retirement, can make valuable contributions to society through continued legal work. Rules that limit judicial practice could have the effect of discouraging the insight and expertise retired judges can bring to pro bono work and public policy development.

Some have suggested that former judges should not be involved in any litigation that may end up before the Supreme Court or cases that may become political. But it is impossible to determine to which cases that limit would apply until it actually happens.

It seems that the solution to the perceived problem of post-judicial activities may create more problems than it solves.

Sure, there is always a risk that the public may perceive that the involvement of a retired judge in a particular case renders the legal system unfair. This is a valid concern and perhaps there needs to be public education about the current rules of professional conduct. But, in reality, judges are very comfortable disagreeing with each other and being disagreed with. Indeed, the PPSC did not seem to be swayed by anything Iacobucci said on the SNC case — the fact he was a former Supreme Court justice did not seem to move the needle at all.

Former Supreme Court of Canada judge Frank Iacobucci, who is now senior ...","The SNC-Lavalin scandal has proven to be an insatiable beast with tentacles reaching deep into the political and legal worlds — perhaps even as far as the Supreme Court of Canada.

Politically, the allegations of interference with the justice system have deeply damaged the “sunny ways” Liberal brand and catapulted the Conservative Party ahead of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in pre-election opinion polls. And, as most scandals do, the SNC affair has led to a series of high-profile resignations. Former minister of justice and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould may have been the first out the door, but her departure was quickly followed by the principal secretary to the prime minister, Gerald Butts, the president of the Treasury Board, Jane Philpott, and, most recently, the clerk of the Privy Council, Michael Wernick.

The government, in its scramble to defuse the political crises, launched a half-hearted study into the allegations before the Liberal-controlled justice committee appointed Anne McLellan to advise the PMO on the role of justice minister and attorney general in cabinet.

But none of this, rightly so given that the rule of law is at stake, has quieted the continuing questions about Trudeau’s integrity and his leadership.

And now there seems to be a rising grumbling that the legal profession should consider what activities former judges can be permitted to engage in after retirement.

After all, the short history of the SNC scandal does reveal a who’s who of the legal profession.

Former Supreme Court of Canada judge Frank Iacobucci, who is now senior counsel at the law firm Torys, was actively involved in SNC-Lavalin’s defence — even signing his name to a letter to the Public Prosecution Service advocating for a deferred persecution agreement.

Wilson-Raybould hired former Supreme Court justice Thomas Cromwell to provide her with legal advice about the scope and application of solicitor-client privilege.

Even the PMO got into the former judge game by floating the idea of retaining former Supreme Court Chief justice Beverley McLachlin to provide a legal opinion on deferred prosecution agreements.

The re-examination of permissible post-judicial activities may all just be a convenient distraction for those who wish to turn the channel away from the actions of the prime minister and his office. But there may be some merit considering what activities judges should be permitted to engage in during their golden years.

Should judges go gently into the good night of retirement? Or should they rage, rage against the dying of the light?

Should former judges have been involved in the SNC case at all?

Well, there are rules about what activities a retired judge can undertake after returning to practice.

In Ontario, a lawyer who was formerly a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada, the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the Federal Court of Appeal or the Superior Court of Justice is barred from advocating in any court or before any administrative board or tribunal absent special permission that can only be granted in exceptional circumstances. Former judges of the Ontario Court of Justice are unable to appear before a court for a period of three years from the date of their retirement.

The Federation of Law Societies has also released a discussion paper on post-judicial returns to legal practice.

But none of the rules — proposed or on the books — would have applied in the SNC case. And that may actually be a good thing.

Prohibiting retired judges from practising law carries hidden costs. Restrictions may limit the pool of qualified lawyers who would want to apply for judicial appointment — many potential applicants won’t want to view the bench as the end of their career. Limiting post-retirement work may indeed encourage judges to serve until mandatory retirement, which risks ossifying our courts and discouraging younger applicants. And limitations on post-retirement work ignores the fact that judges, even after retirement, can make valuable contributions to society through continued legal work. Rules that limit judicial practice could have the effect of discouraging the insight and expertise retired judges can bring to pro bono work and public policy development.

Some have suggested that former judges should not be involved in any litigation that may end up before the Supreme Court or cases that may become political. But it is impossible to determine to which cases that limit would apply until it actually happens.

It seems that the solution to the perceived problem of post-judicial activities may create more problems than it solves.

Sure, there is always a risk that the public may perceive that the involvement of a retired judge in a particular case renders the legal system unfair. This is a valid concern and perhaps there needs to be public education about the current rules of professional conduct. But, in reality, judges are very comfortable disagreeing with each other and being disagreed with. Indeed, the PPSC did not seem to be swayed by anything Iacobucci said on the SNC case — the fact he was a former Supreme Court justice did not seem to move the needle at all.

The real problem may actually be with those in politics who seek to use retired judges as a political weapon.

Former prime minister Stephen Harper did it when he released former Supreme Court judge Ian Binnie’s opinion on the Marc Nadon case — a case that the government clearly knew was going to be controversial.

Iacobucci may have unsuccessfully advocated on SNC’s behalf, but it was the clerk of the privy council, as part of the PMO attempts to influence Wilson-Raybould’s decision, who wielded the name as a weapon, telling her that: “Iacobucci is not a shrinking violet.""

Reid polled the province in December 2013 after McNeil’s Liberal Party formed the government earlier that year.","Nova Scotia’s long-serving premier Stephen McNeil has the lowest approval rating of any premier in Canada, while Quebec’s François Legault is the most popular provincial head of government with roughly six-in-ten Quebeckers approving of him.

The figures come from a new poll released on Tuesday by the Angus Reid Institute.

The institute says Legault’s approval is likely a sign that he’s still enjoying a honeymoon period after the Coalition Avenir Quebec formed government in the wake of Quebec’s provincial election in October.

His support is statistically unchanged from Angus Reid’s poll in December, despite facing criticism over comments that there is no Islamophobia in Quebec and that his government plans to scrap a backlog of more than 40,000 immigration applicants.

Saskatchewan’s Scott Moe has essentially the same approval rating as Legault, with 59 per cent of 842 Saskatchewanians polled saying they approve of his stewardship of the province.

Angus Reid says Moe’s approval has received a seven per cent bump since he succeeded Brad Wall as premier last year.

British Columbia’s John Horgan is the only other premier whose approval remains above 50 per cent, with Horgan receiving 52 per cent of support from B.C. residents.

Horgan’s approval has increased nine per cent since December and ties his highest mark as premier, set in March 2018.

New Brunswick’s Blaine Higgs, Canada’s newest premier, sits one point below a 50 per cent approval rating.

Even with a minority government, the first in the province since the 1920s, Higgs’ approval has risen by nine points since December.

Higgs has recently introduced his first budget which was characterized as tightening the belt in the province in an effort to balance the province’s budget.

With an election on the horizon, Alberta’s Rachel Notley has experienced an increase in popularity for the fifth consecutive quarter.

Angus Reid attributes this to an increase in personal appeal despite being a long shot to retain control of the government when Alberta heads to the polls on April 16.

Manitoba’s Brian Pallister has also had his popularity rise, with it reaching the highest level since March 2017.

Angus Reid’s polling data indicates that 44 per cent of the Manitoba electorate currently approves of him.

READ MORE: Notley’s plan to door-knock interrupted by protester

McNeil at the bottom of the pack

McNeil’s approval has hit the lowest figure since Angus Reid polled the province in December 2013 after McNeil’s Liberal Party formed the government earlier that year.

Nova Scotia’s premier sits at only 24 per cent support among those polled. In 2013 he sat at 57 per cent approval.

Despite tabling his fourth straight balanced budget on Tuesday McNeil has received criticism for perceived failures to follow through on health-care improvements and allocating $22.3 million on a ferry between Yarmouth, N.S., and Bar Harbor, Maine.

Newfoundland’s Dwight Ball and Ontario’s Doug Ford round out the three premiers who have an approval rating below four-in-ten.

Ford’s approval has dropped four points this quarter to 38 per cent, following criticism of his government’s decision to increase class sizes and an overhaul to the province’s autism funding.

However, a recent ruling by Ontario’s integrity commissioner found that the premier didn’t break the rules that govern legislators when one of his close friends was hired as the province’s top cop last fall.

Author: Sean Rehaag, Associate Professor, Osgoode Hall Law School, York University, Canada

According to media reports, Bill Blair, Canada’s minister of border security, is attempting to close a loophole in the Canada-U.S. Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA).

The agreement allows Canada to send asylum-seekers back to the United States without hearing their refugee claims (and allows the U.S. the same option for those going in the other direction). The loophole is that the STCA only applies to asylum-seekers who present themselves at official land ports-of-entry.

Since President Donald Trump was elected, around 40,000 asylum seekers have used this loophole by crossing into Canada from the U.S. at places other than official ports-of-entry. They are not trying to sneak into Canada undetected. Rather, they cross the border irregularly to avoid being turned away under the STCA and then approach Canadian authorities to make refugee claims.

The number of irregular border-crossers has declined recently, with fewer than 1,000 in January 2019. What’s more, while the overall number of refugee claims made in Canada has been higher than usual in the past two years, it is not far off historical norms.

Nonetheless, the additional 40,000 refugee claims have produced pressures on the refugee determination system and on provincial social programs. There has also been political pushback, with calls from the Conservative party for the government to stem the flow.

However, closing the STCA loophole is a complicated proposition.

Blair reportedly wants irregular border-crossers to be taken to official ports-of-entry and processed as if they had presented themselves there directly. In other words, the STCA would apply both at official ports-of-entry and elsewhere.

To make this work, the U.S. would need to agree, which is the first complication.

More asylum-seekers come to Canada

The purpose of the STCA from a Canadian perspective was to force the U.S. to take responsibility for asylum-seekers who travel to Canada via the United States. Canada had long wanted the STCA because the flow of asylum-seekers is asymmetrical. Far more asylum-seekers come to Canada from the U.S. than the reverse.

For the same reason, the United States has long refused to agree to the STCA. That only changed after 9-11, when Canada offered the U.S. greater border security integration in exchange for the STCA.

Canada now wants to expand the STCA, so the question is: What will Canada have to give the U.S. to get them to agree?

One might expect quite a lot, given that Trump has shown little interest in taking steps that would result in thousands of asylum-seekers who would otherwise go to Canada remaining in the U.S.

The need for a quid pro quo raises a second complication. The STCA is being challenged in Canadian courts by human rights organizations who say that the U.S. is not safe for refugees and that the STCA violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Given the anti-refugee policies of the Trump administration, there is a good chance that courts will strike down the STCA. By negotiating expansions to the STCA without waiting to see whether the regime is upheld, there is a real risk that anything Canada gives to the U.S. in exchange will be for naught.

A third complication: Even if Canada gets the U.S. to agree to expand the STCA, and even if the regime is upheld by the courts, the impact of any expansion is likely to be both counterproductive and dangerous.

A dangerous incentive

If asylum-seekers who are intercepted at irregular border crossings are returned to the U.S., this will create a strong incentive for such asylum-seekers to cross the border without being intercepted.

Currently, irregular border crossings are manageable and organized. Most occur in a single, well-monitored location in Quebec. That crossing is not dangerous. Border officials and RCMP are present. Irregular border-crossers immediately enter into immigration and refugee processing, which includes health, criminality and security screening.

Other countries that have tried to stem flows of asylum-seekers by closing off safe and manageable routes have had a common experience. The flows do not stop but are instead diverted into more remote and hence more dangerous routes. Organized crime gets involved, bringing increased security risks and violence. The inevitable result is lost lives and decreased border security.

In the end, the political pressure on the government to be seen doing something on this file may outweigh these policy considerations. But politics lead to a fourth complication.

During the last federal election campaign, Justin Trudeau distinguished himself from former prime minister Stephen Harper partly through a more compassionate response to the Syrian refugee crisis and the death of Alan Kurdi — himself a tragic victim of cat-and-mouse games between smugglers and governments seeking to keep refugees at bay.

Shortly after Trump’s inauguration, Prime Minister Trudeau further sought the moral high ground when, in response to the president’s anti-refugee policies, he famously tweeted Canadians will welcome those fleeing persecution.

There is no way to close the STCA loophole without the Liberal party turning its back on those progressive values, on the eve of a federal election campaign.

In this context, attempting to expand the STCA may not only be bad policy, it may also be bad politics.

NDP leader Rachel Notley

Leader Rachel Notley says the New Democrats would expand $25-a-day daycare if they were to be re-elected in the April 16 Alberta vote.

WATCH: If re-elected Rachel Notley said the NDP will expand its $25-a-day daycare program to all available spaces in the province. Jayme Doll has more.

Speaking in Calgary, Notley said the plan would include adding 13,000 daycare spaces to the current 62,000 spots in the province.

“For too many Alberta moms and dads, finding safe and affordable, quality child care is a real challenge,” Notley said Monday.

WATCH: Alberta NDP Leader Rachel Notley says her party would expand $25-a-day daycare if re-elected in the April 16 provincial election.

The promise is an expansion of a pilot program begun two years ago that capped daycare costs at $25 daily at 7,300 spaces in 122 locations.

READ MORE: Alberta $25-a-day daycare expands to 100 more locations; 6,000 spaces created

Notley said a $25 cap would apply no matter what a parent has been currently paying for child care.

More daycare would get more people employed and add nearly $6 billion a year to Alberta’s GDP, said Notley, who added that Alberta has Canada’s largest gap between men and women in labour force participation.

“I cannot count the number of times I have heard from women that good, affordable childcare is a barrier to them re-entering the workforce,” she said.

“Anything that holds Alberta women back, holds Alberta back.”

Notley pointed to a subsidized daycare program in Quebec that she said increased overall employment by nearly two per cent and GDP by almost as much.

WATCH: Alberta NDP Leader Rachel Notley reacts to the education plan unveiled by the UCP on Monday.

The NDP is budgeting $1.5 billion for expanded daycare over the next five years.

UCP leader Jason Kenney

United Conservative Leader Jason Kenney was in Calgary, releasing details of his party’s education platform.

He says if his party were to head the government, schools would operate under rules for gay-straight alliance clubs developed before the NDP came to power.

WATCH: Alberta political parties shared their thoughts on school funding and operations if they were to form government after the April 16 election. Lisa MacGregor reports.

READ MORE: Alberta government establishes LGBTQ guidelines for schools

He says the UCP would resurrect the former Progressive Conservative government’s unproclaimed Education Act, which included a provision to support the clubs in schools.

The New Democrats amended the School Act to bring in further protections for LGBTQ students – including barring school officials from telling parents if their kids join one of the clubs.

Kenney says he supports gay-straight alliances for young people to get peer support if they’re being bullied and adds he wants a less contentious relationship with religious schools.

“We support those (GSAs) as an opportunity for young people who might be facing harassment or bullying to get that peer support and so we will encourage schools to comply with that legislation,” he said.

When asked how he would respond to religious schools resistant to GSAs, Kenney said his approach “would be one of co-operation rather than one of confrontation.”

WATCH: Alberta UCP Leader Jason Kenney said his government would support GSAs in schools, but also support the religious freedoms of faith-based independent schools.

READ MORE: Court challenge launched against Alberta’s GSA bill

An associate professor at Edmonton’s MacEwan University, who specializes in sexual minority issues, indicated he believes Kenney is taking a “back-door route” to undoing progress the NDP has made on LGBTQ rights.

“This is an attack on LGBTQ rights in the province,” Kris Wells said. “It’s a move to undermine gay-straight alliances and has the ability to do real harm to LGBTQ students, who remain amongst one of the most vulnerable groups of students in our schools today.”

Kenney also says his party would lift a cap on the number of charter schools in Alberta, focus on improving math and science grades and ensure consent was taught in all sex education classes.

The UCP leader said if he becomes premier, education funding would remain unchanged or increase, but his party would seek more efficiency.

He announced his education platform for the April 16 election at the private Calgary Jewish Academy.

Kenney was later scheduled to hold a round table discussion with Calgary-area mothers.

Alberta Party leader Stephen Mandel

Alberta Party leader Stephen Mandel made an arts and culture announcement in Calgary on Monday morning. In the afternoon, he spoke at an international women’s forum.

Liberal leader David Khan

Alberta Liberal leader David Khan started his day door-knocking in the Calgary Mountain-View constituency, then made a carbon tax policy announcement Monday afternoon in Calgary.

Khan said his party would create a revenue-neutral carbon tax.

“We must all fight climate change. It is one of the most important issues of our time. Alberta Liberals are making this a priority in the 2019 election,” Khan said in a statement Monday.

“We must all change our behaviour. It is not just a responsibility of heavy emitters. Every single ton of carbon we emit into the atmosphere carries a cost to society. We all bear the cost.”

The party said it does not support the NDP’s current version of the carbon tax and that a revenue-neutral carbon tax would strike a balance between protecting the environment and protecting the economy.

“We will adopt enhanced rebates for low-income Albertans. That we will also lower income taxes. The amount will be equal to the carbon tax Albertans pay. Our revenue-neutral carbon tax is efficient, equitable and protects the environment.

“Our plan is different. We will be transparent in our reporting to all Albertans. Unlike the NDP government, we will fully inform the legislature on the progress being made in reducing carbon emissions.”

The Liberals said the party would not cancel the commitments currently paid for by the carbon tax. More information on the police would be release later this week, the party said.

The committee will travel to Terrace and Prince Rupert, B.C. But the senators have twice voted down pleas to hold hearings in Alberta and Saskatchewan.

On Friday NDP Leader Rachel Notley sent a letter asking the Senate to reconsider. She urged Albertans to do the same.

“They don’t think the people of Alberta should be heard . . . I gotta tell you, this is kind of an unprecedented stampede of stupid,” Notley said.

“I’m stunned. Albertans deserve better from Canada,” she said.

UCP leader Jason Kenney said, “It’s ridiculous that the Liberal-appointed majority in the Senate won’t even consider hearings in Alberta, where the Trudeau government’s series of anti-oil and gas policies are having a damaging impact on jobs and communities across our province.”

Bill C-48 has passed the Commons and is now in the hands of this Senate transport committee, the last line of defence against final approval.

Tankers, obviously, are all about ocean transport of products transported from inland places.

But the Senate’s transport committee is not interested in hearing from provinces that need transport.

If that bunch won’t listen, who ever will?

Veteran Alberta senator Elaine McCoy told the committee there would “effectively be a ban on any kind of shipping of oil from Canada from that region.

“That means that we as a country will have told three provinces that they cannot exploit or sell their natural resources. Those provinces are British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan.”

McCoy isn’t a committee member, so she could speak but not vote. The same is true for fierce C-48 opponent Senator Doug Black, who says: “It angers me, as a senator from Alberta, that is being hurt, which I would suggest is being targeted, that my colleagues wouldn’t say ‘I can find two days to go and listen to Albertans.’”

The committee has rigged these hearings to ensure that most of the testimony comes from coastal supporters of Bill C-48.

Inside Alberta podcast

In this edition of Inside Alberta, Don Braid and Chris Varcoe discuss polls, the “kamikaze candidate” and the importance of trust in an election campaign that promises to be the most divisive in recent memory.

It’s hard to miss the echo of Bill C-69, the equally horrible legislation that focuses on environment and social concerns for project approval, to the exclusion of economic benefit.

Bill C-48 was conceived on a whim by Justin Trudeau before he was prime minister. It’s part of the Liberal plan to ensure that nothing like Northern Gateway can ever be proposed again. The Liberals are even deaf to First Nations who want to build a northern pipeline.

Clearly, the craven majority on the Senate committee is unwilling to cross Trudeau’s dewy romantic vision of that lovely coast, whatever the cost to prairie economies.

This news drops into Alberta at the start of an election campaign in which every party agrees many Albertans are already furious at Ottawa.

On Friday, a new Environics Institute survey showed that a majority of people in Alberta and Saskatchewan think we get so little out of Canada that we might as well leave.

Discontent is almost as strong in Atlantic Canada. And that part of the country, by clueless coincidence, was also excluded from the hearings on Bill C-48.

Some Atlantic senators wanted hearings there because the region has knowledge to share about safe tanker transport of oil products. That might actually have helped senators understand that tankers can co-exist with a clean, healthy environment.

No such federal ban is proposed for the Atlantic, of course, even though much of the landscape there is every bit as pristine and precious as B.C.’s north coast.

Black has done research and could find no comparable ban to C-48 anywhere in the world.

But nothing quite like Alberta’s oilsands industry exists anywhere in the world, either — so how else can a bunch of tame, unelected senators give it a hard time?

Fred Lum/The Globe and Mail

Canada has granted asylum to two of the people who housed whistleblower and U.S. fugitive Edward Snowden in Hong Kong, but is facing calls to take in the other five “Snowden refugees” whose Canadian asylum claims remain in bureaucratic limbo.

Vanessa Rodel and her seven-year-old daughter, Keana Nihinsa, arrived at Toronto Pearson International Airport Monday night after a flight from Hong Kong. The Filipino refugees will make their way to Montreal Tuesday, where they will settle into their new lives with the support of a non-profit group that privately sponsored them to come to Canada.

Robert Tibbo, a Canadian lawyer, represents the Rodels and the five other Snowden refugees. He is urging the Liberal government to provide refuge to the other five people, who are of Sri Lankan origin and who sheltered Mr. Snowden in Hong Kong.

Story continues below advertisement

In 2013, Mr. Snowden was on the run and landed in Hong Kong after leaking classified information about the U.S. National Security Agency’s programs, which collected private information on millions of people. Mr. Snowden soon fled Hong Kong but was stopped in Russia, where his passport was confiscated. He was granted asylum by the Russian government and remains there today.

“They all helped out on something extraordinary in helping Mr. Snowden, making their decisions of conscience to provide him shelter, humanity and empathy,"" Mr. Tibbo said.

“It’s a bit like their bond [as a group] is now broken … It’s been broken by Canada.""

In a tweet Monday, Mr. Snowden also called on the Canadian government to resettle all of the asylum claimants who housed him in Hong Kong.

“Thank you to everyone, in Canada and around the world, who made this possible. After so many years, the first of the families that helped me has a future. But the work is not over – with solidarity and compassion, Canada can save all of them,"" reads the tweet, which was written in French.

A spokesman for Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen declined to comment on the asylum cases for privacy reasons. Mat Genest said that, generally speaking, privately sponsored applications are normally processed on a “first-in, first-out basis,” but noted that cases may be expedited in exceptional circumstances.

Ms. Rodel fled her home country of the Philippines after allegedly being raped and sexually trafficked by the New People’s Army − the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines. She and her daughter, who was born in Hong Kong and is considered stateless, are the first Snowden refugees to be granted asylum after hiding Mr. Snowden when he fled to Hong Kong.

He hired Mr. Tibbo, a former Montrealer who was working in Hong Kong as an immigration lawyer. After a brief stay at a hotel, Mr. Snowden spent two weeks shuttling between three refugee families who were Mr. Tibbo’s clients, including the Rodels.

Ajith Pushpa Kumara, a former Sri Lankan soldier who says he was tortured after deserting the army, also took in Mr. Snowden for some time, as did Supun Thilina Kellapatha (who alleges as well that he was tortured in Sri Lanka), his wife and child. Mr. Kellapatha and his wife have had another child since hiding Mr. Snowden; both children are considered stateless.

Mr. Tibbo said he explained who Mr. Snowden was to his clients and they were eager to assist the American.

“These families, it was part of their modus operandi, that they helped other newly arrived asylum seekers,"" Mr. Tibbo said. “They saw he was distressed and they recognized him as being in a similar position to what they were when they were fleeing for their lives from their home countries.”

Since the refugees’ involvement with Mr. Snowden rose to global prominence in 2016 – including in scenes in a Oliver Stone film on the fugitive – Mr. Tibbo says they’ve faced harassment for their role in the matter. He said they’ve been questioned by welfare authorities, seen welfare benefits cut and had visits from police.

Knowing Hong Kong’s reputation as a difficult jurisdiction in which to seek refugee protection, a Canadian non-profit group called For the Refugees applied to privately sponsor all seven of the “Snowden refugees.” The Rodels’ applications were approved by the Canadian government in January, but kept secret until Monday for security reasons.

Mr. Tibbo said Ms. Rodel was shocked when he broke the news to her earlier this year.

“She said five times, ‘Are you joking?’ I said, ‘No, I’m not joking. Get ready to go. Start packing,’ "" Mr. Tibbo said.

Let Jody Wilson-Raybould have her (additional) say. Stop muzzling her with cabinet confidence and solicitor-client privilege. Waive it.

Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners Suddenly, New Attention for List of Harper-Era Abuses Traffic surges for Tyee’s 2015 compilation of 70 Tory law and ethics breaches.

“The longer he continues this cover-up,” Bergen said of Trudeau, “the longer he moves heaven and earth to keep himself protected, the worse this gets for him.”

Does it get worse? Or will Canadians tire of the saga and move on, as the Liberals this week bet by moving to shut down the inquiry?

Martyn Brown, who as premier Gordon Campbell’s chief of staff handled scandals buffeting the B.C. government during the 2000s, thinks that this week Trudeau has moved closer to the brink of disaster. The heightened prospect of an RCMP investigation makes Trudeau an anchor sinking the party he once rescued with his leadership.

Now, says Brown, it’s time for Liberal insiders to convince Trudeau to step down.

More bad days for the PM

In one twist this week, Wilson-Raybould promised to dump a pile of more documents on the Justice Committee in order to prove her allegations of undue political interference are correct, even if she isn’t allowed to testify in person.

In another turn, Celina Caesar-Chavannes, who said she’d been bullied by a shouting Trudeau, left the Liberal caucus to sit as an independent MP.

Meanwhile, SNC-Lavalin’s CEO said Trudeau’s team is wrong to imply that his company asked to be spared a criminal trial or else it would move from Montreal with 9,000 Canadian jobs sacrificed.

But the biggest bombshell, in Brown’s view, was dropped by former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott, Trudeau’s other cabinet minister to resign in dismay over LavScam.

What Philpott had to say in her interview with Maclean’s magazine on March 21 proves she’d “gone rogue,” says Brown.

“I’m not accusing anybody of anything illegal or contrary to the Criminal Code,” emphasizes Brown. But Philpott raised enough questions to possibly prod the RCMP to launch an investigation, and that would mean a severe hit to Trudeau’s political fortunes.

On the phone with The Tyee March 21, Brown laid out his reasoning:

Philpott is “now basically saying in this interview with Maclean’s that Jody Wilson-Raybould was bullied, that there is much more to the story. And so she’s flatly contradicting [Trudeau’s] version of events.”

Philpott has given “new legs” to the demand by five previous attorneys general and the Tories for an RCMP investigation. In Maclean’s she makes it clear she could not remain in “solidarity with cabinet,” because she “felt that there was evidence of an attempt to politically interfere with the justice system in its work on the criminal trial that has been described by some as the most important and serious prosecution of corporate corruption in modern Canadian history.”

She also reveals that she raised deep concerns about the DPA file on SNC-Lavalin a full month before the affair became public.

She says this, Brown notes, as we find out the PMO’s claims about harm to the public interest if SNC-Lavalin were to be criminally prosecuted are baloney.

“What we need to know is, in this period, particularly after Jan. 14 when the shuffle took place, was cabinet misled by false threats or false information of the sort we’ve now learned about? That SNC was leaving Montreal, which [we know] now is patently untrue. Or that Canada was going to lose 9,000 jobs, which the present CEO now says was patently untrue. Was cabinet misled by that? Because if so, that would be a reason for the RCMP to investigate.”

The Mounties would be particularly interested in finding out, says Brown, “if false information was used to try to pressure Jody Wilson-Raybould to get her to politically intervene for something that anyone in government knew wasn’t true. Or if the government knew that it wasn’t true that jobs would be lost, that the company would move, as it was trying to suggest to her was the reason in the public interest, then the public interest argument goes out the window.

“That’s the only legal argument the government currently has. Even though by law they’re precluded in the Criminal Code from considering the national economic interest, they’re trying to couch it in this phrase, ‘the public interest,’ to say that because it was in the public interest, that’s why they could talk to her.

“But if the public interest argument is based on a lie, and they knew that, then all that you’re left with is a political motive, an electoral motive that would be self-serving. And that to me would raise questions of obstruction of justice, breach of trust, all sorts of things that the RCMP would suddenly be concerned with.

“I think that’s what’s really changed, the stakes have been elevated by both what the present CEO has said and what Philpott has said.”

Veteran of scandal management

Brown was chief of staff for premier Campbell on Dec. 28, 2003, the day RCMP officers arrived at the B.C. legislature and carted away boxes of evidence for what would become a years-long scandal involving the botched billion-dollar sell-off of the province’s public rail system.

Neither Campbell nor Brown was charged with any wrongdoing. But eight years later, Brown was the first witness called for the resulting trial, which ended with guilty pleas to fraud by two ministerial aides.

If Trudeau gets a knock on his door by the Mounties any time soon, he might want to give Brown a call for a bit of advice.

Then again, the PM likely won’t like what he hears. Brown, who writes a column for the Georgia Straight, declares in his latest that the Liberals’ best chance of winning the fall election is to “lance the boil” that is Trudeau.

As he told The Tyee in an email today, “The fear of losing Trudeau needs to be flipped on its head if left-leaning progressives want to minimize the chances of a Scheer victory this fall. The Liberals can now only hope to regain the moral high ground that is so vital for securing the values they purport to represent by replacing their leader. They can own the ethical hill they are now choosing to die upon by defending the indefensible by selecting a new leader who the heroines Wilson-Raybould and Philpott and Celina Caesar-Chavannes can all rally behind.”

Brown figures, “I am perhaps one of the first to suggest that Trudeau should be dumped by his caucus in their party’s political interest.”

As such, he joins a club that includes The Tyee’s Crawford Kilian who wrote a column published here March 5 headlined: “Trudeau’s Resignation Is the Party’s Only Hope.”

Alberta Liberal Leader David Khan announced a plan he says will ...","RED DEER, Alta. — The leader of Alberta's United Conservative Party notes that many people in the province support secession from Canada, based on what he calls ""a real tension that runs through the hearts of many Albertans.""

The party states in a news release that a recent poll found ""a shocking 50 per cent of Albertans surveyed said they support secession from Canada.""

Kenney says in the release that most Albertans are proud Canadians, but they will no longer tolerate the rest the country benefiting from the province's resources while trying to hold back its economy.

Watch: Kenney says his campaign is focused on jobs

His comments come in the wake of the British Columbia government's effort to pass legislation that would impact the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline, which runs from Edmonton to Metro Vancouver.

They also reflect his view of the federal government's Bill C-69, which would change how projects such as oil and gas pipelines are reviewed.

Kenney says that in the midst of economic crisis, Alberta is ""under assault from other governments in Canada.""

""We are by far the biggest contributor to the federation. We have always played by the rules, paid our taxes, and produced wealth for other Canadians,"" Kenney said in a statement on Saturday.

""And it's why we need to stand up and fight for a fair deal, a new deal, for Alberta in the Canadian federation.""

Kenney repeated during a campaign stop in Red Deer on Saturday an earlier pledge to hold a referendum on federal equalization payments if his party wins the provincial election on April 16.

Dave Chidley/CP Alberta Premier Rachel Notley makes an announcement in Calgary on March 19, 2019.

Kenney last week said a UCP government would hold a referendum on equalization on Oct. 18, 2021 — the same date as the next municipal elections in Alberta — if what he dubs the ""no more pipelines'' law hasn't been mothballed, and if there is still no progress on pipelines.

Kenney further says if he becomes premier, he would also call for Ottawa to cut federal income tax for Albertans equal to the amount of the Canada Health Transfer and Canada Social Transfer.

He says that would allow Alberta to raise its tax rates to give Albertans more control over their own money.

NDP Leader Rachel Notley, who spoke at a campaign rally in Edmonton on Sunday, noted she compelled the federal government to buy the stalled Trans Mountain project to keep it alive.

""Pipeline, pipeline, pipeline. That is two more times saying the word pipeline than Mr. Kenney did in the House of Commons in the 10 years that he was representing Alberta in Ottawa,"" Notley told the rally, referring to the UCP leader's time as a federal cabinet minister under former prime minister Stephen Harper.

""We led the largest pipeline campaign across Canada and we have made the need to build pipelines a majority opinion across this country, including in British Columbia.""

Pipeline, pipeline, pipeline. That is two more times saying the word pipeline than Mr. Kenney did in the House of Commons in the 10 years that he was representing Alberta in Ottawa. Rachel Notley

On Sunday, Kenney further pledged a UCP government would seek to form federal and provincial agreement on resource corridors to create pre-approved, guaranteed land corridors for Canadian products.

He also said the UCP would demand an exemption for Albertans to the stress tests recently imposed by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, and would create an Alberta parole board.

Notley, meanwhile, repeated accusations Sunday that Kenney's proposed rollback of corporate tax increases was a giveaway to profitable corporations. She also summarized the UCP's first week of the campaign, where a candidate resigned over online comments she reportedly made about white nationalists, and her replacement was accused of calling for wives to obey their husbands.

""In all fairness, in responding to this, Mr. Kenney did say, listen, he wasn't aiming for perfection with his candidates. Well, Mr. Kenney, mission accomplished,"" Notley said to cheers from the crowd.

She promised an announcement Monday on child care.

Also Sunday, Alberta Party leader Stephen Mandel promised to introduce a single provincial identification card that would replace the current drivers' licences, health cards, provincial ID and the card necessary for buying hunting and fishing licences.

81,,2019-03-26T19:48:00.0000000Z,But since then inflation has been tamed and growth has been steady: Canada has had only one recession ... mostly on the care and feeding of Liberal client groups. Remember infrastructure?,"The 2019 federal budget, like all recent federal budgets, is a tribute to the pleasures of endless economic growth.

In the days when inflation was high, interest rates were volatile and growth was very stop and go, budgeting was hard work. Reining in runaway deficits absorbed most of the energies of finance ministers for the better part of three decades.

But since then inflation has been tamed and growth has been steady: Canada has had only one recession in the last quarter-century, and a mild one at that. Budgeting in such times is comparative child’s play — governments, at the federal level at least, have to positively go out of their way to run deficits.

Indeed, so steady has the revenue-gusher been — no government has ever had as much money to play with, measured in inflation-adjusted dollars per citizen — that the Liberals have been obliged to perform quite heroic feats of spending just to keep pace. Though real per capita spending is at all-time record levels, the deficit remains stubbornly below one per cent of GDP — hardly a deficit at all, really. My God, in the fiscal year just ending, the deficit actually fell: revenues came in faster (6.8 per cent) than even the Liberals could spend them (4.9 per cent).

I’ve said before that these are deficits of choice, rather than necessity. A better way to describe them might be deficits for show. Not even the Liberals still pretend deficits of this size would have any impact on growth, nor have they: real growth per capita in the bad old Harper years, from fiscal 2007 to 2016, averaged 0.9 per cent — versus 0.7 per cent, actual and projected, in the shining new era ushered in by the Liberals (2017-2024).

Indeed, they’re not even supposed to. Their impact is, first, symbolic — behold, we run deficits because we like to, whereas the previous government did so only grudgingly! — and second, to permit the government to spend more, mostly on the care and feeding of Liberal client groups.

Remember infrastructure? That was supposed to differentiate the new Liberal deficit spending from the old Liberal deficit spending. It wasn’t about pork-barrel politics, or short-run economic fixes. It was about making strategic investments that would increase productivity for the long run. Only it hasn’t quite worked out that way, has it?

The budget boasts that federal infrastructure spending has increased from $8 billion in fiscal 2016 to $14 billion in the current fiscal year. That’s an increase of $6 billion, which sounds like a lot, until you realize total program spending has increased by $47-billion in the same period. At one point the Liberals used to claim one dollar in three of new spending would go to infrastructure. The actual result: more like one in eight.

It is time, then, for the conversation to move on: from how spending is financed to what it is spent on, from the size of government to its composition, from the macro to the micro. Deficits of this size are not going to ruin us, as the opposition claims; neither would eliminating them, as the finance minister pretends.

The quantity of spending isn’t so much the issue as the quality. It isn’t that we can’t afford it: it’s that, in the rush to get all that spending out the door, little thought appears to have been given to whether the money is being spent in the best way, or whether it should be spent at all.

The most telling table in the budget is the last: the one that tallies up the estimated savings from the several “comprehensive reviews” of spending the government claims to have undertaken. The total annual saving: $237 million. Out of a budget of $323.5 billion.

Perhaps one day something a little more stringent will be attempted. And perhaps this budget’s signature initiatives on training and housing, which give every impression of having been cooked up in the Prime Minister’s Office, if not in party election planning sessions, will be the subject.

The training chapter notes, with evident satisfaction, that the government now spends close to $7.5 billion a year on skill development “across more than 100 distinct programs.” Given the country’s acute and growing skills shortages, some questions might be asked about their efficacy. Some, but not too many: a review of skills programming provided “an opportunity to reflect on past successes and determine where more can be done.”

Such a forgiving attitude to the past does not bode well for the future. Has any serious analysis been done of the new Canada Training Benefit — how it will interact with provincial programs, what sort of training will be eligible, and so on?

Likewise for the government’s suite of new policies to make housing more affordable. The budget acknowledges the only real solution to high house prices in the long run is to increase the supply of houses. But the specific measures it announces would mostly stimulate the demand — notably a First-Time Home Buyer Incentive that would involve the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, worryingly, in lending directly to prospective buyers. The details are sketchier than sketchy, but any benefit would more than likely be capitalized into prices. Would anyone really be made better off?

But why ask hard questions, when growth is endless and budgets need never be balanced? Except … even if the business cycle has been abolished, and growth does persist, it will be much slower growth than we have known, now that the Baby Boomers are hitting their retirement years. That may not be of much concern to the feds, who largely insulated themselves, in the deficit-slashing years, from the fiscal consequences. But it’s a huge problem for the provinces, who will have to pay to look after all those aging Boomers.

What would the budget do to stimulate growth in the long run — to improve Canada’s sluggish productivity record, to arrest the alarming decline in business investment, to reform Canada’s complex, growth-killing corporate and personal income tax system?

Er, nothing, as it happens. For as it has been said, in the long run we are all out of office.","Andrew Coyne: Federal budget a testament to the pleasures of endless growth.

Asian countries are the target customers for LNG from B.C. (Tom Fletcher/Black Press)

The B.C. government has presented its promised tax breaks for LNG Canada’s liquefied natural gas development at Kitimat, over the objections of three B.C. Green Party MLAs.

The legislation was supported by B.C. Liberal MLAs when it was introduced Monday by Finance Minister Carole James, and opposed by the three B.C. Green MLAs. That means its passage is assured, with 83 of 87 MLAs in favour of it.

The changes were agreed to by the government and the Shell-led consortium investing an estimated $40 billion in the LNG terminal and Pacific GasLink pipeline from Dawson Creek to Kitimat.

They include repealing an LNG income tax imposed during former premier Christy Clark’s push for LNG development at a nearby site at Prince Rupert. The amendments also provide a provincial sales tax exemption that the government estimates will save LNG Canada $596 million during construction. That amounts to an interest-free loan, as the agreement requires the company to begin paying the accumulated PST bill once the LNG starts shipping to customers in Asia.

The NDP government is also giving LNG Canada the province’s standard industrial rate for electricity, replacing a higher rate that was part of the previous government’s deal. James said the LNG Canada project is currently rated as the cleanest LNG project in the world, despite the consortium’s decision to power its refrigeration and compression equipment by burning natural gas.

Weaver said an LNG plant in Louisiana is already moving to all-electric LNG production for export, meaning LNG Canada will not be the cleanest by the time it begins shipping in 2024.

James said as of December, there were 600 people working on the LNG Canada project, and more work on the pipeline route. Discussions continue with protesters who have built a camp on the route near Smithers.

By CCN.com: Alphabet Inc.’s Google is banning political advertising in Canada just in time to apply to the 2019 Federal elections.

The prohibition came in the wake of the Elections Modernization Act, passed by the Canadian Senate this December, which requires online advertising platforms to monitor and report all political and partisan ads. The penalties for not adhering to the said Bill C-76 could slap offenders with fines and possibly, imprisonment.

Ruby Sahota, the liberal politician in Canada, said the Election Modernization Act would limit third-party influence on the outcome of the upcoming Federal elections.

“No foreign actors would be allowed to participate financially in our elections and also for all those who are advertising on platforms such as Facebook or any other platforms, all would be made transparent,” Sahota said while adddressing the senate.

Better Safe than Sorry

Nevertheless, achieving the kind of transparency the Canadian liberals seek could become a challenging task for online advertising companies. Colin McKay, Google Canada’s head of public policy and government relations, told TGAM that it was difficult for them to detect partisan ads, arguing that they may not feature the name of a political candidate or party.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Fred Chartrand

OTTAWA – The Conservatives are asking the federal judicial affairs commissioner to investigate the leak of confidential information about former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould’s controversial choice for chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada.

Conservative justice critic Lisa Raitt has sent a letter to Marc Giroux arguing that the leak “strongly suggests” that “political actors” leaked information about an appointment to the country’s highest court.

If so, Raitt says, it would be “an egregious case of political interference … that severely injures the independence of the judiciary.”

Raitt’s letter comes two days after The Canadian Press and CTV reported that Wilson-Raybould and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau clashed over whom to appoint to the top court upon the retirement of Beverley McLachlin as chief justice in 2017.

Sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss details of the normally confidential process, said Wilson-Raybould urged Trudeau to name Glenn Joyal, chief justice of Manitoba’s Court of Queen’s Bench, to fill both McLachlin’s spot on the bench as a justice from western Canada but also the chief justice role.

They said Trudeau was disturbed to discover that Joyal took a restrictive view of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and had criticized the top court for liberally interpreting it to include “new rights” not explicitly mentioned in the charter; the court’s broad interpretation has led to things like legalization of same-sex marriage and the striking down of Canada’s abortion law and prohibition on medically assisted dying.

Trudeau ultimately appointed Alberta judge Sheilah Martin to fill the western slot on the Supreme Court and elevated sitting Justice Robert Wagner to the role of chief justice.

Wilson-Raybould said Monday there was “no conflict” with Trudeau on the matter but otherwise declined to comment, saying the selection process for Supreme Court justices is confidential and any disclosure “could compromise the integrity of the appointments process and potentially sitting justices.”

However, on Wednesday, citing an anonymous source, the Globe and Mail reported that Wilson-Raybould recommended Joyal as part of a broader plan to appoint an Indigenous judge to the role of chief justice of Manitoba’s Court of Queen’s Bench – which would have been a first for a superior court in Canada. The newspaper also said Wilson-Raybould believed Joyal held a more liberal view on the charter of rights than Wagner, although the report cited evidence to the contrary.

The Canadian Bar Association and the Manitoba Bar Association have also criticized the disclosure of information about the appointment process.

The leaks suggest Trudeau may have had reasons unrelated to the SNC-Lavalin affair to move Wilson-Raybould out of the prestigious justice portfolio in a mid-January cabinet shuffle. She was moved to Veterans Affairs but resigned from cabinet a month later amid allegations that she had been improperly pressured last fall by the Prime Minister’s Office to intervene to stop a criminal prosecution of the Montreal engineering giant.

Wilson-Raybould has since said she believes the move was punishment for her refusal to instruct the director of public prosecutions to negotiate a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin. Such an agreement would have forced the company to pay stiff restitution but saved it from the risk of a criminal conviction, which could threaten the viability of the company.

Raitt said Wednesday that the leaks about the Supreme Court appointment process are more proof of Trudeau’s disrespect for the rule of law.

“The SNC-Lavalin affair has raised serious questions about the rule of law in Canada and the degree to which the Prime Minister’s Office has interfered in it,” she said.

“This most recent episode of potential political interference from the PMO only further damages our democratic institutions and values and requires immediate attention.”

How can we believe anything he says?

First, we learned that the budget doesn’t balance itself. Trudeau ran on the plank of modest deficits in the first few years leading to a balanced budget in 2019. What we learned last week was that, in fact, we are looking at an eye-popping $19 billion this year with no plan to balance our budget at all.

Does Trudeau really still think that magically the budget will balance itself?

We should pray that we don’t hit a recession or interest rates continue to increase. Not only do we not have a cushion to land on, we have a giant pothole to fall into.

Second, remember the plan to change the election system from first past the post?

On June 17, 2015, Trudeau not only announced it as a pillar of his campaign but said he would introduce electoral reform within 18 months of taking over government.

It looked like an urgent thing to him. Why the haste?

“(Prime Minister Stephen) Harper has turned Ottawa into a partisan swamp promoting partisan interests at the expense of public trust” he said.

After two months of LavScam and the resignation of four of some of the most powerful people in government, that quote fits Trudeau as perfectly as one of his bespoke suits. The worst part of the saga was former top bureaucrat Michael Wernick, who quit last week. His disgraceful appearances at the justice committee made him a full-time member of the Liberal party swamp.

Turns out electoral reform was a Trudeau ruse to get rid of Harper. Less than one year into his new mandate, Trudeau pulled the plug on it. Why?

“Under Mr. Harper, there were so many people who were unhappy with the government and his approach that people said, ‘We need electoral reform in order to stop having governments we don’t like,’” Trudeau told Quebec’s Le Devoir.

“However, under the current system, they now have a government with which they are more satisfied and the thirst to change the electoral system is less striking.”

Trudeau was never serious about electoral reform. It was yet again a cynical vote-buying scheme. Now that he won under the traditional system, why risk toying with the current system?

Third, turns out our “sunny ways” feminist was a fake. Gender party is a good thing — that is, if you respect women and women’s voices in cabinet. We were treated to ElbowGate a year after the election: Trudeau, showing his true colours, rushed across the aisle of the House of Commons to manhandle the Conservative whip while accidentally elbowing NDP MP Ruth Ellen Brosseau.

It was a strange combination of lack of respect for women and an illustration that Trudeau may be in need of anger management.

Then the Kokanee Grope made headlines, an incident from 2000 in which Trudeau was accused by a journalist, then 18, of “groping” and “inappropriate handling” at the Kokanee Summit, a music festival.

More recent, two powerful ministers, then-attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould and then-Treasury Board minister Jane Philpott, quit cabinet, having lost confidence in Trudeau over his handling of LavScam.

But the most blistering defection was from the Liberal caucus. Whitby MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes announced she will sit as an Independent. Apparently, her crime was to tell Trudeau about her plan not to seek re-election and he went ballistic on her.

“He was yelling. He was yelling that I didn’t appreciate him, that he’d given me so much,” Caesar-Chavannes said. There were two similar interactions. More indication that our PM may needs a little anger management, perhaps?

But cheer up. Some strains of pot apparently have anti-depressant qualities.

Trudeau has at least provided us a way to be cheerful about the depressing state of his government.

But I guess my job is to poke the powers and do it in a depiction way in a drawing and it's a wonderful job that I have for sure.

WELLS: And you've been in The Spec 22 years this September is my guess. That means you're a young buck compared to me. You started at The Spec four months after I did?

MACKAY: Yes. But I bet you, they probably gave you a computer. Right?

WELLS: They did! You are right about that.

MACKAY: I didn't get a computer for like, three or four years after. And I think it took like half a year to get a phone. That was 1997.

WELLS: Those were the perks back then. So we'll talk a little bit about the road travelled for you and then how you do what you do in this age of Trump and Trudeau. I was thinking I feel the limitations of audio here where your work is so visual.

MACKAY: Sure.

WELLS: But Ayesha Nasir, the producer of The Message, will post some of your work on our site and a link to your website which I was going through. There's a ton of material on there for readers. Archives and —

MACKAY: I'm very proud of my website.

WELLS: It's a great website. I wish I had something that showed some of my past work you know, so yeah, that's terrific. But to start, today's cartoon — by the way you create five editorial cartoons per week at The Spec, is that right?

MACKAY: Right.

WELLS: And your work is nationally syndicated so it appears online and in newspapers throughout Canada and sometimes in the US. The cartoon today, just to take a random one because it's in the paper today, it features Doug Ford.

Editorial cartoon for Wednesday, March 6, 2019. | Graeme MacKay, The Hamilton Spectator

We have Ford. In the background of the cartoon, there's a big carnival happening. Fireworks in the sky and a carnival tent is labelled SNC-LAV-SCAM. Big party happening in the background and in the foreground we have Doug Ford looking very much like a mob boss standing over someone bearing something in the dirt led by car headlights — which symbolize what?

MACKAY: Well there's, obviously, some interference happening on both the provincial and federal level. It's an edgy cartoon and I could have gotten into trouble with that. I had to like go to my editor Howard Elliot, just to make sure that we wouldn't get sued because it's —

WELLS: It's pretty suggestive.

MACKAY: Yeah, it's very suggestive. You're saying what, the premier is killing people off? I guess in a metaphorical way, he did. Or his deputy, one of his deputies, actually fired the deputy commissioner of the OPP.

WELLS: Just this week, right?

MACKAY: Yeah. But, you know, it's just interesting because we've been obsessed by the SNC-Lavalin story for weeks now. And there's other things that are happening. We as cartoonists just have to be careful not to get too obsessed with the media and keep our eye on other, you know, nasty things that might be happening and I think what's happening in Ontario right now is ... it's fodder for cartoons for sure.

WELLS: I've heard and seen some criticism of the coverage of LAV-SCAM, that the media is all in and everyone is now trying to outdo the other, that is, not to say it's not a huge story, which it is. But it's a good opportunity, for you to kind of shine the light somewhere else like you're doing here.

MACKAY: Well, you gotta wonder like, are people really focused in on the LAV-SCAM thing and are they more focused on what's happening with Ford? I mean, I don't know. Until polls come out, we don't know. Maybe for the vast majority of people outside the bubbles that really follow these political things nobody really cares. But I guess time will tell.

WELLS: Would you anticipate when you draw Doug Ford in this sort of manner, do you ever sort of expect to get a an email or call from someone who's a fan and not a fan of yours? Perhaps who is angry about the depiction.

MACKAY: I expect with my job that I'm not gonna have 100% happiness. I think with a good cartoon you're going to get as many people oppose as people who like it. So yeah, on various social media platforms, I get an earful from people who are totally upset with my cartoon. We get the odd letters to the Editor, a lot of them I don't even see. They just cross Howard's desk and he protects me from seeing some of these angry emails and letters and whatnot. But yeah, I think if you're not getting feedback, you're not doing your job properly as a cartoonist.

WELLS: Do you have thick skin as far as that goes? I mean, your job is to stir the pot. I think if I got a letter taking a shot at my story — I'm probably more thin skinned — I might feel defensive at first. I guess it depends on the nature of —

MACKAY: I think I get more defensive when people obviously don't understand and they show they don't understand satire. They're not seeing the bigger picture that sometimes you need to use Certain metaphors and situations that cast affliction on certain people in order to skewer the person who's the power. I think in some countries like in France and Britain, they get that. But here, it's almost like it's a continuous kind of thing where you got ""Well, no, this is how it works here."" And, ""This is what satire is all about."" But I can understand that even satire has to adapt to the changing norms and everything that happens with society.

WELLS: And satire is not polite.

MACKAY: It's not polite and it's not fair sometimes, either.

WELLS: That's right. One of your favourite cartoonists and friends in the fraternity of cartoonists, I suppose, is Michael deAdder. He apologized recently. He did one of the LAV-SCAM cartoons where he depicted Jody Wilson-Raybould tied up with her mouth taped, in a boxing ring, with Trudeau poised to take her on in the ring. So her hands are tied down her back, her mouth is covered up.

MACKAY: I did actually the almost exact same cartoon too.

WELLS: Did you?

MACKAY: Yeah and we were lumped into this whole sort of thing with hate and misogyny and that sort of thing. I posted my cartoon online and deAdder saw it and then he messaged me and said I'm in the middle of tweeting that same cartoon but just giving you the heads-up that this is going in my paper tomorrow. And he's on the Atlantic Coast so he didn't have much of a timeline.

WELLS: Right, he's in Halifax.

MACKAY: Seven o'clock in the evening. So we go ahead and then everything hits the fan the next day it was posted.

WELLS: I saw on Twitter, I mean I just saw a bit of it, but he apologized and then he sort of apologized for the apology. But people started giving a hard time for apologizing.

MACKAY: I think the big difference there is that he's a freelancer so he doesn't answer to an editor. My editor is Howard Elliot and he cleared it. He looked at it and he didn't raise any worry it about or anything. There's been subsequent apologies since then and they all come from freelancers who don't have those filters that thank goodness I have here at The Spectator because I've never apologized for a cartoon.

WELLS: You haven't? I was going to ask you about that.

MACKAY: Not here. I have come close but no I haven't.

Editorial Cartoon for Friday, February 15, 2019 | Graeme MacKay, The Hamilton Spectator -

WELLS: With that one, people are missing the whole boxing analogy. Trudeau was famous at least for people following his career for boxing publicly.

MACKAY: Well, the Liberal Party and his supporters have made a big deal. He punched out Patrick Brazeau and it was, you know, ""Look what he did here!"" and all of you can look at that like well yeah, he was an Indigenous guy too that he punched out. But, you know, it was taken as a positive thing and it was an important thing because it was before he became prime minister. And a lot of people will say hell, he's just a weakling who only cares about his hair and his looks and selfies and that sort of thing. So let's go and prove that he's a capable guy. And I've used that in other cartoons. His punching acumen when dealing with Donald Trump and that sort of thing.

WELLS: Right, right. The first time I covered him ever in Hamilton was when he came here. And he did a big thing at the gym downtown where he put on a big workout. He was quite happy to to sweat for the cameras.

MACKAY: I'm kind of amazed that we as cartoonists haven't really capitalized on this whole thing because you could you can see the good in that. But you can also see the ugly side of being a boxer as well, and I think both Mike and I did that job as was expected in a satirist.

WELLS: How often would you say an editor like Howard or Paul Berton editor in chief comes to you with an idea that they would like to see done, or an issue say that they like to see done by you in the paper? And how often is it just you percentagewise?

MACKAY: They never come to me. I can tell you they never instruct me or say ""Oh, you gotta like lay off."" Although in the early days they would tell me to lay off way back when I started out. I came on and it was a different approach that I had towards my job. I was scathing towards the mayor who was Bob Morrow and I did some nasty cartoons about him and my boss who actually happened to be Howard. Howard has been my boss for a long time and I remember he told me so you gotta back off on the mayor because he's starting to like badger us. I think that says something. There's something about ... it's easier to go after a politician who's in Ottawa or London or Washington but when it comes to City Hall here these are people that you got to deal with.

WELLS: We have reporters.

MACKAY: And reporters have to deal with them as well. If you keep it up they're going to stop answering the phones when a reporter calls.

WELLS: Right. So then each day, the cartoon ... that is you picking the topic and give your spin on it.

MACKAY: Yeah as I say it's like you or Andrew or Jeff Mahoney. I'm given the liberty of a columnist. However it hasn't always been that way. I mean we've had different editors as you know and they have different definitions on what my role is. I can fight against it but they're the ones paying me.

WELLS: Let's roll back a little bit to your road here. So you grew up in Dundas and attended junior art classes at the Dundas Valley School of Art. I was reading from a piece that the spec ran when you were first hired that's on your website. You were a news geek as a kid and used to doodle in class and draw your teachers and classmates and in grade four through the whole class and ran off photocopies for all of them on demand.

MACKAY: Yeah!

WELLS: Does it make you popular or not popular?

MACKAY: Oh sure, sure. I still had bullies going after me and stuff like that. But if you're a pretty good cartoonist or an artist, you often are like a hit, if you can use that art against the authority of a teacher.

WELLS: What cartoons or comics did you enjoy reading most when you were growing up?

MACKAY: You know, I didn't read a heck of a lot of comic books. I was definitely into MAD Magazine and Cracked. I loved MAD Magazine. And I think that's probably because it was parody. It was like an early form. I didn't know who the president United States was when I'm nine or 10 years old but I knew about being bombarded by all these products on TV. Actually I was thinking also of Wacky Packs. Remember Wacky Packs? They're these candy things and you get gum and then inside would be all these stickers that were parodies of products. Instead of Captain Crunch it was a sticker showing a box with Captain Crud. I think that was the germ of my fascination with just making fun of, you know, on a pop culture thing that extended to politics which came very soon after that I guess.

WELLS: In MAD magazine, as a kid, I would enjoy the parodies of movies. In very highly detail, they would go through the plot of the movie and just ridicule notions of it.

MACKAY: Don Martin and Al Jaffee and Sergio ... wonderful, wonderful cartoonists.

WELLS: In the introduction to your book, which was published in 2017, which is titled ""You might be from Hamilton if ..."", The Spectator's Scott Radley wrote the introduction to the book. He mentioned MAD Magazine and he also said that a lot of kids growing up probably wanted to be a cartoonist and I was going to tell you that I can attest to that. Back in grade five or six I gave my speech, when we all had to give speeches back in the day, you to stand in front of class give a speech. I gave mine on how my career aspiration was to be a cartoonist and I was a huge Peanuts fan. Charles M. Shulz, the whole thing. I had sketch books but I couldn't draw and so set me back a little bit. When did you know that you wanted to draw, and for a living, and be a newspaper editorial cartoonist specifically?

MACKAY: Well I've always drawn. I guess I'm the nerd who instead of going out and playing football or hockey or whatever I stayed in and drew. But I guess, like I said, it was parody I was fascinated with. I was a television junkie too let's be honest. With MAD Magazine, I was also into SCTV and Saturday Night Live — a lot of these great comedy shows that would make fun of the politics of the day. So you know you had Saturday Night Live making fun of the president of the day, which they do so fine even to this day. And so, you know, that made me wonder: what are they talking about here? So, I guess I came of age to find the fascination of politics when Ronald Reagan was president. That was the time when Pierre Trudeau was the prime minister and I know I would always hear the family discussions at the dinner table. On Sunday night, my grandparents would come over and they would freak out over the latest thing that Pierre Trudeau was doing to the country. And so that started an interest in reading the newspapers and by that time I was delivering the Hamilton Spectator and I could open the paper and I'd see the wonderful works of Blaine, the cartoonist here for so long. And so that naturally went to well, what are they drawing in the Toronto Star? What are they drawing in the Globe? And so I just became aware of a lot of the cartoonists at that time period in the early 80s and it's a lifetime fascination starting from there.

WELLS: It's interesting. SCTV was, I loved that it was just so clever energy in not just politics with shows like that on SCTV but the powerful, the famous to be skewered and made fun of whether it was Bob Hope or whoever. I'd love to see that on Netflix. They got to bring SCTV on Netflix.

MACKAY: That would be wonderful, wouldn't it?

WELLS: Political cartoons have been around a long time, if you're Googling anyways. It suggests that the first one ever might have been in 1754 by Ben Franklin. And just to give the audience the visual: it's a snake that's been cut into several sections to show disunity among the new colonies that were not yet the United States. And the caption is, join or die. And we were just talking before the show briefly, but how you actually did a cartoon years ago, that was a take on Franklin's cartoon.

MACKAY: Yeah, it was to apply to the amalgamation of Hamilton. So you know, they were amalgamating all the colonies back at that time, and the threats were out there. Well, that was sort of the same thing that was happening back in around 1999 and 2000, when the province, was compelling us to amalgamate. I did that cartoon and I showed it to the editor and he didn't know what I was talking about so much I guess. Typical journalist doesn't know the history of satire.

WELLS: Back to the drawing board.

MACKAY: Exactly.

WELLS: I think that one and your work and the best editorial cartoons show how carefully chosen words of a little bit of information convey so much. Just randomly going through your website ... maybe because this one appeared on my birthday ... but the one that is lamenting the end of summer. It says ""RIP summer"" and it has you know these ...

MACKAY: They're Grim Reapers.

WELLS: Grim Reapers carrying this pumpkin man who's heralding the pumpkin spice is back. I just think it's awesome. Pumpkin spice of course is a great flair but it does signal that something is coming to an end.

MACKAY: I'm just around so many people that say Oh, have you had this beer? It's pumpkin spice. It's like no I don't want pumpkin spice. All the coffee shops were bringing their coffee so that's a perfect cultural thing that gets away from the politics. Like I said, I know that there are people who are who are shutting out the politics and they're sick of it and everything and so it's important for us to do some of the cultural references and sort of jab at it, which means we have to put up with every year like pumpkin spice and whatever.

WELLS: I love that stuff. Of course at Christmas time all the different flavours. I'm just like what is that? You know all the different flavours. I don't even know what they are.

MACKAY: The other thing on coffee that drives me crazy is the Roll Up The Rim thing. It's like a sport for me every year to come up with another, you know, let's mock the Roll Up The Rim campaign because it's just ... I walk to work and I see the results of Roll Up The Rim. All these dirty cups all over the place.

WELLS: I've never done it.

MACKAY: Have you not?

WELLS: I prefer my lattes and stuff from elsewhere. Whatever that makes me I don't know. But you know, you gotta hand it to them. They certainly tapped into something.

MACKAY: I do. But it's, you know, take some responsibility because these cups are all over the place. And I know there's been an outcry and it's been getting louder every year. You know, this is the disposable ... like this is the crap that you're adding to the landscape through this. It's just horrible.

WELLS: Is one of your challenges determining how much information to provide in a cartoon? Some of your work, some of your cartoons, have layers and layers of background information, little bits and minutiae within the cartoon. And others have a very simple — what appears to be simple — message although, as I say, with the one about pumpkin spice, simple yet there's a lot to it. That's kind of under the surface. Is that something you think about consciously, or you just kind of go with it?

MACKAY: It depends on how I feel. I guess it's kind of nice to be able to put those little Easter eggs in and just give a little extra fun for the viewer. I mean, I'm a big fan of the intricate cartoons. I know there's a wonderful thing about simplicity of cartoons, but I think from time to time was nice to do these elaborate things.

WELLS: Where people can kind of dig into it and get what they can out of it. Of course, then some people aren't getting half of what you're trying to convey sometimes.

MACKAY: Also if the gag is kind of weak then it's you know, I spice it up. I pumpkin spice it up with more details.

WELLS: I said you were an award-winning cartoonist and you're a two-time recipient of a United Nation citation. The Ranan Lurie Political Cartoon.

MACKAY: Ranan Lurie. He's a famous cartoonist from — I don't know where he's from — Egypt, I think. And he's obviously very rich. He throws his money around and rewards people.

WELLS: Which is fabulous. And then last year you were nominated for a City of Hamilton Arts Award.

MACKAY: Yeah, I was nominated. I didn't win.

WELLS: So what you do is absolutely art. And it's punditry and commentary. Do you see yourself more as an artist or commentator?

MACKAY: I would love to do more art. And a lot of us cartoonists do. I would like to do more art, I'd like to do oil paintings. I look at our colleague here, Lee Munn who does some outstanding artwork. Landscapes and things like that. Boy, that would be a dream of mine to go back to the basics of what I learned at the DVSA and take a sketch book out there and draw stuff. Because that's what I did. I used to do that. I used to go out to museums and draw vases and statue heads and things like that. It's a wonderful, therapeutic thing to do.

WELLS: Just to quickly go back to the politics. I meant to ask you earlier: I'm sure there are followers of your work, or people who dip in on your work on occasion, who think they can pinpoint ... There are people who think they can pinpoint The Spectator's political leanings. Even if we had one, which I don't think that the paper does. I don't think it has a particular leaning but I'm sure there's some who think they can label you along the spectrum. And they'd probably be wrong no matter what they say.

MACKAY: Yeah. Good luck. Cause I don't even know where I am. That's right. One thing that drives me crazy is partisanship. It drives me nuts because I will put something on Twitter and I can easily predict who's going to be weighing and then saying such and such. But you know, there's your example right there. You've got a Doug Ford cartoon there and I'm making fun of a guy. He happens to be a Progressive Conservative. But the day before, I'm making fun of Justin Trudeau, he happens to be a federal Liberal. And then I'm making fun of Trump and I'm making fun of all kinds of political parties. Again, it isn't about partisanship to be a cartoonist. Put that all away. It's all about jabbing the powers. It just so happens, we are in a really good situation now. We had a Conservative in Queen's Park in a Liberal in Ottawa.

WELLS: It's kind of an ideal situation for you.

MACKAY: Yeah, it is. But I think in the past, I might have come here with a bit of a partisan leaning towards the centre right. But I can't ... I'm not there at all. I think over time and being around smart people like we have The Spectator, you know, you've learned something. And I certainly have being here.

WELLS: I've talked about how this is such a rich time for cartoonists, in Canada with Justin Trudeau's reign and the dawn of the age of Trump. Looking back to other periods in your career to this point, is this the most interesting time or have they all been interesting?

MACKAY: We were having some great scandal times right now. But in 22 years you can think back, I mean, there's the gas plant scandal, the Gomery scandal, money in bags that Mulroney was passing to Karlheinz Schreiber. Look at the scandal happening in Washington right now. So I think what happens is you get a series of scandals adding up and that's what lends itself to the eventual defeat of a government. I don't know if this SNC-Lavalin thing is going to topple the government. I doubt it will. I think in a life of government there's a series. I mean we had a Liberal government in Ontario that was very plagued with scandals and it lasted for how many terms. And now we got a new government that's starting up its own scandals so scandals are just part of life, right?

WELLS: It's the fuel for the fire for a cartoonist. Graeme, I'm fascinated by the work you do. As I've already pointed out I envious because you're doing what I wanted to do when I was a kid. It's great what you bring to the Spectator adding colour and perspective and wit to our pages and you're one of the best in the business. And that's in Canada and the US. So I want to say thanks for coming on the show.

MACKAY: Well, thanks. It's a pleasure. Thanks, Jon and Ayesha.

WELLS: Thanks to the audience. And again, you can see Graeme MacKay's archives and other information on the link that we'll put on our podcast webpage. And my thanks to Ayesha Nasir, as always, and we'll talk to you later on The Message.

John Crawford

LNG Canada says proposed changes to the province's tax structure for liquefied natural gas, announced this week by the BC Government, are a very important step forward in the development of the industry in this province.

Although the company's investors had already given the project final approval, an LNG Canada spokesperson says the announcement shows the NDP is prepared to deliver on its commitments.



Finance Minister Carole James announced on Monday the government's new Income Tax Amendment Act, which she said will ensure the LNG export industry has an even playing field with other resource sectors in the province, and can be globally competitive.

""We're creating jobs, we're creating environmental protection and we're bringing in a fair share of resources to British Columbia,"" she said.

LNG Canada External Affairs Director Susannah Pierce agreed, saying the changes help ensure BC can find a new market for its natural gas resources, and realize the opportunities the LNG sector creates for the province's workers, communities and First Nations.

""It is removing the LNG Income Tax Act, which is something that was unique only to the LNG industry in the province, and so really it's the final chapter of the BC Government's commitment to ensure that there is a sustainable and competitive industry in the province,"" she said.





[PHOTO: Susannah Pierce, LNG Canada -- at October 2018 FID announcement]

Environmental groups aren't happy with the new bill -- nor is the BC Green Party, with leader Andrew Weaver complaining that the NDP basically sold out to the industry.

""They've basically given LNG Canada whatever they want, frankly I'm surprised they haven't given them promises of their second and third children as well!"" he said.

But while the Green Party will vote against the bill, it's likely to pass with the backing of the BC Liberals.

""Our desire is to be supportive, but we still have a job to do, in terms of ensuring that the government fully discloses the benefits and the costs associated with the agreement,"" said Liberal MLA Mike De Jong.

In the meantime, work is proceeding on the project at Kitimat -- and Pierce says local businesses are already seeing the benefits.

""We've begun additional site-clearing and that's to make sure the site is ready for materials when they come on-site to start more of the construction element of this; we've done preliminary dredging, to enable some of the ships to safely enter the area, and also to ensure Rio Tinto has an extension to its wharf, so that when they go off of the former Eurocan wharf, they can go onto a new extension of their wharf closer to shore,"" she explained.

More than 600 workers have already been busy on site, and Pierce says that number is steadily increasing, with a focus on hiring local as much as possible.",LNG Canada Applauds BC Tax Changes,CFTK TV,http://www.cftktv.com/News/LNG-Canada-Applauds-BC-Tax-Changes

The fear now is whether the situation escalates.

With spring seeding fast-approaching, the fear about what the dispute with China could mean for farmers’ bottom lines grows by the day.

The trade war with China is yet another fire Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s embattled Liberals must fight at a time when the party has spent much of 2019 on the defensive.

Internationally, Canada-China diplomatic relations are severely strained. China remains livid about the fact Canadian authorities detained Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer for Chinese telecom giant Huawei, in December following an extradition requested from the United States.

Chinese officials have since detained two Canadians, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessperson Michael Spavor, who the Chinese have accused of espionage.

The diplomatic dispute has also cost Canada its ambassador to China, who was fired by the prime minister after he suggested to reporters Wanzhou had a strong legal case.

Closer to home, the Trudeau government has spent more than a month combatting allegations the Prime Minister’s Office inappropriately pressured the former attorney general in relation to a file involving SNC Lavalin.

It’s a political crisis that has seen two cabinet ministers, a senior adviser to the prime minister and the clerk of the privy council (this country’s top bureaucrat) resign.

The possibility of a drawn-out dispute with China over canola exports is unlikely to do the Liberals any favours in Western Canada, where the economy is already a hot-button issue thanks to troubles in the energy sector.

In Alberta alone, it’s estimated 3,000 jobs are directly tied to canola, with 70 percent of the province’s exports to China canola-related.

Then, there are the political concerns.

Those who follow Canadian politics know that the East-West political divide in this country is as much reality as the urban-rural spread. With a federal election just around the corner, fears over western alienation are re-emerging.

From the start, the Trudeau government only had a handful of western voices in its caucus outside of British Columbia.

Both Liberal MPs from Calgary now sit as independents. Edmonton MP Amarjeet Sohi, who serves as Trudeau’s natural resources minister, has his hands full with the economic and market access struggles of Canada’s oil and gas sector.

Meanwhile, fellow Edmontonian Randy Boissonault sits on the House of Commons justice committee that until recently was handling the SNC Lavalin affair.

International Trade Minister Jim Carr is a key figure for the Liberals who has been tasked with finding a solution to the canola dispute. The importance of the file is not lost on him. The Richardson’s family has deep ties to Winnipeg, where Carr is from.

Carr has said there is no scientific basis for China’s concerns about pests in Canadian canola.

Carr is scheduled to testify in front of the House international trade committee on the canola-China dispute on April 2 alongside Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau.",Farmers caught in the middle of trade dispute with China,The Western Producer,https://www.producer.com/2019/03/farmers-caught-in-the-middle-of-trade-dispute-with-china/
92,Canada,2019-03-26T22:40:00.0000000Z,An all-party committee of the legislature delivered ... Trevena stated the commercial licences mean additional safety. But Liberal members on the committee say they’re not convinced.,"An all-party committee of the legislature delivered recommendations Tuesday on how best to handle ride-hailing in B.C. and is recommending the government allow drivers with Class 5 licences to get behind the wheel.

The committee was asked to deal with specific issues after the government changed laws in 2018 to pave the way for app-based ride-hailing services. Other key recommendations delivered to the legislature include eliminating boundaries for where passengers can be picked up, no limits on fleet size and establishing minimum pricing.

The transportation minister said she’s willing to be flexible on those issues, but not on who gets behind the wheel.

“I will not move on Class 4 licences,” Claire Trevena told reporters in Victoria. “I think people's safety is paramount and Class 4 adds to that safety.”

Asked several times for evidence that shows safety is increased, Trevena stated the commercial licences mean additional safety.

But Liberal members on the committee say they’re not convinced.

“Parents send their children in cars with other parents on field trips and they don't worry that that driver doesn't have a Class 4 license,” said Stephanie Cadieux, who insisted Class 4 licences would be prohibitive for Uber.

The report referred to Alberta and Nova Scotia having Class 4 licences.

They tend to be more intensive to get and cost more. Critics say that will lead to fewer drivers.

In a statement, Uber said Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario allow the more common Class 5 licences. The company wants B.C. to consider the same.

Uber Canada’s Michael van Hemmen wasn’t ready to say what a Class 4 requirement would mean for the company.

“Uber has to see the full regulations before we can comment about whether we can apply or launch,” he told CTV.

Regulations and insurance options are being developed. After that, companies will be able to apply to get ride-hailing vehicles on the road.

The opposition claimed with so much work left to do, a 2019 timeline is unrealistic, and suggested the spring of 2020 is more likely.

Asked about the timeline, Premier John Horgan said, “forgive me if I ignore their fear mongering today,"" adding that “I'm absolutely confident ride hailing will be here in 2019.”",B.C. premier 'confident' ride-hailing will be in place by end of 2019,BC CTV News,https://bc.ctvnews.ca/b-c-premier-confident-ride-hailing-will-be-in-place-by-end-of-2019-1.4353184

The “Pardon Truck,” run by the Cannabis Amnesty campaign and licensed cannabis producer DOJA, parked outside the Vancouver Public Library where its small crew of petitioners geared up to collect 10,000 signatures to take to Ottawa.

They spoke with passersby near their ornately decorated “jam van” about their call for policy-makers to pass legislation that goes beyond pardons, and instead expunges simple possession convictions from criminal records.

Before legalization on Oct. 17 last year, people convicted of simple possession could face up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. In 2016, 17,733 people were charged with cannabis possession, down 3,600 from 2015, according to Statistics Canada.

On March 1, Minister of Public Safety Ralph Goodale tabled Bill C-93 to provide no-cost, expedited pardons for simple possession (up to 30 grams) of cannabis. The bill scraps a $631 application fee and five-year waiting period for a pardon after conviction.

But NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and NDP MP Murray Rankin have repeatedly called for expungement instead of pardons for convictions on possession crimes that longer exist in law. Rankin’s Bill C-415 to establish a procedure for expungement, tabled last October, found the support of People’s Party of Canada Leader Maxime Bernier.

The “Pardon Truck” people also believes Goodale’s bill doesn’t go far enough.

“We actually want an expungement, which is completely destroying the record,” said David Duarte, with DOJA. “This will never be brought up again and we can kind of help those people move forward with their lives.”

Duarte said the truck, which did a similar tour last fall, will also stop in Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg and Toronto. Organizers are also soliciting signatures at pardon.life and cannabisamnesty.ca.

Sarah Leamon, a Vancouver criminal defence lawyer, said that a pardon still considers a person culpable for committing an offence, but acknowledges that they have been reintegrated into society and “no longer need to have the label of criminal.” Police officers and border officials can still see the conviction on their record but employers or landlords will not find it during background checks, Leamon said.

“What an expungement says is you were convicted of this criminal act but you never should have been,” Leamon said. “You are not morally culpable for it, this never should have been a crime, we were wrong to have prosecuted it and it was an unjust conviction, essentially.”

Leamon said expungements are rare and most often used in historical prosecutions against LGBTQ people.

She has heard arguments that people fighting past simple possession charges knew they were breaking the law before legalization. Those convictions still carry a moral culpability, in some people’s minds, Leamon said.

On the other hand, some people have been saddled with criminal records for trying to access cannabis for medical purposes, she said.

“I do applaud the Liberal government for recognizing this as something that’s very important, this issue of pardons and amnesty,” she said.

“But I think that there are some arguments to be made that it doesn’t go far enough. I would personally like to see more cannabis-related convictions being eligible for this expedited pardon system, and I would also like them to consider expungements in some cases.”

Outside the library, many people stopped to ask about the truck and petition.

David Stewart, who works for an education company, said he supported the push for expungement.

“I work a job where I send people to go teach English overseas and I’ve had to turn great people away because they have just a minor criminal possession of marijuana (charge),” he said. “It’s long overdue.”

Stewart believes cannabis is relatively harmless, when compared to alcohol, and people shouldn’t be punished for using it.

“We all know that it’s a disproportionate amount of people that are affected that are people of colour, from our First Nations community, so I think to have expungement is just kind of righting the wrongs of the past with cannabis rules,” he said.

Thomas Jordan, who works in hospitality, said a pardon still leaves a person with a “monkey on their back” for life.

“If there’s still a record of what people have done in the past, people can still look it up — like our friends across the border — and cause inconvenience and nonsense,” he said.

“I think they need to just get rid of any record of any contact with the product, because it shouldn’t have been illegal to start with.”

Earlier this month, we started seeing criticism on Twitter about the lack of diverse voices and perspectives on the SNC-Lavalin affair.

To what extent do media project the image of a White Canada? Do white people interrogate how the mirror they see themselves in is totally distorted? (Looking for replies of between 80-110%) — Nora Loreto (@NoLore) March 5, 2019

The experiences of cishet white women = not an appropriate litmus test in this situation. The movement to get more women into politics needs to recognize how starkly different white women’s experiences of political life are from those of Indigenous, Black & other WOC/POC. https://t.co/j3VhmEuM21 — Rosella Chibambo (@Chibambo) March 9, 2019

Some came from Indigenous women who lamented the lack of column space for their perspectives on an issue that affected Canada’s first Indigenous attorney general.

Written by actual indigenous journalists who are getting paid for their work. That too would be a nice change instead of asking random indigenous (or worse, non-indigenous) people to contribute 'opinions' off the cuff to a staff reporter. https://t.co/X5eg3tD7hg — JE Barnard (@J_E_Barnard) March 7, 2019

Others came from former political staffers, including Lauren Dobson-Hughes, who took particular issue with how media outlets continue to commission op-eds from former political advisors at the expense of new voices:

For example, (and no disrespect to him, who I enjoy reading), do we need 14 columns in 14 days across 3 outlets from an ex-PM’s DComms on the same topic? Meanwhile, none of these outlets have picked up talent like @vmochama and it’s so damn glaring — Lauren Dobson-Hughes (@ldobsonhughes) March 5, 2019

She even went as far as to identify some women of colour whose perspectives she was interested in hearing — and how by not offering paid opportunities for diverse perspectives, media outlets in this country were effectively showing why they are in continual decline. When we mentioned that two ideas we had pitched had been passed on, Dobson-Hughes elevated our voice and signalled that in turning down active solicitations, media was, indeed, reinforcing a tired ideological bubble.

Also, if you commissioned one of the 14 ex-DComms columns on SNC* and turned down @badandbitchy, please accept your role in the reason your industry needs a bailouthttps://t.co/dpLwbS7e6q *I like AM and his writing this isn’t about that — Lauren Dobson-Hughes (@ldobsonhughes) March 5, 2019

And yet we pitched three different ideas to seven different outlets and had only one picked up, by a publication with which we enjoyed a strong existing relationship.

Our approach to discussing the scandal has been through one we know well: being racialized women at work and the power dynamics that exist for us there. Many women don’t necessarily recognize these dynamics, and by giving us a platform, we’re able to raise awareness of the patriarchal systems that structure our day-to-day lives. But more than that, in linking the SNC-Lavalin affair to the workplace, we can show how these issues are systemic and that by allowing an echo chamber of Canadian pundits to say how wonderful Gerry Butts is, we are ignoring the things that not only got him to his privileged position in the first place, but also allow him to be taken as credible despite limited evidence to support his claims.

What has largely been missing from the national discourse regarding the SNC-Lavalin scandal is a discussion of power: power relationships, access to power, and how that power is wielded. We could’ve had a great many discussions about Reconciliation, political party loyalty and how it engages gender and racial power dynamics, and allyship. That sadly hasn’t happened; not because those perspectives aren’t out there, but because the Canadian media complex is a small, incestuous one that prioritizes opinions from those upholding the status quo. We’ve been treated to a parade of op-eds and punditry arguing over the validity of Deferred Prosecution Agreements, the ethics and morality of the current government, and jobs, jobs, jobs — to say nothing of an endless debate over what constitutes “pressure.” Other perspectives have by and large been absent. What makes this all the more concerning is the suggestion in Wilson-Raybould’s testimony that the Liberal government has been all keyed up, whatever the issue of the day, to line up opinion pieces supporting their policy agenda.

Consider how different our public policy outcomes would be if lobbyists, government-relations professionals, and former political staffers did not dominate the newspaper columns or the evening punditry panels.

The perspectives the Canadian mainstream media chooses to project are those from a particular elite class: the political, cultural, media, and business establishments predominantly hailing from Toronto, Ottawa, and/or Montreal. These media outlets seek their consensus while the demographics of society change and technological progress marches on.

The one pitch of ours that did get picked up was published on International Women’s Day and remains among the few pieces that views the SNC-Lavalin situation from the perspective of not only Jody Wilson-Raybould, but also women writ large.

Meanwhile, a recent weekend edition of The Globe and Mail had a two-page spread of columns on the subject, three of which were written by men named David.

With this approach by legacy media, the cost is ultimately borne by society. As we peel back the layers of this scandal’s implications, we uncover truths about ourselves as a country. Yet most analysis of Canadian political culture remains frozen in the past, when society was perceived as more homogenous, where Indigenous peoples were afterthoughts (if thought of at all), when Joe stood in a movie theatre with a screen behind him projecting Canadian cultural cues that no longer apply for a beer that no one drinks anymore. This is the Canada the media still chooses to use as a baseline for reporting — a false image of the Canadian citizen upon which most commentary is built. But context is continually changing, and for a growing number of Canadians, this isn’t a Canada we know; our Canada looks like something else entirely, and it is against this backdrop that political and social analysis must take place.

Canada’s media, in centring the perspectives of a white, mostly male elite, is saying that not only are newsrooms not for people who are from marginalized backgrounds, but neither is the news. How many people can truly identify with Paul Wells’s waxing poetic about the symphony? Why couldn’t political issues be viewed through the lens of pop culture and Cardi B? In continuing to align politics with cultural notes that are typically considered “high-brow,” we are saying that news and politics are just that. And that’s nothing to say of the misguided belief that pop culture is “low-brow” and therefore incapable of being a reflection of our current affairs. The news should be accessible to all. But Canada has only so many Denise Balkissoons to go around.

The future of the media is a media that looks as diverse as the population it’s trying to serve. This whole SNC-Lavalin scandal provided a great opportunity for the Canadian media establishment to show its value — namely why we should fund it directly at the source — and to re-establish itself as a beacon of thoughtful and prescient analysis. Instead, what we got was either the same old hackery, or tepid analysis from those who have seen us through every other scandal this century. Independent media may be an antidote, but is a patchwork quilt of coverage and requires the investment of both time and money. And investing in these perspectives is vital to our collective understanding of ourselves and each other.

Mackenzie said people will be looking for a party “committed 101 per cent to make things happen.”,"Northern Indigenous leaders are welcoming the federal budget decision to erase debt incurred from land claims and treaty negotiations with the Canadian government.

They say that instead of repaying the federal government, that money can now be reinvested in programs, wellness, governance and youth.

Chiefs from the Dehcho, Inuvialuit, Gwich’in, Sahtu, Tlicho and South Slave regions were in Detah on Tuesday to meet with Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations Carolyn Bennett.

The Liberal government earmarked $1.4-billion over seven years for loan forgiveness across Canada in the 2019 federal budget.

Yellowknives Dene First Nation Chief Ernest Betsina said the decision is welcomed.

“This forgiveness grant will be provided to our future generations … and provide more opportunities that can support First Nations,” he said.

Betsina said past federal cutbacks under previous governments affected core funding, negotiations, language planning and housing.

Loan system to negotiate land claims not ‘successful’

In 2018, the federal government adopted a grant system to capture the “actual costs of self-government,” Bennett said.

The 2019 budget also sets aside $40 million over five years for First Nations to research and develop claims.

“Getting to self-government shouldn’t be based on loans anymore. People spending 20 years and then $30-million in debt to not quite get there, has just not been successful,” she said.

Negotiation on a loan basis was a hard-sell for communities, she said.

“If people don’t feel that things are fair then it’s pretty hard for them to get their communities behind them to do the work,” Bennett said.

‘Long ways to go’

Tlicho Grand Chief George Mackenzie told Bennett self-government will improve the future for young Indigenous people.

“Us in the Aboriginal world have a long ways to go yet, but we will not get there if we don’t have the federal support that we are seeking,” he said.

As the federal election approaches, Mackenzie said people will be looking for a party “committed 101 per cent to make things happen.”

“Our young people today, everywhere, are crying for help … we lack resources … we lack the funding,” he said.

Other negotiations proceeding

Yellowknives Dene Chief Ernest Betsina announced that Akaitcho First Nations could have an agreement in principle this year. They have been negotiating since 1992.

Grand Chief Gladys Norwegian reminded Bennett that the Dehcho First Nations have been in talks with Canada for nearly 20 years, and negotiations are stalled over surface and subsurface resource rights.

The Dehcho First Nations want to temporarily set aside land and resources and work on issues like education and self-government, Norwegian said.

“We are trying to decide how that looks like for us. It is a struggle and we really would like to move forward, but make sure that it is on our terms, that we are moving toward self-determination,” Norwegian said.

Meanwhile, K’atl’odeeche First Nation Chief April Martel says the community is leaning toward self-government, but has concerns about keeping reserve status under the Indian Act.

“That’s really powerful to our people because we don’t want to lose that. I want you to recognize that,” she said to Bennett.

It’s a stark contrast to the young man who burst onto the jihadist social media scene in 2014. Back then, ISIS was at the height of its power, when it controlled vast swaths of territory across Syria and Iraq, and was still growing. Ali, now 28, had left his home in Mississauga, Ont., in April that year to join the group in Syria, and sounded then like a man on a mission, one that involved beheading inﬁdels, executing homosexuals and enslaving women.

Not long after arriving, he tweeted about “playing soccer” with the head of James Foley, the U.S. journalist who was executed by ISIS on Aug. 19, 2014. In a November tweet, Ali, referring to the terrorist attacks at Parliament Hill and Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Que., in October that year, called on ISIS loyalists to “strike them, just as they strike your brothers and sisters.”

Now, as he is led to a chair, Ali’s gait is tentative and uncertain. He scratches his arm and upper thigh obsessively, a skin condition he tells me, though he never suffered from anything like it growing up. Before sitting, he pauses and looks around at the Kurdish intelligence ofﬁcers in the room, as if waiting for instructions.

After eight months in a prison in northern Syria, Ali looks otherwise healthy, apparently well-fed with the beginnings of a new beard replacing the one he shaved off before attempting to escape the last vestige of the ISIS caliphate in June last year. He becomes agitated when one of the intelligence ofﬁcers sets up a video camera for the interview.

“I don’t want that,” Ali says, his voice strained. “They’re gonna use it for propaganda. They’re always forcing me to do these interviews.”

READ MORE: Life amidst the ISIS insurgency

It’s not a good start to an interview I’d been trying to set up for more than a week. In fact, Ali was not even the Canadian ISIS prisoner I was hoping to meet. That was Mohammed Khalifa, the Toronto native who has admitted that he was the voice behind some of the Islamic State’s most gruesome execution videos.

I explain to Ali he is under no obligation to talk to me. To calm his nerves, I tell him I have news about his wife, who is also Canadian, and two young daughters, who are being held in a camp for the families of ISIS ﬁghters.

“Are they okay?” he asks, his dejection taking a sharp turn.

“The last I heard they are ﬁne,” I tell him. “Your wife is in touch with her father. He’s working on getting them returned to Canada. Do you want to do this interview?”

Ali nods and settles into his chair.

The prison in northern Syria where ISIS ﬁghters like Ali are kept is an imposing concrete panopticon surrounded by blast walls and razor wire on the southern outskirts of al-Hasakah. The prison has changed hands a few times over the course of the Syrian war. For a brief period in 2015, it came under the control of ISIS, which reportedly released all of its prisoners. It then fell to the People’s Protection Units, or YPG, the Kurdish militia in northern Iraq that, backed by the U.S., has led the ﬁght against ISIS.

On the day I meet Ali, in a side ofﬁce inside the prison compound, the prison shows little signs of the violence it has seen. The enemy, the one that once vowed to turn northern Syria into a medieval theocracy, is no longer threatening its gates; it is, instead, locked inside.

As many as 800 ISIS foreign ﬁghters, including Ali and Khalifa, now reside in al-Hasakah’s central prison, most captured by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, during the last stages of the assault on the dwindling caliphate’s territory. Over the past few months, under the cover of U.S. air strikes, artillery barrages and rocket ﬁre, the SDF closed in on the last remaining ISIS strongholds, battling through the Euphrates River Valley on its march to the Iraqi border, one ISIS-controlled village falling after the next.

On March 4, according to Mustafa Bali, an SDF spokesman, as many as 3,000 people, mostly civilians, fled from ISIS’s last stronghold in Baghouz al Fawqani, a tiny patchwork of rundown farmhouses, farm fields and tunnels on the east bank of the Euphrates, less than five kilometers from Iraq.

The last time I was down near Baghouz, on Feb. 11, ISIS ﬁghters were surrounded and desperate, lashing out in a counterattack that seemed to serve little purpose. U.S. jets, artillery and rocket launchers were raining ordnance down on their positions. Hundreds of civilians, almost entirely women and children, were on the move, stuffed into the backs of open-top trucks transporting them to SDF camps.

The counterattack failed. It may have been tactical, or it may have been exploratory, a probing mission to look for weaknesses in SDF lines. Or it may just as well have been the violent spasm of a dying beast.

When I first meet Kyle Town, it’s purely by chance in a restaurant in Derik, a small town in the Kurdish-controlled countryside of northern Syria near the Iraqi border.

The 30-year-old Thunder Bay, Ont., native walks in for lunch with a group of six foreign ﬁghters, mostly Americans, who have enlisted with the YPG, considered by most experts to be the Syrian branch of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, known by its Kurdish acronym, PKK, which has fought a bloody insurgency in Turkey’s southeast for decades and is listed as a terrorist organization in Canada, the U.S. and Europe.

Despite its dubious origins, the YPG is a key ally of the U.S. in the ﬁght against ISIS and the founding militia of the SDF, dominating its command structure and ﬁelding its most potent ﬁghting force, armed and trained by American special forces.

Derik, a sleepy administrative town, is the home base for the International Freedom Battalion, the YPG’s foreign ﬁghter contingent. Hundreds—from Europe, the U.S. and Canada—have joined the group; some, like John Gallagher from Windsor, Ont., have died ﬁghting for them. Town arrived in northern Syria in August last year, geared up not simply to destroy ISIS but to participate in what he considers the noble cause of the YPG’s revolution.

We meet later at the Freedom Battalion’s headquarters, in the rolling green hills surrounding Derik. It is a cross between a military outpost and a trekking base camp, and offers a commanding view of the Kurdish countryside, not just in Syria but Iraq and Turkey as well.

Town shows me around the base, pointing out the aluminum portable building with “mosque” scrawled on its side that the YPG took from ISIS and now uses as a common room for its ﬁghters, decorated with pictures of famous leftist revolutionaries like Che Guevara and Margherita Cagol, the leader of the Italian Red Brigades. He walks me over to a ﬁrepit set on a hilltop overlooking a valley.

“If you look to the north you can see the Cudi mountains, which are a part of northern Kurdistan within the borders of the Turkish nation state,” Town says. “If you look to the east you can see some of the mountains that are in Iraq, so southern Kurdistan. It’s kind of a constant reminder that Kurds are living in these four split-up parts—when you include Iran. These borders, which were drawn up in some kind of meeting room far away from here, have divided people and denied them a lot of their rights.”

The symbolism is central to the YPG’s revolutionary cause. For both ISIS and the YPG, the 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement, doling out different parts of the Ottoman Empire to Britain and France, was the original sin that created superﬁcial nation states and subjected the people of the Middle East to the rule of dictators. That sin, both groups claim, can only be erased by dismantling those nation states altogether.

For ISIS, of course, they would be replaced by the caliphate; for the YPG, by a quasi-anarchist system of self-governing communities, each in control of its own destiny.

The clash of these two ideologies is the backdrop to the war that has played out in northern Syria between ISIS and the YPG, with the latter now declaring victory.

When I meet the foreign ﬁghters at the Freedom Battalion camp, they know the war is nearing its conclusion. They are relaxed and talkative. All have been to the front to ﬁght; Town most recently at the beginning of January. What he found there was an enemy in retreat, without the will to ﬁght and lashing out in desperation. “For the most part there was little resistance,” he says. “On Jan. 7, ISIS attacked our position during the evening. They had cover from dust that was being kicked up by the air strikes and carried on the wind. They swept across the front and wrapped around the right side of our position. The ﬁreﬁght lasted for about three hours and then when night came, they retreated again.”

At the time—in early January—SDF forces had already overrun Ash Sha’fah, the same village where, seven months earlier, Ali had decided to abandon ISIS and make a dash for the Turkish border with his wife and children. He was captured by the YPG there.

In his telling, the journey to Ash Sha’fah began in 2008, when he was 18 years old and a ﬁrst-year student in the aerospace engineering program at Ryerson University in Toronto. Those ﬁrst months at university were a difﬁcult transition for Ali. He found university life disorienting and his choice of career path uninspiring.

“I don’t know what it was, man, whether it was depression or just the stress,” he says. “But I just couldn’t handle it, to the point where I even stopped going to classes. Eventually my marks dropped and they kicked me out.”

Growing up, Ali attended John Cabot Catholic Secondary School, where he had few friends and spent almost no time socializing. His life was routine: go to school, come home, watch television. There was nothing that really interested him, no set of beliefs that his parents, Pakistani Muslim immigrants who arrived in Canada in 1999 and were busy trying to build a new life, instilled in him.

So when he did ﬁnd something, he took to it with unusual fervour. In 2010, Ali says he turned to religion, though his family was never particularly religious. His exploration began online where he says he began reading classical Islamic texts. But without anyone to guide him, his understanding took a more militant turn after the onset of the Arab Spring in 2011. As the uprisings intensiﬁed, Ali became progressively more dismayed and distressed. The Syrian regime’s violent attacks on peaceful protesters left an especially deep impression.

Ali’s anger grew. He fell into bouts of depression and anxiety, sometimes breaking down into tears over what he saw as the crimes being carried out against Muslims around the world. His family became dismayed. At one point, he says, his father took him to a local imam to try to help him.

Ali’s family has declined media interviews but, according to a friend who spoke to Maclean’s on condition of anonymity, what they didn’t know at the time was that, online, Ali had befriended Andre Poulin, the Canadian Muslim convert from Timmins, Ont., who had left to join Syrian rebels in late 2012. Poulin had joined the Jaish al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar, a group of foreign ﬁghters based around Aleppo led by Chechens; he was encouraging the increasingly frustrated Ali to come join him in the ﬁght.

Poulin’s death in August 2013 was the ﬁnal push Ali says he needed. For months he had thought about going; his friend’s “sacriﬁce” was what ﬁnally gave him the courage to follow through. For years after being kicked out of university, he had wandered through life aimlessly and eventually ended up in northern Alberta taking on odd jobs in its oil ﬁelds. After Poulin’s death, Ali went home to Mississauga, bought a plane ticket to Turkey, telling his family he was going on vacation, and in April 2014, left.

While Ali was en route to Turkey, and then being smuggled into Syria, Kyle Town was back in Thunder Bay employed as a sheet metal worker but with dreams of being part of a revolutionary movement that would upend the injustices he felt had become institutionalized around the world.

Town had grown up in an environment of activism and social justice. His parents had opposed the provincial government of Mike Harris and its slashing of social programs in the late 1990s. When Town was three, his father, a police ofﬁcer, was shot in the line of duty and paralyzed. “We got a lot of support from the community,” he says. “We managed to have nurses to take care of him 24 hours a day. We were really fortunate in this way, something that a lot of families don’t have.”

Harris’s cuts would have directly affected this kind of support. In response, the Town family took to joining protest marches against Harris’s plans and Town, then 10 years old, himself began to appreciate the power of “popular resistance to the government.”

Later, after the Liberal party took power, Town says he came to the realization that all political parties were the same, that it was the structures of capitalist-led democracy itself that was the problem. As a teen, politically active and searching for an ideology, he toyed with Marxist-Leninist-style socialism but came to the conclusion that its reliance on centralized state structures would only lead to more tyranny, as it had in the Soviet Union and China. He then turned to anarchism.

In 2007, Town left Thunder Bay for university in Ottawa to study political science—but found that what he was being taught was its own kind of propaganda. “I didn’t really agree with what we were being asked to accept,” he says, “that Canada, and the West generally, is more or less the pinnacle of progress in society in terms of democracy.” He dropped out and joined like-minded people in the anarchist community.

Syria ﬁrst caught his eye during the early days of the ISIS expansion, especially when news began to emerge of its genocide against Yazidis in the summer of 2014. The PKK’s defense of the Yazidis struck him as not only heroic but also the product of the kind of ideologically driven tenacity that was needed to bring about the revolution he felt the world needed.

When he was ﬁnally ready to go, in the summer last year, he says he didn’t keep his intentions secret. He told everyone, including family, friends and work colleagues. “My family was supportive,” he says. “I’ve always been open with them about my thoughts on different issues. We’ve always talked about things like this.” In August, he boarded a flight to Sulaymaniyah in northern Iraq, and then made his way to the Syrian border.

Neither Town nor Ali had any military training but both ﬁrmly believed in their causes. Town’s story is relatively easy to conﬁrm and, being on the side that fought the universally hated ISIS, he has no reason to lie. Ali’s story is more complicated. Fearful and in the hands of the YPG, he now claims his only goal in coming to Syria was to protect Syrians and that he only ever fought the Syrian regime, never the YPG.

It’s impossible to conﬁrm details of his time in Syria (Maclean’s was able to conﬁrm the details of his life in Canada through media reports and interviews with people who knew him). But Ali has been consistent with his story, and the timeline of what he did while he was an ISIS member does align with how the group’s territory expanded and then collapsed.

Ali claims he arrived in Aleppo in early April 2014 with the help of a Swedish radical from ISIS whom he met online. “I didn’t really know much about the groups,” he says. “I just ended up meeting this guy from ISIS. At that time, pretty much everyone was going to ISIS, all of the foreigners and also the Syrians.”

After a month at a compound in Aleppo with about another 200 foreign recruits, Ali says he was moved to Jarablus, on the Turkish border, and then to a camp outside Raqqah, the city that would later become the capital of the ISIS caliphate. He learned how to use small arms; he learned how to pray properly and recite the right lines from Islamic tradition for a variety of situations, whether going into battle or before eating a meal.

After three weeks of training, ISIS administrators asked him what sorts of skills he possessed. Ali says he told them about his work in Alberta’s oil ﬁelds, so he was sent to the oil ﬁelds south of Raqqah. But there, nothing was working so he ended up sitting around until he was approached by an Australian ﬁghter who invited him to come to his training camp in al-Tabqah, a small town just east of Raqqah.

Over three months there, Ali received advanced sniper and reconnaissance training. It was there also that he met his future wife.

Little is known about Rida Jabbar, an Afghan-Canadian from Vancouver, and her motivations for joining ISIS. But according to other wives of ISIS ﬁghters, foreign women who joined the caliphate were held prisoner in homes until they found a husband. In Ali’s case, he was told while at the training camp in al-Taqbah that there was a Canadian woman available for marriage in the village. The two met once briefly and, sometime in September 2014, were married.

Ali insists this was not a forced marriage or any kind of enslavement. He claims he had heard rumours at that time about what was happening to Yazidi women but didn’t really think much of it. “There was always people trying to justify it,” he says. “And me, while not understanding Arabic or being well versed in Islam or things like that, I mean it’s very hard sometimes to separate the truth from ﬁction and to know what’s right and to know what’s wrong. I mean, at the same time you’re sitting in a war zone and you’re getting pressured from all sides. It’s not an easy life, man.”

Ali was also using social media at that time to promote ISIS atrocities like the sexual enslavement of Yazidi women. He was, by his own admission, on board with its mission. In those early days, while the caliphate was rapidly expanding, Ali says it did feel like their cause was divinely ordained. The morale was high, he says, and he was happy.

Things began to change sometime in early 2016, after the birth of his ﬁrst daughter. By then it had become clear to Ali that ISIS was not simply ﬁghting for the Syrian people. Its split from other rebel groups ﬁghting the regime had led to inﬁghting that Ali believed undermined the cause. And he now felt the propaganda campaign calling for attacks on Western targets had been a mistake, even though he himself had participated in it.

“I started seeing that I’d been manipulated, that this group was more so a maﬁa than anything else,” he says. “They were really not concerned about the Syrian people or foreigners like me. They were mostly concerned about protecting themselves and surviving.”

The breaking point came in October 2017, when SDF forces began their assault on Raqqah. Ali says he had been stationed at a training camp for foreign ﬁghters in the countryside east of Hama where he trained others in sniping and reconnaissance. But by the summer of 2017, the regime was closing in. He was forced to retreat to the east to al-Mayadin, on the Euphrates River.

As regime forces advanced, the ISIS lines collapsed. By mid-October, Ali and his fellow ISIS militants were forced further south. By then, Raqqah had fallen to the SDF. After that crushing blow, the will to ﬁght evaporated, Ali says. “A lot of people at that time were fed up already. They wanted to go back. Some people were willing to hang around a bit longer. And for some people, going back was not an option.”

By January 2018, the ISIS caliphate was little more than a patch of land no bigger than Moosonee straddling the Euphrates River. Ali had been sent back to the front near Ash Sha’fah, tasked with targeting regime forces for ISIS snipers and doing some of his own sniping. On the morning of Jan. 23, he says he crossed the river to visit his wife and children and drop into an ISIS ofﬁce for some work.

“By the afternoon, I heard that pretty much the entire west side had fallen in that hour or two-hour period that I’d been gone,” he says. “[The regime] pretty much just walked in and stormed the place. When I heard that news, I pretty much left work, just stayed home with my family, saw a few people. I left ISIS; I stopped working for them.”

Amarnath Amarasingam, a senior research fellow at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue who interviewed Ali in October last year, says ISIS foreign ﬁghters have often had a change of heart, especially once there are children in the picture. “I think his argument that he was disillusioned is probably accurate,” he says. “Whether he was able to leave right away is probably the more difﬁcult question. But he did have a wife and kids at that point.”

He also believes that foreigners in the caliphate were likely used as pawns, particularly women and children who were moved in tandem with the shifting front lines and kept as human shields. “I was stunned by the number of Western women coming out of the last holdouts,” he says.

Ali also claims that the ISIS leadership abandoned foreign ﬁghters, which Amarasingam says is also probably true. For the Iraqis and Syrians at the higher echelons of the organization, melting into the local population would be straightforward, as well as strategic. Most experts agree that ISIS is planning an insurgency in both Syria and Iraq. In fact, it has already begun. But for foreigners like Ali, who looked different and spoke little Arabic, there was no choice but to stay and ﬁght.

The more difﬁcult question to answer is whether Ali has abandoned his ideological fervour. He insists he was never fully inured to the ISIS brand of Islam. But when the situation was good, when ISIS controlled large swaths of territory and Ali was contentedly working away in the oil ﬁelds or training snipers, he was, by his own admission, happy to play the role of radical Salaﬁ jihadist and believed he was engaging in a holy war against the West.

The Canadian government has been evasive on the issue of what to do with people like Ali—as many as 32 Canadians are held in al-Hasakah’s prison and a refugee camp in northern Syria. Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale has admitted that bringing them home and prosecuting them will be difﬁcult considering the challenge of gathering evidence of their activities in a dangerous war zone. The U.S., meanwhile, has said if countries like Canada do not repatriate their nationals, the SDF will have no choice but to release them, increasing the likelihood they will return to the battleﬁeld.

Ali insists he poses no danger to Canada and wants to come home, that his experiences on the battleﬁelds of Syria have taught him the value of life in his home country. “Canada is very open and everyone is very accepting of each other,” he says. His revolution, he claims, is over.

For Kyle Town, the ideological question is more clear: being on the winning side has only deepened his belief in the YPG’s cause. ISIS was only one part of a much bigger battle, he says, and he was late on that scene anyway. During his brief time on the front lines, he was witness to the end of the caliphate. Now there is a more dangerous enemy on the horizon, he says.

Turkey, which considers the YPG as much a terrorist organization as the PKK, is threatening to launch its own offensive on YPG-held areas in northern Syria. For the Turks, the YPG’s political vision, its rejection of all state structures, is an existential threat.

During the last ceaseﬁre between Turkey and the PKK, PKK militants were criticized by international organizations for setting up their own political structures in areas they controlled in the southeast, in essence overthrowing the local government. In Syria, the YPG has done ostensibly the same thing. Its utopian political experiment means the Syrian regime will either have to give up political control over a vast swath of its territory or try to take it back by force.

Town says he is ready to ﬁght, whether it is against Turkey or Syria. His revolution is only beginning.

Liberal MLAs and Green MLA Olsen voted for standard (Class ...,"VICTORIA — As a representative of the only party in the legislature to consistently support ride-hailing over the years, Green MLA Adam Olsen had the cleanest hands of any MLA on a committee studying the issue.

“It was an honour to work through some of the more difficult challenges that happen in this place, then develop a report that can help better inform the decisions that are made,” said Olsen at the tabling Tuesday of the final report of the nine-member committee.

He then predicted the 11 recommendations will provide the basis to “bring ride-hailing to this province finally after a very, very, very, very long time.”

Yes, “very.”

The B.C. Liberals stalled for the better part of five years, all the while pandering to the taxi industry. The New Democrats then assumed stalling and pandering for another two years and counting.

But Olsen may be right that the committee report provided a plausible basis for going forward. Ten of the 11 recommendations were approved by MLAs representing all three parties in the legislature.

The consensus covers several of the most contentious issues involving ride-hailing, a technology that is inherently disruptive to the taxi monopoly. The committee rejected any need for restrictive boundaries that would limit the geographical range of operations for ride-hailing companies.

The MLAs heard from a range of experts that boundaries contribute to inefficient service, traffic congestion, increased emissions and reduced driver earnings. They also heard from the Vancouver Police Department that “restrictive boundaries contribute to undersupply, making it difficult for people to get home safely, particularly late at night.”

There was likewise little sympathy for imposing a cap on the size of ride-hailing fleets.

The federal Competition Bureau argued an unrestricted supply of operators would reduce prices and waiting times, increase quality of service and foster innovation.

The bureau further suggested “greater supply will not reduce drivers’ earnings because improved service will increase demand.”

In the interest of reducing emissions, the committee did recommend a maximum age of 10 years on vehicles licensed for ride-hailing services.

On fares, the committee said those should be pegged to a minimum higher than the equivalent trip on public transit. Operators would have to disclose fares in advance. The rate should be the same for accessible and non-accessible vehicles.

And regulators should monitor ride-hailing companies to determine if there is a need for a check on abuses such as surge pricing.

Having reached consensus on those points, the committee split on the licensing requirements for providers of ride-hailing services.

Some jurisdictions — Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba — require only a standard driver’s licence. Others — Alberta, Quebec, Nova Scotia — insist operators require a higher-grade commercial licence.

The latter is more onerous and more expensive to acquire, with tougher driving tests and a cost of up to $500.

The committee heard that the commercial licence, known as a Class 4 in B.C., can constitute an entry barrier to younger drivers, recent immigrants and others. In Alberta where commercial licensing is required, women comprise only five per cent of those qualified to provide ride-hailing services.

The arguments against the higher licensing requirement carried the day at the committee. Four B.C. Liberal MLAs and Green MLA Olsen voted for standard (Class 5) licensing. Three New Democrats voted for the Class 4 requirement. Another NDP MLA, Ravi Kahlon, recused himself from voting because his father, a longtime cab driver, owns a taxi licence in the provincial capital.

But the New Democrats had an ace in the hole card on licensing, courtesy of Transportation Minister Claire Trevena.

Minutes before the report was tabled Tuesday morning, she was on her feet in question period, telling the house she’d not seen the contents, was looking forward to them and would not — perish the thought! — prejudge the findings.

By noon, after an entire hour spent digesting the contents of the report and crafting her talking points, Trevena met with reporters to declare the committee recommendation on licensing to be dead on arrival.

“I will not move on Class 4 licences,” she declared. “I think people’s safety is paramount and a Class 4 licence adds to that issue of safety.”

Asked several times for evidence to back up that claim, she provided none. But it hardly mattered. Clearly, the New Democrats had one more service to perform for the taxi monopoly and perhaps there would be more to come.

In anticipation of that possibility, the Liberals predicted the New Democrats will draw out the approval process for ride-hailing for some time to come. They know the way, having gone the delaying route themselves.

The ministry has to draft the necessary regulations, which the cabinet must then approve. The regulator, the Passenger Transportation Board, needs to work up the application and approval process for ride-hailing operators. The vetting will take more time.

ICBC still has to come up with workable insurance for ride-hailing companies. All of which has the Liberals predicting that ride-hailing won’t be up and running in B.C. until this time next year — at the earliest.

Not so, said Premier John Horgan.

“We committed to get this done,” he told reporters. “We’ve passed the appropriate legislation last fall to enable ride-hailing. The regulations are being developed. And I am absolutely confident that ride-hailing will be here in 2019.”

Perhaps. But given the years of creative stalling to date, believe it when you can finally hail a ride.

Clayton Knutson

According to a the Freedom Conservative Party’s director of communications, Clayton Knutson was asked to resign as its candidate in Innisfail-Sylvan Lake and was officially removed on March 18 when he wouldn’t step down.

“He had failed to disclose previous information on his candidate nomination package and that includes… financial, personal and prior social media posts,” Cody Johnston told Global News on Tuesday. “We are a small and mighty party and we do our best to make sure that we vet our candidates properly before they get on the paper, and we do expect them to follow the honour system and it was found out that Clayton had failed to disclose controversial and quite frankly, Islamophobic posts in the past.”

When interviewed by Global News, Knutson said he believes a true libertarian party should not kick him out because he is critical of Islam.

“You have to be Shariah-compliant if you’re going to run for a party in Alberta,” he said. “I criticized people that will use the word Islamophobia because I don’t believe in Islamophobia. I think nobody has a phobia if they are actually criticizing Islam. It’s all about: you can’t criticize Islam.

“They asked for my resignation. I said, ‘Absolutely not,’ because they’re saying stuff like, ‘You’re a racist,’ and I’m not a racist, I’m in an interracial marriage.”

Knutson said he was turned off by the UCP after that party turfed a nomination candidate over photos he took with the far-right group Soldiers of Odin. He said he believed the Freedom Conservatives would allow its prospective candidates to have more freedom in their comments and associations.

Watch below: (From October 2018) Rachel Notley responds to the UCP disqualifying Lance Coulter after comments about the Soldiers of Odin.

Johnston said while the Freedom Conservative Party does see itself as a party of conservative libertarians,”there’s no place for Islamophobia in any party… and no one’s going to stand for that type of stuff.”

“He’s truly doubled down in the last few days, trying to prove that he is a racist and he is Islamophobic and I find his comments to be deplorable and we absolutely wholeheartedly reject them.”

Since being removed as the Freedom Conservatives’ candidate, Knutson has been active on Twitter, posting about Islam and saying he would vote for Caylan Ford, who recently resigned as a UCP candidate over comments about race and white supremacist terrorists; Eva Kiryakos, who recently resigned as a UCP candidate for comments she made about gender-neutral washrooms and a post she shared about refugees; and Todd Beasley, who was prevented from running for the UCP after social media posts were discovered in which he said of Islam that he hoped someone in history would have “snuffed this evil cult when they had the chance.”

“I think Mr. Knutson is unfit to be a politician in the province of Alberta,” Johnston said. “We need to be standing up against hate and intolerance and I know that he said we’re a bad libertarian party for not protecting his freedom of speech, but I argue he’s a bad conservative for failing to stand up against terrorism.”

Knutson said he has “the best intentions for every individual Muslim” and that he hopes “they have great lives.”

“But taking away my free speech with regards to religion just because I want to be a political candidate I think is very cowardly of the Freedom Conversative Party.”

Wade Woywitka

On Tuesday, the Freedom Conservative Party confirmed Wade Woywitka, who had been its candidate in Vermilion-Lloydminster-Wainwright, was asked to resign by the party which Woywitka did.

“It was a similar situation [to Knutson’s],” Johnston said when asked why Woywitka was asked to step down. “[He] had made some controversial posts.”

Johnston said he couldn’t immediately elaborate but Woywitka told Global News he believes his involvement in the Yellow Vest movement and views he has expressed on immigrants prompted the call for him to resign.

“[Things were brought up by another party about] stuff I said on the internet about our Yellow Vest movement and of course, as soon as you’re part of the Yellow Vests, you’re painted as a racist and every other thing in the book because we’re against the UN and we want pipelines built and everybody to get back to work,” he said.

“They were taking… just stuff I had said… interviews I had done in Ottawa (when the United We Roll convoy arrived there), and picking and choosing what they wanted to use out of context.”

Watch below: (From February 2019) A pro-pipeline convoy arrived at Parliament Hill Tuesday. Kendra Slugoski and Mike Le Couteur have more on the issues the protesters from across Canada want addressed.

Woywitka said he knows one social media post — that he said he made years ago — in particular helped bring about the end of his candidacy.

“It was in regards to all the immigrants coming in and I said, ‘Yeah, we need someone like (Donald) Trump to keep all the foreigners out of our country because they’re taking over and they’re ruining our country for our children,” he recounted.

“I talked to Derek and he just said, ‘There’s all these things they’re saying about you,’ and I just told him… ‘I’m not doing it (running as a candidate any longer) cause I’m not taking down the Yellow Vest movement for anything.'”

However, Woywitka said he plans to continue to support the Freedom Conservatives going forward.

“I back them 110 per cent,” he said. “That’s how I’m voting this year… I will back Derek [Fildebrandt] 110 per cent.

“We’re here for one reason and that’s to make our country better and to get our sovereignty back and to be a free nation again and not have some globalist government running our country, and I’m pretty sure that the Freedom Conservative Party and most Albertans have the same views that I do.”

Watch below: (From March 21, 20190 The Freedom Conservative Party launched its 2019 election campaign in Calgary on Thursday.

Woywitka, who indicated he was previously active in the Wildrose Party, said he is not sure if he will run for office again but he hopes all Albertans will vote this election, regardless of what party they support.

Chad Miller has now replaced Knutson as the Freedom Conservatives’ candidate in Innisfail-Sylvan Lake while Matthew Powell has now replaced Woywitka as the party’s candidate in Vermilion-Lloydminster-Wainwright.

Albertans head to the polls on April 16.

This, according to a new analysis of public opinion polling data by the non-profit Angus Reid Institute. The data was donated to ARI by Angus Reid Global Public Affairs.

The Conservatives capture 37 per cent of the decided and leaning vote – essentially unchanged from where they stood last month – but it is the governing Liberals who have dropped three points to 28 per cent as the SNC-Lavalin affair has remained in the headlines.

The principal beneficiaries of this decline in Liberal support appear to be the New Democratic Party and smaller parties, including the Green Party and the People’s Party of Canada.

These parties are seeing their fortunes rise as the Canadian public expresses unfavourable views of the main parties and their leaders.

UCP leader Jason Kenney outlined his party’s education platform for the April 16 provincial election at the private Calgary Jewish Academy on Monday.

He said his government would proclaim the former Progressive Conservative government’s Education Act of 2014 to replace the NDP’s amended School Act.

The Education Act included a provision to allow gay-straight alliances — clubs meant to make LGBTQ kids feel safe and welcome — in schools if students wanted them.

“We support those as an opportunity for young people who might be facing harassment or bullying to get that peer support and so we will encourage schools to comply with that legislation,” Kenney said.

The UCP said Tuesday it supports GSAs and Bill 10 would ensure that GSAs and peer support groups would be available to students when requested — in both private and public schools.

The party said it does not support mandatory notifications for parents that their child is in a GSA, but believes teachers should have the authority to tell parents if they deem it necessary.

“It’s a move to undermine gay-straight alliances and has the ability to do real harm to LGBTQ students, who remain amongst one of the most vulnerable groups of students in our schools today.”

Commenting on how a UCP government would deal with any pushback from religious schools on gay-straight alliances, Kenney said: “Our approach would be one of co-operation rather than one of confrontation.”

Kenney also said his party would ensure all sex education in the province covered the topic of consent.

Other planks of the United Conservative platform include lifting a cap on charter schools and requiring clear and understandable report cards.

Education funding would be maintained or increased, while at the same time, UCP will seek more efficiency. The NDP’s curriculum review which Kenney has previously threatened to put through “the shredder” if it strayed too far from learning fundamentals — would be put on hold to allow for broader consultations with parents, teachers and experts, Kenney said.

So at this critical juncture ...","The ghastly attacks on two mosques in New Zealand recently show that the rise of far-right extremism has not only proven itself to be a major global threat to peace and security, but also an existential threat to conservatism itself, which has come under heavy fire for breeding, or at least tolerating in its ranks, xenophobic elements.

In a way, the New Zealand attacks may prove to become a pivotal moment for the right-wing.

Though the racism of far-right extremism has long been identified as something real and dangerous, it has also, to a large extent, remained under the radar; something ugly simmering under the surface.

But after 50 people (nearly all visible minorities) were slaughtered at a house of worship, in a modern western nation deemed to be one of the safest in the world, that ugliness has boiled over for the world to see.

What’s now clear is that it’s past time for conservatives to utterly separate themselves from any notion or any segment of their membership base that ascribes even remotely to xenophobic or Islamophobic views. It should go without saying that conservatism is a movement in which racists are not welcome. Unfortunately, this is a message that must now be shouted by conservatives across the world, including here in Canada, where anti-immigrant views have, as of late, begun to stain the brand.

After the New Zealand mosque attack, the leader of the People’s Party of Canada refused to offer comment (even to denounce it). Similarly, the leader of the Conservative Party’s first statement focused on how “freedom” had come under attack (not Muslims), needing a second try to get it right. The delay left the impression that the Conservative Party feared alienating a kind of voter who may hold anti-immigrant views.

Both parties have also been skeptical of Canada’s signing of the UN’s Global Compact for Migration. The Conservatives have argued that it will erode the sovereignty of our borders, while the PPC says it will open the doors to masses of migrants from poor countries. Both claims seem geared toward stoking fear among anti-immigration voters, and contrary to the reality of the massive value of immigration.

Of course, south of the border, the president of the United States has openly fraternized with far right and white supremacists while routinely raising fears about immigrants, whether it’s about building a wall to keep out Mexicans or imposing a travel ban to keep out Muslims.

It’s as if an element of the right has forgotten, or perhaps has simply not truly understood, that there is a huge difference between “nationalism” and “nation building”.

“Nationalism” as we understand it today, is increasingly a movement based on bigotry and fear-based racism—one that’s often associated with populist far right movements in Europe that have ridden a wave of anti-migrant sentiment. “Nation building” however, is a very different and noble cause; one that is about wanting to make your country great—it is not to be associated with the pettiness of racism, bigotry or Islamophobia at all.

There needs to be a refocus on positive conservatism, a movement that embraces immigration and minorities. After all, immigration is what made the U.S. the dominant power in the world, by welcoming and nurturing the best minds to fuel technology and ingenuity. (Immigrants contribute 10 per cent of America’s annual GDP and are, according to the Brookings Institution, more likely to become Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, and physiology or medicine.)

We’ve seen the immense benefits of immigration here as well, but there’s a lot more potential we have yet to tap into. And conservative thinking should be obsessed with wanting to build Canada up to reach its true greatness.

Conservatism at its best is a movement that champions individual liberties and fiscal responsibility; small government and social values. Campassionate conservatives also believe in helping others, be they refugees or fellow citizens. It’s also important to remember that in the Conservative Party of Canada’s recent past, during the time of Stephen Harper, Canada recorded record high immigration and was focused on winning over immigrant communities.

So at this critical juncture, what is stopping Canadian conservatives from building a party that embraces open doors and offers a safe haven to the world’s most needy, while making Canada an economic powerhouse? Nothing. Because most right of centre voters in Canada are welcoming to refugees and immigrants and would welcome the economic growth and innovation they bring.

This is what the new conservatism, a positive conservatism, can look like. It’s got to be about nation building, not nationalism. It’s got to be about achieving the best for Canada, in a way that includes everybody, and cuts at the root of far-right extremism. It’s time to make a separation between racist nationalism, and the positive, inclusive patriotism of nation building.

At a campaign event in Red Deer Saturday, Kenney said a UCP government would end Alberta’s agreement with the Parole Board of Canada and pass legislation creating an Alberta Parole Board.

While Quebec and Ontario have their own parole boards, Alberta contracts with the arm’s length federal institution to provide the service.

The policy is meant to address concerns that repeat offenders, including parolees, are driving big increases in property crime in rural Alberta. But two criminologists contacted by Postmedia are critical of the proposal.

Parole is a form of release that allows offenders to serve the remainder of their sentences in the community under supervision. Parole eligibility dates vary for each inmate. Federal inmates who are not subject to a parole ineligibility period are typically eligible one-third of the way through their sentence — though eligibility is no guarantee of release.

Related

UCP spokeswoman Christine Myatt said the provincial board would decide whether inmates serving sentences in provincial jails — which hold inmates sentenced to two years or less — should be allowed conditional release. The national parole board would continue to be responsible for parole decisions regarding federal inmates.

The proposal was one of nine policies Kenney announced Saturday that take aim at what he described as unfair arrangements with the federal government.

During the speech, Kenney attacked the “alliance” between NDP Leader Rachel Notley and Justin Trudeau and also pledged to use the “prospect of a referendum” on equalization payments to force action on pipelines.

A UCP news release said “much of the recent property crime wave in Alberta has been connected to repeat offenders, including those on parole.” An earlier UCP report on crime in rural Alberta referred to a “revolving door” justice system.

In an email, Myatt said a provincial parole board wouldn’t necessarily be more stringent in granting supervised release. It would, however, be “more in touch with the current crime issues facing Alberta, including recidivism in property crime for those already on parole.”

Keith Spencer, a former criminologist at the University of Alberta, isn’t convinced.

“All it’s going to do is add more cost, and it isn’t going to produce any better results,” he said.

Spencer, who previously worked as an assistant district director with the National Parole Service, said the idea of a provincial parole board is not new.

He said jurisdictions that have looked at the idea typically balk at the cost. It’s also unlikely to be politically palatable, because it shifts the blame if a paroled inmate goes on to commit a high-profile crime.

“I think the government would be smart to stay out of … a justice system where you can never be a winner,” Spencer said. “Because you can have 99 successes and one failure and you only get credit for the failure.”

Anthony Doob, a University of Toronto criminology professor who studies parole, said only a tiny number of people across the country are granted parole from provincial institutions.

In an email, he said Kenney may be right about the role of repeat offenders in Alberta’s rural crime problems, but added it was “very, very unlikely” that much of Alberta’s property crime can be attributed to people on parole from provincial jails.

Postmedia asked the NDP for comment on the UCP proposal but did not hear back by press time.

Pages to request publications from Elections Canada, as well as the websites of Liberal, Conservative and NDP MPs use an outdated, unprotected chain to carry information you send to them through the network.

Liberal Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould, Conservative Finance Critic Pierre Poilievre and the NDP's Ruth Ellen Brosseau had this deficiency on the ""contact me"" form that asks for personal information — like your email, name and address — before sending feedback to your MP. Gould and other Liberal MPs updated their sites after queries from CBC News.

Conservative Party spokesperson Cory Hann said the party's websites all adhere to proper encryption standards, but the sites of individual MPs are not run by the party.

NDP spokesperson Jonathan Gauvin said the party has ""been in the process of updating all sites to ensure they're secure for users"" and they're ""committed to ensuring this is the default for all of our sites.""

There are two different protocols for sending data between your browser and the website you're connected with, the unsecure ""HTTP,"" and ""HTTPS"" — the secure version, with proper encryption — where the ""s"" stands for ""secure.""

Banks and credit card-based sites like Amazon started using HTTPS about 20 years ago, and social media sites have had it in place for more than a decade.

""This is what you can really consider the minimum 'security 101' for your website,"" said Aleksander Essex, a cyber security expert at Western University who specializes in democratic institutions.

He said if major political players — like Elections Canada and MPs — haven't fixed their websites yet, it's time to consider ""what kind of message is that sending.""

Elections Canada said they're aware of the security gaps and are working to fix them.

""We share the view that this is an important security measure. We are working on the final stages of implementing HTTPS on our site,"" they said in an email.

Fears of voter suppression

Basic HTTPS encryption isn't just about protecting information flowing through the internet, Essex said. It's about the user knowing their information will be kept confidential and giving people confidence they're interacting with legitimate organizations.

Without proper security, hackers are able to alter information on a website, including redirecting users to decoy pages. In the case of Elections Canada, Essex said these tactics could be used for voter suppression if information like where to vote is manipulated because the site isn't protected.

Essex said he first reached out to the agency eight months ago to flag the issue.

""I don't see any technical reason that it would take as long as it has,"" he said, adding a single web page can be converted into a HTTPS-safe site in a few minutes.

""Ultimately it comes down to the organization's priorities.""

Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale joins Power & Politics to discuss the government’s new cyber security strategy and what it means for Canadians. 6:30

A spokesperson for the Liberal Party said the ""highest levels of security are implemented for all data, communications, and records.""

When asked if Canadians should be concerned about sharing personal information over Liberal-affiliated websites, Braeden Caley said the party takes data security seriously.

""We are also providing 2019 candidates, campaign teams, and campaign officials with comprehensive resources and guides on best practices for information security online, on social media, and more broadly.""

Not every MP's web page is a security risk. Many MPs are already using HTTPS and all of the parties' primary websites are properly protected.

Similarly, most of Elections Canada's site uses a secure connection when it asks for your information.

'Not sending the right message'

Despite steps to fix the problems, Essex said it should worry Canadians that many MPs and the country's election agency are still operating at 1990s-level internet security.

""They say 'we would like to hear from you please sign up give us your email' and they send it insecurely over the unencrypted connection. It is not sending the right message,"" he said.

It's not a critical vulnerability, but that doesn't mean it should be tolerated.

105,Canada,2019-03-26T01:10:00.0000000Z,"OTTAWA — Jody Wilson-Raybould recommended in 2017 that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau nominate a conservative Manitoba judge to be ... who has touted the Liberals as “the party of the charter” and whose late father, Pierre Trudeau, spearheaded the ...","OTTAWA — Jody Wilson-Raybould recommended in 2017 that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau nominate a conservative Manitoba judge to be chief justice of the Supreme Court, even though he wasn’t a sitting member of the top court and had been a vocal critic of its activism on Charter of Rights issues, The Canadian Press has learned.

Well-placed sources say the former justice minister’s choice for chief justice was a moment of “significant disagreement” with Trudeau, who has touted the Liberals as “the party of the charter” and whose late father, Pierre Trudeau, spearheaded the drive to enshrine the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in the Constitution in 1982.

The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal discussions about a Supreme Court appointment, which are typically considered highly confidential.

For her part, Wilson-Raybould said Monday “there was no conflict between the PM and myself.”

In an email, she characterized the matter as part of the normal process of appointing a Supreme Court justice, which involves “typically CONFIDENTIAL conversations and communications — back and forths between the PM and the AG (attorney general) on potential candidates for appointment.”

She said she’s “not at liberty to comment” on the “veracity” of what the sources said occurred, adding, “Commentary/reporting in this regard with respect to a SCC appointment(s) could compromise the integrity of the appointments process and potentially sitting justices.”

The issue suggests Trudeau may have had reasons unrelated to the SNC-Lavalin affair for moving Wilson-Raybould out of the prestigious Justice portfolio earlier this year — a cabinet shuffle that touched off a full-blown political crisis for the governing Liberals.

Wilson-Raybould has said she believes she was moved to Veterans Affairs as punishment for refusing to intervene to stop a criminal prosecution of the Montreal engineering giant on bribery charges related to contracts in Libya. Trudeau has denied the SNC matter had anything to do with the decision.

She resigned a month later amid allegations she was improperly pressured by the Prime Minister’s Office to interfere in the SNC-Lavalin case, triggering a furor that has engulfed the Trudeau government ever since. The PMO refused to comment on the story Monday.

The issue, the sources say, arose after Beverley McLachlin announced in June 2017 her decision to retire that December after 28 years on the high court, including 17 as chief justice.

Her retirement meant the government would have to choose a new chief justice and find another bilingual judge from western or northern Canada to sit on the nine-member bench.

Trudeau created an independent, non-partisan advisory board, headed by former Conservative prime minister Kim Campbell, to identify qualified candidates to fill the western/northern vacancy and submit a short list of three to five names for consideration.

According to the sources, one of the names on the eventual list was Glenn Joyal, who had been appointed in 2011 by former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper as chief justice of Manitoba’s Court of Queen’s Bench.

Wilson-Raybould then sent Trudeau a 60-plus-page memo arguing that Joyal should not only be added to the top court but should be named chief justice as well.

Only once before in Canadian history — in 1906, when Sir Wilfrid Laurier appointed his justice minister to the top judicial job — has a prime minister chosen a chief justice who was not already sitting on the Supreme Court.

Wilson-Raybould’s pick puzzled Trudeau but he became disturbed after doing some research into Joyal’s views on the charter, the sources said.

Joyal had criticized the judiciary for broadly interpreting charter rights and expanding them to apply to things not explicitly mentioned in the charter or, in his view, intended by provincial premiers when they agreed to enshrine a charter in the Constitution.

The Supreme Court’s liberal interpretation has led to things like legalization of same-sex marriage, the right of women to choose to have an abortion and the legalization of medical assistance in dying, among other things Â­– developments Trudeau has celebrated.

In a January 2017 speech to the Canadian Constitution Foundation’s Law and Freedom Conference, Joyal echoed conservative arguments that the top court has usurped the supremacy of elected legislatures to determine social policy.

The charter, Joyal argued, was the result of a compromise between Pierre Trudeau and premiers, most of whom had originally opposed inclusion of a charter in the Constitution. The compromise was intended to maintain a balance between the judiciary and the legislative branch of government, with provisions allowing governments to limit or override rights altogether in some circumstances.

Since then, judicial interpretation of the charter has ignored the intentions of the drafters and “led without question to a level of judicial potency that was not anticipated back in 1982,” Joyal said in the speech, a video of which is available on the foundation’s website. That, in turn, has resulted in a “less potent and less influential legislative branch that seldom has the final word.”

“With the ‘constitutionalizing’ of more and more political and social issues into fundamental rights, the Canadian judiciary has all but removed those issues, in a fairly permanent way, from the realm of future civic engagement and future political debate,” he said.

Joyal was particularly critical of the Supreme Court’s interpretation of section 7 of the charter Â­– the section which guarantees everyone the right to life, liberty and security of the person and under which the top court struck down Canada’s abortion law and the prohibition on medically assisted death.

The court’s liberal interpretation of that section “has become, particularly in recent years, the single most fertile source for the discovery of new rights and the de facto constitutionalization of political and social issues,” he said.

Trudeau rejected Wilson-Raybould’s advice. He ended up appointing Sheila Martin, a judge on the appeal courts of Alberta, Northwest Territories and Nunavut, to fill the vacant western Canadian seat on the bench. Sitting Supreme Court Justice Richard Wagner was elevated to the role of chief justice.

Shortly after Trudeau told Wilson-Raybould he did not support her choice, the sources said Joyal withdrew his name from consideration.

In a statement Monday, Joyal makes no mention of the former minister, saying he submitted an application for consideration for the Supreme Court in 2017, only to be forced to withdraw his name for personal reasons related to his wife’s health.

“I fear that someone is using my previous candidacy to the Supreme Court of Canada to further an agenda unrelated to the appointment process,” Joyal said. “This is wrong.”

Wilson-Raybould’s advocacy of Joyal for the top judicial job may not come as a total surprise to some Liberals, who’ve privately noted what they consider her conservative, restrictive approach to charter rights in a number of bills, including those dealing with assisted dying, impaired driving and genetic discrimination.

Jane Philpott, as health minister at the time, was jointly responsible with Wilson-Raybould for the assisted dying legislation.

By contrast, the NDP is the only one among the major political parties vying to win the 2019 Alberta provincial election to achieve gender parity. The competitors — including the Liberal Party — don't even come close.

Parity YEG has been keeping track of the men and women in the parties:

""I just think for too long we've sort of had one demographic represented predominantly in government and I think we have more nuanced and better decision making when we have more women and more women of colour in politics,"" said Rakhi Pancholi, 41, NDP candidate for Edmonton-Whitemud.

""I believe women have a lot to contribute to government and I think it's a great place for their voices to be heard,"" she said.

Still, a closer look at the New Democrats' slate reveals a tendency to attract union reps and public and non-profit employees such as teachers, health-care professionals and social workers.

The Alberta Party — which likes to position itself as the centrist party — is putting forward a slate of candidates that's remarkably similar to the UCP's, but with the most Indigenous or Métis representation of any party.

Nearly one in four candidates is of a visible minority group

At least 21 of the 86 — or one in four — candidates nominated so far under the United Conservative tent have identified themselves as members of a visible minority group.

They include East Asian, South Asian, black, Middle Eastern, mixed-race as well as Indigenous and Métis, among others.

The Alberta Party has 28, including five with First Nations background.

The NDP is running at least 19 self-proclaimed racially diverse candidates, which is statistically comparable.

Candidates with diverse ethnic backgrounds are largely concentrated in the big cities.

They make up around half of the candidates running in at least 10 ridings in Edmonton, and 10 ridings in Calgary. In some electoral districts — such as Calgary-Falconridge and Calgary-McCall — all the candidates from major parties are visible minorities.

""I never chose Calgary, Calgary chose me,"" said Gar Gar, the Alberta Party candidate for Calgary-East, whose family fled war-torn Sudan and Egypt to settle in Canada.

Breaking down professional backgrounds

At least 19 NDP candidates mentioned being involved in unions or labour movements in their party biographies. That number dwindles to two in the Alberta Party and none in the UCP.

No surprise, given the New Democrats' traditional affiliation with labour movements, and party leader Rachel Notley's previous connections as a labour lawyer for unions.

When it comes to entrepreneurial or business experience, however, UCP trumps all other parties in terms of the number of candidates hailing from the private sector.

Close to 60 UCP candidates claim to have worked in or owned their own business almost twice as many as the NDP.

""I believe it's good to have a cross-section of all people in every type of business and I believe agri-business needs to be represented,"" said Adriana LaGrange, UCP candidate for Red Deer-North. Her family runs a farm on the outskirts of the city.

At least 33 NDP candidates mention work experience in the public sector in their campaign biographies. That number falls to 26 for both the UCP and the Alberta Party.

Irfan Chaudhry, the director of MacEwan University's Office of Human Rights, Diversity and Equity, said it's important to look beyond tokenism, to ensure a true diverse representation of Albertans in elected office.

""Political parties will utilize candidates to enhance their diversity portfolio, and also because they want to ensure that it reflects the demographic of the community that they serve,"" he said.

""It's always important to make sure they form a very broad spectrum of diversity that voters have a general connection to.

""Being a very credible candidate is priority number one — someone that knows the issue is someone that can represent the community well and that's a starting point.""

Kenney on education

A United Conservative Party government would bring back Grade 3 provincial achievement tests and introduce new standardized math tests in Grades 1, 2 and 3, party leader Jason Kenney announced at a Calgary school on Monday morning.

As school trustees gathered in Edmonton and Calgary to advocate for Alberta’s next government to fund enrolment growth in schools and address shortfalls in transportation and school repair funding, Kenney said the UCP would “maintain or increase” education funding. Kenney said he would expect boards to decrease administrative overhead and direct more funding to classrooms.

The UCP will continue to build new schools to address demand, he said.

Kenney also said the UCP would proclaim the Education Act by Sept. 1, 2019, replacing the School Act. It would erase the additional protections the NDP government introduced for LGBTQ students and staff with Bill 24 in 2017.

The party would pause the current K-12 curriculum rewrite, he said, and broaden consultation to include more perspectives. The curriculum should be written in plain language and include more history and geography of Alberta and Canada, he said.

“It’s time to put away failed teaching fads” and embrace tried and true education methods, Kenney said.

The party would repeal a 2013 ministerial order from the previous Progressive Conservative government that refers to schools focusing on competencies rather than content, and using inquiry-based learning methods for students to apply knowledge.

If elected, the UCP would order an immediate audit of the $3 billion spent during the last 15 years that was supposed to help keep class size averages near guidelines set by the Alberta Commission on Learning in 2003. Class sizes in many parts of the province have grown steadily since 2010.

Kenney also said a UCP government would work with universities to ensure teachers are experts in the subjects they are teaching.

The UCP would also introduce a “Choice in Education Act,” which would lift the cap on the number of charter schools in Alberta. The Progressive Conservative government established a cap of 15 charters in provincial regulation in the 1990s. There are currently 13 charter schools operating in Alberta.

Charter schools would be able to own property, Kenney said, and would have a higher priority in making use of surplus school sites.

The UCP would also review the education funding formula, which rural school boards say is penalizing them when enrolment declines.

Fildebrandt on education

The Freedom Conservative Party also released its education platform Monday afternoon.

Speaking outside a church in Chestermere, party leader Derek Fildebrandt pledged to provide equal funding for all schools — public, private or home school — with cash following the students, and pass a Parents Bill of Rights to give moms and dads final say in their child’s education.

Fildebrandt also vowed to cancel the NDP’s new curriculum rollout “lock, stock and barrel.”

“We’re not going to cancel the curriculum and replace it with an FCP curriculum. We are going to cancel the Alberta curriculum, period, and allow school boards to decide for themselves what curriculum they will follow so long as they meet reasonable … targets for learning,” he said.

Fildebrandt took a swipe at universities and colleges, too, saying they have “become a hotbed of radicalism that has more of a focus on indoctrination than on learning and free thought.”

He said any post-secondary institution that doesn’t protect freedom of speech, assembly and thought would have their provincial funding revoked under an FCP government, and student union fees would be voluntary.

Holland, according to a statement, was motivated to run “out of frustration” over decisions being made by the Liberal government in Ottawa. “Liberal MPs here in Nova Scotia have failed to stand up and fight for our province,” Holland said in the release. Holland, a former county councillor and Liberal MLA for Timberlea-Prospect, more recently ran unsuccessfully for a regional council seat in 2016 for District 12, which was taken by Richard Zurawski.

He also ran unsuccessfully for the Halifax Atlantic seat in the 2017 provincial election for the Progressive Conservative party, losing to Liberal Brendan Maguire. The release said Holland remains concerned about the federal Liberal government’s commitment to maintaining the shipbuilding contract in Halifax. Last October, shipbuilders at Halifax’s Irving Shipyard launched a campaign to keep their work in Nova Scotia as concerns mounted over the possibility of repair work on Halifax-class navy ships being transferred to Davie Shipbuilding in Quebec. “The Liberals have not been clear in their commitment to keeping those jobs here in Halifax. That’s not good enough,” said Holland. “A Conservative government led by Andrew Scheer recognizes we need a strong and prosperous capital city. It was the Conservative Party that brought in the largest procurement arrangement in Canadian history, and Halifax has proved itself to be among the best in class when it comes to building our naval and coast guard vessels.”

Scheer, the federal Conservative leader, was also quoted in Holland’s release saying “having Bruce join our team will ensure Halifax gets the strong representation they deserve in a Conservative government that will lower taxes, and put people first.” Liberal MP Andy Fillmore is running to keep his Halifax seat and anti-poverty advocate Christine Saulnier is seeking the NDP nomination for the riding.

110,Politics,2019-03-28T18:30:00.0000000Z,Conservative leader Andrew Scheer wasted no time taking ... president of the Richmond Hill federal riding association and as president of the Liberal Party of Canada (Ontario) Central Region. “Considering how significant the challenges facing the country ...,"The Walrus/flickr

On September 17, 2018, Parliament’s first day back from summer break, Leona Alleslev, the Liberal MP from Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill, rose in the House of Commons to announce her defection from the governing Liberal Party of Canada. “The government must be challenged openly and publicly. But for me to publicly criticize the government as a Liberal would undermine the government and, according to my code of conduct, be dishonourable,” she said. “After careful and deliberate consideration, I must withdraw from the government benches to take my seat among the ranks of my Conservative colleagues.”

New to politics when she was first elected in 2015, Alleslev is a hard-nosed and plain-spoken air force veteran. Before her dramatic exit, her time in office had been somewhat unexceptional, save for her early career appointment as parliamentary secretary to public-services and procurement minister Judy Foote—a notable promotion for a rookie MP. Still, she was, until she switched sides, little known outside of political and military circles.

The media immediately scoured her social media for signs of dissent but turned up nothing—no instances of serious disagreement with the party, no off-the-cuff clashes with Liberal colleagues, no pretension of sticking it to the man for the sake of her constituents. Rather, by all appearances, Alleslev had fallen in line with the party. Throughout her tenure, she offered reassurances that team Trudeau was on the right track. In July, two months before switching sides, she fawned over the prime minister, foreign-affairs minister Chrystia Freeland, and defence minister Harjit Sajjan in a private email, calling them “truly awesome.” Nine days later, she praised Trudeau’s leadership at a fundraising event.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer wasted no time taking advantage of her move. “For all those Canadians who supported Justin Trudeau in 2015 and are dissatisfied or even angry about the leadership that he’s been giving,” he told a room full of reporters, “the Conservative Party needs you.” He had apparently forgiven her previous anti-Conservative criticism. During a 2015 election debate in her riding, Alleslev lamented having watched the country under Stephen Harper “become something I barely recognize—socially, politically, economically, and internationally.” But the Trudeau government, in the end, apparently fared just as poorly in Alleslev’s eyes. Bidding adieu to her fellow caucus members, she referenced wide-ranging failures on tax reform, trade, foreign policy, defence, and security. She assured everyone who asked that it was never only one issue.

The act of switching teams requires a flexibility uncommon among twenty-first-century politicians. Alleslev considers herself among that rare breed of lawmaker. “As a member of Parliament, it’s my job to listen to everybody,” she told me. “I’m not sure that’s always the most widely held opinion.” She sees in modern politics a tendency to characterize all debate as conflict and worries about where that will lead. “If you look where we are, not only in Canada but in the world, where we’re becoming far more divided, far less able to have conservations with those that we have differing opinions with, we’re at risk of losing the value of debate.”

The resignations of two high-profile cabinet ministers over the Liberals’ mishandling of the SNC-Lavalin affair have since brought the question of debate within parties into greater focus. Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former justice minister and attorney general, and Jane Philpott, the former Treasury Board president, two of Trudeau’s most respected ministers, brazenly stood against the prime minister and his office and still remain in the Liberal caucus. Their actions lend credibility to Alleslev’s story while undermining the necessity of her departure. She chose to keep her quarrels with the party silent, she says, because dissenting openly would jeopardize its ability to govern.

But, in keeping quiet for so long, Alleslev has opened herself up to accusations of political opportunism. “Did you put your finger in the air to see which way the wind was blowing,” pressed CTV’s Don Martin, “and figure it was going to go Conservative in 2019, so you might as well join the parade?” If she hopes to regain her seat in 2019, Alleslev will need to prove those accusations wrong. She will need to convince her supporters that switching sides was more than simply self-interested politics, despite what the opposition says. And the Liberals will come armed with stories spun by former staffers and Liberal hard-liners with an incentive to discredit her. All voters have is her word. Whether she honestly acted in their interest or not, the fallout that ensued suggests intentions are moot. Few things are as politically isolating as crossing the floor.

Since Confederation, 340 MPs have changed party affiliation, willingly or not, between elections. Those who leave tend to opt for independence, with many soon switching again to join another party or to return to their former caucus. While some forty countries have laws pertaining to crossing the floor—in most cases, defecting legislators are forced to give up their seats—there’s no federal convention, legislation, or parliamentary rule regarding it in Canada. Manitoba and New Brunswick have enacted laws forcing outgoing caucus members to sit independently for the remainder of the term. But both the Liberals and Conservatives seem less keen to hamstring members’ freedom. In 2005, the federal government defeated a bill proposing that changes in party affiliation be followed by a by-election. Similar legislation has been introduced regularly in parliamentary sessions since; all have failed to pass first reading.

However, a series of ethics inquiries suggests floor crossers came under greater scrutiny beginning in the early 2000s, as crossing grew in popularity. Some forty-four MPs switched sides between 2001 and 2005, which, according to a 2006 study, outpaced the previous eighty-year average of twenty-three crossings per decade. In 2005, former ethics commissioner Bernard Shapiro was asked to determine whether a member had contravened the Conflict of Interest Code in switching parties. The following year, his attention turned to investigating Prime Minister Stephen Harper. In question was whether Harper had bribed Liberal MP David Emerson into leaving his party with the perks of a cabinet position with the Conservatives. Shapiro found no wrongdoing, but noted, “The discontent expressed by Canadians on this matter cannot be attributed merely to the machinations of partisan politics. Fairly or unfairly, this particular instance has given many citizens a sense that their vote—the cornerstone of our democratic system—was somehow devalued, if not betrayed.”

A number high-profile defections have been viewed as politically expedient, such as those of Belinda Stronach, in 2005, and Eve Adams, in 2015. Stronach left the Conservatives and was granted a cabinet seat with the Liberals, a move she made, some suspect, to help keep Paul Martin’s minority government in power ahead of two important budget votes. Adams deserted the Conservatives over their “mean-spirited leadership” six months after dropping out of a nomination-race in a new riding and was welcomed by Trudeau’s Liberals with open arms.

In Alleslev’s case, journalists and political pundits raised the possibility that she was reacting to the Ontario Liberal Party’s defeat in June 2018. During that provincial election, the riding of Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill saw Conservative Michael Parsa win by more than twice as many votes as the Liberal runner-up. By comparison, in 2014, each of the predecessor districts that now make up the new riding—Newmarket-Aurora, Oak Ridges–Markham, and Richmond Hill—had voted Liberal. The losses are notable, but they offer little insight into the projected electoral outcome for the region in October. According to the CBC, the federal party that has won the most seats in Ontario has been different in 52 percent of elections from the one currently in power provincially.

At the federal level, the ethnically diverse riding of Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill remains a toss-up between the reds and blues. It would be foolish to think Alleslev had special insight, more than one year out, into how the election will unfold. What we know is this: in Ontario, the parties have been neck and neck in the polls since early 2018, and an analysis of polling numbers by the website Calculated Politics, taken only weeks before Alleslev’s defection, projected the Conservatives were on par to win Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill by a margin of just 2 percent.

What seems to set defectors apart is an ability to exploit the divisive nature of politics today to their own advantage. It’s a quality Alleslev seems to have put to work during her 2014 nomination race. Clayton Haluza, president of the federal Liberal riding association in Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill, hadn’t the faintest idea who she was when she approached him at a fundraising event that year. Haluza found her straightforwardness refreshing for a political hopeful. But Alleslev had no ties to the Liberal party, hadn’t served in municipal politics, and wasn’t particularly involved in the community.

Alleslev’s aloofness was the result of having, as she says, “never, ever considered” a life in politics. Instead, she envisioned spending her entire career in the military—a calling she says teaches you to put country first. Her father retired as a two-star general from the Royal Canadian Air Force; his father had resisted the Nazis in Denmark as a member of the Danish underground. She came to believe that “serving one’s country is an honourable profession.” In 1991, she joined the Canadian military as a second lieutenant, logistics officer in Comox, BC, having studied history and political science at the Royal Military College in Kingston, Ontario. A decade later, following her retirement from the military, she worked as a consultant, at times within the federal government, and eventually landed in the private sector at IBM and Bombardier Aerospace.

Alleslev says it was Harper government that motivated her to join the Liberal Party in 2014. She thought their policies weren’t positioning Canada competitively and that, in contrast, the Liberals were making bold promises on everything from foreign policy to infrastructure spending, which she found appealing. Sitting in her Richmond Hill office late last year, she told me she began to sense, around four years ago, that “some pretty dramatic things” were unfolding at home and abroad. She was unsure about running for office, however, until she met Jason Cherniak, who was seeking the nomination. A lawyer based out of Richmond Hill, then in his midthirties, Cherniak was as faithful as they come: a card-carrying Liberal since high school, he went on to serve on the Young Liberals of Canada national executive and later as president of the Richmond Hill federal riding association and as president of the Liberal Party of Canada (Ontario) Central Region.

“Considering how significant the challenges facing the country and world are right now, I’m not sure he’s the right guy to represent me as a member of Parliament,” she said, thinking back. “Ah rats—I’m going to have to run.”

With existing ties to the Liberal Party, Cherniak was confident he had a shot at the nomination. But he began to suspect party upper brass were favouring Alleslev. “That part of it has been very difficult for me,” Cherniak says, “because after all these years of volunteering, I really thought that at the very least I had earned a chance at a fair race.” Alleslev had virtually no political experience, but she was a veteran and strong leader who stood in contrast to Conservative incumbent, Costas Menegakis. She played right into the optimistic, feminist narrative the Liberals were hoping to tell. As the Globe and Mail’s Adam Radwanski has noted, Trudeau “made a point of recruiting a diverse array of candidates who, despite impressive professional credentials, often did not have much partisan political experience.”

So intent was the party to win the riding that it overlooked what one former staffer now considers several “red flags.” Alleslev’s sister Caroline vied for the Conservative seat in Beaches–East York in 2008. And, throughout the nomination race, Alleslev could be found in tow of Greg Beros, a staunch Conservative and Richmond Hill city councillor. “You know that Leona’s a good, dear friend,” Beros would say when introducing her to members of local community groups. “While I can’t vote for her, because she’s with the Liberal Party, she is a great individual and would represent us well.” Beros recused himself from supporting her come the election. “Some people are candidate first, party second,” he says. “I’m always party first, candidate second.”

Alleslev succeeded at connecting with influential members of the riding’s Muslim community, whose support, both financial and otherwise, was “key to her getting the nomination,” says Haluza. She was later able to leverage constituents’ unhappiness with the Conservatives’ anti-immigrant rhetoric over “Canadian values” to garner widespread approval among members of the Muslim community. Without their support, many Liberals believe she would have lost in the general election. In the end, a combination of Alleslev’s own political abilities and the Conservatives’ hardline tactics helped mobilize the Muslim community at the polls, and she clinched the seat by fewer than 1,100 votes.

Following the win, a different picture of Alleslev began to emerge, one the Liberals could attempt to resuscitate during the upcoming election. In several instances, sources speaking on background say Alleslev was reluctant to credit the Muslim community for its role in her electoral success. This, they say, left some supporters feeling hurt and embittered. (In a request for comment, Alleslev apologized. “I like to think of myself as being sensitive,” she said. “So if I have been in any way insensitive, then I’m very sorry for that.”). According to the sources, that resentment was amplified by Alleslev’s decision to join the Conservatives, a party which has shown itself—most recently through its promise to withdraw Canada from the UN’s Global Compact for Safe, Orderly, and Regular Migration—to be less open to refugees and immigrants. In 2019, Alleslev will have to grapple with having alienated a group that fervently supported her only four years ago.

“A political party is made up of the people who are in it at the time and must be judged by what the country needs at the time,” Alleslev has said, in explanation of her actions. By this, she appears to suggest that political parties aren’t monolithic entities but rather are born out of a particular time and place and defined by their caucuses, which presumably have voters’ best interests at heart. This logic enables Alleslev to argue it’s not her principles but rather the needs of Canadians that have changed since she first entered politics.

Her position reveals a grey area, rarely acknowledged in federal politics, that can be exploited by politicians willing to see beyond fervent partisanship. The Liberals and Conservatives may have the tendency to disagree, especially during election years, and their rhetoric may be different, but their track records suggest they’re more similar than they’re wont to admit. “To this day, if you go down line by line and look at what the Conservative and Liberal party stand for,” Haluza says, “at least on paper, it’s shades of grey.”

Alleslev seems to have leveraged this dynamic to her own advantage. Justifying her defection, she accused the Liberals of failing to meet the NATO target that members spend at least 2 percent of GDP on defence, even though Trudeau campaigned on maintaining previous spending levels. The truth is, no sitting government has met NATO’s targets since they were enacted in 2006. Alleslev also rebuked the Liberals’ diplomatic track record, citing tensions with Saudi Arabia, China, and India. This critique ignores the Conservatives’ own failings, such as in 2010, when Canada was forced to withdraw from pursuing a seat on the UN Security Council, a move interpreted by an article in OpenCanada as a “stinging rebuke of Harper’s anti-UN foreign policy.” (Trudeau has pledged to vie for a seat on the council in 2020). Their similarities extend to the economy, where both parties are quick to talk about more free-trade agreements and tax relief for the middle class.

But, if the parties are so alike, why would Alleslev leave one for the other? To the former colleagues who are quick to mention Alleslev’s ambition, it’s easy to craft a tale of opportunity. Alleslev’s political career was off to a strong start when, in late 2015, she was named Foote’s parliamentary secretary. The public-services minister’s mandate included replacing the country’s fleet of aging CF-18s and supporting a national shipbuilding procurement strategy—two areas that would seem to be of strong personal interest to Alleslev. As parliamentary secretary, she supported these files. But she also worked on Phoenix, the payment system for the federal civil service, the deployment of which has been riddled with complications.

According to a 2018 Senate finance committee report, more than half of the Canadian civil service has not been properly paid since Phoenix’s implementation in 2016. The report notes that the project will likely amass $2.2 billion in unplanned costs by 2023, making it an “international embarrassment.” When questioned about Phoenix on Foote’s behalf, Alleslev would assure legislators the system would soon be fixed. But the situation remained chaotic, and following a cabinet shuffle in January 2017, she was demoted from her role as parliamentary secretary. Historically, such appointments have been used to prepare (or rather to test the readiness of) future cabinet ministers. Alleslev would later cite the Liberals’ failure to resolve Phoenix as among her reasons for leaving the party.

Throwing herself in with the Conservatives has, conveniently, allowed her to regain lost momentum. National media attention has made her a familiar face and a champion of the Conservative cause. And, with Scheer swiftly appointing her shadow cabinet secretary for global security, she has reclaimed a prominent role in the House. It may prove to be an important career pick-me-up, given that she was ousted as chair of the Canadian NATO parliamentary association one month after defecting. Like the majority of floor-crossing MPs before her, Alleslev could have ridden out her term as an independent, thereby limiting speculation on her motives, but she says she decided against it, believing that the Canadian system is not “structured for independence.” Independent members rarely sit on committees, are not recognized as often during Question Period, and lose the support of a caucus. They are, in other words, less influential.

Alleslev has always been focused on maximizing her influence. She entered politics with her mind set on transforming the country and, after three years, came to believe she couldn’t do it as a Liberal. An early party switch meant trying to make the most of what could be her last year in office, she says, noting she had the support of her family and many constituents. But it also meant alienating supporters and staff who fought to get her elected and who now have reason to want to see her lose. Later this year, they will get their say on whether her actions were genuine and, above all, justified.",The Politics of Switching Parties,The Walrus,https://thewalrus.ca/the-politics-of-switching-parties/
111,Politics,2019-03-26T22:39:00.0000000Z,"On Tuesday, the battleground moved to the Commons ethics committee, which considered a Conservative motion to launch a study ... Although Erskine-Smith has a track record of challenging the party line, and had even previously cast a vote in favour of ...","OTTAWA — Liberal MPs have blocked the latest attempt to provide a venue for former cabinet ministers Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott to testify on the SNC-Lavalin affair.

On Tuesday, the battleground moved to the Commons ethics committee, which considered a Conservative motion to launch a study after the Liberal-dominated justice committee voted to conclude its investigation without calling more witnesses.

But the six Liberals on the ethics committee out-voted the Conservatives, who had two votes, and the NDP, who had one, and the motion failed.

Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre called the result especially ironic given recent comments from some Liberal MPs that it was time for Wilson-Raybould to just say her piece, rather than dribbling out news day-by-day. In the most prominent example, Liberal MP Judy Sgro said in a radio interview over the weekend that Wilson-Raybould needed to “either put up or shut up.”

“Today, the Liberals got together and voted against giving her the chance to say it,” Poilievre told reporters. “You know, this is a cavalcade of contradictions and cover-up.”

Parliament has been seized by the SNC-Lavalin affair for nearly two months now, after The Globe and Mail published an allegation on Feb. 7 that Wilson-Raybould had been politically pressured while attorney general to intervene and defer the corruption prosecution of the construction company.

Toronto MP Nate Erskine-Smith was the only Liberal who spoke during the ethics committee meeting. Although Erskine-Smith has a track record of challenging the party line, and had even previously cast a vote in favour of holding a public inquiry on the matter, he told the committee he felt launching the study was premature.

He noted Wilson-Raybould planned to provide a written submission to the justice committee that included further evidence, including text messages and emails.

“To me, it makes far more sense to see what is said in that public statement, to see how justice (committee) reacts to that, frankly, and whether they think any of that new information is something worth reconsidering their previous decision to close off their study,” Erskine-Smith said.

The NDP’s Tracey Ramsey rejected that, saying the Liberals blocked multiple attempts to keep the investigation going. “No one in Canada believes that the justice committee is going to revisit that,” she said. “There is absolutely no indication that they will entertain any further conversation.”

The Conservatives offered an amendment to call Wilson-Raybould only after her submission to the justice committee, but Erskine-Smith said it was too early to make decisions before seeing what she provided. It is not known when Wilson-Raybould will make her submission, but justice committee chair Anthony Housefather has said it will be made public.

Erskine-Smith also pointed out that Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion is already studying the matter, and said the committee should support Dion’s study rather than launch a parallel process.

Finally, Erskine-Smith argued that the waiver provided by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Wilson-Raybould on cabinet confidence privilege and solicitor-client privilege only covered testimony to the justice committee, not the ethics committee.

That waiver has become its own source of conflict, however. Wilson-Raybould has pointed out it does not apply to events after she was removed as justice minister, and opposition parties have demanded Trudeau provide an expanded waiver to cover that time period. Philpott also said in an interview in Maclean’s magazine last week that there was “much more to the story that should be told.”

This breach of the confidentiality of what is supposed to be a highly confidential judicial appointment process is serious enough to require an investigation on its own

After the meeting, while other Liberal MPs left without making their position clear, Erskine-Smith stayed and said he believed an expanded waiver may be necessary — depending what Wilson-Raybould’s evidence to the justice committee showed.

“If still, to get at the truth, there is additional information that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott need to provide that they are unable to provide because of the confines of the existing waiver, then yes, to get at the truth there should be a broadening of that waiver,” he said.

He said he believed that was only a fair position, given the comments from some of his colleagues that “we should get all of this information out in the open as quickly as possible and deal with it and move on.”

Both the Conservatives and NDP — and even Erskine-Smith — condemned two stories that came out Monday that contained leaks about the Supreme Court of Canada appointment process. The stories cited confidential sources to allege that tension had arisen between Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould when she recommended the appointment of Glenn Joyal, a Manitoba judge who Trudeau felt to be too conservative.

“This breach of the confidentiality of what is supposed to be a highly confidential judicial appointment process is serious enough to require an investigation on its own,” said Conservative MP Peter Kent during the meeting.

Speaking earlier in the day, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau did not respond directly when asked by a reporter whether his office leaked the story.

“Canadians can have confidence in our government’s respect for the institutions, for the Supreme Court,” he said. “Canadians have confidence in the strength of our judiciary in this country. And I have no further comment to make on this issue.”

VANCOUVER—Though British Columbia should be fertile ground for the Liberals to grow support ahead of October’s general election, the party’s biggest asset in 2015 is now its biggest liability: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Brown’s comments follow a new Research Co. poll released on Tuesday that found a majority of British Columbians believe a new party leader would be better. A third of B.C. residents who voted for the Liberals in 2015 also believe a different party leader would do things better in Ottawa than Trudeau.

“As long as Trudeau is their leader, the party is bound to suffer big time.”

“B.C. is critical to the Liberals’ fortunes, as their strength in Quebec seems to be waning and in Atlantic Canada they’re grossly under attack. They have to look for where they can gain seats,” Brown said in an interview.

And that animosity toward Canada’s current prime minister is pervasive across the province, though strongest outside of the Metro Vancouver region, said Mario Canseco, president of Research Co.

“That’s the danger the Liberals are facing,” Canseco said. “This is more worrisome in urban areas where you can see people gravitate more to the NDP, which places a lot of seats in jeopardy.”

Meanwhile, half of British Columbians think a different party is needed to lead in Ottawa. Notably, a majority of all age groups polled — from millennials to boomers and beyond — felt that way, as well as a quarter of 2015 Liberal voters.

Prior to 2015, the Liberal party held two seats in British Columbia. But after “Trudeaumania” took the country, the Liberals went from third place in the House of Commons to holding a majority government. Now, they hold 17 seats in B.C.

Canseco questioned whether they could sustain that momentum.

And while there wasn’t much of a gender gap in 2015, men are now more likely to be critical and dissatisfied with the Liberals.

Canseco is closely following the millennial reaction to Trudeau, as the previous election saw a significant spike in the youth vote. For Canseco, the big question ahead of the fall election will be exactly where those votes go.

“It’s no longer the idea of Trudeau as a great unifier, and if they find a shinier object out there, will they support it?” he said. “If you’re disenchanted because of environmental decisions, or maybe electoral reform, or the SNC-Lavalin affair, do you stay home or vote Green or NDP?”

Poll results were based on an online study from March 8 to 10 among 800 adults in B.C., with a margin of error of +/- 3.5 percentage points 19 times out of 20.

Left-leaning progressives offended by the SNC-Lavalin affair may be tempted to vote for the NDP or Greens, Brown said, while centre-right leaning and “swing Liberals” will now be swayed to vote Conservative.

Disenchantment with Trudeau — particularly in B.C. — has risen because he has “failed” on so many files, according to Brown, such as proportional representation, balancing the budget, reconciliation and the purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline.

“(All that has) dramatically reduced his party’s fortunes in Greater Vancouver on progressive, environmentally conscious voters,” he said. “On so many files, he’s proven himself to be the opposite of what he purports to be.”

Braeden Caley, a Liberal party spokesperson, says Trudeau and the Liberals are focused on a strong plan for British Columbians “to build more affordable housing, invest in better roads and transit, grow the economy and protect a healthier environment for our kids and grandkids.”

A decline in support for the Liberals is exaggerated, according to Caley. He says grassroots support for the party continues to grow.

“More than 15,000 British Columbians have singed up as new Liberals in the past two years alone,” he said in an email. “The Liberal party is also continuing to be approached by a variety of talented community leaders interested in becoming Team Trudeau candidates throughout British Columbia, building on the strong growth that we’ve seen in our B.C. team and caucus in recent years.”

Brown has been publicly calling for Trudeau to step down to improve the Liberal party’s chances in October, amid the ongoing SNC-Lavalin affair which he said has “dramatically undercut” Trudeau’s personal brand of having the ethical high-ground.

He predicts an RCMP probe on the matter in the near future and told the Star the Liberal party will only have a chance in October if they find a new leader. Brown said that would be in their best “political self-interest,” especially with the support of Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott.

“If they went into an election with those two women behind them saying we’re cleaning up our act and we mean it,” Brown said, “it would suddenly turn the table and make the new Liberal leader potentially the voice of a new ethical government instead of the opposite.”

Trudeau’s response? “I apologize, and it was a chocolate bar.”

By Canadian Press on March 26, 2019.

CALGARY – Another United Conservative Party candidate who has pulled out of the Alberta election says someone outside the party is threatening to release her past social media comments about Muslim refugees and transgender washrooms in schools.

Eva Kiryakos, who was running in Calgary-South East in the April 16 vote, announced her resignation in a Facebook statement and video released Sunday night.

Kiryakos said she’s been getting threats from someone who wants to release images of things she has said or commented on.

“Someone outside of our party has been threatening to smear me, and I have had enough of the bullies and the threats,” she said in the statement. “This is who I am and I will keep speaking up – for myself and for Albertans.”

In one of the online exchanges, Kiryakos retweeted an article about Germany’s alleged migrant rape crisis called “Rapefugees Not Welcome.”

She said in her statement that everyone retweets and shares articles.

“I admit the image on the article isn’t positive,” she said. “But the article was on women getting raped and the crisis there. When women are being assaulted, I care, no matter the faiths or the backgrounds of the people.”

In another post, Kiryakos wrote about transgender washrooms in Alberta schools. “I should have the right to choose for my children to not be brainwashed into accepting perversions as ‘alternative lifestyles.”’

In her statement, she said she was concerned for her daughter’s safety and voiced her honest opinion.

“It’s OK to disagree.”

UCP Leader Jason Kenney said he appreciates her decision to step down and put the party first. He did not specifically comment on the social media posts.

“I’ve always been clear that the United Conservative Party is a big-tent coalition that respects human dignity and will protect the rights of people regardless of how they pray or who they love,” he said.

“Eva’s also from a minority community herself. She is from a Middle Eastern refugee family, from a community that has faced a history of genocide.”

Kiryakos, a lawyer and mother of two, said she came to Canada as a child with her parents after they fled persecution for their Christian faith in Iraq. She said she was raised in Saskatchewan and taught to speak up and practise her right to freedom of speech.

Last week, Calgary UCP candidate Caylan Ford stepped down after publication of a private 2017 Facebook conversation in which she allegedly spoke about the replacement of white people in their homelands and the collapse of western culture.

Ford has degrees from three universities, including Oxford, and once worked as a policy adviser for what is now Global Affairs Canada under the Harper government. She was considered a star candidate.

At the time, NDP Leader Rachel Notley said she was shocked by Ford’s comments. She said she doesn’t believe Kenney is a racist but that the UCP has a problem with racism.

On Monday, she told reporters that the problem isn’t about the UCP not properly vetting candidates.

“I think this is about the leadership,” she said.

“This is not in my mind, a good look for anybody who is seeking to represent Albertans in the legislature and to lead this province.”

People’s Party Leader Maxime Bernier says it’s party policy not to comment on tragic events in other countries in the wake of criticism over his response to the deadly massacre at two mosques in New Zealand.

Mr. Bernier said at a press conference on Parliament Hill Monday morning that he is not “playing politics” with tragedies and accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of exploiting the massacre by continuing to talk about the tragic event.

“I said what I have to say on Twitter and I think I was very clear about that. That’s our policy,” he said Monday.

When asked what he would say to those who accuse him of stoking hate and fear by not condemning the massacre, he said, “I said to everybody that if you want to be part of this party, if you want to be members of this party, you must share our values.”

“So people who don’t share our values, they can create their own party. They’re not welcome in our party.”

Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners Suddenly, New Attention for List of Harper-Era Abuses Traffic surges for Tyee’s 2015 compilation of 70 Tory law and ethics breaches.

That piece is “Harper: Serial Abuser of Power, The Evidence Compiled: The Tyee’s full, updated list of 70 Harper government assaults on democracy and the law.”

You can find it here.

The article lists dozens of serious abuses of power racked up by former prime minister Stephen Harper and his Conservatives from the time they formed government in 2006 until the date the article was published, Aug. 10, 2015.

The list was not concerned with Tory laws, policies or positions disagreeable to people whose politics don’t lean right.

Instead, The Tyee defined abuses of power to be the opposite of good government, acts ranging from “scams to smears, monkey-wrenching opponents to intimidating public servants… some offences are criminal, others just offend human decency.”

The article drew on suggestions from Tyee readers as well as journalists. Each carefully researched item in the list is linked to credible journalistic sources, including newspapers such as the National Post and the Globe and Mail whose editorial boards had backed the Conservatives in the previous election, and would do so in the fall of 2015.

The article quickly became one of The Tyee’s most read ever, and was one of the most widely read pieces by any news organization covering the federal election. After the contest was won by the Justin Trudeau-led Liberals, traffic for the article faded and it resided in The Tyee’s digital archives.

With another election coming, Trudeau and his party deny improper pressure was applied to former minister of justice and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould in hopes of stopping a criminal trial of Montreal-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board president Jane Pilpott, who say the political interference was real, have resigned from cabinet. Trudeau’s top advisor Gerald Butts and Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick have quit their posts, as well.

After Wilson-Raybould gave testimony to the House justice committee on Feb. 27, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh called for an independent investigation into the affair.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer was more aggressive, demanding that Trudeau step down.

Trudeau had “lost the moral authority to govern,” he charged, and was a “prime minister who allows his partisan, political motivations to overrule his duty to uphold the rule of law. A prime minister who doesn’t know where the Liberal Party ends and where the government of Canada begins.”

Perhaps not coincidentally, that’s when The Tyee’s rap sheet on the last Conservative government began gaining a lot of new readers.

In the past month, the piece has received more than 14,000 page views, a near 2,000-per-cent jump over this time last year. Its numbers topped almost all other Tyee stories this month.

Who is suddenly reading and sharing the article and why?

It’s not hard to imagine why members of both the federal Liberals and NDP would find it apt to promote. The Liberals could point to the bad record of the Conservatives as evidence they were just as scandal-plagued when in power, or more so. The NDP might offer the piece to people souring on the Liberals as proof their party offers a cleaner alternative to the Tories.

Scheer was a Conservative MP throughout the Harper government, rising high in its ranks before becoming House speaker. He was first elected as a Saskatchewan MP in 2004, after accusing his opponent of being soft on child pornography because, in Commons debate, he’d warned against censoring art such as Nabokov’s novel Lolita.

A recent tweet by Tyee web director Bryan Carney noted the article has been popular of late.

Keywords like “did Stephen Harper break campaign rules”, “Harper + ethics violations”, “Harper government members with criminal convictions”, “Harper government scandals” and “what lies did Harper tell the Canadian people” started to show up from Google traffic.

Next, the traffic started to arrive from social media.

Author: Sean Rehaag, Associate Professor, Osgoode Hall Law School, York University, Canada

According to media reports, Bill Blair, Canada’s minister of border security, is attempting to close a loophole in the Canada-U.S. Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA).

The agreement allows Canada to send asylum-seekers back to the United States without hearing their refugee claims (and allows the U.S. the same option for those going in the other direction). The loophole is that the STCA only applies to asylum-seekers who present themselves at official land ports-of-entry.

Since President Donald Trump was elected, around 40,000 asylum seekers have used this loophole by crossing into Canada from the U.S. at places other than official ports-of-entry. They are not trying to sneak into Canada undetected. Rather, they cross the border irregularly to avoid being turned away under the STCA and then approach Canadian authorities to make refugee claims.

The number of irregular border-crossers has declined recently, with fewer than 1,000 in January 2019. What’s more, while the overall number of refugee claims made in Canada has been higher than usual in the past two years, it is not far off historical norms.

Nonetheless, the additional 40,000 refugee claims have produced pressures on the refugee determination system and on provincial social programs. There has also been political pushback, with calls from the Conservative party for the government to stem the flow.

However, closing the STCA loophole is a complicated proposition.

Blair reportedly wants irregular border-crossers to be taken to official ports-of-entry and processed as if they had presented themselves there directly. In other words, the STCA would apply both at official ports-of-entry and elsewhere.

To make this work, the U.S. would need to agree, which is the first complication.

More asylum-seekers come to Canada

The purpose of the STCA from a Canadian perspective was to force the U.S. to take responsibility for asylum-seekers who travel to Canada via the United States. Canada had long wanted the STCA because the flow of asylum-seekers is asymmetrical. Far more asylum-seekers come to Canada from the U.S. than the reverse.

For the same reason, the United States has long refused to agree to the STCA. That only changed after 9-11, when Canada offered the U.S. greater border security integration in exchange for the STCA.

Canada now wants to expand the STCA, so the question is: What will Canada have to give the U.S. to get them to agree?

One might expect quite a lot, given that Trump has shown little interest in taking steps that would result in thousands of asylum-seekers who would otherwise go to Canada remaining in the U.S.

The need for a quid pro quo raises a second complication. The STCA is being challenged in Canadian courts by human rights organizations who say that the U.S. is not safe for refugees and that the STCA violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Given the anti-refugee policies of the Trump administration, there is a good chance that courts will strike down the STCA. By negotiating expansions to the STCA without waiting to see whether the regime is upheld, there is a real risk that anything Canada gives to the U.S. in exchange will be for naught.

A third complication: Even if Canada gets the U.S. to agree to expand the STCA, and even if the regime is upheld by the courts, the impact of any expansion is likely to be both counterproductive and dangerous.

A dangerous incentive

If asylum-seekers who are intercepted at irregular border crossings are returned to the U.S., this will create a strong incentive for such asylum-seekers to cross the border without being intercepted.

Currently, irregular border crossings are manageable and organized. Most occur in a single, well-monitored location in Quebec. That crossing is not dangerous. Border officials and RCMP are present. Irregular border-crossers immediately enter into immigration and refugee processing, which includes health, criminality and security screening.

Other countries that have tried to stem flows of asylum-seekers by closing off safe and manageable routes have had a common experience. The flows do not stop but are instead diverted into more remote and hence more dangerous routes. Organized crime gets involved, bringing increased security risks and violence. The inevitable result is lost lives and decreased border security.

In the end, the political pressure on the government to be seen doing something on this file may outweigh these policy considerations. But politics lead to a fourth complication.

During the last federal election campaign, Justin Trudeau distinguished himself from former prime minister Stephen Harper partly through a more compassionate response to the Syrian refugee crisis and the death of Alan Kurdi — himself a tragic victim of cat-and-mouse games between smugglers and governments seeking to keep refugees at bay.

Shortly after Trump’s inauguration, Prime Minister Trudeau further sought the moral high ground when, in response to the president’s anti-refugee policies, he famously tweeted Canadians will welcome those fleeing persecution.

There is no way to close the STCA loophole without the Liberal party turning its back on those progressive values, on the eve of a federal election campaign.

In this context, attempting to expand the STCA may not only be bad policy, it may also be bad politics.

B.C.'s John Horgan finds himself among Canada's most popular premiers, according to a new poll.

The poll conducted by the Angus Reid Institute has Horgan sitting in the third most popular position behind Quebec Premier François Legault and Saskatchewan's, Scott Moe.

British Columbia Premier John Horgan received the approval of more than half of B.C., earning the backing of 52 per cent of B.C. residents. Thats an increase of 9 percentage points since December, when four-in-ten or 43 per cent approved of his performance. The current number ties Horgan’s highest mark as premier, which was set in March 2018.

Most premiers have seen their standing among their own constituencies improve – or at least hold – since December. The two exceptions are Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s approval drops four points this quarter to 38 per cent.

Alberta’s Rachel Notley, currently seeking a second term as Alberta premier, faces long odds ahead of the April 16 election day. Recent polls, including one released by the Angus Reid Institute, have consistently pointed to a substantial lead for the opposition United Conservative Party.

""On the big things that will reduce our climate pollution, allow Canada to fulfil its role under the Paris agreement and show the poorer countries of the world that are suffering ...","

Allison Jones, The Canadian Press





TORONTO -- Ontario's environmental commissioner issued dire warnings Wednesday about the ""frightening"" state of climate policy in the province as she delivered her office's last report.

The Progressive Conservative government announced last fall that it was eliminating the office of the environmental commissioner and merging its functions with the auditor general. In delivering a report on energy conservation, Dianne Saxe said Ontario is heading in the wrong direction on the environment.

""At a time when climate damage is accelerating, Ontario is turning away from the things that we know work,"" she said, describing the government's climate policy as ""very inadequate, very frightening.""

""On the big things that will reduce our climate pollution, allow Canada to fulfil its role under the Paris agreement and show the poorer countries of the world that are suffering the greater damage that we are going to do our part, we are causing great damage.""

Saxe is critical of the government's cancellation of a cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gases, as well as the cancellation of electricity conservation programs and a growth plan that she says increases urban sprawl and therefore reliance on transportation fuels.

""I think that what we're doing in Ontario and what we may do in Canada this year puts the entire Paris Agreement at risk,"" she said, referring to the federal Conservatives' opposition to the upcoming carbon tax.

""If the world can't hold together on the Paris Agreement we are toasted, roasted and grilled.""

The 2015 Paris Agreement sets a target of keeping average global temperatures from rising by more than 2 C, or 1.5 C if possible.

Saxe was critical of the government's recent cancellation of a slew of electricity conservation programs, including rebates for energy-efficient heating and cooling equipment, discounts for buying energy-efficient products such as LED light bulbs, incentives for builders to improve energy performance in new residences, and refrigeration equipment upgrade incentives.

Since 2007, Ontario has made valuable progress in conserving electricity and some progress in conserving natural gas, and without those programs the province would be emitting about six megatonnes more each year in carbon dioxide equivalents, she said.

The government's environment plan doesn't even mention electricity conservation, Saxe said, and abandoning it would increase greenhouse gas emissions from electricity by about two megatonnes.

Environment Minister Rod Phillips said his climate plan will produce a 30 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, the target set by the federal government, without a carbon tax -- which the province continues to rail against.

Phillips said the plan focuses conservation efforts on natural gas instead of electricity.

""We're adding conservation programs around areas that actually produce greenhouse gases, like natural gas production,"" he said. ""The conservation programs related to electricity largely are affecting programs that come from our electricity grid, which because of nuclear power, because of renewables, because of hydro, doesn't produce a great deal of greenhouse gas.""

NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said reports and comments like the ones Wednesday from the environmental commissioner are why the government got rid of Saxe's office.

""They don't want to hear what it takes and what's necessary to meet greenhouse gas emission reduction targets,"" she said. ""Instead, they just want to continue along their merry way and not take seriously our responsibilities when it comes to climate change.""

Green party Leader Mike Schreiner called it a ""tragic loss"" to no longer have a standalone officer to report on facts and evidence that members of the legislature need to make sound policy decisions.

Premier Doug Ford had promised that not a single job would be lost under his government, but Saxe said this move has meant 12 people are losing their jobs.","State of Ontario's climate policy is 'frightening,' watchdog says",CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/state-of-ontario-s-climate-policy-is-frightening-watchdog-says-1.4354564

Because it’s not only in Canada that you can ...,"We have learned so much. Within minutes Monday afternoon, two good reporters had stories (here and here) about the Chief Justice of Manitoba, who was a candidate to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada and who, later, wasn’t. Both reporters unfurled similar yarns about a lone Prime Minister standing athwart the tide of conservatism by blocking—shudder—a Harper appointee from sitting on the top court. Jody Wilson-Raybould plays the role of villain in the piece.

Both reporters decorously neglect to mention that Trudeau’s choice for Chief Justice, Richard Wagner, was a Harper appointee.

There are many things we can say about this story, working outward in concentric rings from the thing itself. First, Glenn Joyal’s views, as expressed in speeches that were said to alarm the prime minister, are almost comically orthodox. I first became aware of the notion that Charter litigation systematically airlifts important matters from the parliamentary arena and into the realm of jurisprudence in a Chantal Hébert column in the late 1990s. If I had paid more attention to literally any of my Canadian public administration profs a decade earlier I would have caught the argument then, because it is canvassed in every Canadian political science class. This is not wild-eyed Hayekism.

Second, perhaps the many thousands of Canadians who have applied for federal government appointments under what they thought was a confidential process, introduced by this prime minister, will want to contemplate a class-action suit against him. Because it is now radiantly clear to each of them that their CV is being held hostage by a claque of embattled sorcerers’ apprentices who will cheerfully wheel it over the transom to any waiting scribe if anything about them—their opinions, a fallen political star’s unfortunate decision to argue for their advancement—becomes politically inconvenient. This is the very stuff of the police state.

It was immediately fashionable to wonder on social media how everyone would react if Stephen Harper had done such a thing. It’s germane to note that Stephen Harper never did. Because he had more class. Welcome to the Tet offensive of Charter rights: This was the week it became necessary to destroy the village of good government in order to save it.

Third, Justice Joyal’s wife was in poor health. Apparently we are to believe that 9,000 jobs depended on your knowing that.

If the Trudeau government is not the source of the leak, I assume we will see spectacular efforts deployed in the next 36 hours to find the leaker. Mark Norman-scale efforts. But I’m pretty sure that we needn’t hold our breath, because the government is the source of the leak; that the amiable chap who currently sits in the office once occupied by the Attorney General of Canada will not bestir himself to question Monday’s sickening attack on due process; and that the leak will actually be roundly applauded by the ambient cloud of Liberal and Liberal-adjacent opinion, which became self-aware this weekend and decided Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott are a virus endangering the party’s re-election chances and must therefore be stopped.

That’s right, it’s Judgment Day. As early as March 5, it was possible for Andrew Cohen to publish a column identifying Philpott and Wilson-Raybould as enemies of the (right-thinking) people. But not for the first time, Andrew was ahead of the moment, and when that column ran, he found few takers. The news that the Criminal Code had been amended in ways SNC-Lavalin found congenial as it faced a criminal trial for serious alleged misdeeds was interesting to millions of Canadians, including many Liberals. Justin Trudeau’s slow, tentative response was worrisome to lots of people who support the government, just as it was to many others. It was still possible for many minds to find room for both general support for Liberal re-election and general interest in what Wilson-Raybould and Philpott — recent Liberal rock stars, after all — had to say.

Then Maclean’s published my interview with Philpott last Thursday morning. On Thursday night’s At Issue panel, Chantal said that with Gerald Butts and Michael Wernick no longer working in government, Philpott and Wilson-Raybould were clearly looking for someone else to lose a job, and it must be Justin Trudeau. This interpretation became popular quickly (and probably would have even if Chantal hadn’t given it voice). By Saturday it was easy to find Liberals and friends of Liberals — pollsters, the odd political scientist, about half the party’s Ontario caucus — attributing the worst motives to the two former ministers. They were “infatuated with ephemeral attention,” said Frank Graves. They were committing “an attempted coup d’état,” wrote a lawyer with impressive credentials, Ishat Reza. This behaviour is, she added, “disqualifying.” This is understatement: Historical penalties for coup plotting have been harsher than exclusion from a governing caucus.

Qui veut noyer son chien l’accuse de la rage, we say in Quebec. When you want to drown your dog you say it has rabies.

This SNC-Lavalin business has been bewildering — honestly bewildering, in ways that are surely easy to understand — for many Canadians with good hearts since it began. It is an odd scandal by many standards. No money changed hands illegally, or at least not after the Qaddafis were executed. None of the assorted Liberal staffers and high officials who came at Jody Wilson-Raybould was seeking personal advancement, except insofar as many of them wanted to be on the winning side in an election and, she asserts, kept telling her so. They kept asking whether she’d seek outside advice on a decision that was the public prosecutor’s to make and the AG’s to review. When they were done asking, the prosecutor’s decision held. That would have been the end of that, if she hadn’t been shuffled. Then it became a duel of assertions and interpretations.

It’s easy to understand why all of this would seem minor and technical. An interesting theological debating point, but surely not worth more than a month of headlines and anguished commentary. So it didn’t get real, for many people, until Conservatives took the lead from Liberals in the polls — and Jane Philpott, whom Trudeau had been busy promoting in cabinet, announced that she too doesn’t like whatever she says she knows.

This puts the stakes high indeed. Everything Trudeau advocates is endangered, not by his own increasingly conspicuous limitations as a public administrator, but by the shorter route of a possible Conservative election victory this autumn. So it is all Liberal hands on deck. All of this is easy to understand.

I felt something like this was coming when I wrote, near the bottom of a column I wrote last November that was published in December, that an election is “the crudest possible instrument” for fixing serious shortcomings in public administration. It’s simply not true that if you don’t like something a government does you must replace it. But nor should re-electing the Liberals mean endorsing Justin Trudeau’s increasingly obvious flaws. The issues raised by the SNC-Lavalin controversy shouldn’t be settled by an election. Some misdeeds are worth dealing with as themselves, when they come up. And then let the election settle the election.

What is at stake in this affair is whether you can get the rules changed in mid-stream if you have the right friends or can hire them. Whether the decisions of competent professionals — beginning with an experienced prosecutor and defence lawyer, Kathleen Roussel — should be trumped by appeals to a preferred electoral outcome. This sort of system-rigging has been at the heart of, for instance, Poland’s confrontation with the European Union over judicial “reforms” that systematically benefit associates of the current regime. Reforms that are immensely popular among people who agree with the ruling party that they tilt the balance back toward fairness in a confrontation against political opponents they judge to be moral failures. Because it’s not only in Canada that you can win many arguments by saying, “Of course this helps our side, but that’s okay because our side is right.”

There’s a neat symmetry here. Jody Wilson-Raybould claimed she was approached, again and again, by people who said things had to work out a certain way because it was an election year. The emerging Liberal argument this month has been, not that this claim was untrue, but that of course it is true and should be. Wilson-Raybould and Philpott have sinned against a higher virtue so sure of itself that it cannot be troubled with the fine print. This sin is deemed disqualifying. They will soon be disqualified by their fellow Liberals, for the (synonymous) good of the party and the nation. And if you’ve sent your CV to Ottawa, have no fear. It probably won’t get leaked until it needs to be.

Eva Kiryakos, the United Conservative Party candidate for the riding of Calgary – South East, announced in a Facebook post on Sunday that she was pulling herself from the race.

The post was accompanied by a video showing Kiryakos explaining why she had ended her candidacy, stating that she had been receiving threats from “someone outside of our party” that posts she had made in the past would be brought to light.

“I’ve had to wrestle with this for a while, but I decided I am going to speak up and communicate openly,” she wrote in the post.

“This video was filmed in my living room and yes, I am reading off a script, but these words are from my heart. Someone outside of our party has been threatening to smear me, and I have had enough of the bullies and the threats. This is who I am and I will keep speaking up — for myself and for Albertans. This video, done by me, will serve as my statement.”

The video shows Kiryakos speaking to a camera in her home, beginning with her stating that she had been scared of what would happen if photos of her past online activity were leaked.

“I have been getting threats from someone who wants to release images of things I’ve said or commented on in the past. At first, I was scared of this person, scared that my fellow candidates would be affected, scared that people would take my comments out of context, label me, or attack me on social media. Let’s be honest — politics can get really ugly sometimes,” she said in the video.

“Then I remembered why I am in Alberta and how I got here. My parents fled religious persecutions in Iraq where they were not free to live their faith or express their views. We came to Canada as refugees, I was born a refugee. Growing up in Saskatchewan I was taught as a little girl to speak up and practice my free speech because I could. And that is what I did in these examples.”

Kiryakos shows the online activity in the video, explaining that she retweeted an article titled “Germany’s (Muslim) Migrant Rape Crisis Spirals out of Control” with a photo of a sign reading “RAPEUGEES NOT WELCOME.”

She noted that, while the image on the article “isn’t positive,” she stood by retweeting it because “when women are being assaulted, I care. No matter the faiths or backgrounds of the people.”

She also showed a response she wrote during a Twitter discussion in which she disagreed with the Alberta Teachers’ Association trans-gender-inclusive guidelines, saying that “I should have the right for my child to choose not to be brainwashed into accepting perversions as ‘alternative lifestyles.'”

In defence of the tweet, she said that she was worried about her daughters’ safety in the schools’ washrooms, calling the transwomen who would potentially be using the facilities, “grown men.”

“The possibility of a grown man sharing a washroom with the little girl, to me, is a perversion,” she said in the video.

She also stated that her use of the term “alternative lifestyle” to describe transgendered people was due to the people she was talking to also using that term.

Kirykos ended the video by firmly stating that she would not give up her right to free speech or her ability to voice her opinions openly. She also called for an end to what she described to be a “culture of bullying people who have different opinions, backgrounds, faiths, cultures, genders, and identities.”

“Sure, I make comments, and voice my opinions on issues. You don’t have to agree with them — that’s the beauty of free speech and democracy,” she said.

“We teach our girls to stop being silent, to speak their mind, and yet I am here feeling silenced and cornered because I voiced my opinion and spoke up for what I believed in.”

Kiryakos isn’t the first UCP candidate to drop out of the race due to online activity, as Calgary – Mountain View’s Caylan Ford resigned shortly after Facebook messages were leaked in which Ford allegedly echoed sentiments held by white supremacists.

Canadians watch Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election comfortable in the belief that such foreign interference couldn’t happen here.

Except it did happen here.

And while the Russians adamantly deny interference in American political affairs, the perpetrators of interference in the 2015 Canadian federal election not only devised and executed a plan aimed at helping to elect the party friendly to their cause, they publicly trumpeted their success in achieving just that. And then they got a huge bonus when one of their most fervent comrades was appointed to the most powerful non-elected position in the country.

This story has all the elements of a fiction novel. But it’s not fiction.

Piece by meticulously researched piece, independent researcher Vivian Krause spent almost 10 years unveiling the information. Every detail has been corroborated by sources, including American and Canadian tax records, together with documents and statements from the perpetrators themselves.

The story begins in 2008, when a group of radical American anti-fossil-fuel environmental organizations created Tar Sands Campaign Strategy 2.1 designed “to landlock the Canadian oilsands by delaying or blocking the expansion or development of key pipelines.”

A list of key strategic targets included: “educating and organizing First Nations to challenge construction of pipelines across their traditional territories” and bringing “multiple actions in Canadian federal and provincial courts.” A “raising the negatives” section includes recruiting celebrity spokespersons such as Leonardo DiCaprio to “lend their brand to opponents of tar sands and generating a high negative media profile for tar sands oil.”

Executing such a massive intrusion into Canadian affairs would take years and a large amount of money. Ironically, much of that anti-oil money came from the legacy of the man who founded the U.S. oil industry, John D. Rockefeller. Joining the Rockefeller Foundation were the two legacy foundations of Hewlett-Packard co-founders William Hewlett and David Packard.

These foundations, together with other American anti-fossil-fuel charities, poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the U.S.-based Tides Foundation, a murky organization that serves as a legal money launderer, receiving donations from other foundations and redistributing the funds without revealing sources.

Since American and Canadian tax laws require charities to document receipt and disbursement of funds, Krause was able to gather irrefutable evidence that tens of millions of dollars were transferred from Tides U.S. to its Tides Canada subsidiary. Moreover, the resourceful Krause obtained 70 covering letters showing recipients and use of the funds.

The largest portion the funds were directed at raising fears of oil spills among First Nations, including seven payments to help build “indigenous solidarity resistance to pipeline routes,” maintain “opposition to oil tankers” and to “provide legal support for actions constraining tar sands development.”

Funding also went to the Great Bear Initiative to build support for designating the so-called Spirit Bear habitat a nature reserve. Those initiatives resulted in the successful court appeal by First Nations suspending approval by the former government of Stephen Harper of Enbridge’s Northern Gateway Pipeline.

Then came Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s lamentable decision to disallow oil pipelines through the Great Bear Rainforest, along with a north-coast tanker ban, driving the final nails into the coffin of Northern Gateway.

Other payments include: the Pembina Institute to “advance … the narrative that oil sands expansion is problematic;” Greenpeace Canada “for events to show opposition to pipelines and tar sands expansion;” the Living Oceans Society “to build opposition to the Kinder Morgan pipeline” and Forest Ethics “to conduct education and outreach opposing the Kinder Morgan and Northern Gateway pipelines.”

The American anti-oilsands funding didn’t stop at encouraging opposition to oil pipelines. The Victoria-based Dogwood Initiative, one of the most politically active organizations in the country, received millions of dollars from Tides Canada to run get-the-vote out campaigns in the 2017 B.C. provincial election, including deployment of thousands of campaign workers in Green Party Leader Andrew Weaver’s riding. Without his election, the anti-Trans Mountain NDP/Green coalition wouldn’t have gained power.

At the federal level, money was funnelled directly to campaign activists working to help the Liberals win the 2015 election. Vancouver based non-profit society Leadnow, directly and through the B.C.-based Sisu Institute, received more than $1 million from Tides Canada with the express objective of defeating the pro-oil industry Harper Conservatives. The society claims its campaigners helped defeat Conservative candidates in 25 ridings.

Given that no new export pipelines have been built in the 10 years since their anti-oilsands campaign began, one must conclude that the American organizations have been spectacularly successful. But all that funding directed at First Nations and other anti-pipeline activist campaigns wouldn’t have been nearly so effective without the election of an ideologically anti-fossil-fuel government in Ottawa.

Until recently, the anti-tar sands website contained the following statement by campaign quarterback Michael Marx: “The controversy from the campaign contributed to political victories at the provincial and national level in 2015 and led to bold climate commitments by Canadian leaders.” Realizing the implications of Marx’s statement, it was removed following a revealing expose aired in the Jan. 20 edition of CBC’s The Weekly hosted by Wendy Mesley. It’s very much worth watching.

Election of the anti-fossil fuel Trudeau government would have been ample cause for a victory celebration. But the campaigners received a bonus beyond their wildest dreams when one of their most dedicated eco-warriors was appointed principal secretary to the prime minister, the most powerful post in the prime minister’s office. From 2008 to 2012, Gerald Butts was president and CEO of World Wildlife Fund Canada (WWF), an important Tides campaign partner.

Butts used his position in the PMO to bring other former campaigners with him. Mario Reynolds, Environment Minister Catherine McKenna’s chief of staff, is past executive director of the Pembina Institute, recipient of substantial Tides funding. Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi’s chief of staff is also a former WWF Canada official and Sarah Goodman, policy adviser to the prime minister, is a former VP of Tides Canada.

With these people at the epicentre of power, it’s no wonder the oil industry, and the hundreds of thousands of people it employed, has plummeted into political and policy purgatory.

Now Butts, the mastermind behind that economic, social and national unity disaster, has resigned. But there’s more disturbing news. I was startled to learn that Butts received two separate payments from WWF Canada totalling $361,642 during his first two years at the PMO.

In a May 26, 2016 tweet to a question from Krause, Butts responds: “It was my contract severance.”

Over my entire career leading one of Canada’s largest companies and serving as a director of four others, I have never heard of severance paid when someone decided to quit their job. But then, given that he was receiving those payments from WWF Canada while at the PMO, one might conclude that he never really changed jobs. He just combined the old and new ones together.

That, fellow Canadians, is the story that never could have been told without the determination of a real Canadian patriot who dedicated 10 years searching for the truth.

THE CANADIAN PRESS

OTTAWA-Jody Wilson-Raybould recommended in 2017 that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau nominate a conservative Manitoba judge to be chief justice of the Supreme Court, even though he wasn’t a sitting member of the top court and had been a vocal critic of its activism on Charter of Rights issues, The Canadian Press has learned.

Well-placed sources say the former justice minister’s choice for chief justice was a moment of “significant disagreement’’ with Trudeau, who has touted the Liberals as “the party of the charter’’ and whose late father, Pierre Trudeau, spearheaded the drive to enshrine the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in the Constitution in 1982.

The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal discussions about a Supreme Court appointment, which are typically considered highly confidential.

For her part, Wilson-Raybould said Monday “there was no conflict between the PM and myself.’’

In an email, she characterized the matter as part of the normal process of appointing a Supreme Court justice, which involves “typically CONFIDENTIAL conversations and communications, back and forths between the PM and the AG (attorney general) on potential candidates for appointment.’’

She said she’s “not at liberty to comment’’ on the “veracity’’ of what the sources said occurred, adding, “Commentary/reporting in this regard with respect to a SCC appointment(s) could compromise the integrity of the appointments process and potentially sitting justices.’’

The issue suggests Trudeau may have had reasons unrelated to the SNC-Lavalin affair for moving Wilson-Raybould out of the prestigious Justice portfolio earlier this year, a cabinet shuffle that touched off a full-blown political crisis for the governing Liberals.

Wilson-Raybould has said she believes she was moved to Veterans Affairs as punishment for refusing to intervene to stop a criminal prosecution of the Montreal engineering giant on bribery charges related to contracts in Libya.

Trudeau has denied the SNC matter had anything to do with the decision.

She resigned a month later amid allegations she was improperly pressured by the Prime Minister’s Office to interfere in the SNC-Lavalin case, triggering a furor that has engulfed the Trudeau government ever since.

The issue, the sources say, arose after Beverley McLachlin announced in June 2017 her decision to retire that December after 28 years on the high court,

including 17 as chief justice.

Her retirement meant the government would have to choose a new chief justice

and find another bilingual judge from western or northern Canada to sit on the nine-member bench.

Trudeau created an independent, non-partisan advisory board, headed by former Conservative prime minister Kim Campbell, to identify qualified candidates to fill the western/northern vacancy and submit a short list of three to five names for consideration.

According to the sources, one of the names on the eventual list was Glenn Joyal, who had been appointed in 2011 by former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper as chief justice of Manitoba’s Court of Queen’s Bench.

Wilson-Raybould then sent Trudeau a 60-plus-page memo arguing that Joyal should not only be added to the top court but should be named chief justice as well.

Only once before in Canadian history, in 1906, when Sir Wilfrid Laurier appointed his justice minister to the top judicial job, has a prime minister chosen a chief justice who was not already sitting on the Supreme Court.

Wilson-Raybould’s pick puzzled Trudeau but he became disturbed after doing some research into Joyal’s views on the charter, the sources said.

Joyal had criticized the judiciary for broadly interpreting charter rights and expanding them to apply to things not explicitly mentioned in the charter or, in his view, intended by provincial premiers when they agreed to enshrine a charter in the Constitution.

The Supreme Court’s liberal interpretation has led to things like legalization of same-sex marriage, the right of women to choose to have an abortion and the

legalization of medical assistance in dying, among other things ? – developments Trudeau has celebrated.

In a January 2017 speech to the Canadian Constitution Foundation’s Law and

Freedom Conference, Joyal echoed conservative arguments that the top court has

usurped the supremacy of elected legislatures to determine social policy.

The charter, Joyal argued, was the result of a compromise between Pierre

Trudeau and premiers, most of whom had originally opposed inclusion of a

charter in the Constitution. The compromise was intended to maintain a balance

between the judiciary and the legislative branch of government, with

provisions allowing governments to limit or override rights altogether in some

circumstances.

Since then, judicial interpretation of the charter has ignored the intentions

of the drafters and “led without question to a level of judicial potency that

was not anticipated back in 1982,’’ Joyal said in the speech, a video of which

is available on the foundation’s website. That, in turn, has resulted in a

“less potent and less influential legislative branch that seldom has the

final word.’’

“With the ‘constitutionalizing’ of more and more political and social issues

into fundamental rights, the Canadian judiciary has all but removed those

issues, in a fairly permanent way, from the realm of future civic engagement

and future political debate,’’ he said.

Joyal was particularly critical of the Supreme Court’s interpretation of

section 7 of the charter ?_ the section which guarantees everyone the right to

life, liberty and security of the person and under which the top court struck

down Canada’s abortion law and the prohibition on medically assisted death.

The court’s liberal interpretation of that section “has become, particularly

in recent years, the single most fertile source for the discovery of new

rights and the de facto constitutionalization of political and social

issues,’’ he said.

Trudeau rejected Wilson-Raybould’s advice. He ended up appointing Sheila

Martin, a judge on the appeal courts of Alberta, Northwest Territories and

Nunavut, to fill the vacant western Canadian seat on the bench. Sitting

Supreme Court Justice Richard Wagner was elevated to the role of chief

justice.

Wilson-Raybould’s advocacy of Joyal for the top judicial job may not come as a

total surprise to some Liberals, who’ve privately noted what they consider her

conservative, restrictive approach to charter rights in a number of bills,

including those dealing with assisted dying, impaired driving and genetic

discrimination.

Jane Philpott, as health minister at the time, was jointly responsible with

Wilson-Raybould for the assisted dying legislation.

She quit the cabinet earlier this month in solidarity with Wilson-Raybould,

saying she no longer had confidence in the government’s handling of the SNC-

Lavalin affair.

Conservative whites “who dislike diversity ...","“How are the Gulf Islands being changed by global migration patterns?”

That was the title for a talk I was to give on the Gulf Islands, after a library committee asked me to hop on the ferry and meet some of those whose homes are surrounded by the Salish Sea.

Gulf Island organizers of the talk tacked up small posters about it at their community centres, their (often-organic) grocery stores and (vegetarian) cafes.

But there was a misunderstanding. Many locals assumed, since the notices said there was to be a presentation about “global migration patterns,” I was going to talk about … birds.

It turns out bird migration may be more germane to nature-loving, kayak-paddling Gulf Islanders than the trans-national migration of humans, a phenomenon that is a key issue in Metro Vancouver but far less noticeable on the islands.

Unlike Metro Vancouver, where the population is almost half foreign-born, the demographic reality is vividly different just a short B.C. Ferries ride away from the big, bustling city.

The number of foreign-born residents who have made a home in the past two decades on the Southern Gulf Islands is just two per cent. And, unlike Metro Vancouver where the 2016 census shows whites comprise about 49 per cent of residents, the proportion of people of European origin on the Southern Gulf Islands is a notable 97 per cent.

You don’t have to be a demographer to recognize something happens when you join passengers on a ferry to the Southern Gulf Islands, Sunshine Coast, Northern Gulf Islands, or, to a slightly lesser extent, Vancouver Island. The ferry’s population suddenly turns quite European in origin.

Related

It’s part of a long-term trend, according to Statistics Canada. More than 85 per cent of immigrants to B.C., most of whom are Asians or other people of colour, move to Metro Vancouver.

At the same time, roughly 9,000 whites and Aboriginals each year depart Metro Vancouver for different parts of B.C., especially towns on the southwest coast.

Let’s take the Southern Gulf Islands as an illustration. The region of rocky beaches and forest (comprising Saltspring, Galiano, Mayne, Pender and Saturna) provides a graphic example of the urban-rural split in regards to ethno-cultural enclaves.

While large sections of Richmond are more than two-thirds ethnic Chinese, and the core of north Surrey is more than two-thirds South Asian, more than nine of 10 of the 4,660 permanent residents of the Southern Gulf Islands are of English, Scottish or Irish descent.

The total visible minority population of the Southern Gulf Islands is only 143 people. The biggest minority cohort is Japanese, followed by Chinese and Latin Americans. And most of them settled several decades ago, if not earlier. Strikingly, the census shows no South Asians make a home on the Southern Gulf Islands.

The Indigenous proportion of the Southern Gulf Islands, meanwhile, is about five per cent, almost as high as the B.C. average. However, none of those speak an Aboriginal language. That is unlike the 195 who have German, Dutch or Danish as a second language.

The strong European roots of the Southern Gulf Islands — where the vast majority of immigrants came, before 1980, from Britain or the United States — has cultural and even political implications.

Voters on the Southern Gulf Islands have recently, for instance, sent a Green party candidate to both Ottawa and Victoria. That unique achievement reflects a Mainstreet poll that suggests B.C. whites are far more inclined to vote for the Green party than people of colour.

The shift to ethnic enclaves is likely to continue across B.C. Similar to human movements in Britain, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and elsewhere, a segment of whites are leaving behind highly diverse neighbourhoods of Metro Vancouver and Toronto for nearby predominantly white regions.

Political scientist Eric Kaufmann, who was raised in Vancouver to mixed-race parents, has created a chart showing how the proportion of whites jumped by roughly 20 per cent in a recent period in municipalities such as Squamish, North Vancouver and Port Moody.

Saanich, West Vancouver and Abbotsford are somewhat similar, Kaufmann found, retaining populations in which four of five are white.

Why are such trends occurring in the increasingly ethnically diverse West?

Demographers have long realized that many members of ethno-cultural groups tend to flock together for the sense of familiarity and the economic and social support.

In his new book, Whiteshift: Populism, Immigration and the Future of White Majorities, Kaufmann cites studies showing whites tend to move out of urban neighbourhoods that are changing as a result of in-migration.

And, surprisingly, the studies show white liberals leave ethnically diverse neighbourhoods for more Caucasian ones at a slightly higher rate than white conservatives (partly because liberals are more inclined in general to move).

Conservative whites “who dislike diversity don’t retreat from it any more than pro-diversity whites do,” writes Kaufmann, who is at the University of London, Birkbeck.

“What people say and do seems almost totally disconnected.”

Such trends make up the demographic experiment that is Metro Vancouver, which, along with Toronto, ranks as the most ethnically super-diverse region of Canada, if not the world. Meanwhile, the broad geography of Canada remains predominantly white.

For a moment, I was tempted to suggest the headline for this article about the Southern Gulf Islands could be: “Journey into the heart of whiteness.”

That would have played on the title of Joseph Conrad’s famous book, The Heart of Darkness, which was about a harrowing journey into the Congo, which Francis Ford Coppola turned into Vietnam in Apocalypse Now.

But such a headline would likely feed more half-jokes about whites. And that’s a North American cultural trend that Reihan Salam took apart in a brilliant essay in The Atlantic, titled The Utility of White Bashing.

Salam explains how anti-white rhetoric can be a way to get ahead socially and “often smacks of intra-white status jockeying.”

As with members of other ethnic enclaves in urban Canada, it is easiest to leave the white Southern Gulf Islanders to their pursuits, be they alternative energy, gardening, amateur music bands, Green party politics, orca-watching, or birding.

As people of any origin know, delight can be found in grabbing a pair of binoculars and focusing on the annual “global migration patterns” of cormorants, oystercatchers and hummingbirds.

At Toronto’s “A Cure for the Munchies,” the four-course menu is infused with cannabis.

The April 26 eight-seat culinary experience by Munchy Brothers and presented by communal dining service U-Feast sold out in less than 10 minutes, but tickets for a second and third night are already on sale for $110 per seat.

The eight guests signed up for the event next month will taste the “Mary Mo” cocktail, a mojito accented with a syrup infused with 2.5 mg of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the chemical compound that gives users that “high” sensation. They’ll be treated to the “Pipe Dreams” dessert, a Mexican churro pastry with a toasted marshmallow s'mores dip, each with 5 mg of THC from ganja-infused salt, sugar and chocolate chips. The other menu items all feature hints of cannabis, whether actually infused with the psychoactive drug or not, said Munchy Brothers head chef and creative director Pat Newton.

“All of the dishes are themed and presented as something that’s related to cannabis culture,” he told CTVNews.ca. “I've designed this menu to be playful and reflect traditional cannabis customs and archetypes.”

The dish is paired with a blood orange citrus vinaigrette drizzled onto the salad from Visine bottles, which some marijuana smokers use to hide red eyes that often come with getting high. The “Smoke and Mirrors” appetizer is a take on enjoying a “toke and a coffee” in the morning: the tomato and parmesan cappuccino is served with a smoked gouda and chive grilled cheese, served on a rolling tray (used to roll joints) complete with an ashtray, cigar shavings and freshly ground cannabis crumbs.

None of the dishes feature a strong marijuana taste or smell, because Newton’s Munchy Brothers crafted a proprietary process that removes the typically unsavory taste and scent from its products.

While cannabis edibles aren’t legal in Canada until October, this small event is private and offered to U-Feast members only. It will take place at a private condo in Yorkville’s Four Seasons Hotel and Residences, and features no retail sales of edibles. The menu items are made on the spot using cannabis-infused ingredients created by Newton’s Munchy Brothers, which are not available for sale.

“They’re paying for the service, for the hospitality,” he said. “This is like I’m inviting friends over for dinner and I’m offering an experience.”

Both Newton and U-Feast stressed that the cannabis will be consumed safely. Diners will consume up to 15 mg, which the organizers consider to be a conservative amount. “We’re careful not to have people walk out of there stoned,” said U-Feast CEO Terry Mocherniak, who said he’s planning a “cooking with cannabis 101” event. Only the cocktail at the start of the meal and the dessert at the end of the meal will feature prominent doses of THC, said Newton.

The issues to be resolved by the court in Resolute FP Canada Inc. et al v. Ontario could have ...,"More than a half century after a river system in northwestern Ontario was contaminated by mercury poisoning from a pulp and paper plant, there are still health problems for members of two First Nations communities who live in the region.

The impact on the Grassy Narrows First Nation and Wabaseemoong Independent Nations has been referred to as one of the country’s worst environmental disasters.

It also continues to be an environmental and health concern in 2019. The former Liberal government in Ontario agreed nearly two years ago to establish a trust fund for remediation actions in the English and Wabigoon Rivers. The new Conservative government of Doug Ford promised last fall to increase disability payments for local residents with health difficulties related to the environmental problems.

As well, a dispute over the meaning of an agreement signed in 1985 between the province and two companies to end litigation stemming from the mercury poisoning and also to keep pulp and paper operations going at the Dryden plant is to be heard later this month by the Supreme Court of Canada.

The issues to be resolved by the court in Resolute FP Canada Inc. et al v. Ontario could have implications in commercial contracts far beyond that of the scope of the 1985 indemnity. It is also another reminder about the importance of precision in contract drafting. “You have to be cautious to avoid boiler plate language,” says Natalie Mullins, a partner at Gowling WLG in Toronto. “You have to address every issue very specifically,” adds Mullins, whose practice focuses on environmental-based litigation.

A central aspect of the upcoming case before the Supreme Court is whether the indemnity clause agreed to by Ontario in the 1985 agreement applied only to third-party claims against two companies or to so-called “direct” claims stemming from the costs of subsequent environmental orders by the province. Also, if an indemnity is in effect for a corporate property owner, the Supreme Court is being asked to clarify what happens to this protection if there is a transfer of control and a provincial government invokes its environmental powers against any entity that was ever attached to the land.

Adding to the somewhat complicated factual history in this dispute is that judges at every level in the litigation have disagreed on the application of the contractual interpretation template set out by the Supreme Court less than five years ago in Sattva Capital Corp. v. Creston Moly Corp.

In some ways, the issues in the case invoke basic principles of contract law. “It goes back to the debate over contractual interpretation — textual or contextual,” notes Paul Davis, a lawyer at Paliare Roland Rosenberg Rothstein LLP in Toronto. “Our Supreme Court has been moving away from a textual interpretation,” says Davis, who is the co-author of a paper in the Canadian Business Law Journal about the issues raised in Resolute as a result of the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal.

The indemnity in 1985 was part of an agreement between the Ontario government and Reed Ltd. and Great Lakes Forest Products Limited. A predecessor company of Reed was responsible in the 1960s for the release of untreated mercury waste into the local river systems. Great Lakes agreed to purchase the Dryden plant in 1979 after the province, which did not want the pulp and paper operations to close, agreed to limit the potential liability from litigation. The deal also required Great Lakes to spend a significant amount of money to upgrade and modernize the plant.

A settlement with the First Nations bands impacted by the pollution was not reached until 1985. As part of a broad agreement with all parties, including First Nations, the federal government and the two companies, the province agreed to an indemnity provision for both Reed and Great Lakes.

The main clause of this provision stated that Ontario would indemnify the companies from “any obligation” as a result of “any claim, action or proceeding, whether statutory or otherwise” that existed in 1979 when the transaction for the pulp and paper operations went through. The scope of the indemnity extended to claims by individuals, companies, the federal government and “any province” as a result of environmental damage caused previously.

Ownership of the pulp and paper operations and control over the waste disposal site had transferred hands a number of times when, in 2011, the Ontario government issued environmental orders to deal with soil erosion and ongoing water testing.

Weyerhaeuser and predecessor companies to Resolute FP Canada Inc. were named in the order and required to compensate the province more than $270,000 to cover the cost of the remediation. The companies were also informed that they were not relieved from being responsible for any future orders related to site, which, in 2011, had an estimated lifespan of another 35 years.

Weyerhaeuser was named in the order as a result of it owning the property for two years, from 1998 to 2000. Through a number of corporate consolidations over the years, Resolute could be linked back to Great Lakes, one of the two companies that signed the agreement with Ontario in 1985.

The companies named in the order were not responsible for the mercury poisoning, but the powers of the province are quite broad under the Environmental Protection Act, explains Mullins. “To address contamination, the ministry can reach back in time. You just have to have some association with the land and you continue to be exposed even after you sell it,” she says.

Weyerhaeuser initiated an action against the province in 2013 and Resolute was added as a party to the litigation. Superior Court Justice Glenn Hainey ruled that the indemnity was not restricted to third-party claims, as Ontario argued.

“The province wanted to protect Dryden’s economy and encouraged Great Lakes to continue the pulp and paper operation in Dryden and to invest a great deal of money in upgrading the operation. It was well known that the disposal site posed a serious environmental liability,” the judge wrote. “Under the circumstances, it would be commercially absurd to conclude that the parties contemplated that the province could at any time withdraw its commitment to protect Great Lakes and its successors from environmental liability arising from the disposal site,” he added.

The province appealed that decision and, in a 2-1 ruling, the Court of Appeal upheld the finding that the indemnity applied to direct claims. However, the majority also ruled that the predecessor company to Resolute had assigned its benefit to Weyerhaeuser in1998. It also concluded that the motions judge should determine if Weyerhaeuser transferred its benefit when it sold the Dryden mill and other assets in 2007 to another company.

On the first issue of whether the 1985 indemnity was restricted to third-party claims, all three judges referred to the Supreme Court’s decision in Sattva and the instruction to consider the “factual matrix” when deciding the intent of the parties in a contract.

Justice David Brown, with Justice Peter Lauwers concurring, also highlighted this section of the Supreme Court ruling. “While the surrounding circumstances will be considered in interpreting the terms of a contract, they must never be allowed to overwhelm the words of that agreement,” noted Brown.

“I see no legal error in the motion judge’s statement that the interpretation of a contract should start with the language of the contract. That is the logical place to start, especially since the jurisprudence requires the interpreter of a contract to determine the parties’ intention in accordance with the language they use,” wrote Brown.

The majority found that Hainey did not commit a “palpable and overriding error” in his interpretation of the contract and that, depending on the language used, an indemnity can cover direct claims.

Justice John Laskin issued a dissenting judgment and suggested that Hainey’s analysis was in error.

“The motion judge’s starting point for interpreting the 1985 indemnity was to look at the words of the document in isolation, and then only secondarily at the ‘surrounding circumstances.’ His two-stage approach to the interpretation of the 1985 indemnity is not the proper approach. Context controls meaning,” wrote Laskin, who ruled in favour of Ontario on whether the indemnity applied to direct claims.

Ontario and the two companies all sought leave to appeal different aspects of the Ontario Court of Appeal decision. Leave was granted last fall.

Douglas Sarro, a lawyer and co-author with Davis of the paper on the case and its legal issues, says he believes Laskin’s judgment is more in line with the way the Supreme Court has suggested to go about interpreting these kinds of agreements. “I think the Supreme Court is going to have to remind the courts below about the approach it set out in Sattva,” says Sarro, senior advisor, research and regulatory innovation at the Ontario Securities Commission (his comments are not on behalf of the OSC).

“Given the structure of this indemnity, it makes more sense to me as one that covered third-party claims,” Sarro says, in part because of other aspects of the agreement that was signed in 1985 by the provincial and federal governments, the companies and First Nations.

There is not a lot of Canadian case law on the scope of indemnities in circumstances such as the Weyerhaeuser/Resolute case. In their law paper, the lawyers also argue that the majority did not follow the approach of other jurisdictions, both in the United States and some Commonwealth countries, in determining whether the indemnity covered third-party claims. Broad language on its own is not enough to expand the scope of an indemnity without considering the context, they write.

Not surprisingly, the Ontario government is in agreement with the analysis conducted by Laskin in his dissent on whether the indemnity applied to direct claims. “Further, the Court of Appeal ought to have corrected the motion judge’s conclusion that the 1985 indemnity was a business agreement. The settlement was not commercial in nature. It reflected a policy objective to address concerns arising from the mercury contamination,” state Ontario lawyers Leonard Marsello, Tamara Barclay and Nansy Ghobrial in written submissions filed with the Supreme Court.

Agreements with government are different than contracts solely between private-sector entities, they argue, because of the public interest requirements. “Absent express language, courts should not imply an obligation to compensate for breach of contract resulting from future legislation,” they write.

Resolute, in its written submissions, suggests the issues before the court are not actually complex. “In 1979 and again in 1985, the province of Ontario gave indemnities to Great Lakes Forest Products Limited. It gave those indemnities to persuade Great Lakes to buy and invest $200 million in a pulp and paper mill, to settle environmental litigation with First Nations bands and to save the economy of Dryden, a single industry town. . . . [B]ut in 2011, when environmental liabilities arose from the buried mercury, Ontario sought to renege from its bargain,” write Andrew Bernstein, Jeremy Opolsky and Jonathan Silver at Torys LLP.

In his dissent, Laskin did not address whether the companies involved in the litigation still enjoyed the benefit of the indemnity, because he found it only ever applied to third-party claims.

The finding by the majority that the benefit had extinguished over time through the various commercial transactions is criticized by both companies in their written submissions before the Supreme Court, on the basis of failing to apply the standard principles of contractual interpretation. “Those principles required the court to consider the wording of the enurement provision in the context of the indemnity as a whole, the factual matrix, and the principle that commercially unreasonable results should be avoided,” write Weyerhaeuser’s lawyers Christopher Bredt, Markus Kremer and Alannah Fotheringham at Borden Ladner Gervais LLP.

The finding by the majority in the Court of Appeal ruling that more evidence is required to determine if Weyerhaeuser “lost” the benefit of the indemnity in the 2007 sale of the Dryden plant leads to a “commercially absurd result,” they argue. “It would be very difficult for an indemnitee to sell a contaminated property if a purchaser knows that it will be exposed to liability upon becoming the property’s owner. By the same token, few owners would be willing to sell a contaminated property if they know that, by doing so, they will lose the benefit of the indemnity,” they state.

If you are indemnified only while you hold title to the property and theindemnity, but once you sell and assign it you are opened up to an order “doesn’t seem to be a reasonable commercial outcome,” says Mullins. “The ministry would be potentially getting a windfall.” When draftingindemnityagreements, it is important to make clear what you are protected from and who is protected, Mullins adds.

Depending on how the Supreme Court rules in this case, it may be necessary for legal departments to revisit past agreements to determine the scope of an indemnity, says Michael Barbero, a lawyer at McLennan Ross LLP in Calgary, whose practice focuses on environmental law and regulatory compliance.

“Identify whether the agreement has a robust definition of claim, such that you can ascertain whether direct claims, third-party claims or both are captured by the agreement. Then identify whether the commercial context is relevant and worth arguing,” says Barbero.

Davis agrees that reviewing past indemnity agreements may be worthwhile. “You may have to go back and look and see what other sections of the contract say,” he adds. In future agreements, “if the intention is to limit it to third-party claims, use that express language,” Davis says.",Risky business: what is the scope of your indemnity?,Canadian Lawyer Magazine,https://www.canadianlawyermag.com/author/shannon-kari/risky-business-what-is-the-scope-of-your-indemnity-17014/

The newly-hired executive director at the Kamloops Chamber of Commerce has been let go following a series of controversial Facebook posts.

John Perks suddenly changed the privacy settings on his Facebook page on Friday morning after contents of some posts began circulating on social media.

“Today, the Kamloops Chamber of Commerce is announcing that John Perks will not be employed as its executive director as previously announced,” chamber president Joshua Knaak said in a press release issued on Sunday afternoon.

Shortly after the hiring announcement, some of Perk’s recently shared Facebook posts began to get noticed, including a post that denies climate change is real, a post that refers to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as an “idiot,” a post that refers to substance-abuse addicts as “junkies” and a post that claims the migrant caravan from Central America to Mexico was staged for the media.

There is also a post Perks shared that states pro-choice advocates should be forced to watch an abortion procedure and a post referring to Muslims that is incorrectly attributed to a quote by former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill: “When Muslims are in the minority, they are very concerned with minority rights; when they are in the majority there are no minority rights.”

Screenshots seemingly calling @JustinTrudeau an idiot, disparaging Muslims and seemingly denying climate were found on a Facebook page allegedly belonging to (now former) Kamloops Chamber of Commerce exec director John Perks.@BlackPressMedia

STORY: https://t.co/Koxferhw0c pic.twitter.com/Di3KsyGhbU — Kat Slepian (@katslepian) March 25, 2019

In defence of the posts, Perks told Kamloops This Week that he did not know his Facebook page was public and that anyone who knows him would not conclude what the posts might otherwise lead them to believe.

One post is a screenshot that implies climate change is along the same lines as “unicorns, Superman, the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, the tooth fairy and old washed up communists becoming president” — referring to Bernie Sanders, who was featured in the posts’s content.

But Perks said that he does, indeed, believe in human-caused climate change “100 per cent” and was only sharing the post to highlight the absurdity of the comment.

Another was a meme post that read, “When your Liberal friend finally wakes up… And thanks you for making him realize Justin Trudeau is an idiot!”

When asked why he — now the chamber’s executive director and someone who will be liaising with government of all levels, including federal, on a regular basis — would share a post calling the prime minister an idiot, Perks said he didn’t recall ever doing so.

“Justin Trudeau is a smart and intelligent man. He’s the prime minister of Canada,” Perks said. “He is due respect and the honour to be in that office. There has to be healthy dialogue if there are differences and that’s what I believe in.”

Another post shared by Perks purports the migrant caravan that travelled to the United States’ southern border was staged for the media.

“My point of posting that was not to say anything about the border wall or security, it was that I couldn’t believe the media is exploiting this crisis in Honduras and exploiting women and children at risk,” he said.

Other recent posts on Perks’ page include pro-Donald Trump and anti-Democrat messages. He said he was a Trump supporter and he admits he was at one point.

“I went to his inauguration, but there’s a lot of things I do not agree with — about 90 per cent,” he said.

In January, Perks shared an image celebrating Trump’s national emergency declaration for funding the country’s controversial southern border wall. The image also denigrated former president Barack Obama’s emergency declarations to lift sanctions preventing aid to countries like Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Ukraine.

Perks also shared posts from the alt-right news website Breitbart, though he told KTW he did not know what Breitbart was.

Perks also shared a post by Facebook page National Conservative News Network Canada, a far-right website similar to Breitbart. The post compared the cost of epinephrine pens to the cost of Narcan and referred to drug-users as “junkies.”

“The messed-up part of that from my perspective is that there are costs behind a medical system that is supposed to be socialized,” he said.

As for drug users being referred to as “junkies,” Perks’ defence of sharing the post was that he has a close family member who is a drug addict. He said it is not prejudiced against drug users.

“Like I said, I didn’t know anybody else would see that. I probably have 2,000 friend requests waiting. I don’t add everybody to my personal Facebook page,” he said.

Perks said he made his Facebook page private on Friday morning because he has personal family photos on the page and wants to protect his family.

Kamloops Chamber of Commerce president Joshua Knaak said Perks went through a “rigorous” vetting process that included not only its board of directors, but also a third-party consultant.

“We saw enough of his social media. We saw enough of him so that we were confident in the person we got,” Knaak said.

“We met the candidate on two separate occasions to get the context that I think is missing. The only way others are going to be able to get that context is to meet John and see what he does.”

LONDON – Britain has just a few weeks to break its Brexit impasse, with the fate of the country’s departure from the European Union and that of Prime Minister Theresa May both hanging in the balance.

Here’s a look at what might happen next:

___

DEAL OR NO DEAL

With British politicians deadlocked, EU leaders last week granted Britain a two-stage “flextension” to Brexit, which had been due to take place on March 29. Under the new plan, if U.K. lawmakers approve the divorce deal agreed upon between Britain and the bloc, the country will leave the EU on May 22.

If they defeat it, Britain has until April 12 to tell the EU what it plans to do next: leave without a deal, risking economic chaos, or seek a long delay to Brexit and chart a course toward a softer exit or even remaining in the bloc.

___

PARLIAMENTARY BATTLE

The battle now shifts back to the British Parliament, which is split down the middle between supporters and opponents of Brexit.

Both sides voted in large numbers, twice, to reject May’s Brexit deal. But May wants to try again. She hopes to persuade reluctant pro-Brexit lawmakers that backing her deal is their only hope of leaving soon and in an orderly fashion, and to convince pro-EU legislators that they must choose between her deal or a chaotic no-deal Brexit.

But May conceded Monday that “as things stand, there is still not sufficient support” for a new vote on the deal, though she hoped to change that before the end of the week.

___

OTHER OPTIONS

There is little evidence yet that lawmakers’ opinion has shifted strongly in favour of May’s deal.

Anti-EU supporters of “hard Brexit” still believe that rejecting it can lead to a no-deal departure from the bloc as soon as April 12.

A larger group in Parliament, from a range of parties, favours a compromise Brexit in which the U.K. keeps close economic ties with the bloc.

These pro-EU lawmakers had a victory late Monday when the House of Commons agreed 329-302 to take temporary control of the parliamentary agenda, usually the government’s prerogative, to schedule a series of votes on alternative Brexit options. The goal of the “indicative votes” is to see if there is majority support for any of the alternatives.

Proposals could include seeking closer ties with the bloc than May’s deal envisages, or putting the Brexit deal to a public vote.

___

THE END OF MAY?

British politicians are divided over Brexit, but they agree that the process is in a mess _ and many blame May, who has refused to consider alternatives to her deal and failed to win changes to the agreement from the EU.

Many Conservatives are now calling for May to step down. Some pro-Brexit Tories who have so far opposed her deal say they would support it if she promised to hand over the next stage of negotiations – when Britain and the EU will hammer out their future relations – to a new leader.

For now, May is standing firm. Under Conservative rules, May cannot face a formal leadership challenge from within her own party until December because she survived one three months ago.

___

BYE-BYE BREXIT?

Opposition politicians think the only way forward is an early election that could rearrange Parliament and break the political deadlock. May has ruled that out, but could come to see it as her only option.

And anti-Brexit campaigners haven’t abandoned the idea of a new Brexit referendum on remaining in the EU. There’s currently no majority for that in Parliament, but pro-referendum campaigners feel opinion is shifting in their favour. Hundreds of thousands of people marched through London on Saturday to demand a new Brexit vote.

The “nuclear option” of simply cancelling Brexit is also gaining support. An online petition urging the government to revoke the decision to leave the EU has amassed more than 5 million signatures.","What Next?

Big party happening in the background and in the foreground we have ...,"WELLS: On that note, I want to welcome to The Message Graeme MacKay, the Hamilton Spectator's award winning editorial cartoonist. In fact it occurred to me as I was preparing for the episode that the sign Beware of Cartoonist is funny and also has deeper meetings or layers to it, just as your work always does, because in fact you occupy a physical space in the newsroom off on your own — separate from the reporters. And you also play a singular role at The Spectator which is to offer an opinion, a point of view on everything from politics to Hamilton's quirks and the vast canvas of human nature and to do so editorial cartoons. That's me giving my spin how you might see your job. How do you see what you do?

MACKAY: Yeah, I occupy a very isolated corner of the newsroom way at the other end and by the exit door to the newsroom too so there's a symbolic thing there. I guess I'm lucky enough to have a position that I have because it's sort of like a visual columnist. But I guess my job is to poke the powers and do it in a depiction way in a drawing and it's a wonderful job that I have for sure.

WELLS: And you've been in The Spec 22 years this September is my guess. That means you're a young buck compared to me. You started at The Spec four months after I did?

MACKAY: Yes. But I bet you, they probably gave you a computer. Right?

WELLS: They did! You are right about that.

MACKAY: I didn't get a computer for like, three or four years after. And I think it took like half a year to get a phone. That was 1997.

WELLS: Those were the perks back then. So we'll talk a little bit about the road travelled for you and then how you do what you do in this age of Trump and Trudeau. I was thinking I feel the limitations of audio here where your work is so visual.

MACKAY: Sure.

WELLS: But Ayesha Nasir, the producer of The Message, will post some of your work on our site and a link to your website which I was going through. There's a ton of material on there for readers. Archives and —

MACKAY: I'm very proud of my website.

WELLS: It's a great website. I wish I had something that showed some of my past work you know, so yeah, that's terrific. But to start, today's cartoon — by the way you create five editorial cartoons per week at The Spec, is that right?

MACKAY: Right.

WELLS: And your work is nationally syndicated so it appears online and in newspapers throughout Canada and sometimes in the US. The cartoon today, just to take a random one because it's in the paper today, it features Doug Ford.

Editorial cartoon for Wednesday, March 6, 2019. | Graeme MacKay, The Hamilton Spectator

We have Ford. In the background of the cartoon, there's a big carnival happening. Fireworks in the sky and a carnival tent is labelled SNC-LAV-SCAM. Big party happening in the background and in the foreground we have Doug Ford looking very much like a mob boss standing over someone bearing something in the dirt led by car headlights — which symbolize what?

MACKAY: Well there's, obviously, some interference happening on both the provincial and federal level. It's an edgy cartoon and I could have gotten into trouble with that. I had to like go to my editor Howard Elliot, just to make sure that we wouldn't get sued because it's —

WELLS: It's pretty suggestive.

MACKAY: Yeah, it's very suggestive. You're saying what, the premier is killing people off? I guess in a metaphorical way, he did. Or his deputy, one of his deputies, actually fired the deputy commissioner of the OPP.

WELLS: Just this week, right?

MACKAY: Yeah. But, you know, it's just interesting because we've been obsessed by the SNC-Lavalin story for weeks now. And there's other things that are happening. We as cartoonists just have to be careful not to get too obsessed with the media and keep our eye on other, you know, nasty things that might be happening and I think what's happening in Ontario right now is ... it's fodder for cartoons for sure.

WELLS: I've heard and seen some criticism of the coverage of LAV-SCAM, that the media is all in and everyone is now trying to outdo the other, that is, not to say it's not a huge story, which it is. But it's a good opportunity, for you to kind of shine the light somewhere else like you're doing here.

MACKAY: Well, you gotta wonder like, are people really focused in on the LAV-SCAM thing and are they more focused on what's happening with Ford? I mean, I don't know. Until polls come out, we don't know. Maybe for the vast majority of people outside the bubbles that really follow these political things nobody really cares. But I guess time will tell.

WELLS: Would you anticipate when you draw Doug Ford in this sort of manner, do you ever sort of expect to get a an email or call from someone who's a fan and not a fan of yours? Perhaps who is angry about the depiction.

MACKAY: I expect with my job that I'm not gonna have 100% happiness. I think with a good cartoon you're going to get as many people oppose as people who like it. So yeah, on various social media platforms, I get an earful from people who are totally upset with my cartoon. We get the odd letters to the Editor, a lot of them I don't even see. They just cross Howard's desk and he protects me from seeing some of these angry emails and letters and whatnot. But yeah, I think if you're not getting feedback, you're not doing your job properly as a cartoonist.

WELLS: Do you have thick skin as far as that goes? I mean, your job is to stir the pot. I think if I got a letter taking a shot at my story — I'm probably more thin skinned — I might feel defensive at first. I guess it depends on the nature of —

MACKAY: I think I get more defensive when people obviously don't understand and they show they don't understand satire. They're not seeing the bigger picture that sometimes you need to use Certain metaphors and situations that cast affliction on certain people in order to skewer the person who's the power. I think in some countries like in France and Britain, they get that. But here, it's almost like it's a continuous kind of thing where you got ""Well, no, this is how it works here."" And, ""This is what satire is all about."" But I can understand that even satire has to adapt to the changing norms and everything that happens with society.

WELLS: And satire is not polite.

MACKAY: It's not polite and it's not fair sometimes, either.

WELLS: That's right. One of your favourite cartoonists and friends in the fraternity of cartoonists, I suppose, is Michael deAdder. He apologized recently. He did one of the LAV-SCAM cartoons where he depicted Jody Wilson-Raybould tied up with her mouth taped, in a boxing ring, with Trudeau poised to take her on in the ring. So her hands are tied down her back, her mouth is covered up.

MACKAY: I did actually the almost exact same cartoon too.

WELLS: Did you?

MACKAY: Yeah and we were lumped into this whole sort of thing with hate and misogyny and that sort of thing. I posted my cartoon online and deAdder saw it and then he messaged me and said I'm in the middle of tweeting that same cartoon but just giving you the heads-up that this is going in my paper tomorrow. And he's on the Atlantic Coast so he didn't have much of a timeline.

WELLS: Right, he's in Halifax.

MACKAY: Seven o'clock in the evening. So we go ahead and then everything hits the fan the next day it was posted.

WELLS: I saw on Twitter, I mean I just saw a bit of it, but he apologized and then he sort of apologized for the apology. But people started giving a hard time for apologizing.

MACKAY: I think the big difference there is that he's a freelancer so he doesn't answer to an editor. My editor is Howard Elliot and he cleared it. He looked at it and he didn't raise any worry it about or anything. There's been subsequent apologies since then and they all come from freelancers who don't have those filters that thank goodness I have here at The Spectator because I've never apologized for a cartoon.

WELLS: You haven't? I was going to ask you about that.

MACKAY: Not here. I have come close but no I haven't.

Editorial Cartoon for Friday, February 15, 2019 | Graeme MacKay, The Hamilton Spectator -

WELLS: With that one, people are missing the whole boxing analogy. Trudeau was famous at least for people following his career for boxing publicly.

MACKAY: Well, the Liberal Party and his supporters have made a big deal. He punched out Patrick Brazeau and it was, you know, ""Look what he did here!"" and all of you can look at that like well yeah, he was an Indigenous guy too that he punched out. But, you know, it was taken as a positive thing and it was an important thing because it was before he became prime minister. And a lot of people will say hell, he's just a weakling who only cares about his hair and his looks and selfies and that sort of thing. So let's go and prove that he's a capable guy. And I've used that in other cartoons. His punching acumen when dealing with Donald Trump and that sort of thing.

WELLS: Right, right. The first time I covered him ever in Hamilton was when he came here. And he did a big thing at the gym downtown where he put on a big workout. He was quite happy to to sweat for the cameras.

MACKAY: I'm kind of amazed that we as cartoonists haven't really capitalized on this whole thing because you could you can see the good in that. But you can also see the ugly side of being a boxer as well, and I think both Mike and I did that job as was expected in a satirist.

WELLS: How often would you say an editor like Howard or Paul Berton editor in chief comes to you with an idea that they would like to see done, or an issue say that they like to see done by you in the paper? And how often is it just you percentagewise?

MACKAY: They never come to me. I can tell you they never instruct me or say ""Oh, you gotta like lay off."" Although in the early days they would tell me to lay off way back when I started out. I came on and it was a different approach that I had towards my job. I was scathing towards the mayor who was Bob Morrow and I did some nasty cartoons about him and my boss who actually happened to be Howard. Howard has been my boss for a long time and I remember he told me so you gotta back off on the mayor because he's starting to like badger us. I think that says something. There's something about ... it's easier to go after a politician who's in Ottawa or London or Washington but when it comes to City Hall here these are people that you got to deal with.

WELLS: We have reporters.

MACKAY: And reporters have to deal with them as well. If you keep it up they're going to stop answering the phones when a reporter calls.

WELLS: Right. So then each day, the cartoon ... that is you picking the topic and give your spin on it.

MACKAY: Yeah as I say it's like you or Andrew or Jeff Mahoney. I'm given the liberty of a columnist. However it hasn't always been that way. I mean we've had different editors as you know and they have different definitions on what my role is. I can fight against it but they're the ones paying me.

WELLS: Let's roll back a little bit to your road here. So you grew up in Dundas and attended junior art classes at the Dundas Valley School of Art. I was reading from a piece that the spec ran when you were first hired that's on your website. You were a news geek as a kid and used to doodle in class and draw your teachers and classmates and in grade four through the whole class and ran off photocopies for all of them on demand.

MACKAY: Yeah!

WELLS: Does it make you popular or not popular?

MACKAY: Oh sure, sure. I still had bullies going after me and stuff like that. But if you're a pretty good cartoonist or an artist, you often are like a hit, if you can use that art against the authority of a teacher.

WELLS: What cartoons or comics did you enjoy reading most when you were growing up?

MACKAY: You know, I didn't read a heck of a lot of comic books. I was definitely into MAD Magazine and Cracked. I loved MAD Magazine. And I think that's probably because it was parody. It was like an early form. I didn't know who the president United States was when I'm nine or 10 years old but I knew about being bombarded by all these products on TV. Actually I was thinking also of Wacky Packs. Remember Wacky Packs? They're these candy things and you get gum and then inside would be all these stickers that were parodies of products. Instead of Captain Crunch it was a sticker showing a box with Captain Crud. I think that was the germ of my fascination with just making fun of, you know, on a pop culture thing that extended to politics which came very soon after that I guess.

WELLS: In MAD magazine, as a kid, I would enjoy the parodies of movies. In very highly detail, they would go through the plot of the movie and just ridicule notions of it.

MACKAY: Don Martin and Al Jaffee and Sergio ... wonderful, wonderful cartoonists.

WELLS: In the introduction to your book, which was published in 2017, which is titled ""You might be from Hamilton if ..."", The Spectator's Scott Radley wrote the introduction to the book. He mentioned MAD Magazine and he also said that a lot of kids growing up probably wanted to be a cartoonist and I was going to tell you that I can attest to that. Back in grade five or six I gave my speech, when we all had to give speeches back in the day, you to stand in front of class give a speech. I gave mine on how my career aspiration was to be a cartoonist and I was a huge Peanuts fan. Charles M. Shulz, the whole thing. I had sketch books but I couldn't draw and so set me back a little bit. When did you know that you wanted to draw, and for a living, and be a newspaper editorial cartoonist specifically?

MACKAY: Well I've always drawn. I guess I'm the nerd who instead of going out and playing football or hockey or whatever I stayed in and drew. But I guess, like I said, it was parody I was fascinated with. I was a television junkie too let's be honest. With MAD Magazine, I was also into SCTV and Saturday Night Live — a lot of these great comedy shows that would make fun of the politics of the day. So you know you had Saturday Night Live making fun of the president of the day, which they do so fine even to this day. And so, you know, that made me wonder: what are they talking about here? So, I guess I came of age to find the fascination of politics when Ronald Reagan was president. That was the time when Pierre Trudeau was the prime minister and I know I would always hear the family discussions at the dinner table. On Sunday night, my grandparents would come over and they would freak out over the latest thing that Pierre Trudeau was doing to the country. And so that started an interest in reading the newspapers and by that time I was delivering the Hamilton Spectator and I could open the paper and I'd see the wonderful works of Blaine, the cartoonist here for so long. And so that naturally went to well, what are they drawing in the Toronto Star? What are they drawing in the Globe? And so I just became aware of a lot of the cartoonists at that time period in the early 80s and it's a lifetime fascination starting from there.

WELLS: It's interesting. SCTV was, I loved that it was just so clever energy in not just politics with shows like that on SCTV but the powerful, the famous to be skewered and made fun of whether it was Bob Hope or whoever. I'd love to see that on Netflix. They got to bring SCTV on Netflix.

MACKAY: That would be wonderful, wouldn't it?

WELLS: Political cartoons have been around a long time, if you're Googling anyways. It suggests that the first one ever might have been in 1754 by Ben Franklin. And just to give the audience the visual: it's a snake that's been cut into several sections to show disunity among the new colonies that were not yet the United States. And the caption is, join or die. And we were just talking before the show briefly, but how you actually did a cartoon years ago, that was a take on Franklin's cartoon.

MACKAY: Yeah, it was to apply to the amalgamation of Hamilton. So you know, they were amalgamating all the colonies back at that time, and the threats were out there. Well, that was sort of the same thing that was happening back in around 1999 and 2000, when the province, was compelling us to amalgamate. I did that cartoon and I showed it to the editor and he didn't know what I was talking about so much I guess. Typical journalist doesn't know the history of satire.

WELLS: Back to the drawing board.

MACKAY: Exactly.

WELLS: I think that one and your work and the best editorial cartoons show how carefully chosen words of a little bit of information convey so much. Just randomly going through your website ... maybe because this one appeared on my birthday ... but the one that is lamenting the end of summer. It says ""RIP summer"" and it has you know these ...

MACKAY: They're Grim Reapers.

WELLS: Grim Reapers carrying this pumpkin man who's heralding the pumpkin spice is back. I just think it's awesome. Pumpkin spice of course is a great flair but it does signal that something is coming to an end.

MACKAY: I'm just around so many people that say Oh, have you had this beer? It's pumpkin spice. It's like no I don't want pumpkin spice. All the coffee shops were bringing their coffee so that's a perfect cultural thing that gets away from the politics. Like I said, I know that there are people who are who are shutting out the politics and they're sick of it and everything and so it's important for us to do some of the cultural references and sort of jab at it, which means we have to put up with every year like pumpkin spice and whatever.

WELLS: I love that stuff. Of course at Christmas time all the different flavours. I'm just like what is that? You know all the different flavours. I don't even know what they are.

MACKAY: The other thing on coffee that drives me crazy is the Roll Up The Rim thing. It's like a sport for me every year to come up with another, you know, let's mock the Roll Up The Rim campaign because it's just ... I walk to work and I see the results of Roll Up The Rim. All these dirty cups all over the place.

WELLS: I've never done it.

MACKAY: Have you not?

WELLS: I prefer my lattes and stuff from elsewhere. Whatever that makes me I don't know. But you know, you gotta hand it to them. They certainly tapped into something.

MACKAY: I do. But it's, you know, take some responsibility because these cups are all over the place. And I know there's been an outcry and it's been getting louder every year. You know, this is the disposable ... like this is the crap that you're adding to the landscape through this. It's just horrible.

WELLS: Is one of your challenges determining how much information to provide in a cartoon? Some of your work, some of your cartoons, have layers and layers of background information, little bits and minutiae within the cartoon. And others have a very simple — what appears to be simple — message although, as I say, with the one about pumpkin spice, simple yet there's a lot to it. That's kind of under the surface. Is that something you think about consciously, or you just kind of go with it?

MACKAY: It depends on how I feel. I guess it's kind of nice to be able to put those little Easter eggs in and just give a little extra fun for the viewer. I mean, I'm a big fan of the intricate cartoons. I know there's a wonderful thing about simplicity of cartoons, but I think from time to time was nice to do these elaborate things.

WELLS: Where people can kind of dig into it and get what they can out of it. Of course, then some people aren't getting half of what you're trying to convey sometimes.

MACKAY: Also if the gag is kind of weak then it's you know, I spice it up. I pumpkin spice it up with more details.

WELLS: I said you were an award-winning cartoonist and you're a two-time recipient of a United Nation citation. The Ranan Lurie Political Cartoon.

MACKAY: Ranan Lurie. He's a famous cartoonist from — I don't know where he's from — Egypt, I think. And he's obviously very rich. He throws his money around and rewards people.

WELLS: Which is fabulous. And then last year you were nominated for a City of Hamilton Arts Award.

MACKAY: Yeah, I was nominated. I didn't win.

WELLS: So what you do is absolutely art. And it's punditry and commentary. Do you see yourself more as an artist or commentator?

MACKAY: I would love to do more art. And a lot of us cartoonists do. I would like to do more art, I'd like to do oil paintings. I look at our colleague here, Lee Munn who does some outstanding artwork. Landscapes and things like that. Boy, that would be a dream of mine to go back to the basics of what I learned at the DVSA and take a sketch book out there and draw stuff. Because that's what I did. I used to do that. I used to go out to museums and draw vases and statue heads and things like that. It's a wonderful, therapeutic thing to do.

WELLS: Just to quickly go back to the politics. I meant to ask you earlier: I'm sure there are followers of your work, or people who dip in on your work on occasion, who think they can pinpoint ... There are people who think they can pinpoint The Spectator's political leanings. Even if we had one, which I don't think that the paper does. I don't think it has a particular leaning but I'm sure there's some who think they can label you along the spectrum. And they'd probably be wrong no matter what they say.

MACKAY: Yeah. Good luck. Cause I don't even know where I am. That's right. One thing that drives me crazy is partisanship. It drives me nuts because I will put something on Twitter and I can easily predict who's going to be weighing and then saying such and such. But you know, there's your example right there. You've got a Doug Ford cartoon there and I'm making fun of a guy. He happens to be a Progressive Conservative. But the day before, I'm making fun of Justin Trudeau, he happens to be a federal Liberal. And then I'm making fun of Trump and I'm making fun of all kinds of political parties. Again, it isn't about partisanship to be a cartoonist. Put that all away. It's all about jabbing the powers. It just so happens, we are in a really good situation now. We had a Conservative in Queen's Park in a Liberal in Ottawa.

WELLS: It's kind of an ideal situation for you.

MACKAY: Yeah, it is. But I think in the past, I might have come here with a bit of a partisan leaning towards the centre right. But I can't ... I'm not there at all. I think over time and being around smart people like we have The Spectator, you know, you've learned something. And I certainly have being here.

WELLS: I've talked about how this is such a rich time for cartoonists, in Canada with Justin Trudeau's reign and the dawn of the age of Trump. Looking back to other periods in your career to this point, is this the most interesting time or have they all been interesting?

MACKAY: We were having some great scandal times right now. But in 22 years you can think back, I mean, there's the gas plant scandal, the Gomery scandal, money in bags that Mulroney was passing to Karlheinz Schreiber. Look at the scandal happening in Washington right now. So I think what happens is you get a series of scandals adding up and that's what lends itself to the eventual defeat of a government. I don't know if this SNC-Lavalin thing is going to topple the government. I doubt it will. I think in a life of government there's a series. I mean we had a Liberal government in Ontario that was very plagued with scandals and it lasted for how many terms. And now we got a new government that's starting up its own scandals so scandals are just part of life, right?

WELLS: It's the fuel for the fire for a cartoonist. Graeme, I'm fascinated by the work you do. As I've already pointed out I envious because you're doing what I wanted to do when I was a kid. It's great what you bring to the Spectator adding colour and perspective and wit to our pages and you're one of the best in the business. And that's in Canada and the US. So I want to say thanks for coming on the show.

MACKAY: Well, thanks. It's a pleasure. Thanks, Jon and Ayesha.

WELLS: Thanks to the audience. And again, you can see Graeme MacKay's archives and other information on the link that we'll put on our podcast webpage. And my thanks to Ayesha Nasir, as always, and we'll talk to you later on The Message.

""It's certainly a new phenomenon and it seems to ...","Not long ago, if a U.S. presidential hopeful from either party was mounting a serious bid for the Oval Office, the candidate would seek a spot on the main stage at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) policy conference, the largest U.S. gathering of the pro-Israel lobby.

This year, it seems, not so much.

While the 2019 speakers list was stacked with officials from President Donald Trump's administration and Republican Party grandees, most major Democratic presidential candidates for 2020 were missing from the conference altogether.

The three-day event, which ended Tuesday, included speeches from Vice-President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and House minority leader Kevin McCarthy.

So I am troubled that leading Democrats seem to have some difficulty plainly calling out anti-semitism within their own ranks. And I am troubled that many of the declared Democrat presidential candidates seem to be avoiding <a href=""https://twitter.com/AIPAC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@AIPAC</a> this year. —@senatemajldr

Nine of the biggest names in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination skipped the conference this year, and not one Democratic candidate was on the speakers list.

Jewish Americans have long aligned themselves with liberal causes. About 75 per cent of Jews voted Democratic in the 2018 midterms. But some delegates at this year's conference noted with dismay recent comments by freshman Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar that they felt trafficked in stereotypes about Jewish political influence and money.

Recent polling suggests there is more willingness among younger progressive voters to criticize Israel.

Some AIPAC attendees who spoke with CBC News wondered whether the party has shifted too far to the left. Here's what some of them said.

Michael Goldberg, 49, Democrat from New York:

Michael Goldberg is waiting for a more 'centrist' Democrat to get in the race. (Matt Kwong/CBC)

""It used to be that Democrats and Republicans had to fight to get a spot on the stage,"" Goldberg said.

Noting the lack of 2020 candidates on the speakers' list, he asked, ""Who's here that's running for the presidency for the Democrats?""

The attorney and father of three admitted that he feels ""a bit politically lost.""

He supported Barack Obama during his two terms in office. He and his wife have been ""lifelong Democrats,"" and are still registered with the party. But they voted for Trump in 2016 and may do so again in 2020, unless a Democrat they consider ""more centrist"" decides to run.

The ‘Jexodus’ movement encourages Jewish people to leave the Democrat Party. Total disrespect! Republicans are waiting with open arms. Remember Jerusalem (U.S. Embassy) and the horrible Iran Nuclear Deal! <a href=""https://twitter.com/OANN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@OANN</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/foxandfriends?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@foxandfriends</a> —@realDonaldTrump

Asked about talk of an ""Exodus"" or ""Jexodus"" — a movement begun by conservatives to woo Jewish-Americans away from the Democrats to the Republicans — Goldberg gave a knowing nod.

""It's me and my wife. That's what happened,"" he said. ""The Democrats were friends of the Jewish people. They were friends of Israel. But it's a different party now.""

Vicki Fishman, 47, Independent from Washington, D.C.:

Vicki Fishman is an Independent who lives in Washington. (Matt Kwong/CBC)

""The American Jewish community stands for social justice, and the Democratic Party has positioned itself as being the party of social justice,"" Fishman said.

She's aware the eventual Democratic nominee often addresses AIPAC in an election year, as has been the case in the past three presidential election cycles, and that the upcoming election is still 19 months away.

""This is an off-year,"" she said.

Indeed, AIPAC's policy is to invite presidential candidates to speak only in election years. Even so, Hillary Clinton addressed AIPAC in 2016 as well as the off-year in 2015. Obama spoke there before the 2008 election, as well as in 2011 and again in the lead-up to his re-election in 2012. In 2007, a non-election year, both Clinton and Obama competed for Jewish voters, holding big events at AIPAC.

Rep. Ilhan Omar's tweets have ""complicated"" the public discourse for the Democratic Party, Fishman said. But she considers it to be a distraction.

""We're living in a polarized country right now, and that's just adding to the general polarization, and maybe that's taking up within the party.""

Katie Draisen, 20, Democrat from Boston:

Katie Draisen supports Elizabeth Warren's bid to be the Democratic presidential candidate in 2020. (Matt Kwong/CBC)

""There are so many conservative politicians here. It's really concerning to me as someone who is pro-Israel, Jewish-American because it feels to me like Jewish-Americans are being used by Republicans to gain voters,"" said Draisen, a self-described liberal Democrat.

""Knowing that Mitch McConnell is here, that makes me want to throw up.""

Draisen, a student at Boston University, supports Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren's bid for the Democratic nomination, though she declined to attend the conference.

Trump's closeness with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has aroused skepticism among her Gen Z progressive friends ""who see Israel and pro-Israel Americans as villains,"" Draisen said.

Netanyahu was listed as a speaker, but skipped AIPAC after a Gaza rocket attack. Netanyahu sent in a video address from Israel on Tuesday. A few months earlier, he reportedly told an aide, ""We don't need AIPAC anymore,"" reasoning he had enough support from American evangelicals and Trump.

Dismayed as she was that major Democratic 2020 hopefuls didn't attend, Draisen also said she saw political risk for them had they showed up at AIPAC. Doing so, she said, would be ""a big turnoff to most liberal Democrats.""

""It's unfortunate because I think most people don't understand the importance of supporting Israel, supporting a two-state solution, and learning.""

Marcia Jacobs, 86, Republican from Los Angeles:

Marcia Jacobs says she likes many of U.S. President Donald Trump's policies. (Matt Kwong/CBC)

Trump wasn't Jacobs's first choice to be president, but she has come to see the commander-in-chief as a staunch ally of Israel. Among the actions that convinced her was the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, as well as its recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel by moving the embassy there.

""He supports it so strongly, and [Democrats] are so anti-Trump that they're letting it affect any other issue,"" she said.

Jacobs was appalled by reports that the liberal non-profit MoveOn.org had urged Democratic candidates not to attend AIPAC.

""That's absolutely horrific,"" she said.

She also praised Trump for his tweet last week reversing more than 50 years of U.S. foreign policy on the Golan Heights by recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the strategically important strip of rocky highlands located where the borders meet between northern Israel, southern Lebanon and Syria.

Manny Srulowitz, 18, Independent from Long Island, N.Y.:

Manny Srulowitz says he's noticed a new wave of Democrats who are critical of Israel. (Matt Kwong/CBC)

Srulowitz, a moderate, said he was receiving emails last week from a pro-Israel organization informing him about the latest Democrats to pull out of AIPAC. He comes from a Republican household that voted for Trump in 2016.

""I wouldn't have enough knowledge to give you a confident answer about why the Democrats are all leaving,"" he said, ""but it's very evident the Democrats are not here.""

The high school senior from Long Island will be 20 years old in 2020, but doesn't see a Democratic candidate yet who would capture his vote.

""I have noticed there is a new wave of young and critical Democrats, usually the younger ones,"" he said of what he sees as declining support for Israel among people of his generation. ""I am not one of them. I am a big fan of the state of Israel.""

Ira and Susan Kapinow, 78 and 76, Independents from Potomac, Md.:

Susan and Ira Kapinow say they can't see themselves voting for Trump in 2020, but they don't like some of the things they see going on in the Democratic Party. (Matt Kwong/CBC)

As ""middle-of-the-roaders"" who try to avoid extremes in their politics, this is a fraught time for Ira and Susan Kapinow, married retirees and strong supporters of Israel.

Susan was troubled by support among at least two Democratic newcomers in Congress for the so-called BDS movement — a campaign calling for a boycott, divestment and sanctions against Israel.

""I find it offensive. Israel is a strong ally and a strong friend,"" Susan said.

The Kapinows can't see themselves happily voting for Trump in 2020. But when they look at the growing divide over Israel within the Democratic Party, they have concerns about how the progressive candidates are breaking with what they viewed as conventional pro-Israel policy.

""It's certainly a new phenomenon and it seems to be generational,"" Ira said. ""The older Democrats were more supportive of Israel, the more traditional way. The younger Democrats are moving more and more to the left on Israel. Way too far left.""

Stewart Eisenberg, 64, Democrat from Philadelphia:

Stewart Eisenberg says he wasn't concerned about the lack of big-name Democratic presidential hopefuls at the conference this year. (Matt Kwong/CBC)

A liberal Democrat who voted for Clinton in 2016, Eisenberg has attended AIPAC's annual policy conference more than 20 times.

""You would like to see some presidential candidates from both sides, but we don't have the presidential candidate from the Republican side, either,"" he said.

He wasn't concerned about the lack of big-name Democratic presidential hopefuls this year, noting that top Democrats in Congress such as Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gave speeches, as well as House majority leader Steny Hoyer.

Eisenberg balked at the idea of a ""Jexodus.""

""I think it's overblown,"" he said. ""You have certain people on the right and certain people on the left that have different views about Israel. Both parties have taken a turn to the radical side on both extremes, but in the general majority of the party on both sides, there has always been bipartisan support for Israel. That continues.""",Lack of big-name Democratic candidates at pro-Israel conference confirms for some voters the party has changed,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/aipac-democrats-jexodus-1.5072069

Her track record as San Francisco’s district attorney and California’s attorney general has drawn scrutiny in a Democratic Party that has ...,"(Reuters) - A crowded field of fresh faces and veteran U.S. lawmakers has lined up to seek the Democratic Party’s 2020 presidential nomination.

The diverse group vying to challenge President Donald Trump, the likely Republican nominee, includes six U.S. senators. A record six women are running, as well as black, Hispanic and openly gay candidates who would make history if one of them became the party’s nominee.

Here are the Democrats who have launched campaigns or are expected to pursue a presidential bid, listed in order of their RealClearPolitics national polling average.

JOE BIDEN

The leader in polls of Democratic presidential contenders is not even a candidate yet. But Biden, who served eight years as vice president under former President Barack Obama and 36 years in the U.S. Senate, looks poised to join the 2020 race. At 76, he will be the second oldest candidate in the Democratic primary, after Senator Bernie Sanders. Biden will be a key figure in the Democratic debate over whether a liberal political newcomer or a centrist veteran is needed to win back the White House. Liberal activists criticize his Senate record, including his authorship of the 1994 crime act that led to increased incarceration rates, and his ties to the financial industry, which is prominent in his home state of Delaware. Biden, who relishes his “Middle-Class Joe” nickname and touts his working-class roots, made unsuccessful bids for the nomination in 1988 and 2008.

BERNIE SANDERS

The senator from Vermont lost the Democratic nomination in 2016 to Hillary Clinton but has jumped in for a second try. In the 2020 race, Sanders, 77, will have to fight to stand out in a packed field of progressives touting issues he brought into the Democratic Party mainstream four years ago. His proposals include free tuition at public colleges, a $15 minimum wage and universal healthcare. He benefits from strong name recognition and a robust network of small-dollar donors, helping him to raise $5.9 million during his first day in the contest. Sanders, whose father was a Jewish immigrant from Poland, has shown a more personal side in this campaign, highlighting his struggles while growing up in a working-class family. He also has tried to reach out to black and Hispanic leaders after having trouble winning over minority voters in 2016.

KAMALA HARRIS

The first-term senator from California would make history as the first black woman to gain the nomination. Harris, 54, the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India, announced her candidacy on the holiday honoring slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. She has made a quick impact in a Democratic race that will be heavily influenced by women and minority voters. She raised $1.5 million in the first 24 hours of her campaign and drew record ratings on a CNN televised town hall. She supports a middle-class tax credit, Medicare for All healthcare funding reform, the Green New Deal and the legalization of marijuana. Her track record as San Francisco’s district attorney and California’s attorney general has drawn scrutiny in a Democratic Party that has shifted in recent years on criminal justice issues.

BETO O’ROURKE

The former three-term Texas congressman jumped into the race on March 14 - and has been jumping on to store countertops ever since to deliver his optimistic message to voters in early primary states. O’Rourke, 46, gained fame last year for his record fundraising and ability to draw crowds ahead of his unexpectedly narrow loss in the U.S. Senate race against Republican incumbent Ted Cruz. O’Rourke announced a $6.1 million fundraising haul for the first 24 hours of his campaign, besting his Democratic opponents. But with progressive policies and diversity at the forefront of the party’s nominating battle, O’Rourke will face a challenge as a wealthy white man who is more moderate on several key issues than many of his competitors.

ELIZABETH WARREN

The 69-year-old senator from Massachusetts is a leader of the party’s liberals and a fierce Wall Street critic who was instrumental in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. She has focused her presidential campaign on her populist economic message, promising to fight what she calls a rigged economic system that favors the wealthy. She also has proposed eliminating the Electoral College, vowed to break up Amazon, Google and Facebook if elected, and sworn off political fundraising events to collect cash for her bid. Warren apologized earlier this year to the Cherokee Nation for taking a DNA test to prove her claims to Native American ancestry, an assertion that has prompted Trump to mockingly refer to her as “Pocahontas.”

CORY BOOKER

Booker, 49, a black senator from New Jersey and former mayor of Newark, gained national prominence in the fight over Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination. He has made U.S. race relations and racial disparities a focus of his campaign, noting the impact of discrimination on his family. He embraces progressive positions on Medicare coverage for every American, the Green New Deal and other key issues, and touts his style of positivity over attacks. Booker eats a vegan diet and recently confirmed rumors he is dating actress Rosario Dawson.

The third-term senator from Minnesota was the first moderate in the Democratic field vying to challenge Trump. Klobuchar, 58, gained national attention in 2018 when she sparred with Brett Kavanaugh during Senate hearings for his Supreme Court nomination. On the campaign trail, the former prosecutor and corporate attorney supports an alternative to traditional Medicare healthcare funding and is taking a hard stance against rising prescription drug prices. Klobuchar’s campaign reported raising more than $1 million in its first 48 hours. Her campaign announcement came amid news reports that staff in her Senate office were asked to do menial tasks, making it difficult to hire high-level campaign strategists.

PETE BUTTIGIEG

The 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is emerging from underdog status as he begins to build momentum with young voters. A Harvard University graduate and Rhodes Scholar at the University of Oxford, he speaks seven languages and served in Afghanistan with the U.S. Navy Reserve. He touts himself as representing a new generation of leadership needed to combat Trump. Buttigieg would be the first openly gay presidential nominee of a major American political party.

JULIAN CASTRO

The secretary of housing and urban development under President Barack Obama would be the first Hispanic to win a major U.S. party’s presidential nomination. Castro, 44, whose grandmother was a Mexican immigrant who immigrated to Texas, has used his family’s personal story to criticize Trump’s border policies. Castro advocates for a universal pre-kindergarten program, supports Medicare for All and cites his experience to push for affordable housing. He announced his bid in his hometown of San Antonio, where he once served as mayor and a city councilman. His twin brother, Joaquin Castro, is a Democratic congressman from Texas.

KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND

Gillibrand, known as a moderate when she served as a congresswoman from upstate New York, has refashioned herself into a staunch progressive, calling for strict gun laws and supporting the Green New Deal. The senator for New York, who is 52, has led efforts to address sexual assault in the military and on college campuses, and she pushed for Congress to improve its own handling of sexual misconduct allegations. On the campaign trail, she has made fiery denunciations of Trump. She released her tax returns for the years 2007 through 2018, offering the most comprehensive look to date at the finances of a 2020 White House candidate, and has called on her rivals to do the same.

JAY INSLEE

The Washington state governor has made fighting climate change the central issue of his campaign. As governor, Inslee, 68, has moved to put a moratorium on capital punishment and fully implement the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, and accompanying expansion of Medicaid health coverage for the poor. He has not settled on a position on Medicare for All but does support the Green New Deal backed by progressives. Inslee spent 15 years in Congress before being elected governor in 2012.

JOHN HICKENLOOPER

The 67-year-old former Colorado governor has positioned himself as a centrist and an experienced officeholder with business experience. He is the only Democratic presidential candidate so far to oppose the Green New Deal plan to tackle climate change, saying it would give the government too much power in investment decisions. During his two terms in office, Colorado’s economy soared and the Western state expanded healthcare, passed a gun control law and legalized marijuana. The former geologist and brew pub owner is among the many candidates who have refused to take corporate money. He previously served as mayor of Denver.

JOHN DELANEY

The former U.S. representative from Maryland became the first Democrat to enter the 2020 race, declaring his candidacy in July 2017. Delaney, 55, plans to focus on advancing only bipartisan bills during the first 100 days of his presidency if elected. He’s also pushing for a universal healthcare system, raising the federal minimum wage and passing gun safety legislation.

TULSI GABBARD

The Samoan-American congresswoman from Hawaii and Iraq war veteran is the first Hindu to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives. After working for her father’s anti-gay advocacy group and drafting relevant legislation, she was forced to apologize for her past views on same-sex marriage. Gabbard, 37, has been against U.S. intervention in Syria and slammed Trump for standing by Saudi Arabia after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. She endorsed Bernie Sanders during his 2016 presidential campaign.

ANDREW YANG

The entrepreneur and former tech executive is focusing his campaign on an ambitious universal income plan. Yang, 44, wants to guarantee all American citizens between the ages of 18 and 64 a $1,000 check every month. The son of immigrants from Taiwan, Yang also is pushing for Medicare for All and proposing a new form of capitalism that is “human-centered.” He lives in New York.

MARIANNE WILLIAMSON The 66-year-old New York Times best-selling author, motivational speaker and Texas native believes her spirituality-focused campaign can heal America. A 1992 interview on Oprah Winfrey’s show propelled her to make a name for herself as a “spiritual guide” for Hollywood and a self-help expert. She is calling for $100 billion in reparations for slavery over 10 years, gun control, education reform and equal rights for lesbian and gay communities. In 2014, she made an unsuccessful bid for a House seat in California as an independent.

WAYNE MESSAM

Messam, 44, defeated a 16-year incumbent in 2015 to become the first black mayor of in the Miami suburb of Miramar. He was re-elected in March. The son of Jamaican immigrants, he played on Florida State University’s 1993 national championship team, and then started a construction business with his wife. He has pledged to focus on reducing gun violence, mitigating climate change and reducing student loan debt and the cost of healthcare.",Factbox: Big Democratic field taking shape for 2020 U.S. presidential race,Reuters,https://in.reuters.com/article/usa-election-2020-candidates-idINKCN1R92CI
133,Politics,2019-03-28T20:24:00.0000000Z,"This weekend the New York Times breaks one of the biggest taboos, describing the responsibility of Jewish donors for the Democratic Party’s slavish support for Israel. Nathan Thrall’s ...","This weekend the New York Times breaks one of the biggest taboos, describing the responsibility of Jewish donors for the Democratic Party’s slavish support for Israel. Nathan Thrall’s groundbreaking piece repeats a lot of data we’ve reported here and says in essence that it really is about the Benjamins, as Rep. Ilhan Omar said so famously.

The donor class of the party is overwhelmingly Jewish, and Jews are still largely wed to Zionism– that’s the nut.

Though that party is breaking up. Thrall’s labors are minimized by the New York Times with the headline “The Battle Over B.D.S.,” but his message is that the progressive base has a highly-critical view of Israel that the leadership has refused to reflect, and that’s about to change. We’re inside the tent. The party is going to have to reflect pro-Palestinian positions. Ben Rhodes tells Thrall that the moment of overcoming the fear of the pro-Israel lobby (as the Cuba fear was overcome) is about to happen.

The article is a thorough-going rebuke of every journalist and former official (Daniel Shapiro, former ambassador under Obama, for instance, as well as the Forward and the Times opinion writers) who says that money is not at the root, or very near the root, of Democratic Party support.

So let’s follow the money, and review the money quotes. Deep into his piece, Thrall explains why progressives aren’t being heard. Megadonors.

For all the recent tumult over Israel in Washington, the policy debate remains extremely narrow… Despite pointed critiques of American support for Israel by representatives like Betty McCollum of Minnesota, [Rashida] Tlaib and Omar, there is little willingness among Democrats to argue publicly for substantially changing longstanding policy toward Israel. In part, some Hill staff members and former White House officials say, this is because of the influence of megadonors: Of the dozens of personal checks greater than $500,000 made out to the largest PAC for Democrats in 2018, the Senate Majority PAC, around three-fourths were written by Jewish donors. This provides fodder for anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, and for some, it is the elephant in the room. Though the number of Jewish donors known to prioritize pro-Israel policies above all other issues is small, there are few if any pushing in the opposite direction…

As we reported from Ben Rhodes’s book, Rhodes tells Thrall that donors forced Obama to hew to the Netanyahu line.

According to Ben Rhodes, a former deputy national-security adviser and one of Obama’s closest confidants, several members of the Obama administration wanted to adopt a more assertive policy toward Israel but felt that their hands were tied. “The Washington view of Israel-Palestine is still shaped by the donor class… The donor class is profoundly to the right of where the activists are, and frankly, where the majority of the Jewish community is.” Peter Joseph, an emeritus chairman of the center-left Israel Policy Forum, told me that the views of major Democratic Jewish donors could act as a check on the leftward pull by progressive voters who are strongly critical of Israel: “I can’t imagine that mainstream Democratic Jewish donors are going to be happy about any Democratic Party that is moving in that direction.”

Off the record, people go further. The Obama administration didn’t just support the occupation, it kept supporting it right up till the November 2016 election so that Hillary Clinton wouldn’t lose donors. We reported as much at the time. Another former member of the Obama White House, who asked not to be named, fearing professional retaliation, said that concerns about donors among Democrats dominated not just “what was done but what was not done, and what was not even contemplated.” Even the timing of the administration’s policies toward Israel was dictated by domestic politics. Faced with a 2016 United Nations Security Council resolution condemning settlements, the Obama administration abstained (effectively supporting the resolution), but only after having signaled it would not consider backing any resolution before November. “There is a reason the U.N. vote did not come up before the election in November,” the former official said. “Was it because you were going to lose voters to Donald Trump? No. It was because you were going to have skittish donors. That, and the fact that we didn’t want Clinton to face pressure to condemn the resolution or be damaged by having to defend it.” Everyone knows this math. And the Democrats fear they’ll lose all their money. What worries establishment Democrats, the former official added, is that the partisan divide over Israel will concretize — with Republicans defined as pro-Israel, Democrats defined as anti-Israel — and that the party coffers will empty. Joel Rubin, a deputy assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs in the Obama administration, former political director at J Street and a founding board member of the centrist Jewish Democratic Council of America, agreed: “The fight over Israel used to be about voters. It’s more about donors now.” Thrall says the Democratic Party leadership is perfectly happy with AIPAC, but he leaves out what we reported here: the extent of the reliance on Jewish donors is “gigantic” and “shocking,” according to insiders JJ Goldberg and the head of Emily’s List, and AIPAC gets to script congressional campaigns on their middle east positions before the candidates can raise money from the Jewish community. We always said Sanders could be better on Palestine because he avoided the donor class of the Democratic party. Rhodes agrees. “If you don’t rely on a traditional fund-raising model, then you have more freedom on these types of issues,” Rhodes said. “You’re not worried about the one-hour phone call that you’re going to have to do after the presidential debate with a really angry donor.” The key element here is, older Jewish donors are conservative about Israel. A former Clinton campaign official: “There’s no major donor that I can think of who is looking for someone to take a Bernie-like approach.” And whereas none of the most liberal Jewish donors have threatened to withdraw support because a candidate was too pro-Israel, pro-Israel donors and PACs have a history of financing opposition to candidates deemed unfriendly. Haim Saban, one of Hillary Clinton’s top five donors in 2016, has financed opponents of Democratic candidates critical of Israel Sadly the Jewish community is largely supportive of Israel, as Thrall shows. By and large, American Jews are Zionists. Trump’s horrors in the Middle East are OK by them. In the same [Mellman] poll — conducted after the United States closed the Palestinian diplomatic mission in Washington, moved the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, appointed a fund-raiser for the settlements as U.S. ambassador and cut humanitarian aid to Palestinians — roughly half of American Jews said they approved of President Trump’s handling of relations with Israel. On what is considered the most divisive issue in U.S.-Israel relations, the establishment of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, a November 2018 post-midterm election poll of more than 1,000 American Jews that was commissioned by J Street, the pro-Israel lobby aligned with Democrats, found that roughly half said the expansion of settlements had no impact on how they felt about Israel. Those Jews are conservative compared to the base, which is increasingly people of color and real progressives. Members of the Democratic Party’s progressive activist base, by contrast, find themselves light years from their representatives in Washington. And any declension in US support is seen as alienating the donor class. Joel Rubin said: “The problem for center-left groups that are more critical of Israel is that the Jewish donor class is comfortable with current U.S. policies. They just don’t like Trump on other issues.” In October, just weeks before the 2018 midterm election, as the Democratic leadership was working to take back the House, a Democratic staff member, who asked not to be named for fear of professional retaliation, told me that it was important to retain the support of all major donors, not just the most liberal ones. Referring to two of the largest Jewish donors to Democrats, on opposite ends of the political spectrum, the staff member said: “Our members need George Soros and Haim Saban. And they need everything in between.” Thrall shows that fear of losing donors played a role when the University of Michigan student body passed a narrow divestment measure last fall– to divest only from companies doing business in the occupation— and still the administration said No way. Michigan’s administration quickly issued a statement that it would not appoint a committee to investigate divestment. A month later, the board of regents released a letter backing the decision. (The two regents who didn’t sign it were the only people of color on the board.) Like many large American universities, the University of Michigan has extensive research partnerships with Israeli universities. And many of its institutes and buildings are named after alumni donors who have contributed large sums to Israel or pro-Israel groups. Lara Friedman of Foundation for Middle East Peace and formerly of Peace Now continues to blaze a trail by honestly describing the intolerance in the Jewish community for debate of Israel. That community has pushed the anti-BDS legislation. “The American Jewish community, which is broadly speaking liberal, has allowed itself in the name of defending Israel and fighting B.D.S. to become the leading edge of illiberalism by pushing legislation to curb free speech.”

OK now let’s get to some of the good news here. Thrall’s overall point is that the battle is breaking out, thanks to those women of color in the House and the progressive base.

As the Democratic Party is pulled toward a more progressive base and a future when a majority of the party will most likely be people of color, tensions over Israel have erupted. In the past several months, a fierce debate over American support for Israel has periodically dominated the news cycle and overshadowed the Democrats’ policymaking agenda.

BDS is gaining ground. Israel knows it.

Emmanuel Nahshon, a spokesman for Israel’s foreign ministry, told me, “Despite the overwhelming support for Israel in the U.S., we see that the attempt to delegitimize Israel is gaining ground, especially among extreme left-wing marginal groups.”

When have you ever seen such a fair assessment of BDS in the Times?

Instead of tying itself to a specific outcome, the B.D.S. movement insisted on these three principles, which could be fulfilled any number of ways: two states, one state with equal individual rights, a confederation with equal collective rights.

This is a simple turn by Thrall on why Zionism is racist at its core.

Following the 1948 war, which erupted after the United Nations announced its plan to partition Palestine into two states, the Jews who fled could return; Palestinians could not.

Here’s another great moment, brilliant reporting.

I asked [Zionist Organization of America’s Morton] Klein why he believed it was “utterly racist and despicable,” as he put it, for [Richard] Spencer to promote a state for only one ethnic group but not racist for Israel to do so. “Israel is a unique situation,” he said. “This is really a Jewish state given to us by God.” He added, “God did not create a state for white people or for black people.” Senator Charles Schumer, the Democratic minority leader, similarly told the Aipac conference in 2018: “Of course, we say it’s our land, the Torah says it, but they don’t believe in the Torah. So that’s the reason there is not peace.”

Thrall says Israel is Jim Crow society thru and thru.

Currently, hundreds of Israeli towns have admissions committees that can bar Palestinian citizens from living in them based on “social suitability.” (It’s illegal for people to be excluded on the basis of race, religion or nationality, but the rubric of “social suitability” permits the rejection of applicants who are not Zionist, haven’t served in the army or don’t intend to send their children to Hebrew-language schools.) More than 900 towns in Israel contain no Arab families, according to Yosef Jabareen, a professor at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa. Palestinian schools can lose government funding if they commemorate the Nakba, the displacement of Palestinians in 1948. Israeli law forbids citizens to obtain citizenship or permanent residency for Palestinian spouses from the West Bank and Gaza.

And that’s why MD Rep. Donna Edwards and two white congressional colleagues locked arms and sang We Shall Overcome in apartheid Hebron:

Edwards and her colleagues looked up to see garbage-filled nets hanging above their heads, put up to catch trash thrown by Israeli settlers. “We had never seen anything like that,” she told me recently. “Hebron is the place where I think you can see in the most frightening way what the injustice is, where you have people on one side of the street who live one way and people on another side of the street living another way. And streets that some people can cross and walk on, but other people cannot. To me, it looked like the stories that my mother and my grandmother told me about living in the South.”

The great news at the end of the article. Edwards et al are taking over the party. Thrall cites Electronic Intifada’s influence, and Jewish Voice for Peace, and IfNotNow too.

Politicians speaking on Israel-Palestine used to worry primarily about attacks from pro-Israel media and activist groups; now progressives are starting to feel some heat from the pro-Palestinian side.

But it’s over. All the anti-Omar stuff of recent weeks is just the froth on the wave. Jim Zogby got slamdunked on the platform in 2016 by the Clintonites. But that wont’ happen again.

James Zogby… says that standing for Palestinian rights is guaranteed to be a major topic in the 2020 election: “It’s a smell-test issue. If you go to young people, they know you stink if you don’t talk about it right.” A senior Democratic staff member on Capitol Hill told me: “People like Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and Bernie Sanders have opened the floodgates on this issue. It may be painful for the party as we move in a more progressive direction. But we’ll come out in a better place — a more moral and evenhanded place — in the end.”

This piece is going to resonate for weeks. It’s going to come under fierce attack. Because it’s huge, and it’s calm and factual. It doesn’t say a word about Christian Zionists because they don’t have influence in the Democratic Party. And Thrall did the shrewd thing of avoiding the word “lobby.” I guess it’s been anathematized, but that’s what this article is about. That and race. People of color are driving this change. They are going to be punished. Betty McCollum doesn’t get taken to the woodshed for calling it apartheid, but one county west, Ilhan Omar is going to be primaried next year.",‘New York Times’ reports that Jewish donors shape Democrats’ regressive position on Israel,Mondoweiss,https://mondoweiss.net/2019/03/regressive-democratic-groundbreaking/

Yes, the United Conservative Party will appear on ballots for the first time, since it didn't exist the last time Albertans went to the polls in a general election.

But most Albertans are well aware of the UCP — especially after the first week of the campaign, which was dominated by Jason Kenney's party and its main rival, Rachel Notley's New Democratic Party.

In total, there are now 13 political parties registered with Elections Alberta.

The dormant Progressive Conservative and Wildrose parties are still on the list, but won't field any candidates. That's due to the merger of the two parties under the UCP banner in 2017.

New choices include the Alberta Independence Party, added to the list of registered political parties just this week, and the Alberta Advantage Party.

3 ways to get on the list

Drew Westwater, deputy returning officer with Elections Alberta, said after the election was called on Tuesday, the Alberta Independence Party was able to endorse candidates in at least half of the 87 electoral divisions.

According to the Election Finances and Contributions Disclosures Act, there are three ways to qualify a party for registration:

hold at least three seats in the legislative assembly;

endorse candidates in at least half of the electoral divisions in Alberta;

collect 7,868 signatures on a petition to illustrate support. (The number represents 0.3 per cent of electors eligible to vote in the last general election.)

""I know this is a new one for Alberta,"" Westwater said of the Alberta Independence Party.

""It's the first time someone has done that and qualified under this provision of the act.

""Now we have a new party for electors to choose from in the upcoming election.""

Westwater said that by qualifying as a registered political party, the party's candidates can officially appear on the ballot under their party name. Without the party being registered, those candidates would have to list as ""independent.""

New parties try to get attention

Another new party appearing for the first time this election is the four-month-old Alberta Advantage Party.

Leader Marilyn Burns knows she faces a big challenge in getting noticed, but said the consequences of not being on the ballot are bigger.

The leader of the new Alberta Advantage Party, Marilyn Burns, says it's a challenge to get noticed, but important that Albertans have a choice in the election. (Alberta Advantage Party)

Supporters combed Alberta to gather 8,600 signatures on a petition to form the Alberta Advantage Party, said Burns.

The process of canvassing voters directly, said Burns, has given her a good indication of how people are feeling going into the election.

""What we've heard loud and clear, and continue to hear, is a visceral hatred for the NDP that is not going to change no matter what Jason Kenney does,"" she said.

That sentiment is balanced by ""the strong dislike and distrust of Jason Kenney,"" Burns added.

Choice and consequences

The upstart Freedom Conservative Party was created in 2018 by former UCP MLA Derek Fildebrandt.

Fildebrandt anticipates more about 30 FCP candidates will run in the election. He said his biggest challenge is to get people to think of options when they go to the polls.

""The media tend to give the impression you've only got two choices in politics.You've got the red team and you've got the blue team,"" Fildebrandt said in an interview with Radio-Canada.

""You've got Diet Coke and you've got Coke Zero, and there's a lot more to it than that.""

Little room for small parties

Mount Royal University political scientist Duane Bratt said this election is significant because it has put Alberta into the position of a two-party race for perhaps the first time in recent history.

""We've gone into new terrain here,"" Bratt said.

""I think there is room in the centre in this very polarized environment, but not in this election.""

He said it will take at least one election cycle to open up the field again.

""Throughout every step of this process, we've focused on empowering the grassroots and ensuring that we hold the most transparent, inclusive, and fair primary in our party's history.""

Florida is a key swing state and helped hand President Trump his victory in 2016. Miami has a large Hispanic population, a diverse demographic which often leans left but can swing toward Republicans in Florida. Republican Rick Scott clinched his victory in the 2018 Senate race by winning 48 percent of the state's Hispanic vote.

There will be 12 primary debates in total, with CNN hosting the second at an unspecified date and location in July. The DNC made waves earlier in March for announcing it would not partner with Fox News for a debate.

In February, the DNC detailed the criteria candidates must meet to be included in the first two debates. Each candidate must have at least 1 percent support in three separate polls from a list of reputable state and national polling outfits determined by the committee. Candidates must also meet two fundraising thresholds: donations from at least 65,000 individuals, and 200 unique donors from at least 20 states.

Candidates who meet both criteria will be included in the debate. If more than 20 candidates meet the threshold, the DNC said it will use ""a methodology that gives primacy to candidates meeting both thresholds, followed by the highest polling average, followed by the most unique donors"" to determine participants.

The format is meant to give ""all types of candidates the opportunity to reach the debate stage and [give] small-dollar donors a bigger voice in the primary than ever before,"" Perez said at the time.

His successor agreed — and said the new wave of activism also has provided ""an army of motivated volunteers."" ""I think there will ...","The 50 or so party faithful gathered at a western Michigan GOP headquarters prayed for President Donald Trump's re-election and hummed with excitement about his upcoming visit — a meeting-turned-pep rally for the effort they'll mount on his behalf in 2020.

""Are we ready?"" former Michigan Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land asked the group assembled in Grand Rapids on Monday night.

""Yeah!"" the crowd cried back.

The area around former President Gerald Ford's hometown has been very good to Trump, helping deliver him to the White House in 2016 with a victory in a blue state he wasn't supposed to win. But as he returns to Grand Rapids on Thursday night for a rally that will celebrate the completion of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, there is cause for worry.

The Democratic-leaning city and the historically Republican turf surrounding it in Kent County have seen a rise of Democratic activism and electoral success since Trump took office. Democrats also are benefiting from demographic changes, as the area has grown younger and more diverse, and there are signs the improving economy also could be helping them.

Last fall, Democrat Gretchen Whitmer won the governor's race over a Trump-endorsed candidate with help from voters in Kent County. She was the first Democratic gubernatorial nominee to take the county since an incumbent won it in 1986. Democrats also picked up a longtime GOP-held state Senate seat and made gains on the county board.

Local Democratic leaders also point to a flurry of new organizations that popped up to oppose Trump and promote progressive causes, from women's marches to environmental concerns.

""I haven't been to this many marches since the 1960s,"" said Frank Lynn, former chairman of the Kent County Democratic Party.

His successor agreed — and said the new wave of activism also has provided ""an army of motivated volunteers.""

""I think there will be an even higher level of motivation in 2020,"" Chairman Gary Stark said.

But for all the enthusiasm among Democrats, Trump's supporters could be newly energized by the Mueller investigation ending with no evidence of collusion with Russia.

""Democrats are in a pickle and they put themselves here"" by trumpeting the investigation, said Brian ""Boomer"" Patrick, communications director for Republican U.S. Rep Bill Huizenga. ""All the eggs were in one basket on the Mueller report.""

Trump campaign officials acknowledge that they face a battle holding the states Trump swung away from Democrats in 2016, including Michigan and Wisconsin, and that Trump's likeliest path to victory in 2020 almost requires them to do it.

Still, they insist that the lesson of the 2018 midterms is that Trump's core supporters are still enthusiastic about him — as evidenced by several victories in races in which the president invested his time. And in 2020, Trump himself will be atop the ballot and actively campaigning.

""There's nobody that excites and unites voters like President Trump. He brings in new voters that would never be involved in politics,"" Republican National Committee spokesman Rick Gorka said. ""When you have that bully pulpit, and Air Force One lands in your state, it moves people and it moves numbers.""

The Trump campaign is hiring 10 regional political directors for swing states in the coming weeks. The RNC field operation in Michigan has been continuous since before the 2016 election cycle.

Meanwhile, RNC officials say, Democrats must struggle through a fractious primary with more than a dozen candidates fighting for the nomination.

Republicans will focus on what they call Trump's biggest successes, including low unemployment, tax cuts and putting the Islamic State group ""on the run.""

The party already has been painting the Democratic field as ""very extreme,"" criticizing their support for proposals such as ""Medicare For All"" and the Green New Deal, which they say would destroy Michigan's manufacturing and agricultural sectors.

""Whoever emerges, I think there will be very stark differences in policies and beliefs,"" said Michigan GOP Chairwoman Laura Cox.

Democrats are also planning their offensive. Parties in Michigan, Wisconsin and five other battleground states are joining with the Democratic National Committee to train organizers, particularly young people of color, to organize on college campuses and in their communities. Organizing Corps 2020 hopes to have 1,000 trained organizers by this summer.

The Democratic group Priorities USA also plans to spend at least $100 million in battleground states, including Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida.

Two 2020 candidates, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas, campaigned in Michigan this month, and Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Kamala Harris of California have stops scheduled in coming weeks.

Kent Boersema, a 31-year-old security officer and member of the Kent County GOP's executive committee, said he thinks the president will do even better in the area in 2020, as people who supported GOP rivals Ted Cruz or John Kasich in 2016 get behind him this time.

""I got friends that I know — didn't vote for Trump in 2016, but they're voting for him now in 2020. He's going to have a more solid, cohesive Republican Party behind him,"" he said.

Still, he said, Kent County has become more of a swing area politically than the GOP stronghold it once was.

""We've got our work cut out for us,"" he said.

Top Republicans immediately condemned Gov. Laura Kelly’s action as allowing an unlegislated tax increase and hurting the state’s economy. The measure was aimed at preventing individuals and businesses from paying more in state income taxes because of changes in federal tax laws at the end of 2017.

Kelly’s top priorities are boosting funding for public schools and expanding the state’s Medicaid health coverage for the needy, but she told lawmakers in her veto message that the tax bill would have created another “self-inflicted budget crisis.” “We simply cannot go backward now,” Kelly told reporters Monday during a Statehouse news conference. “We cannot fix our state if we repeat the mistakes of the past.” A clash between Kelly and Republican leaders was inevitable. Allowing the tax relief to become law would have undermined the state’s ability to sustain Kelly’s proposals for education funding and Medicaid expansion. Republican leaders have yet to muster the two-thirds majorities necessary to override a veto and enact the tax bill, so Kelly is likely to prevail.

Top Republicans said by allowing an unlegislated tax increase, Kelly broke a campaign promise she made repeatedly last year not to raise taxes while helping public schools, expanding Medicaid and stabilizing the state budget. Her GOP opponent, former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, made returning the tax “windfall” among his key issues. “Today, Laura Kelly showed us how little her words mean,” said Senate President Susan Wagle, a conservative Wichita Republican. “Hardworking Kansans know how to best spend their money and more of it should stay in their own pockets.” Top Republicans also that the issue was akin to deciding whether to return a lost wallet full of cash after finding it on the sidewalk with the owner’s ID inside. “She kept the money — she kept the money for herself,” said House Majority Leader Dan Hawkins, another conservative Wichita Republican. The governor and fellow Democrats noted the persistent budget woes that Kansas experienced after Republican legislators jumped into cutting income taxes in 2012 and 2013 at the urging of then-GOP Gov. Sam Brownback. Voters came to view the experiment as a failure; bipartisan majorities reversed most of the tax cuts in 2017, and Kelly ran against Brownback’s policies.

Kelly’s administration projected that under the bill, taxpayers would save $209 million during the state budget year beginning in July. Like other states, Kansas faced the issue of revising its income tax code because it is tied to the federal tax code. While changes in federal tax laws championed by President Donald Trump lowered rates, they also included provisions that raised money for Kansas, in party by discouraging individual filers from claiming itemized deductions.

The bill vetoed by Kelly would have provided relief to taxpayers who have itemized on their state returns. It would have allowed them to keep itemizing even if they don’t on their federal returns, something previously prohibited. Republican legislators also attached a provision to lower the state’s sales tax on groceries to 5.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent to make the bill harder for Kelly to veto. Kelly herself promised during her campaign last year to work to lower the tax. But much of the relief in the bill would have gone to large businesses that faced paying state income taxes on income generated by operations outside the U.S. because of the federal changes. Kelly said such changes represented “tax breaks to entities who need them the least.” Kelly said she remains open to considering limited changes in tax laws that help working families if they’re offset by other changes that keep the package from lessening the state’s revenues. However, she also said: “The right thing in this case is to not mess with our tax structure at all right now, let our budget stabilize, let our revenues stabilize.” ___ Follow John Hanna on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjdhanna .",Kansas’ new Democratic governor vetoes GOP tax relief bill,Toronto Star,https://www.thestar.com/news/world/us/2019/03/25/kansas-new-democratic-governor-vetoes-gop-tax-relief-bill.html

But communities practically everywhere else would be absolutely crushed."" He told reporters at the ...","The Senate on Tuesday rejected the Green New Deal, with Republicans casting the proposal to reduce dependence on fossil fuels to combat climate change as a far-left idea and with Democrats taking the rare step of voting ""present"" on a politically driven vote.

The measure failed on a 57-to-0 vote, with all Republicans and four Democrats blocking the resolution. Aiming to avoid an intraparty fight on the issue, 43 Democrats - including those who introduced the Green New Deal - voted ""present.""

The vote Tuesday came against the backdrop of historic flooding in the Midwest and repeated warnings, including from agencies in the Trump administration, about the economic and environmental impact of failing to deal with global warming.

Yet the vote amounted to a political show vote as President Donald Trump and Republicans deride the Green New Deal, but few in Congress have worked on crafting a bipartisan approach to deal with climate change.

The broad proposal from freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., envisions the United States achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions within a decade while guaranteeing Americans high-paying jobs and high-quality health care.

Republicans call it unrealistic and see it as a means to divide Democrats, pitting liberals who have embraced the idea, including some 2020 presidential hopefuls, against moderates from Republican-leaning states.

Joining Republicans in voting ""no"" were Democratic Sens. Doug Jones of Alabama, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, as well as Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats.

Forcing the vote was Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who called the plan a ""far-left wish list.""

""The proposal addresses the small matter of eliminating the use of all fossil fuels nationwide in a 10-year time frame,"" McConnell said Tuesday. ""This might sound like a neat idea in places like San Francisco or New York, the places that the Democratic Party seems totally focused on these days. But communities practically everywhere else would be absolutely crushed.""

He told reporters at the Capitol that he believes climate change is real and a result of human behavior. But he added, ""The question is, how do you address it?""

Democrats have countered by calling McConnell's maneuver a ""sham,"" saying the vote was held without any hearings or expert testimony, all to scuttle meaningful legislative efforts on climate change.

""McConnell tried to rush the #GreenNewDeal straight to the floor without a hearing,"" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. ""The real question we should be asking: Why does the Senate GOP refuse to hold any major hearings on climate change?""

The vote was in part intended to put the six Democratic presidential contenders in the Senate on record. But those 2020 hopefuls - all of whom co-sponsored the legislation - voted ""present"" on Tuesday, with several decrying the vote as ""a political game.""

""Combating this crisis first requires the Republican majority to stop denying science and finally admit that climate change is real and humans are the dominant cause,"" one of the 2020 candidates, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said in a statement.

Another presidential contender, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., said it is politically savvy to set a seemingly aspirational goal, as President John F. Kennedy did when he called for sending a man to the moon.

""We don't know if we can get to net-zero carbon emissions in 10 years, but we should certainly try,"" Gillibrand said at a pro-Green New Deal news conference in front of the Capitol. ""Why not let this be a measure of how great we are as a nation?""

Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters Tuesday that McConnell's ""stunt is backfiring"" and that it was becoming clear that ""the Republican Party is way behind the times on clean energy.""

""I heard talk here about floods in the Middle West,"" Schumer said, speaking shortly after Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, raised the issue at the Senate GOP news conference. ""To not do something about climate change when you know your communities are being hurt by it is so badly representing the voters of your state.""

Later on the Senate floor, Ernst again raised the issue of the severe flooding in Iowa, but she made no mention of climate change in her remarks. A spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on what Ernst would like to see done to address the issue.

The main Senate sponsor of the Green New Deal, Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., was unapologetic about the broad scope of his proposal. ""It is the national-security, economic, health care and moral issue of our time,"" he said at Tuesday's press event.

But a chorus of detractors, including some Democrats, have argued that the sweeping resolution contained many items only tangentially related to reducing climate-warming emissions or addressing their impacts.

Others said the goal of drastically curbing the release of the heat-trapping gases across U.S. electricity, manufacturing, transportation and agricultural sectors within just 10 years is impossible to achieve.

Among them is former Colorado governor and 2020 Democratic presidential aspirant John Hickenlooper, who said in an op-ed published Tuesday in The Washington Post that the vision being pushed by Ocasio-Cortez and Markey has ""laudable aims but also take an approach that limits our prospects for success.""

""The resolution sets unachievable goals,"" Hickenlooper said. ""We do not yet have the technology needed to reach 'net-zero greenhouse gas emissions' in 10 years. That's why many wind and solar companies don't support it.""

Ernest Moniz, President Barack Obama's energy secretary, has also criticized the idea of an all-renewable energy economy by 2030 as ""just unrealistic.""

""And putting forward unrealistic goals in my view may impede our progress if it starts to leave behind key constituencies,"" Moniz said last month on the day the Green New Deal was introduced.

A panel of U.N. scientists says the world has about 10 years to rein in emissions and keep the global temperature increase to moderate levels.

One irony of the Green New Deal proposal is that it is forcing some Republicans to put forward their own climate proposals after being led by for two years by Trump, who has repeatedly dismissed the overwhelming consensus among climate scientists that humans are warming the world.

May told her Conservative lawmakers she would step down if her Brexit deal was finally passed by parliament at the third attempt, in a last-ditch bid to win over many of her party’s eurosceptic rebels.

But some were unmoved and the Northern Irish party crucial to getting the agreement through said it would reject the deal again.

Britain was supposed to leave the bloc on Friday but Brussels agreed last week to put back the divorce date until April 12 to give it a chance to resolve a three-year crisis that has split the country down the middle.

However, it still remains uncertain how, when or even whether the United Kingdom, the world’s fifth-biggest economy, will leave the EU. The possibilities that it will leave with no deal to soften the shock to its economy, or delay the departure date to hold a general election, have increased as other options fade.

While May’s deal continued to stumble, an attempt by parliament to take control of the process by holding a series of indicative votes on other options produced no immediate way through the impasse.

None of the proposals, many of which involved closer alignment with the EU than May envisages, won the support of a majority of lawmakers.

WATCH: U.K. lawmakers vote to take control of Brexit process

“In a spectacular display of indecision, the House of Commons has voted against remaining in the EU and every version of leaving the EU,” tweeted James Cleverly, the Conservative Party’s deputy chairman.

Nevertheless, some proposals fared better than May’s deal had done two weeks ago, and parliament was due to hold more indicative votes on Monday after refining the options most likely to secure a majority.

Many Conservative eurosceptics had made clear they would only consider supporting May’s deal if she gave a firm commitment to resign, hoping a new leader would be more sympathetic to their views when negotiating the terms of Britain’s future relationship with the EU.

“I have heard very clearly the mood of the parliamentary party,” May told a meeting of Conservative lawmakers (MPs).

“I know there is a desire for a new approach – and new leadership – in the second phase of the Brexit negotiations – and I won’t stand in the way of that.”

But within hours of May’s offer, the Democratic Unionist Party, which props up her minority government, said it would vote against the deal if May brought it back a third time.

“We’re in a situation where we cannot sign up to the Withdrawal Agreement,” DUP leader Arlene Foster said.

The government gave itself the option of bringing May’s deal back to parliament on Friday, although speaker John Bercow repeated his warning that he would not allow a third vote unless the motion had changed substantially since its last defeat.

May, who voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, had already promised to step down before the next election, due in 2022.

Her deal, defeated in parliament by 149 votes on March 12 and by 230 votes on Jan. 15, means Britain would leave the EU single market and customs union as well as EU political bodies.

But it requires some EU rules to apply unless ways can be found in the future to ensure no border posts need to be rebuilt between British-ruled Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.

Many Conservative rebels and the DUP object to this “Irish backstop,” saying it risks binding Britain to the EU for years.

To succeed, May needs at least 75 lawmakers to come over to her side.

After the ERG met, a spokesman said: “There is no way enough votes are coming out of that room to put the (Withdrawal Agreement) through.”

WATCH: U.K.’s May tells lawmakers: ‘Unless this house agrees to it, no deal will not happen’

While May was addressing her lawmakers, MPs in the main chamber debated eight other Brexit options, ranging from leaving abruptly with no deal to revoking the divorce altogether.

While there was no majority support for any, the option calling for a referendum on any departure deal, and another suggesting a UK-wide customs union with the EU, won more votes than May’s deal did two weeks ago.

Oliver Letwin, a Conservative former cabinet minister who led parliament’s unusual power grab, said it had been expected that none would immediately win a majority, and lawmakers would have another chance on Monday.

The uncertainty around Britain’s most significant political and economic change since World War Two has left allies and investors aghast. Sterling dipped after Wednesday’s events.

If May’s deal were to pass, her office said there would be a contest to replace her after May 22, when Britain would leave the EU.

She would also become the fourth Conservative prime minister in a row to have fallen foul of divisions over Europe within her centuries-old party, following David Cameron, John Major and Margaret Thatcher.

Most voters think the Brexit negotiation has been handled badly and there may now be a slight majority for staying in the EU, recent polls suggest. Many Conservative MPs say May herself has caused the chaos by not negotiating harder with the EU.

“It was inevitable and I just feel she’s made the right decision. She has actually read the mood of the party, which was a surprise,” said Conservative lawmaker Pauline Latham.

The Democratic National Committee announced Thursday that the first debate among the candidates for its 2020 presidential nomination will take place in Miami.

The party used the term “debate,” but it’s actually two events on two successive nights, June 26 and June 27.

There are so many candidates that the debates are being split, with random selection process to decide who appears on what night.

The Democrats already have 16 candidates — including Miramar Mayor Wayne Messam, who announced his candidacy Thursday — and more are sure to join the field.

To qualify for the debates, candidates will have to either meet thresholds of 1 percent in national polling or in early primary states or receive contributions from 65,000 different donors, with at least 200 of them in each of at least 20 states.

When candidates head to a region for a debate, many hold events before and after.

In 2016, Bernie Sanders held his only Florida rally before the state’s presidential primary because he was headed to South Florida for a debate. He was in the region to debate Hillary Clinton at Miami-Dade College’s Kendall campus, so he held a rally for supporters the day before.

The first debates among the 2020 Democratic candidates will be broadcast on NBC and MSNBC and translated into Spanish on the Telemundo network.

“Miami is the perfect place to introduce our extraordinary presidential candidates to the country,” Florida Democratic Party Chairwoman Terrie Rizzo said in a statement. “People are hungry for new leadership in the White House, and after the first debate, they’re going to be fired up and ready to organize for Democrats.”

Tom Perez, the Democratic national chairman, called Miami “a vibrant and dynamic city that reflects the values and diversity of the Democratic Party.”

Tuesday’s vote to begin debate on the nonbinding resolution was likely to fail as Democrats planned to vote “present.” They accused the GOP of quashing debate by blocking public hearings and expert testimony about the consequences of inaction on climate change. The Green New Deal calls for the U.S. to shift away from fossil fuels such as oil and coal and replace them with renewable sources such as wind and solar power. It calls for virtual elimination by 2030 of greenhouse gas emissions responsible for global warming. Republicans say the plan would devastate the economy and lead to a huge tax increase. They call it more evidence of the creep of “socialism” in the Democratic Party, along with “Medicare for All” and a sweeping elections reform package that would allow public financing of congressional campaigns.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky scheduled the vote on the Green New Deal, saying it would force Democrats to take a stand on a plan that “might sound like a neat idea in places like San Francisco or New York” but would result in communities across the country being “absolutely crushed.” By “basically outlawing the only sources of energy that working-class and middle-class families can actually afford,” the Green New Deal would “kill off entire domestic industries” and eliminate millions of jobs, McConnell said. The plan could lead to a spike in household electric bills of over $300 a month, he said. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, called the Green New Deal “ridiculous” and displayed pictures of dinosaurs, cartoon characters and babies on the Senate floor. He said he was treating the plan “with the seriousness it deserves.” Lee’s remarks enraged Democrats, who called climate change deadly serious, citing recent floods in the Midwest, wildfires in the West and hurricanes in the South. “Climate change is not a joke,” said Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, the bill’s lead Senate author. “Mocking it is shameful.”

New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, one of a half-dozen senators seeking the Democratic nomination for president, said Republicans treat climate “as a game” and said Democrats “will not fall for this stunt.” Addressing climate change “should be our nation’s moonshot” in the 21st century, Gillibrand said, calling it a generational challenge similar to the race to the moon in the 1960s.

By Timothy Gardner

WASHINGTON, March 26 (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republicans on Tuesday defeated the ""Green New Deal"" resolution that called for tackling climate change by moving the United States off fossil fuels, while Democrats said the vote was a political stunt on an issue that will not die.

The vote was 57 against the resolution in the 100-member chamber, with 43 Democrats voting ""present,"" avoiding an up-or-down vote. Republicans won over Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema and one independent senator, Angus King, who usually votes with that party.

The Green New Deal, introduced last month by Democrats, marked an initial attempt to define legislation to create government-led investments in clean energy like wind and solar power, infrastructure and social programs.

Democrats have said the plan, which is backed by most of the party's presidential candidates, was designed to spur debate during the 2020 campaign on the intricate problem of how to tackle climate change while boosting the economy, not to force the party to take sides in a quick vote.

But Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell forced a vote before the plan had the chance for a national debate or hearings in Congress.

In a move that likely previews their wider strategy ahead of next year's presidential election, Republicans used the plan to try to sow discord among Democrats, painting their rivals as shifting to socialism and embracing extreme policies.

McConnell wrote on Twitter that Americans would see which senators are against the deal and which ""are so fully committed to radical left-wing ideology that they can't even vote 'no' on self-inflicted economic ruin that would take a sledgehammer to America’s middle class.""

Asked before the vote whether he believes climate change is happening and if humans are contributing to it, McConnell said: “I do. The question is how do you address it."" He said the way to fight climate change was by encouraging private companies to innovate.

The non-binding Green New Deal resolution sought to speed a transition of the U.S. economy away from burning oil, gas and coal and emitting greenhouse gases from cars and industry blamed for climate change. Its name referenced Democratic President Franklin Roosevelt's Depression-era New Deal that used massive government-led investments to lift the economy.

Democratic Senator Edward Markey, who unveiled the plan with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, told reporters that McConnell and other Republicans ""fail to understand ... that the Green New Deal is not just a resolution, it is a revolution.""





TO FIGURE IN 2020 CAMPAIGN

Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein was criticized by Green New Deal supporters after she was filmed last month telling children she opposed the resolution because it was too expensive. But she sided with the majority of Democratic senators in voting ""present,"" to show unity in the party.

Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat running for president in a crowded field, told reporters that most Republican lawmakers were treating climate change like a ""political stunt.""

Gillibrand said most Republican lawmakers were lockstep in support of President Donald Trump's policies of rolling back environmental regulations and withdrawing from the 2015 Paris international climate agreement and ""have refused to put forward any real plan to address climate change in any meaningful way.""

Senator Lamar Alexander, a Republican, has offered a response to climate change that proposes to engage innovation by doubling research funding in 10 technologies including advanced nuclear, batteries and capturing carbon for burial underground, a plan critics say does not act fast enough.

Former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper became the first 2020 Democratic candidate to oppose the plan, writing in the Washington Post that it would give the government too much power in investment decisions. To spur innovations needed to curb climate change, ""government must not shun the private sector,"" Hickenlooper said in the piece.

As scientists say climate change is causing billions of dollars worth of damage by making floods, storms and droughts more intense, debate is expected to amplify ahead of 2020.

Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters the Green New Deal was discussed with Trump at a party lunch on Tuesday. Graham said Trump told Republican senators: ""Make sure you don't kill it too much because I want to run against it.""

View photos From demonetisation to GST, from foreign affairs to new schemes, it is Modi who takes all the decisions and also announces them with fanfare.","In his first election rally in West Bengal last week, Congress president Rahul Gandhi attacked Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, accusing her doing things her way without consulting others.

Without taking Mamata’s name, Rahul said “She neither talks to anyone nor takes anybody’s suggestion. She does whatever she feels like. Does Bengal not have any voice? Bengal is being run by just one person. Should one person be allowed to run an entire state?” he said at a rally in Chanchole.

Well, Mamata is not alone in this. There are two other leaders constituting a trilogy of 3 ‘M’s – Mayawati and Modi – who neither listen nor talk to fellow partymen for suggestions.

The three have a mind of their own making them totally unpredictable. Fear is often the key.

Mamata runs the state and her party with an iron fist. She sets the rules even if they are chaotic, changes them at her whim and fancy, and brooks no opposition.

The other lady in the group, Mayawati, the Behenji of Uttar Pradesh, is no ‘behen’ (sister) to anyone except, probably, to her ego. She takes all the decisions, partymen dread her and, like Mamata, she is a one-woman army. She too is unpredictable and can change decisions and alliances in a jiffy.

But unlike Mamata, Maya has an eye on Delhi; specifically, the PM chair. Mamata is reluctant to leave Bengal and move to Delhi knowing well that the moment she does that, an aggressive BJP and hungry-for-revenge Communist Party (Marxist) would make life miserable for the Trinamool.

Maya has no chair to protect in her state. Her voter base is solid and she could easily move over to Delhi and further shore up her party in Uttar Pradesh and elsewhere. Unlike Mamata, Maya has started spreading her wings to other states including the south. However small, her Bahujan Samaj Party has set up outposts in Karnataka, Kerala and Maharashtra, apart from the Hindi belt, trying to rally the splintered Dalit votes together.

That brings us to the third ‘M’ – Modi, who runs the party and the government his way. What Rahul Gandhi said of Mamata is applicable to Modi too – he neither talks to anyone nor takes anybody’s suggestion. He does whatever he feels like. And, as Rahul wondered, should one person be allowed to run an entire state, in this case the entire nation.

From demonetisation to GST, from foreign affairs to new schemes, it is Modi who takes all the decisions and also announces them with fanfare. Ministers are just either implementers of Modi’s decisions or, like Sushma Swaraj whose role is to rescue or help people in distress through posts on Twitter.

The rather infamous saying ‘India is Indira and Indira is India’ that eulogised Indira Gandhi to a larger than life status is also applicable to Modi. He is the party, the government, the decision-maker and does not entertain any opposition.

Men are more likely to believe that a different leader would fare better as Canada’s head of government (56%, compared to 50% for women).

Trump.

Democrats know their path to the White House must include Michigan and Trump, and the GOP is ready for a rumble.

Ohio has been a vital state in recent years in indicating who wins the White House. But it isn’t technically considered a swing state by pundits as it voted GOP in 2016 and also steered red in the 2018 midterms.

Michigan, meanwhile, is up for grabs.

The president is heading to Grand Rapids, Thursday and will no doubt take a victory lap after initial reports about the FBI probe found not enough evidence to charge him with colluding with the Russians in the 2016 election.

With Michigan on his mind, Trump was seen last week golfing with Detroit’s Kid Rock and recently requested Michigan’s new Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer sit next to him at the National Governor’s Association dinner at the White House.

“President Trump expanded the map, winning states that Republicans have not won in decades,” said Kayleigh McEnany, national press secretary for Trump’s campaign. “Among these states was Michigan. He will be returning to Michigan and sharing his undeniable list of achievements with the American people. He brought back hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs and growing paychecks.”

Unlike 2016 when Hillary Clinton mostly ignored Michigan during the general election, Democrats are armed with new leadership and stepping up to avoid mistakes that possibly cost them the White House.

Whitmer took to Twitter a few weeks ago and rolled out the welcome wagon for Democratic presidential candidates, adding, “all roads to the White House lead through Michigan.”

Presidential hopefuls U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and former Texas Congressman Beto O’Rourke crisscrossed Metro Detroit last Monday with campaign stops.

U.S. Senator Kamala Harris will be in Detroit as the keynote speaker at the influential 64th Annual Fight for Freedom Fund Dinner of the Detroit Branch NAACP on May 5. It’s a high profile speaking platform with over 10,000 people and has been a favorite of previous Democratic presidential candidates (Bill and Hillary Clinton and Al Gore to name a few).

Many in Southeast Michigan are quietly holding their collective breath in anticipation of former Vice President Joe Biden’s decision on whether he will throw his hat into the ring. Biden’s legendary in these parts, and is extremely close with Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan and was a frequent visitor during the Obama years as the auto industry fell apart and GM and FCA went through bankruptcies.

“Just like every other state President Trump won in 2016, Michigan will be critical to the President’s re-election bid in 2020,” said Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the National Republican Committee who hails from a well known Michigan political family. Her grandfather is former Michigan Gov. George Romney (a former presidential candidate), and her uncle is U.S. Senator Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee.

“President Trump’s America First policies continue to benefit Michiganders immensely, from manufacturing jobs coming back to Michigan to the President’s roaring economy,” McDaniel added.

Until 2016 Michigan had voted Democratic in every presidential race since George H. W. Bush in 1988. However, the 2018 mid-terms found a pink and blue wave sweeping Michigan and other states as women won top jobs. In Michigan that included females winning the governor, attorney general, and secretary of state races.

US Congresswoman, Debbie Dingell, raised the warning flag for fellow Democrats 18 months before Trump claimed victory in 2016. She earned the nickname “Debbie Downer” because of her prophetic words about Trump’s campaign catching on with blue collar, the middle class and folks who felt disenfranchised from both parties.

When asked about his prospects this time, Dingell said: “It’s a long time between now and next November.”

“Michigan is at play and whoever connects with the workers will be the winner,” she said. “Yes, the climate is a little different than two years ago but this state remains very competitive. Trade mattered two years ago, trade matters now and Democrats must do a better job of talking about it.”

Peter Secchia, Grand Rapids businessman and former U.S. Ambassador to Italy, has been on board with Trump since the beginning. He isn’t worried about the Democrats.

“People in Michigan welcomed him,” said Secchia, adding Trump’s message is as relevant today as it was in his first campaign. “He professed reality to the ‘changing of the Guard’ in DC he ran on, and voters approved.”

The Michigan Democratic Party just announced it is joining with their counterparts in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. There are strengths in numbers.

“This effort will not only strengthen our respective abilities to defeat Trump in 2020, but it will allow us to get an early start on laying the groundwork to elect Democrats up and down the ballot throughout Michigan and across the country,” said Lavora Barnes, the new chair of the Michigan Democratic Party.

Newly elected Michigan Republican State Party Chair Laura Cox added her thoughts: “Democrats know that their path to retake the White House runs right through our state. President Trump and Republicans across Michigan are ready to fight to deny them that path.”

However, Democratic presidential candidate John Hickenlooper said Tuesday he opposes the Green New Deal. The former Colorado governor said the proposal sets “unachievable goals” and ...","WASHINGTON — The Senate turned away from the Green New Deal on Tuesday as both parties shunned an opportunity to debate a comprehensive climate change plan offered by Democrats.

Republicans in the GOP-controlled Senate forced the vote as they seek to turn the Green New Deal into a wedge issue in the 2020 elections. Democrats called the GOP’s move a “sham” and said it carries its own political risk by mocking an issue — climate change — that a growing number of Americans care deeply about.

Senators voted 57-0 against a procedural motion to take up the nonbinding resolution, which calls for the U.S. to shift away from fossil fuels such as oil and coal and replace them with renewable sources such as wind and solar power.

Three Democrats and independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with Democrats, joined all 53 Senate Republicans in opposing the climate plan. Forty-three Democrats voted “present” to protest the GOP’s action. Democrats accused the GOP of quashing debate by blocking public hearings and expert testimony about the consequences of inaction on climate change.

In shifting the U.S. economy away from fossil fuels, the Green New Deal calls for virtual elimination by 2030 of greenhouse gas emissions responsible for global warming.

The plan has broad support among Democratic activists, and all six of the 2020 presidential contenders serving in the Senate have signed on as co-sponsors, putting it at the forefront of the party’s sprawling primary race.

However, Democratic presidential candidate John Hickenlooper said Tuesday he opposes the Green New Deal. The former Colorado governor said the proposal sets “unachievable goals” and shuns the private sector.

Republicans say the plan would devastate the economy and lead to a huge tax increase. They call it more evidence of the creep of “socialism” in the Democratic Party, along with “Medicare for All” and a sweeping elections reform package that would allow public financing of congressional campaigns.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky scheduled Tuesday’s vote, saying it would force Democrats to take a stand on a plan that “might sound like a neat idea in places like San Francisco or New York” but would result in communities across the country being “absolutely crushed.”

By “basically outlawing the only sources of energy that working-class and middle-class families can actually afford,” the Green New Deal would “kill off entire domestic industries” and eliminate millions of jobs, McConnell said. The plan could lead to a spike in household electric bills of more than $300 a month, he said.

President Donald Trump also weighed in against the plan, which the White House called “job crushing.” At a luncheon with Senate Republicans, Trump urged lawmakers to keep the Green New Deal alive as an issue to use against Democrats.

“He said it’s important to run against,” said Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D. Trump likes the way the Green New Deal makes Democrats “uncomfortable,” said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La.

Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, called the Green New Deal “ridiculous” and displayed pictures of dinosaurs, cartoon characters and babies as he derided the plan. He said he was treating it “with the seriousness it deserves.”

One poster Lee displayed depicted President Ronald Reagan shooting a machine-gun while riding a dinosaur that was holding a U.S. flag. The outlandish image was intended to illustrate the U.S. winning the Cold War, Lee said, but its fictional nature served a purpose: “Because this image has as much to do with overcoming communism in the 20th century as the Green New Deal has to do with overcoming climate change in the 21st,” he said.

Lee’s remarks enraged Democrats, who called climate change deadly serious, citing floods in the Midwest, wildfires in the West and hurricanes in the South.

“Climate change is not a joke,” said Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., the resolution’s lead Senate author. “Mocking it is shameful.”

Freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., the lead House author, trolled Lee’s argument on Twitter. “If this guy can be Senator, you can do anything,” she wrote to her 3.7 million followers.

New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, one of a half-dozen senators seeking the Democratic nomination for president, said Republicans treat climate change “as a game” and said Democrats “will not fall for this stunt.”

Slowing climate change “should be our nation’s moonshot” in the 21st century, Gillibrand said, calling it a generational challenge similar to the race to the moon in the 1960s.

“We don’t know if we can get to net-zero carbon emissions in 10 years, but why not try?” she said at a rally before the Senate vote.

Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said Democrats were being hypocritical by refusing to vote for their own plan. “I’ve never seen a bill sponsored by a dozen people who don’t want to vote on it,” he said.

The Green New Deal goes far beyond energy to urge national health care coverage and job guarantees, high-quality education and affordable housing, as well as “upgrading all existing buildings in the United States” to be energy-efficient. Democrats have not specified a price tag, but Republicans say costs could run into the tens of trillions of dollars.

Early results, announced by the country’s election commission after 89 per cent of votes had been counted, put Phalang Pracharat, led by military junta chief Prayuth Chan-o-cha, ahead with seven million votes. The opposition Pheu Thai party had 6.6 million.

However, in a late twist, Ittiporn Boonprakong, the commission’s chairman, said that the full unofficial results would only be declared this morning, without giving any reason for such a delay.

Polling day saw a high turnout among Thailand’s 51.2 million eligible voters, many of whom were determined to cast their ballots after five years under military rule headed by General Prayuth.

The close result reflects deep divisions that remain between supporters of the pro-monarchy junta and those who back Pheu Thai and other parties aligned with Thaksin Shinawatra, the billionaire former prime minister who now lives in exile.

Junta critics have blamed rule by the military for the poor performance of the economy and a lack of democratic freedoms, while its supporters claim the army has stabilised the country.

The odds are weighted in favour of the junta returning to power through the civilian Phalang Pracharat Party, due to recent electoral reforms which have been denounced by opposition parties as unfair.

The official election results do not have to be declared until May 8.

Early polls also indicated a strong performance for the new Future Forward party led by Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, a charismatic young motor-parts tycoon.

In 2008, Nancy Pelosi was House Speaker when Democratic lawmakers denied President George W. Bush’s request for a vote within 90 days on a trade pact with Colombia. The rejection delayed approval of deals the Bush administration negotiated with South Korea and Panama, though all three were later ratified.

Once again Speaker, Pelosi will play a pivotal role for Trump’s renegotiated accord with Mexico and Canada, renamed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which isn’t one of her legislative priorities. It’s a change of pace from the frenetic year of negotiations that led to the deal being signed by leaders from all three countries in November.

“If the House doesn’t want to move on this, it doesn’t have to move. So it’s really up to her,” said Edward Alden, a trade expert at the Council on Foreign Relations.

Left-Tilting Tent

Pelosi is expected to only move the deal through the House if she can find a critical mass of her caucus supporting it and if she extracts concessions unrelated to trade from the White House in return, senior congressional aides say.

Asked to comment, Pelosi’s office referred to remarks she made this month in which the speaker said she and other Democrats are still weighing USMCA’s provisions on the environment, labor, pharmaceuticals and enforcement before deciding whether to support it.

With 60 new Democratic members who still have to familiarize themselves with their districts’ priorities and the content of the trade deal, the biggest challenge is educating lawmakers, the aides said. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is expected to meet with freshman members in the coming weeks to make his case.

Lighthizer has been wooing Democrats to support the updated version of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Sympathetic groups could include the New Democrat Coalition, which includes 100 lawmakers who back pro-growth policies.

He may face a tougher challenge on the party’s left flank. Outspoken rookie lawmakers such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who identifies as a democratic socialist and backs a sweeping spending plan to reduce carbon emissions called the “Green New Deal,” have driven the Democratic agenda since the November election.

“That’s the most amorphous piece of this: When is the caucus happy enough that she feels confident moving this? Hard to say,’’ said the National Foreign Trade Council’s Vanessa Sciarra, referring to Pelosi.

Kevin Brady, the top Republican on House Ways and Means Committee, said on Tuesday there may be a House vote on the pact “this summer” once Democrats’ concerns are addressed.

Labor, Drugs

Some Democrats are calling for changes to sections of USMCA dealing with labor standards and drug patents.

The pact commits Mexico to reform its labor laws to allow workers to engage in collective bargaining. But senior Democrats have said the commitments are lacking teeth without adequate enforcement provisions.

America’s biggest federation of labor unions, the AFL-CIO, has said it won’t support USMCA in its current form, and would oppose it if the business community forced a “premature” vote. “What we hear on the Hill is the same thing we’re saying: It’s not ready to be voted on,” AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said on Bloomberg TV Friday.

Democrats also aren’t enthusiastic about a drug patent provision that would force Mexico and Canada to extend protection for biologic drugs, warning it could raise prices for consumers.

Steel, Aluminum

Mexico and Canada have warned they may not ratify USMCA unless the U.S. lifts tariffs on steel and aluminum. The duties are also unpopular with lawmakers from Trump’s own Republican Party.

Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Senate finance committee, said the agreement wouldn’t be considered as long as the duties remain in place.

The administration is considering replacing the tariffs with quotas, which are equally, if not more, unpopular with many lawmakers as well as Mexico and Canada.

The Trump administration can make tweaks to the agreement to mollify concerns. But major revisions would require reopening talks with Mexico and Canada, a scenario Lighthizer has ruled out.

Markey and Ocasio-Cortez held a news conference to unveil their Green New Deal resolution.

(CNN) - House Republicans are hoping to force a vote on the Green New Deal to put House Democrats on the record as to whether they support the sweeping and controversial proposal, though it's not clear the effort will gain traction as Democrats are expected to dismiss it as a political stunt.

House GOP Whip Steve Scalise said at a news conference Wednesday where House Republicans announced their plan that it's important to ""contrast"" the kind of energy policy that their party supports with ""what Nancy Pelosi and her radical leftists are trying to do.""

The concept of a Green New Deal has been championed by progressive party rising stars like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and embraced by Democratic 2020 contenders. But the Green New Deal, which calls for a national mobilization of resources to tackle global warming, hasn't been universally embraced by congressional Democrats, though the party is broadly united in calling for action to fight climate change.

Pushing for a vote gives House Republicans an opportunity to put a spotlight on a proposal that they believe divides Democrats.

Republican Rep. Jody Hice of Georgia plans to file a discharge petition in an attempt to bring the Green New Deal resolution to the House floor for a vote. A discharge petition is a procedural tool that can be used to force a floor vote, but only if a majority of House members sign on in support.

Discharge petitions rarely succeed because of how high threshold is to clear. Even if every House Republican signs on in support, roughly 20 House Democrats would still need to sign on in order to force the vote.

""The American people need to know where their representatives stand on this radical proposal, the Green New Deal,"" Hice said. ""Make no mistake about it, regardless of what supporters say, it is a radical proposal that will dramatically take American society further to the left. And I want a vote on it.""

The Georgia Republican added that he hopes there will be enough support from Democrats to force a vote.

""The message to my socialist, Democrat colleagues is very simple: we're looking for at least 20 of them ... we want them to join with Republicans for the sake of a recorded vote on the Green New Deal,"" he said.

That appears improbable, however, especially if House Democrats put up a show of unity like most Senate Democrats did when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell brought the Green New Deal up for a vote in the Senate on Tuesday.

The overwhelming majority of Senate Democrats voted ""present,"" in protest over the vote, which they argued was only intended as a political attack on the nascent proposal.

Hice said on Wednesday that he will file the discharge petition sometime after Easter.

The congressman tentatively plans to file the motion on the House floor in late April, a GOP aide familiar with the discussions told CNN. Once that happens, the congressman will be able to start gathering signatures for the petition, according to the aide. The aide added that Hice is currently ""actively working to garner support among his colleagues,"" for the petition.

CNN has reached out to Ocasio-Cortez's office to request comment.

The freshman Democrat on Tuesday criticized McConnell's decision to bring the Green New Deal to a vote in the Senate and tweeted that she ""encouraged"" Senate Democrats to vote ""present.""

Republicans have been quick to seize on the fact that Senate Democrats did not vote to advance the measure, casting it as a sign that Democrats are unwilling to stand behind the proposal. Senate Republicans were united in voting ""no"" out of objection to the far-reaching plan, which McConnell has labeled ""a socialist makeover of the entire US economy.""

In response to a tweet from Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming asking, ""Why did Senate Democrats just duck a vote,"" Ocasio-Cortez wrote, ""Because I encouraged them to vote present, along w/ others. McConnell tried to rush the #GreenNewDeal straight to the floor without a hearing.""

Ocasio-Cortez added, ""The real question we should be asking: Why does the Senate GOP refuse to hold any major hearings on climate change?""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly said that she welcomes the enthusiasm behind the Green New Deal, but she has described it as one of many proposals that will be looked at by committees.

At the start of the new Congress, Pelosi set up a Select Committee on the Climate Crisis that's expected to come up with recommendations for new legislation. In one sign of the efforts Democrats are making to push for climate action, Pelosi along with other House Democrats, unveiled a bill Wednesday that aims to push the United States to uphold the Paris climate agreement.",House Republicans will attempt to force vote on Green New Deal,channel4000.com,http://www.channel4000.com/nation/politics/house-republicans-will-attempt-to-force-vote-on-green-new-deal/1063251618

NDC cries foul over ‘new voters’ register’ in EC communiqué

Asiedu Nketiah is NDC General Secretary

The opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) says Inter-Party Advisory Committee (IPAC) has not discussed matters relating to the compilation of a new voters register.



In a statement Thursday, the NDC says a release by the Electoral Commission (EC) on Wednesday gives the impression the matter was discussed.



“We wish to state emphatically and without any fear of contradiction, that no decision was taken on this matter. In fact, the compilation of a new voters register was only mentioned in passing by the EC during the discussion on limited registration,” the NDC wrote.



“The NDC holds the view that, a matter as important as the compilation of a new voters register, has to be discussed in a manner that will ensure that every aspect and the implication of its implementation are thoroughly discussed to the satisfaction of all stakeholders and in accordance with due process, time tested rules, procedures and conventions before a decision is made,” the statement added.



The statement, signed by the General Secretary, Johnson Asiedu Nketiah, further added that the EC should be “mindful of its core mandate to act as a credible impartial referee in the country's electoral processes and to play by the rule books.”



Read the full statement below:



NDC DEMANDS WITHDRAWAL OF DECEPTIVE IPAC COMMUNIQUE



The National Democratic Congress (NDC) notes with concern a Communique issued by the Electoral Commission after the IPAC meeting held on Wednesday, 27th March, 2019.



At the meeting under reference, the EC presented for discussion its programmed activities for 2019. While the press release issued by EC covers aspects of the ensuing discussions we note that there are portions that do not represent the true reflection of what transpired at the IPAC meeting.



We take particular notice of a portion of the EC press release which states as follows:-



“The Commission will compile a new voters’ register ahead of the 2020 Presidential and Parliamentary Elections “.



We wish to state emphatically and without any fear of contradiction, that no decision was taken on this matter. In fact, the compilation of a new voters register was only mentioned in passing by the EC during the discussion on limited registration. There certainly was no “extensive deliberations“ on this particular matter.



The absurdity of such a claim, is amply evident from the Commission’s own Statement, which captured the agenda for discussion as follows;



*Preparations for the 2019 District Level Elections *Inspection of Political Party Offices *Updates on the compliance of the Political Parties with Audit requirements.



The compilation of a new voters register was not one of the items on the agenda for discussion, thus cannot warrant a basis for any decision by the political parties. A careful analysis of the subsequent points in the statement, specifically, point 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6, shows that all the issues raised were clearly in sync with the items on the agenda.



It is self-evident, and judging from the flow of the Press Release and its relationship with the agenda above, that item 3 is totally incongruous to the real issues discussed at the meeting, let alone any purported decision be made on the subject.



The NDC holds the view that, a matter as important as the compilation of a new voters register, has to be discussed in a manner that will ensure that every aspect and the implication of its implementation are thoroughly discussed to the satisfaction of all stake holders and in accordance with due process, time tested rules, procedures and conventions before a decision is made. A matter as delicate as such has to be discussed thoroughly and all the related consequences, ramifications considered before arriving at a decision.



A decision of this nature has grave bearing on the credibility and integrity of our Elections and therefore has to be tabled properly as part of an IPAC Agenda, discussed exhaustively with all relevant stakeholders, before the EC can communicate such a MAJOR DECISION taken at an IPAC meeting to the general public. No such matter was tabled as part of the agenda, nor was it discussed, either exhaustively or thoroughly as the EC has sought to portray in their communique.



Curiously the communique was signed by only the Chairperson of the Commission instead of the representatives of the various political parties. Can the EC explain why this is so? The NDC therefore disassociates itself from the communique and demands it's withdrawal as it is not in consonance with conclusions of the IPAC meeting.



It may interest you to note that, there were decisions taken which did not find space in the communique. One such decisions was for the EC to decentralize the limited registration exercise to the Electoral Area level in accordance with the time tested practice in all limited registration exercises since the beginning of the fourth Republic.



The NDC cautions the EC to be mindful of its core mandate to act as a credible impartial referee in the country's electoral processes and to play by the rule books.



Signed



Hon. Johnson Asiedu Nketiah

Here is the latest national primary survey from Quinnipiac, released on Thursday: The next time a new national 2020 poll comes out, you can probably fill in ...","What do you know, former Vice President Joe Biden is leading another 2020 Democratic presidential primary poll with roughly 30 percent of the vote.

The story of the 2020 election polling so far is how little the polling has changed. Here is the latest national primary survey from Quinnipiac, released on Thursday:

Joe Biden: 29 percent

Bernie Sanders: 19 percent

Beto O’Rourke: 12 percent

Kamala Harris: 8 percent

Elizabeth Warren: 4 percent

Pete Buttigieg: 4 percent

Cory Booker: 2 percent

Amy Klobuchar: 2 percent

Julian Castro: 1 percent

John Hickenlooper: 1 percent

The big news out of this poll is that South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is hitting a new polling high of ... 4 percent. That should tell you how monotonous the Democratic primary polling has really been. This chart from Real Clear Politics reinforces the tedium:

The next time a new national 2020 poll comes out, you can probably fill in the blanks yourself: Biden at 30 percent or so, Sanders trailing 5-10 points behind him, O’Rourke and Harris both hanging around at 10 percent, Warren sitting at 5 percent-ish, and then a crowd of Booker, Buttigieg, Klobuchar, Castro, and Kirsten Gillibrand with a few percentage points each.

The story has barely changed all year. The big unknown is how durable Biden’s stubbornly consistent lead really is — and we won’t know the answer to that until he decides whether or not to run. And even then, things may not really change until the first round of debates, when the public finally turns its full attention to the presidential campaign.

The Iowa and New Hampshire 2020 polling landscape, explained

Maybe you’d argue national polls don’t really matter (and you’d be right). We don’t have a national primary election. We have a very deliberate schedule of caucuses and primaries, and the narrative and momentum built out of the early contests could mean quite a lot in a crowded field.

But in a recent Des Moines Register poll, the gold standard in the first caucus state, the results look only a little different than the national polls:

Biden: 27 percent

Sanders: 25 percent

Warren: 9 percent

Harris: 7 percent

O’Rourke: 5 percent

Booker: 3 percent

Klobuchar: 3 percent

Warren overperforms her national polling a little bit in Iowa; O’Rourke (who hadn’t actually announced when this survey was taken) underperforms. This tracks with what David Binder, who polled for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, put out in his new Iowa survey this week.

That most recent Iowa poll does have a bit of bad news for Biden: His lead has actually diminished from 37 percent in September last year to just 25 percent now. He’s losing ground to Sanders and, in Binder’s most recent poll, Buttigieg was all the way up to 6 percent. Of course, Biden hasn’t yet been traveling to Iowa with regularity like the other contenders, and voters there might be taking an interest in the politicians they’ve actually met and heard from.

Warren, at 8 percent, was still showing a little bit better in Iowa than in national surveys; O’Rourke, down at 6 percent, still didn’t do quite as well in the Hawkeye State. The Binder poll was a comparatively good survey for Booker and Klobuchar, who both hit 6 percent.

Moving to the second state on the calendar, it’s been a while since we’ve seen a New Hampshire poll. But the twist there is that Sanders seems to fare better against Biden than he does in national polls. That makes sense, given New Hampshire is next door to Sanders’s home state of Vermont. He also trounced Hillary Clinton there in the 2016 primary.

Another notable finding is Elizabeth Warren, again, looking stronger in an early primary state than in the national polls. The Massachusetts senator was one of the first major candidates to announce and she has kept up a relentless travel schedule. On the other hand, Warren is still trailing Harris in her own neighborhood, considering the substantial overlap between the Massachusetts and New Hampshire media markets. So maybe that number isn’t quite as good as it seems.

O’Rourke is also below his national numbers in New Hampshire, though all of these surveys were taken before he announced his candidacy.

Taken together, the polling landscape in Iowa and New Hampshire largely aligns with what we’ve seen in the national polls: Biden and Sanders are in a class of their own, while some mix of Harris, O’Rourke, and Warren makes up the second tier. They’re followed by Booker, Klobuchar, and maybe now Buttigieg, who could fight their way up the hierarchy.

We have a long way to go, of course. And we’re still waiting on quality Nevada and South Carolina polls, to give us some idea of how the electorate is looking in the next two states on the 2020 calendar.

There is that one warning sign for Biden in Binder’s survey, as his support appears to be deteriorating a bit even as he holds onto the lead. That brings us to the real lesson to be learned from the early 2020 polling.

This is not a real race until Joe Biden gets in or gets out

Biden is the shadow hanging over the 2020 Democratic primary. He is polling like a frontrunner, but what we don’t yet know is how solid that support really is. Surveys at this point in the campaign reflect name recognition as much as anything else, and Biden is the best-known potential candidate, along with Sanders.

This is how Vox’s Li Zhou summarized the state of Biden’s polling earlier this month:

The size of Biden’s current poll lead certainly isn’t as overwhelming as Clinton’s was in 2015. But it’s also larger and more consistent than any Republican candidate had managed that year until Trump came along. And it’s about the same as Romney’s in early 2011 — when he went on to win the GOP nomination. Still, there are also reasons to suspect Biden’s current lead is a lot like [Rudy] Giuliani’s in 2007 or Jeb Bush’s in early 2015 — that it’s illusory, based on a vague general positive impression that won’t survive contact with an actual campaign.

To state the overly obvious, we simply can’t be sure whether Biden would maintain his polling advantage until he actually enters the race and starts facing more scrutiny and the attacks from his competitors that come with a real candidacy. Hillary Clinton is the classic example of a politician enjoying soaring approval when they aren’t perceived as an active office-seeker and seeing that sky-high favorability rapidly tumble once they enter the arena.

The same could prove true for Biden. Then again, it might not: He’s already seen some tough media coverage but largely held his standing in the polls, and there are interesting anecdotes from focus groups suggesting policy-based attacks don’t hurt him as much as you might think, considering his more centrist profile in a party increasingly moving to the left.

The real wild card is: What if Biden doesn’t run? Where does his 30 percent slice of the primary pie go? Zhou also explored this question recently, and the answer was ... nobody knows. Some surveys show a lot of Biden voters moving to Sanders. Other pollsters think Harris would take up the mainstream Democratic mantle, contrasted with Sanders’s lefty insurgency, and become the favorite. Or maybe there isn’t one beneficiary and the effect of Biden foregoing is diffused among many candidates.

This is a long way of saying the reason the 2020 polling seems so maddeningly unwavering is the biggest domino in the primary campaign hasn’t fallen yet: Is Joe Biden going to run or not?

""In recent months our nation has watched the Democratic Party take a sharp and abrupt ...","Senate Republicans will force a vote on the Green New Deal this week as part of an ongoing effort to turn the provocative climate change resolution into a wedge issue in the 2020 elections. Democrats say the GOP gambit carries its own political risk of mocking an issue that is a priority for a growing number of Americans.

""I think it's a real stupid political move for them to show how cavalier they are about climate change by playing games with the Green New Deal,"" said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., ""If they don't like the Green New Deal, fine, put up your own idea. It smells so disingenuous, especially to young voters. I think it's a really dumb move for them to mess around with this.""

All 53 Republicans oppose the Green New Deal. All 47 Democrats (including the 2 independent senators) plan to vote ""present"" as part of a strategy led by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. ""I'm for it, but I have no problem voting 'present,' "" said Murphy. Schumer wants Democrats to run more aggressively in favor of climate change policies going in to 2020, although he conceded in an interview with The New York Times earlier this month that the exact legislative form that will take is still up for debate. ""It's going to take us a little while to come up with a consensus that works,"" he said.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced last month that he would put the resolution authored by New York Democratic freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., up for a vote. Republicans are trying to elevate the freshman lawmaker, who has described herself as a Democratic Socialist, and her ideas as emblematic of the Democratic Party going in to 2020.

""In recent months our nation has watched the Democratic Party take a sharp and abrupt left turn toward socialism,"" McConnell said earlier this month. ""A flawed ideology that has been rejected time and again across the world is now driving the marquee policy proposals of the new House Democratic majority, and nothing encapsulates this as clearly as the huge, self-inflicted, national wound the Democrats are agitating for called the Green New Deal.""

The National Republican Senatorial Committee, has also started using Ocasio-Cortez in attacks ads similar to how the party campaigns have run against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for years. In a recent tweet attacking Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, who is considering a run against Republican Sen. John Cornyn, the NRSC said Castro ""votes with AOC 94% of the time."" Castro is a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal. House Republican candidates are also using Ocasio-Cortez and the Green New Deal in attack ads, like this one released Monday by former Rep. Karen Handel, R-Ga., who lost in 2018 and is seeking a rematch for a suburban Atlanta district.

The Green New Deal is a loose set of ambitious goals outlined in a non-binding resolution that calls for a global goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 — but no policy specifics on how to get there.

It is also an economic plan, which calls for massive federal investment, enhancing the social safety net, and millions of new jobs to overhaul the energy and infrastructure industries in the U.S.

Critics have seized on the resolution's call for a ""10-year national mobilization"" to work toward a series of goals including ""meeting 100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources.""

But even some of its sponsors like Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar don't regard that marker as a hard deadline, instead saying the resolution is ""aspirational.""

Republicans on Capitol Hill have also seized on a series of talking points Ocasio-Cortez's office accidentally circulated about the resolution that included financial support for Americans ""unwilling to work"" and for policies like building out high-speed rail so ""air travel stops becoming necessary."" Her office said it was an old, working draft that was not intended for circulation, but it was a self-inflicted political hit that gave critics an easy line of attack.

Senate Republicans have been attacking the Green New Deal for weeks. ""To put it mildly the Green New Deal is ambitious. To frame it more accurately, it is an unworkable pie-in-the-sky attempt to reshape every aspect of everyday Americans' lives,"" Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said on the Senate floor.

Conservatives have rallied around an analysis by the right-leaning American Action Forum that estimates the Green New Deal would cost between $51 to $93 trillion over a 10-year period. Senate Republicans are framing it as an expensive government takeover of American life as it exists today. ""This Green New Deal — this big government takeover of the economy — it is masked as an environmental proposal. To me, it is radical,"" said Sen. John Barasso, R-Wyo.

The GOP strategy is intended to divide Democrats, but senators have offered a collective shrug at McConnell's vote strategy. ""The people are on our side as it relates to climate change and I think there's no reason to be defensive about what we want to accomplish,"" said Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, ""Republicans have no plan at all as it relates to climate change, and that's not a rhetorical flourish, that's not a partisan statement. They literally have no bill and they have no plan. They're just sort of goofing around.""

But at least one Senate Republican, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, is offering a counterproposal to combat climate change, which he called ""a New Manhattan Project for Clean Energy"" in a Monday Senate floor speech. It is a five-year plan that includes 10 ""Grand Challenges"" to reduce carbon emissions and create cleaner energy sources. ""I believe climate change is real. I believe that human emissions of greenhouse gases are a major cause of climate change,"" Alexander said, ""And I believe the Democrat cure for climate change, their 'Green New Deal,' is so far out in left field that no one is going to take it seriously."" Alexander is not seeking re-election in 2020.

Democrats' ""present"" vote strategy has the support of climate change activists, including the nascent Sunrise Movement, a coalition of young activists who have recently been storming lawmakers' offices on Capitol Hill in support of the Green New Deal. A spokesman for the group told NPR the Senate vote was ""a sham.""

Democrats are emboldened by growing public consensus that climate change caused by human activities is a serious problem requiring action. A Dec. 2018 NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that two-thirds of Americans, 66 percent, believe action is needed to combat climate change — an upward swing of 15 percentage points since 1999. But that change in attitude has largely come from the left and middle: 71 percent of Democrats (up 42 percentage points since 1999) and 48 percent of independents (up 22 percentage points since 1999) see combating climate change as an immediate concern.

Only 15 percent of Republicans do — the same share of Republicans who felt that way 20 years ago.",Green New Deal Vote Sets Up Climate Change As Key 2020 Issue,KPCC,https://www.scpr.org/news/2019/03/26/88803/green-new-deal-vote-sets-up-climate-change-as-key/

A coalition led by Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is widely expected to retain power in a staggered election beginning on April 11, especially given recent tension with old rival Pakistan.

“This country has seen governments that only made slogans, but for the first time, they are seeing a decisive government that knows how to demonstrate its resolve,” Modi told the rally in the city of Meerut in Uttar Pradesh state, which has the most members of parliament of all states.

“Our vision is of a new India that will be in tune with its glorious past,” he said to roars of approval from the crowd who waved BJP flags and chanted for another term for Modi.

The rally was held in a field flanking a main road, surrounded by farm land. Vendors sold BJP mugs, T-shirts and clocks.

The general election, the world’s biggest democratic exercise with about 900 million eligible voters, will be held in phases ending on May 19. Votes will be counted on May 23.

Tension with neighboring Pakistan soared last month after a suicide bomb attack in the Indian part of the disputed Kashmir region killed 40 Indian paramilitary police. The bombing was claimed by a Pakistan-based militant group.

India retaliated with an air raid against a suspected militant camp in northern Pakistan.

In December, the main opposition Congress party defeated the BJP in three major rural states as a lack of jobs and weak farm prices dented Modi’s popularity.

But pollsters say Modi’s chances have improved significantly thanks to his tough stance on Pakistan

At the rally, Modi repeatedly spoke about the Indian bombing of the suspected militant camp. He also referred to a test on Wednesday in which India shot down one of its own satellites in space, which he said made India a space power.

Modi also promised economic growth and a prosperous society for all.

Modi’s main challenger is the opposition Congress party, which was for decades India’s dominant political party.

One Modi supporter derided a recent Congress offer to hand out 6,000 rupees ($87) a month to the poorest families if it was voted back into power.

“I know how the economy works,” said chartered accountant Anupam Sharma. “GDP would be decimated.”

Astrid Riecken/Getty Images House and Senate Republicans suffer their first defeat in attempts to dismantle Obama's signature health care law. The GOP would continue to address this issue for months to come.

President Donald Trump's latest escalation of his years-long bid to kill Obamacare has given Democrats running for president in 2020 a new opening to assail Trump -- and to sell their own visions of expanded health coverage.

The move by the Justice Department -- telling a federal appeals court on Monday that the Affordable Care Act should be struck down in its entirety -- shifts the political lens back to the issue that helped bolster Democratic victories in the 2018 midterms: health care -- and specifically, Republican efforts to undercut President Barack Obama's signature law.

Across the board, Democratic contenders lambasted the Trump administration's move.

""It's about playing politics with people's public health,"" Sen. Kamala Harris from California said on MSNBC.

Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont tweeted that Trump's administration wants to ""throw millions of Americans off health insurance and put lives at risk. We will fight back.""

Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said on Twitter that for those who benefit from the Affordable Care Act, ""it is now the official position of the White House to take away your health coverage, with no sign of a plan to help you if they win and you lose.""

And Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted, ""Health care is a basic human right, and we fight for basic human rights."" Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke vowed on Twitter to ""protect the care of those whose lives depend on it.""

Of course, the 2020 field itself is divided on how to expand health care access, with some candidates advocating single-payer programs that would eliminate private insurance and others seeking to allow people to buy into Medicare.

But by making another push to kill Obamacare, Trump and his administration have given candidates a set of health care policies around which they can coalesce -- including ensuring coverage for those with pre-existing conditions, banning yearly lifetime limits and allowing children to remain on their parents' insurance until age 26.

On debate stages and in town halls, the entire Democratic field is likely to be ""spending a good chunk of their time talking about how they want to maintain and improve health care for all Americans,"" said Anne Caprara, a veteran Democratic strategist who is now Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker's chief of staff. ""And that's an enormous win for Democrats overall.""

""There's a conversation going on about Medicare for All and public options, but I think, frankly, people spend way more time focusing on that on Twitter than they do out in the electoral base,"" she said. ""The Affordable Care Act is popular with Democratic voters -- very popular. Nobody wants to see it repealed.""

Angel Padilla, policy director of the progressive political group Indivisible, said Tuesday's move would animate the Democratic base and send ""another signal that this is why the 2020 election matters.

""It's about people's lives and it's about health care,"" he said.

Trump's latest effort to undo Obamacare will also raise the stakes of Democrats' intra-party debate over whether to pursue a single-payer health system that eliminates private insurers or set that long-term goal aside in favor of incremental steps toward universal coverage.

A Sanders aide said the administration's move elevates what the Vermont senator's camp saw as one of his top issues.

""I don't know what it says about other candidates, but I think that it plays to his strengths as a candidate because he has a very clear message about health care and about the need to guarantee health care to every American as a right, not a privilege,"" the Sanders aide said.

The Sanders camp's view is that a world in which health insurers have a profit-making incentive is not sustainable.

""As long as you have private insurance companies as a part of that equation, you're going to have a system that is not purely interested in making people healthy and doing it in the most cost-effective way possible,"" the aide said.

Supporters of Medicare for All argue that with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Republican-appointed judges in the way, anything short of a revolutionary change would have little hope of advancing.

Other Democratic presidential candidates, though, have argued that a more narrow approach is all that's politically feasible.

O'Rourke has touted legislation by Illinois Rep. Jan Schakowsky and Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro that would move everyone who doesn't already have private insurance from their employers into Medicare -- and allow those who do have private insurance the option of buying into Medicare instead.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar from Minnesota said in a recent CNN town hall that she wants to ""build on the work of the Affordable Care Act.""

She said Medicare for All ""could be a possibility in the future,"" but that she is looking for ""something that will work now.""

Whatever their differences, Democrats are unanimous in opposing Trump's pushes to undercut Obamacare, said Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation.

""But going forward and now, there is acknowledgment that there are shortcomings with the current law. Not everybody has coverage. Not everybody is eligible for help who needs it. We've got other instability that has been initiated or aggravated by the administration's actions and by the actions of state officials that are hoping to undo or destabilize the law,"" Pollitz said.

""This is going to be a prominent issue throughout the campaign: what direction makes sense. And also, is one direction the answer?"" she said. ""Do (the Democrats) define themselves by this one approach or could they lay out a path that perhaps would have some incremental steps along the way?""",2020 Dems rally around Obamacare amid Trump's new bid to kill it,channel4000.com,http://www.channel4000.com/nation/politics/2020-dems-rally-around-obamacare-amid-trumps-new-bid-to-kill-it/1062927397

The commission’s statement comes ...","(Bloomberg) -- India’s new campaign finance rules allowing anonymous donations reduce transparency in political funding, the country’s election commission said in a filing at the nation’s top court.

The Election Commission of India -- one of the respondents in a case filed against the new funding rules -- said anonymous donations have serious repercussions and impact on the transparency of political funding, according to the document seen by Bloomberg. The court is hearing petitions challenging the introduction of ‘electoral bonds’ and seeking a ban on cash donations filed by Association for Democratic Reforms, a non-government organization.

The commission’s statement comes weeks ahead of general elections in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking a second term. Modi came to power in 2014 promising a crackdown on corruption. The election commission’s comments and any adverse ruling from the top court may dent the anti-graft credentials of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.

Election Commission’s spokeswoman Sheyphali Sharan did not answer two calls made to her mobile phone.

The changes in law allow anonymous donations through electoral bonds which can be bought at a bank in denominations ranging from 1,000 rupees to 10 million rupees ($14 to $150,000) and given to a political party, which can exchange them for cash. They don’t carry the name of the donor and are exempt from tax.

The government has claimed that the changes will cleanse political funding. The move was criticized for allegedly legalizing large anonymous donations that can potentially lead to businesses and foreign companies gaining influence over the elections that start on April 11.

The election commission said the rule allowing political parties to receive donations from foreign companies having majority stake in an Indian company would “allow unchecked foreign funding of political parties in India, which could lead to Indian policies being influenced by foreign companies.”

The top court is scheduled to hear the case on April 2.

New Westminster-Burnaby MP Peter Julian said the party intends to focus on Canada's so-called ""tax gap"" to show it can finance big campaign commitments — in areas such as affordable housing and universal pharmacare — by cracking down on corporate tax avoidance, loopholes and offshore havens.

article continues below

The tax gap, which one estimate said could be above $40 billion annually, is the difference between the amount of tax revenue that should have been collected in a year and what was actually brought in.Julian said to reinforce its fiscal plan, the NDP is counting on the findings of an upcoming report from the independent parliamentary budget officer on the size of the tax gap.

""The whole issue of corporate taxation will be a stronger part of what we offer to Canadians, bolstered by the PBO report,"" Julian said in an interview.

""You will hear us repeating what was found in the PBO report. Whether that number is $10 billion or $15 billion or $20 billion or higher... And we will be talking about the fair tax system as a foundation for making the kind of investments that will make a difference in people's lives.""

Details about the NDP's fiscal approach follow last week's release of the final federal budget before October's election.

The budget from the governing Liberals fed political debate on whether or not federal governments should strive to return the books to balance as soon as possible.

The document showed the Liberals are in no hurry. Their budget, which emphasized a need to continue making investments, projected annual deficits of almost $20 billion in each of the next two years and contained no timeline to balance the books.

A few days after the budget's release, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer told a conference that a Tory government would bring books back to balance, but he didn't say when.

The NDP has been less vocal about its pre-election fiscal vision thus far.

In the 2015 election, the NDP vowed to make major investments and still balance the budget by raising corporate taxes and cutting off tax havens.

Following the party's poor results at the ballot box, former leader Tom Mulcair later laid part of the blame on the fiscal commitment, which he said overshadowed the NDP's ""social democratic economic vision.""

Julian declined to say whether the New Democrats will promise balanced books again in 2019 because NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh will roll out of the party's plans over the coming months.

The NDP will renew its focus on corporate tax fairness — and he expects this time to be different.

""I think what we needed in 2015 is what we'll have in 2019 — which is the PBO report on the tax gap,"" Julian said. ""In a sense, we're coming with far more evidence to support what we're saying about having to put in place a fair tax system.""

Other political parties have shown interest that the forthcoming tax gap report could be a source of new fiscal space for election promises, said Yves Giroux, the parliamentary budget officer.

But Giroux warned any federal government would need to make considerable efforts before they can turn the tax gap estimate into a source of revenue.

""We have to be somewhat prudent because even if we come up with an estimate that's high — and I'm not saying it's the case — it's only the beginning,"" Giroux said in an interview.

He said after identifying how much money is escaping the public treasury, the Canada Revenue Agency ""has to have the willingness to get that money.""","NDP to focus on 'tax gap' in election, says New West MP",New West Record,https://www.newwestrecord.ca/news/ndp-to-focus-on-tax-gap-in-election-says-new-west-mp-1.23771964

Don Beyer (D-Va.) introduced legislation Thursday to tackle climate change and boost the economy two days after the Senate blocked the hotly contested Green New Deal.

The Democrats proposed the Healthy Climate and Family Security Act, which would cap carbon pollution and curtail carbon dioxide emissions gradually in the next 20 years, impose penalties on companies that violate the pollution regulations and donate all the proceeds to American families in the form of dividends.

“The dangers of climate change are front and center in our everyday lives and only getting worse — we must take real steps to fight back,” Van Hollen said in a statement. This bill will spur economic growth and encourage the development of clean technologies. I urge Congress to take up this measure immediately – it’s clear this issue can’t wait.”

“The Healthy Climate and Family Security Act is the kind of bold action we need to help save the planet. Our market-based approach to putting a price on carbon would help the US economy adapt quickly by reducing carbon and embracing clean energy,” Beyer added. “We also see a sharp rise in engagement on this issue and growing support for ambitious solutions, and I believe our bill deserves a prominent place in that discussion.”

Specifically, the Healthy Climate and Family Security Act would cap carbon emissions at 50 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 and then 80 percent below 2005 levels by 2040.

Carbon pollution permits would also be auctioned off to the first sellers of oil, coal, and natural gas into the U.S. market and would in turn give 100 percent of the profits garnered each quarter to every American in the form of a Healthy Climate Dividend.

Van Hollen and Beyer touted the plan as a way to supplement families’ income before accounting for the cost saved by preventing further impacts from climate change. They also pointed to an op-ed written in January by a group of bipartisan economists who the endorsed the cap and dividend approach.

The legislation comes two days after the Senate voted down the Green New Deal, a plan backed by progressives to tackle climate change by investing in eco-friendly jobs. While the plan was popular among the Democratic Party’s left flank, moderates expressed skepticism about the proposal’s cost and if its goals were realistic.

The Speaker says he won't let Ms May’s deal through for a third vote without substantial changes.

British Prime Minister Theresa May made a final push on Thursday to save her European Union withdrawal agreement after her promise to step down gained the deal some support but failed to win over politicians from Northern Ireland.

The government announced there would be a previously unscheduled Brexit debate in parliament on Friday — but did not confirm whether it would include a new vote on May’s twice-rejected EU divorce agreement.

The EU has said the prime minister must secure approval for her deal by 11pm. UK time (10am Saturday Australian time) on Friday if the UK is to be given an automatic delay of its departure date from the bloc until May 22. Otherwise, Britain has until April 12 to announce a new plan, or leave the bloc without a deal.

British parliament speaker John Bercow gave his go-ahead for a vote by MPs on Friday on the Brexit divorce deal, which parliament has already rejected twice.

“The motion is new, substantially different,” House of Commons speaker Bercow told parliament.

It is still unclear whether the government can secure enough votes to pass it.

May pledged on Wednesday night that she would resign if her Brexit deal was approved, in hopes of blunting opposition from politicians in her Conservative Party who have criticised her leadership.

May has been under mounting pressure to quit from pro-Brexit Conservatives, who accuse her of negotiating a bad divorce deal that leaves Britain too closely tied to the bloc after it leaves. Some prominent opponents, including former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, quickly said they would back the Brexit agreement, but Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party said it remained opposed because of concern that the deal treats the region differently from other parts of the UK

Almost three years after Britain voted to leave the EU, Brexit has brought the country’s political system to a standstill. The impasse has frustrated EU politicians trying to negotiate an exit agreement, and it has surprised observers around the world who had viewed Britain’s 1,000-year-old parliamentary system as a model of stability.

It has not always deserved that reputation. The British system works best when one party has a parliamentary majority and can pass legislation. Minority governments struggle and seldom last long.

The current situation is almost unprecedented: Britain has a minority government and a lame-duck prime minister, with both main parties split down the middle over how and whether to leave the EU.

The gridlock has brought the country to the precipice of a chaotic departure from the EU.

Pro-EU Conservative politician Ken Clarke said parliament was mired in “confusion and mayhem.”

“We’ve wasted the first three years. We’re back almost at square one,” he said.

The prime minister’s resignation announcement came as UK politicians rejected eight alternatives to her Brexit deal in an attempt to find a plan that could break the stalemate.

The results of Wednesday’s “indicative votes” underscored the divisions in parliament and the country over Brexit. The idea of remaining in a customs union with the EU came closest to winning a majority, with 264 politicians for it and 272 against. The most popular option was the idea of holding a second referendum on any Brexit deal approved by parliament, which was backed by 268 politicians, but opposed by 295.

“We counted eight no’s last night. Now we need a yes on the way forward,” European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said on Thursday.

The plan is for the most popular ideas to move to a second vote Monday to find an option that can command a majority. Parliament would then instruct the government to negotiate that plan with the EU.

May has refused to say she will be bound by the results.

The architect of the votes said the inconclusive outcome meant a damaging no- deal Brexit was becoming more likely.

“At the moment, we are heading for a situation where, under the law, we leave without a deal on the 12th, which many of us think is not a good solution,” Conservative Party politician Oliver Letwin told the BBC.

“And the question is, is parliament on Monday willing to come to any view in the majority about that way forward that doesn’t involve that result?”

Business groups expressed alarm at the impasse, which has left companies uncertain whether they will face tariffs, customs checks and other barriers to trade with the EU in just a couple of weeks.

“No one would run a business like this — and it is no way to run a country,” said Adam Marshall, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce.

He told politicians to stop “chasing rainbows” and “start making tough decisions, however personally or politically difficult they might be.”

Labour Party legislator Margaret Beckett said politicians who had been “wedded to particular proposals” now needed to compromise in Britain’s national interest.

“They are going to have to look over the abyss,” she said.",Brexit: UK government plans to hold new vote on Friday,Couriermail,https://www.news.com.au/world/europe/brexit-uk-government-plans-to-hold-new-vote-on-friday/news-story/4b806462cd8c57899879669f7555cc51

The new tactical line the Marxist party has adopted is to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led alliance, “to increase the strength of the CPIM and the Left in the Lok Sabha and ensure an alternative secular government.” In 2014, it was to reject the Congress and the United Progressive Alliance and at the same time, “defeat the BJP and its allies.”

Integration of economic growth with generation of jobs to create full employment , putting more money in the hands of people to boost demand, enlarging the resource base by taxing the rich and corporate profits and scrapping the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act and setting a minimum floor for social sector spending as a binding constraint on both the central and state governments were some points common to both manifestos.The CPI (M) also repeated its demand for the “introduction of proportional representation with a partial list system.”

The section Alternative Economic Policies repeated nearly all the points made by the 2014 manifesto and adds two new promises -- of restoring the Planning Commission, which was replaced by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) with NITI Aayog -- and involving state governments in major economic decisions at the central level.

Both manifestos mention the word “rich” five times in context of wealthy people.

Among the new promises, the CPI(M) wants electoral bonds to be scrapped; it wants a halt to “bulk surveillance by state agencies,” and “clear provisions and judicial supervision of any surveillance that violates citizens’ privacy.” It has demanded data privacy laws for protection against appropriation/misuse of users’ private data for commercial use. It also sought curbing of “monopolies that use either telecom such as Jio/Airtel/Vodafone or internet service platforms such as Google, Facebook, etc.”

The CPIM called for an employment guarantee in urban areas, 200 assured days of work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, special packages to support labour-intensive industries in creating jobs, minimum monthly pension not less than 50% of the minimum wage or a monthly ₹6,000 to senior citizens, among other things.

The party’s new promises include passage of the Rights of Transgender Persons Bill, 2014 to uphold the rights of all transgender persons and removing the lacunae that it claims is present in the current Transgender Persons Bill, 2018.

It supported “legal recognition and protection to same sex couples similar to marriage - ‘civil union’ /’same-sex-partnerships’, legislation/s on similar lines as Special Marriage Act, 1954 so that the partner can be listed as a dependent, for inheritance, alimony in case of divorce etc.”

The party favoured a comprehensive anti-discriminatory bill covering the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) communities and reservations for them in education and employment.

The chapter on resource mobilization repeated four old suggestions, and added, “Ensure all the loan defaulters who have fled India to avoid legal action are brought to book and the looted monies recovered with interest”. It said the Goods and Services Tax should be overhauled.

BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The general plan for governing Tibet in the new era defined by the Communist Party of China Central Committee with Xi Jinping at the core is consistent with the principles and policies applied to Tibet since the beginning of democratic reform, while responding to Tibet's development needs in the new era, said a white paper released Wednesday by the State Council Information Office.

""To develop Tibet in a new era, the central authority is committed to the philosophy of people-centered development and the concept of innovative, coordinated, green, open, and inclusive development,"" said the white paper, titled ""Democratic Reform in Tibet -- Sixty Years On.""

Considering innovation as the primary driving force, the government of Tibet has worked hard to implement the strategy of innovation-driven development, it said.

""By 2018, Tibet had established 74 entrepreneurship and innovation entities, including makerspaces, sci-tech enterprise incubators, innovation and entrepreneurship bases for college students, and bases for small and micro businesses, and these entities have attracted 1,338 entrepreneurship teams and startups,"" it said.

In view of the current economic and social climate, the government of Tibet has been committed to coordinated and sustainable development.

The government of Tibet firmly believes that clear waters and green mountains are invaluable assets, and that ecological protection is also a means of protecting productive forces. Bearing these ideas in mind, it prioritizes green development with ecological protection.

""Following the Belt and Road Initiative, the government of Tibet is building a policy structure that is inclusive, open and cooperative in nature, while accelerating opening-up,"" it said.

It also said the government of Tibet works hard to enhance the sense of participation and gain for people of all ethnic groups, ensuring that the fruits of development are shared by all the people.

Since 2013, more than 273,000 new urban jobs have been created. In 2018, the registered urban unemployment rate was 2.83 percent, and per capita disposable income increased by 10.2 percent and 10.8 percent respectively for urban and rural residents.",Development of Tibet enters new era: white paper,Xinhua,http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-03/27/c_137927110.htm

WASHINGTON — The Senate blocked consideration of the Green New Deal on Tuesday, ending a Republican effort to hitch Democratic presidential candidates to the climate plan and paint Democrats as out-of-touch socialists and fantasists.

The resolution that Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the majority leader, put to a test vote called on the federal government to rapidly eliminate planet-warming fossil fuel emissions, accelerate the deployment of wind, solar and other zero-carbon energy sources and create a national jobs program.

But the procedural motion simply to take up the Green New Deal failed to get a single vote. Democrats, denounced the move as a sham intended to divide their party and provide Republicans with election-season talking points. They overwhelmingly voted “present” on the motion, and it failed, 57-0.

Three Democratic senators — Joe Manchin, who represents coal-heavy West Virginia; Doug Jones of Alabama; and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona — joined Republicans voting no.

California’s Democratic senators are split on the Green New Deal itself — presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris is co-sponsoring it and Sen. Dianne Feinstein opposes it — but both called the vote a sham and voted “present.”

“Political stunts won’t get us anywhere,” Harris said in a statement. “Combatting this crisis first requires the Republican majority to stop denying science and finally admit that climate change is real and humans are the dominant cause.”

Dan Crenshaw is perhaps ideally suited to weigh in on the increasingly socialist disposition among young Americans. To the extent that the Republican party has managed to find a compelling answer to the sudden popularity of the Democratic rising stars who willingly place themselves on the far Left, it is best exemplified by the social-media savvy Crenshaw, who first skyrocketed to national attention after SNL comedian Pete Davidson mocked him for his eyepatch — which Crenshaw wears after having lost his eye in an IED attack in Afghanistan.

Instead of latching onto his well-earned “aggrieved-victim” status and lashing out at Davidson, Crenshaw chose to respond with grace. From David French’s coverage of what happened next:

Davidson came on the “Weekend Update” set and offered his apology, and then Crenshaw joined. He took some good-natured shots at Davidson . . . but then things took a more serious turn. Crenshaw briefly spoke of the meaning of the words “never forget” to a veteran, saying that “when you say ‘never forget’ to a veteran, you are implying that, as an American, you are in it with them.” Then he addressed his next words to Davidson: “And never forget those we lost on 9/11 — heroes like Pete’s father. So I’ll just say, Pete, never forget.” Davidson’s father was a firefighter. He died trying to save others when Davidson was a young boy. In one moment, Crenshaw not only honored a true hero, but also softened American hearts towards Davidson, casting him in a new light. He’s a man who carries his own pain. It turns out that there’s a market for grace in American politics. Within minutes, clips of the apology and Crenshaw’s tribute to Davidson’s dad rocketed across Twitter. As of this morning, the YouTube clip of the moment — not even 48 hours old — already had more than 5 million views.

It was a remarkable moment in our national politics, and it exemplifies the type of influence Crenshaw has proven himself able to exercise as a politician. So far, he has used it well. He doesn’t rival Ocasio-Cortez in Twitter followers — he has 382,000 to her nearly 4 million — but his ability to effectively wield his social-media presence to articulate conservative ideas is a promising sign for the right, which is consistently (and perhaps accurately) criticized for its inability to appeal to younger Americans.

And creative social media isn’t all Crenshaw has to offer. At the summit this afternoon, he insisted that the left’s socialist momentum stems from a culture that has made Americans feel disempowered. “That’s why identity politics is so powerful,” Crenshaw said. “It pits you against someone else. It allows you to feel like you’re a victim, and we’ve elevated that status of being a victim.”

Instead, he said, individuals who feel empowered reject victimhood and attempt to rise above the attacks. “That’s what I tried to do when someone made fun of me,” he added, referring to the incident with Davidson.

Crenshaw also offered a theory of why socialism seems to be growing in appeal to young Americans, as well as how conservatives should work to counteract it. “Well-intentioned liberalism always leads to progressivism,” he noted. “It has to. When you start believing that someone else has to be responsible for you, you always have to keep doing more.”

When Kevin asked whether he thinks the Left is increasingly serious about actually wanting to institute a slate of socialist policies, Crenshaw replied, “I do fear that they actually mean what they say. They haven’t called for total nationalism of many parts of the country, but they do talk about a lot of things that look an awful lot like Venezuela . . . a lot of things that do have really bad results.”

At the same time, he acknowledged the uneasy alliances on the right that make responding to the left somewhat more difficult. “In the Republican party, there’s now a somewhat uncomfortable coalition . . . between an old labor party and the free-market, pro-business party,” he said, noting that the latter part of the coalition fails to speak to working-class Americans. “They came to Donald Trump, and to figure out why, you almost have to talk to each one of them separately. . . . We have to figure out how to include them and their concerns in a free-market governing system, and we have to be looking for ways to do that. . . . We have to be talking about policies that actually work toward that.”

On the future of the right, Crenshaw remains optimistic, but he thinks it’ll take work: “We have to know more,” he said. “We have to have in-depth arguments.” He also said that the debate between capitalism and socialism isn’t always about substantive arguments. “It is really a culture war, deep down,” he said. “It is about whether personal responsibility should be valued, or it should not.”

The panel concluded with Crenshaw’s ideas on how to appeal to young people, and his theme was clear: “To young people: I’m not going to try to buy you off with promises I can’t keep.” If the Republican party wants to make that message appealing, they should rely on politicians such as Crenshaw.",Is Dan Crenshaw the GOP’s Answer to the Democratic ‘Freshman Class’?,National Review,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/dan-crenshaw-young-americans-socialism/

Confusion over the outcome of Sunday’s election raised the specter of a protracted struggle to form a government, spoiling hopes of a clear cut result that could have ended 15 years of political turmoil in Southeast Asia’s second largest economy.

Both the pro-army party seeking to keep coup leader Prayuth Chan-ocha on as prime minister and the opposition party linked to self-exiled former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, claimed they would command enough parliamentary seats to form a coalition government.

The pro-Thaksin Pheu Thai party said it was considering a legal challenge over what it said were poll irregularities after partial results showed Prayuth’s Palang Pracharat party with an unexpected lead in the popular vote.

The strong early showing for Palang Pracharat increased the likelihood that Prayuth, who was army chief when he overthrew a Pheu Thai government in 2014, would stay in power, although that outcome was not certain.

“There are irregularities in this election that we’re not comfortable with. These affect the nation’s credibility and people’s trust,” said Sudarat Keyuraphan, candidate for prime minister of the Pheu Thai Party.

“We’ve voiced our concerns before for vote-buying, abuse of power, and cheating. All three have manifested. We will fight back through legal means,” she told a news conference.

Thailand has been racked since 2004 by street protests of both opponents and supporters of Thaksin. Parties linked to Thaksin have won every previous election since 2001, but the populist telecoms billionaire was thrown out by the army in 2006 and a government led by his sister was ousted in 2014.

Thaksin wrote an opinion piece headlined “The Election in Thailand Was Rigged” in The New York Times on Monday.

“I knew that the junta running Thailand wanted to stay in power, but I cannot believe how far it has gone to manipulate the general election on Sunday,” he wrote.

Earlier on Monday, election commission official Nat Laosisawakul blamed delays and irregularities in results on “human error” and said a full count of the vote would be released on Friday.

“We have nothing to hide,” he said.

DECK STACKED FOR MILITARY

The lower house and the upper house Senate, whose 250 members are appointed by the junta, will together select the next prime minister based on the support of a simple majority of 376 lawmakers.

That means Prayuth’s party and allies have to win only 126 seats in the lower house to vote him in as prime minister, while Pheu Thai and its potential “democratic front” partners would need 376 all from the lower house to choose the next premier.

The House of Representatives, the lower house, has a total 500 seats, and on Monday the Election Commission posted the winners of the 350 seats that were contested on a first-past-the post basis.

The, as yet, unofficial results showed Pheu Thai leading with 137 seats to 96 seats for junta leader Prayuth’s party.

However, official results for the lower house’s remaining 150 “party seats”, which will be allocated by a complex formula involving voter turnout, will not be announced until May 9.

It might, however, be possible to roughly calculate the shares of the 150 “party seats” on Friday, when the Election Commission is due to give a breakdown of votes cast.

“CHEATING” TRENDS ON TWITTER

The strong popular vote showing by the pro-junta Palang Pracharat Party stunned voters who had hoped the poll would loosen the grip that traditional elites and the military hold on power in a country that has one of the highest measures of inequality in the world.

Many Thais took to social media to voice their suspicions about the results of an election that critics had said was systematically skewed in favor of the military from the outset because of the junta-appointed Senate’s role in selecting the prime minister.

Thai-language hashtags that translated as “Election Commission screw-up” and “cheating the election” were trending on Twitter in Thailand.

Many tweets referred to inconsistencies between the numbers for voter turnout and ballots cast in some parliamentary constituencies. Some questioned the overall turnout of less than 70 percent, which was much lower than expected.

Future Forward, a new party that appears to have made a spectacular election debut, winning 30 of the 350 constituency seats thanks to its appeal to young voters, also questioned the poll numbers.

“There are obviously some irregularities with the numbers because they don’t add up. This is making people skeptical of the election results,” said Future Forward spokeswoman Pannika Wanich.

A change.org petition launched a week ago to impeach the Election Commission had garnered almost 600,000 signatures by Monday evening, up from around 200,000 at the start of the day.","Surprise, suspicion in Thailand as pro-army party leads election race",Reuters,https://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKCN1R50Q1-OCATP

Analysis by Gregory R. Copley, Editor, GIS/Defense & Foreign Affairs

The follow-on from the U.S. Mueller Investigation which targeted President Donald Trump will confirm just how intractable the great divide is within the U.S. It is a greater strategic threat to U.S. security than the People’s Republic of China.

Few modern, democratic societies are structured to cope with domestic civil threats; they are geared primarily to handle external, conventional security threats.

The U.S. schism is — as with schisms evident in several modern, wealthy societies in the world — between “globalists” and “nationalists”. It is between those who cling to a crumbling status quo, and those for whom that departing status quo had failed to deliver security and who now seek the protection of traditional social defenses.

Today’s globalists believe that the pseudo-borderless world and the wealth of megacity-states over the past seven decades must be sustained (and that any threat of disruption creates disbelief and panic), and those who believe that such a world is collapsing or has already robbed them of their identity, security, and future. Description of this schism has been reduced to urban pseudo-liberal materialists versus “nationalist” supporters of tradition and a secure hierarchy. That is an over-simplification, as it was in the U.S. in 1860 in the run-up to the U.S. Civil War, but it has some resonance. But the symptomatic similarities and causes of the 1860 and 2016-19 trends are profound.

The end, on March 22, 2019, of the investigation by U..S Special Counsel Robert Mueller into alleged collusion between Donald Trump and the Russian government in Trump’s election to the presidency in 2016 came with a clear failure to find any such collusion. And yet the entire premise of the visceral anger of the globalists over the election of Donald Trump hinged, at least in stated logic, on the belief that his election was illegitimate, and must have been, in their view, aided by the illegal intervention of a foreign power.

There was a fundamental belief that the election of Donald Trump was so illogical, horrific, and inconceivable — because it violated all they held sacred — that it could only have occurred by satanic means. It was a triumph of belief over reality.

Globalists had invested all their faith in the investigation by Mueller and a team of legal staff dedicated to the destruction of President Trump.

What had been attempted over 22 months was an attempted legal coup to overthrow Trump. It was a more spineless putsch attempt than even the oblique initial containment of Louis XVI of France by palace and bureaucratic intrigues which finally gave way to the “revolutionary” National Convention and the King’s regicide by execution on January 21, 1793 (at the age of 38).

[Not that most in the U.S. today view with any interest the dispatch of Louis XVI, without whose assistance the 13 British colonies in the Americas would have failed to attain sovereignty after their Declaration of Independence in 1776.]

So the collapse of the Mueller Investigation without success for its proponents, from the standpoint of bringing down the Trump Presidency, marked a watershed in current U.S. political life, but what does it mean strategically for the U.S., its allies, and its competitors?

Strategic Outcomes

The U.S. societal schism remains unhealed — even untouched — by the outcome of the Mueller Investigation. The globalists in the U.S. political system, who essentially dominate the state bureaucracy and media, were angered by the result and will re-double their efforts to depose President Trump, although now mostly hoping to do so by political means at the 2020 presidential elections. But the collapse without substantive findings against Trump means that the president has been given political impetus which is likely to help him in the 2020 election. Overall, the Mueller collapse has given the first significant boost in legitimacy, credibility, and prestige to President Trump since he took office in January 2017.

Given that the Democratic Party (essentially now a globalist party) has won a majority in the House of Representatives, the Trump Administration will find passage of key economic and national security legislation difficult, inhibiting a major focus on, for example, comprehensive military reforms to meet the new global framework.

Continued, and even heightened, political infighting in the U.S. polity will continue to distract the Trump Administration from addressing substantive global issues. Already, major changes in the world — in Africa, the Middle East, the Indo-Pacific, and Europe — have failed to receive due attention by the U.S., with consequent losses in the U.S./ Western strategic posture. That the PRC’s late 2018 declaration of a “new Thirty Years’ War” with the U.S. has received no response from the White House or Administration is symptomatic of the total distraction of Washington by the internal civil war. This has been compounded by the reality that President Trump has an extremely thin senior policy team, and that Presidential appointments have been made extremely difficult because of the unprecedented partisan opposition to anything the administration proposes which requires congressional approval.

U.S. allies have been ignored, because of preoccupations in the U.S. over internal challenges, and have thus often felt the need to accommodate pressures from the People’s Republic of China (in particular). Washington has moved out of the alliance consensus-building arena to deal with domestic issues.

The U.S. economy and society will be increasingly challenged by open border initiatives of globalists and narco-traffickers, further exacerbating domestic divisions and lowering productivity.

In short, the Mueller battle was an opening shot in the “new civil war” in the U.S.; not a closing shot. The question is whether the issue will be resolved electorally or by what could best be described as “undemocratic” means.

The Wisconsin's Third District Court of Appeals on Wednesday put a hold on a temporary injunction that was issued by Dane County Judge Richard Niess which blocked the raft of Republican-authored legislation that was passed in former Gov. Scott Walker's final days in office.

Wednesday's ruling is the latest in a legal saga over the Republican-authored legislation.

Assembly Speaker Robin Vos lauded Wednesday's decision.

""Last week's circuit court ruling created a constitutional crisis -- established law says that the court cannot tell the Legislature how to set its rules. Extraordinary sessions have been called for decades,"" the Speaker wrote. ""Today, the rule of law has prevailed. Independent judges have put a Dane County ruling on hold that was based on politics, not the law. A judge should not violate the Legislature's basic ability to convene when its duly elected members call a session day.""

State Sen. Roberta Darling (R-River Hills) said Democratic Gov. Tony Evers used the intervening days to rescind the appointments of 82 people from various state boards and committees.

""Now crucial boards and councils are left in chaos because of Governor Evers' rash political decision. Boards that protect consumers, victims of domestic violence, and seniors are left without guidance. The governor continues to break his promise of bipartisanship,"" she wrote.

Wisconsin Patch is checking to see whether Wednesday's ruling means each of these 82 appointments are back in effect.

What Are The Laws?

Republicans passed the legislation in December after Democrat Tony Evers defeated Republican Gov. Scott Walker in the Fall 2018 general election.

The laws were designed to weaken Evers and Democratic Attorney General Joshua Kaul's constitutional powers, effectively securing power in the GOP's hands

The laws effectively prevent Evers from backing out of lawsuits without legislative approval, such as Wisconsin's participation in a multi-state lawsuit opposing the Affordable Care Act.

'Lame Duck' Laws Blocked

According to a WISN-TV report, days after hearing oral arguments from both sides, Dane County Circuit Judge Richard Niess issued the injunction, refusing the Republican-controlled State Legislature's request to delay the order.

According to a Wisconsin Public Radio report, a legal challenge to the lame-duck legislation was brought by the League of Women Voters of Wisconsin, Disability Rights Wisconsin Inc. and Black Leaders Organizing for Communities. They contended that the lame-duck session was unlawful ""because legislators met in ""extraordinary session,"" which isn't explicitly allowed under the state constitution.""

Representative LaKeshia Myers (D-Milwaukee) praised the Dane County judge's injunction. She made the following statement regarding Judge Niess' ruling involving the extraordinary session:

Judge Niess' ruling today upholds what the Wisconsin electorate expects, which is equity in government. Today's ruling is a win for the people of Wisconsin; it reaffirms that one party cannot act as a dictatorship over the other. We must act in earnest, with a spirit of compromise and that compromise begins with republican members acceptance that the people of Wisconsin elected Tony Evers governor.",GOP 'Lame Duck' Laws Back In Effect After New Court Ruling,USA Patch,https://patch.com/wisconsin/mountpleasant/gop-lame-duck-laws-back-effect-after-new-court-ruling

But Republicans said Democrats were denying them a vote on the Green New Deal. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,","Suddenly the climate is hot on Capitol Hill.

A day after the Senate blocked consideration of the Green New Deal, lawmakers from both parties were still talking about climate change. House Democrats pushed a plan to keep the U.S. in a global climate agreement, while Senate Democrats formed a special climate committee to match one in the House.

Republicans, meanwhile, continued to mock the Green New Deal as a step toward socialism and pushed for a House vote similar to the one in the Senate. The GOP launched a House Energy Action Team, or HEAT, to push an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy and counteract what they called the ""radical"" and economically devastating Green New Deal.

""Now everyone's talking about climate change,"" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said at one of three separate news conferences Wednesday on the issue.

While no Democrats supported the Green New Deal in a Senate test vote forced by Republicans Tuesday, the sheer volume of discussion made clear the plan has struck a nerve as both parties seek to use it to their advantage in the 2020 elections.

""Democrats are on offense"" about climate change, Schumer said as he announced a Democrat-only committee on climate. ""We're feeling really good about where we're moving.""

Results in the Senate showed otherwise, Republicans said.

Senators voted 57-0 against a procedural motion to take up the nonbinding resolution, which calls for the U.S. to shift away from fossil fuels such as oil and coal and replace them with renewable sources such as wind and solar power.

Again and again, GOP lawmakers noted that no Democrat supported the motion, even as all 53 Republicans opposed it. Three Democrats — Doug Jones of Alabama, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia — joined Republicans to oppose the plan, as did independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with Democrats.

Instead, 43 Democrats— including Schumer and Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, the bill's lead sponsor — voted ""present.""

Democrats called the vote scheduled by GOP leaders a ""sham"" and said it carried its own political risk by mocking an issue — climate change — that a growing number of Americans care deeply about.

""All across the country, people young and old are mobilized, organized and galvanized to take action now on climate change,"" Markey said.

Republicans dismissed the plan as a government takeover of the economy that could bankrupt the nation with an unrealistic goal of obtaining net-zero carbon emissions within 10 years.

""We are not going to be successful at reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and lowering our carbon emissions through virtue signaling,"" said Sen Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. ""And that is all the Green New Deal boils down to: lofty goals and aspirations with no concrete plan or concern as to feasibility.""

RELATED: Can Climate Change Fiction Build Consensus, Empathy?

Voters ""see through this Republican disgrace here in our Capitol,"" Markey countered. ""They know that Democrats are the party of climate action, and Republicans are the party of climate denial.""

But Republicans said Democrats were denying them a vote on the Green New Deal. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has rejected calls to schedule a vote on the plan and has given no timetable when or if it will reach the House floor.

""Even Speaker Pelosi doesn't want a vote"" on the Green New Deal, ""because she herself recognizes it's too radical,"" said Georgia Rep. Jody Hice, a member of the GOP energy team who has vowed to force a floor vote on the climate plan. Hice dared freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and other Green New Deal supporters to show ""political courage"" and agree to a recorded vote.

""When a leftist bill is too radical even for Barack Obama, you know it must be bad policy,"" said House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., who created the GOP energy team. Scalise was referring to comments by former President Barack Obama at a meeting with freshman Democrats this week, where he warned them to think about how their ""bold"" ideas will work and how they will be paid for.

Schumer and other Democrats insisted they were winning, citing polls showing that a clear majority of Americans support action on climate change. A December NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that two-thirds of Americans believe action is needed to combat climate change, and a record 45 percent say the problem is serious enough to demand immediate action.

A growing number of Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, now say they believe climate change is real and that humans play a role in it.

Republicans don't agree with Democrats on possible solutions, a fact Schumer cited in forming the Democratic climate panel, which will be led by Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii. ""We won't wait for Republicans to highlight this issue, with the urgency it requires,"" Schumer said.

In the House, Pelosi and other Democrats introduced a bill to ensure the U.S. honors its commitments under the landmark Paris climate agreement, which President Donald Trump withdrew from in 2017.

""Despite what President Trump has said, America cannot and will not retreat"" on climate change, said Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla., chairwoman of a House select committee on climate.

The bill ""is just the start"" of action needed on climate, Castor said, but unlike the Green New Deal, it has the potential to win Republican support. ""There are many ideas, including this one, that are consistent with the urgency and ambition that the Green New Deal underscores,"" she said.

On March 15, a gunman opened fire on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, during Friday prayers, killing 50 people and injuring many more. It was the country’s first mass shooting in more than a decade. Three days later, cabinet members agreed to develop a massive overhaul of the nation’s gun laws, including a ban on military-style assault weapons.

That show of unified political will, leading to swift action, stands in contrast to the U.S., where there has been more push-and-pull after innumerable high-profile mass shootings in recent years: at Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut and a Sikh temple in Wisconsin in 2012, Emanuel AME Church in Charleston in 2015, Orlando’s Pulse nightclub in 2016, at a Las Vegas country music festival and a Texas church in 2017, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida and a Pittsburgh synagogue last year (and the list goes on).

There have been many calls for gun reform, including a movement led by student survivors. In February, the Democratic-controlled House passed the first major gun bills in a generation to face unclear prospects in the Senate. Yet the only significant change to tighten U.S. gun regulations since 1994 — when former President Bill Clinton signed an assault weapon ban that lasted 10 years but applied only to guns manufactured after the bill became law — came Tuesday, when the Trump administration’s ban on bump stocks went into effect.

While nearly 40,000 people die from firearms in America each year, New Zealand’s response to this month’s terrorist attack has some people asking how that country moved so quickly to change its laws.

What New Zealand did

Seventy-two hours after the mosque attacks, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said her cabinet had agreed to reform the country’s gun laws, which had largely been unchanged since 1992.

Only a few days later, Ardern announced a ban on military-style semi-automatic weapons, along with high-capacity magazines. She also vowed to reduce the number of guns in the country by encouraging owners to get rid of their firearms. New Zealand lawmakers are expected to approve legislation soon after Parliament takes up the changes in the first week of April, and the government is developing a buyback program for owners of military-style semi-automatic guns.

The law is likely to provide some exemptions to the new restrictions, including gun use for professional pest control and international sporting competitions.

What has the U.S. done?

To summarize recent gun control developments in the U.S. is a more complicated story.

The most recent changes to federal firearm laws came in response to the shooting at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas, where 58 people were killed in October 2017 in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The gunman’s use of bump stocks — attachments added to guns that allow rifles to fire multiple rounds like machine guns — raised fresh concerns about whether the device should be legal.

In response, President Donald Trump directed the Justice Department to issue a ban on bump stocks. That ban went into effect Tuesday. Congress debated legislative fixes after the Las Vegas shooting as well, including creating a universal background check system for purchasing firearms, but did not pass major gun legislation.

Years earlier, Congress also considered a bill after the Newtown elementary school shooting where 26 people were killed. In April 2013, a bipartisan amendment failed in the Senate by six votes that would have required background checks on gun sales.

Last year, after the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, some states passed so-called red flag laws, which allow police and family members to petition state authorities to take guns away from someone believed to be experiencing high levels of stress or who is mentally ill and could pose a threat to themselves or others.

In 2018, Florida’s then-Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, signed into law gun restrictions that were supported by survivors of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas shooting.

Some states have also loosened gun regulations since then. Florida lawmakers are currently considering a bill to join other states in allowing teachers to carry guns in the classroom, despite opposition from educators and students. This month, Kentucky became the 16th state in the U.S. to allow concealed carry without a permit. With Republican Gov. Matt Bevin’s signature on the bill, the state law goes into effect this July. On March 21, Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., and Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., introduced the Freedom Financing Act, a bill to ensure that financial institutions can’t deny pro-Second Amendment industry transactions.

“Big banks should not be the arbiters of constitutionality,” Cramer said in a statement. “A small number of banks controlling most of the financial sector could effectively illegalize legal commerce by refusing to finance certain industries or process certain transactions.”

In the fall, the Supreme Court, now more conservative than in recent years, will hear its first gun rights case in almost a decade. The court will review whether a New York City gun law that restricts owners from carrying a firearm outside their home is constitutional.

Meanwhile, more than six years after the Sandy Hook shooting, the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled earlier this month that victims and their families can sue Remington over how the gun-maker marketed the rifle used in the attack.

How do U.S. and New Zealand gun laws differ?

The major difference between American and New Zealand gun laws is that New Zealand’s constitution does not provide a “right to bear arms.”

In New Zealand, gun ownership is thought of as privilege, not a right, as the former police minister noted last week.

To buy a firearm, New Zealanders must have a firearm permit that is granted on a case-by-case basis after a background check by authorities. Firearms permits last up to 10 years. After that time, they have to be re-vetted before they can be renewed.

WATCH: New Zealand prime minister says shooting suspect was a licensed gun owner

Americans, on the other hand, are not required to have a permit to buy a firearm. In some places, including at many gun shows, they are not even required to undergo a background check.

Some states do require permits to carry a concealed weapon, such as a handgun, that are valid for a set number of years as determined by the state.

A handful of states have bans on assault-style weapons, but their definitions and rules vary.

In the U.S., “a large share of the guns used in crime are trafficked from states with minimal regulations,” said Daniel Webster, the director of the Center for Gun Policy and Research at Johns Hopkins University. “Our federal laws are quite lax. No background checks for private transfers. No licensing of gun purchasers or owners. No ban of assault weapons or large capacity ammunition feeding devices.”

Age restrictions for gun ownership are also largely left up to the states. It is a felony in Colorado for anyone under the age of 18 to possess a handgun, with few exceptions, including hunting sports. But Montana does not have a law penalizing children of any age from obtaining firearms, according to the Giffords Law Center, an advocacy group founded by former congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who survived a shooting in 2011.

In contrast, the minimum age for unsupervised use and possession of a shotgun or a rifle in New Zealand is 16.

Public opinion

In the U.S., the divide can be stark between Republicans and Democrats, men and women, gun owners and non-gun owners. In a country with a population 70 times larger than New Zealand’s, the political divisions on gun policy have been difficult to overcome.

Yet Americans have found common ground on some issues. Polling from last October from the Pew Research Center shows 89 percent of Republicans, independents and Democrats say “mentally ill people should be barred from buying guns.”

Approximately 79 percent of Republicans also support background checks at public gun shows and other events where private sales of firearms occur.

Other changes, such as banning semi-automatic weapons, are not as popular. What’s more, support for banning assault weapons has dropped over time. In 1996, when Gallup surveyed Americans about an assault weapon ban, support for it was 57 percent. In 2018, 40 percent of Americans approved of such a ban. Less than half of Americans also believe there would be fewer mass shootings if people had a harder time obtaining semi-automatic weapons, according to Pew.

Data on gun ownership and attitudes about guns in New Zealand are far different. Of 4.9 million New Zealanders, just 6 percent hold a firearm license, compared to 30 percent of Americans who own at least one gun. There are also an estimated 1.1 million firearms in New Zealand, according to government data. In the U.S., there are more guns than there are people. (According to a June 2018 Small Arms Survey estimate, there are more than 393 million civilian-held firearms in the U.S., both legal and illegal; the U.S. population is 330 million.)

In New Zealand, many farmers own guns to control pests. However, New Zealand’s Federated Farmers, a lobbying group for farmers, came out quickly in support of the gun reforms announced after the March 15 shootings.

But even if rural residents were opposed to the new rules, they do not have as much voting power to influence the issue compared to New Zealanders who live in urban areas, according to Webster.

New Zealand’s Parliament is unicameral, meaning that it is made up of just one legislature. Voters elect representatives, which form a coalition with like-minded parties, and those elected officials nominate the prime minister. Gun reform measures do not have to pass obstacles the way a bill would in the U.S., where gun proposals would have to get the seal of approval from, at the moment, a Democratic House, a Republican Senate and Republican White House.

In the U.S., states have more control over local gun laws. And states with largely rural populations, such as Wyoming, have the same number of U.S. senators as states like California that are more liberal and urban.

“Rural residents are more likely to think that they are responsible for their personal and family safety because they do not live close to law enforcement and that guns will help keep them safe,” Webster said. “Guns and gun ownership also have deep cultural meaning among people who live in or grew up in rural communities.”

The gun lobby

“The US isn’t NZ,” tweeted Dana Loesch, a National Rifle Association spokesperson, last week. “While they do not have an inalienable right to bear arms and to self defense, we do.”

Another difference: Gun lobbyists are a force in both the U.S. and New Zealand, but their scale and political influence in the two countries is starkly different.

New Zealand’s Council of Licenced Firearms Owners has opposed the prime minister’s gun law proposal. The group is asking islanders to sign a petition that calls the new firearm proposals “unjust to law abiding New Zealand citizens.”

“The gun lobby is much more powerful in the U.S.,” Webster said. “The gun lobby and politicians often appeal to fear of racial, ethnic or religious minorities to promote gun ownership and the deregulation of guns.”

Nicole McKee, a board member of the New Zealand gun group, said in a video statement that she can support effective changes “so that terrorist attacks cannot happen again.” But McKee said she expects her organization and pro-gun advocates “to be part of a constructive dialogue.”

McKee’s group has called on New Zealand’s House of Representatives to allow for an in-depth public consultation period on changes to the country’s firearms laws.

It is not the first time the organization, and other pro-gun groups in New Zealand, have tried to stop gun control measures.

In 1997, High Court Judge Sir Thomas Thorp suggested several amendments to New Zealand firearm laws, including a buy-back program for military-style semi-automatic weapons. The Council of Licenced Firearms Owners argued at the time that the bill would be too costly.

“Special interest groups prevent meaningful change,” said Philip Alpers, an adjunct professor at the Sydney School of Public Health and founder of GunPolicy.org, which tracks gun laws worldwide.

In the U.S., the NRA has ramped up its lobbying efforts to entirely different levels. According to Open Secrets, an organization that tracks campaign and lobbying contributions, the NRA spent $1.67 million on lobbying efforts in 2008. Ten years later, that number grew to $5.08 million. The NRA’s political action committee spent roughly $19 million in 2018.

Their lobbying efforts have made a clear impact on politicians — no matter under which party they fall. Democrats proudly tout their F rating from the NRA, while Republicans are often concerned about maintaining their A+ rating with the group. In 2017, Trump was the first president in 34 years to speak at the NRA’s annual Leadership Forum, and told the audience, “You have a true friend and champion in the White House.”

According to Richard Aborn, a former director of the Brady Campaign, it’s not that the U.S. can’t enact greater firearm regulations. “We just don’t, at the moment, have the political will.”

He is the author of The End of Greatness: Why America Can't Have (and Doesn't Want) Another Great President.

If there ever was a foreign policy decision made for Donald Trump, it has to be this week's presidential proclamation recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights.

The decision is perfectly in line with the Trumpian way: It's great politics, both for his friend Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and for him, especially looking toward 2020. It appeals to the president's ego by offering him a chance to unilaterally create another historic first (see U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem) and rightly or wrongly take a ride into the history books.

Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967 and then moved to annex the area in 1981. Most nations did not recognize that move and still consider the Golan occupied territory.

In recognizing Israel's sovereignty to the Golan Heights, President Trump has come up with a solution to a problem Washington never had. In doing so, he has created new problems that undermine the U.S. national interest and Trump's own foreign policy agenda, including his stated plan for a peace deal in the region. And here's why.

Re-electing Netanyahu isn't a U.S. national interest

The administration has tried to link Trump's Golan decision to the need to counter Iranian efforts to attack Israel from the Golan. But it's a thin reed that just doesn't add up. The move will hand Iran, Hezbollah and Syria more propaganda advantage and might even incentivize them to focus more attention on Golan.

Far more compelling, two weeks from what is certain to be a closely fought election in Israel, is Trump's desire to give Netanyahu an edge in the race. It's not only good politics for Netanyahu — a politician with whom Trump has bonded as they both claim to face a hostile media; a liberal establishment and ""deep state"" conspiracies.

It's also great politics for the U.S. president looking for re-election in 2020. Strong support for Israel is music to the ears of millions of evangelical Christians, conservative Republicans and a significant number, though hardly a majority, of American Jews who vote Democratic. Trump has intensified his efforts of late to establish the Republican Party as the go-to party on Israel and even to paint Democrats as ""anti-Israel"" and ""anti-Jewish.""

Previous U.S. administrations have also intervened in Israeli elections to play their favorites, but nothing as blatant as this one-two punch. Little more than a week ago, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo traveled to Israel and visited the Western Wall in Jerusalem accompanied by the Israeli prime minister, a first for a top American diplomat.

Trump's move on Golan had nothing to do with the national interest and everything to with his politics and his ego.

The Golan move was gratuitous

Whatever pressure there was to change the status of the Golan, President Trump's move was tethered purely to his and Netanyahu's political calculations.

Indeed, far from wanting to assert Israeli sovereignty, most recent administrations — largely at Israel's request — were interested in testing the possibility that Syria and Israel might be able to do a deal over the Golan.

Back in 1981, Prime Minister Menachem Begin introduced legislation that eventually became basic law that extended Israeli law, jurisdiction and administration over the Golan Heights. He had been pressed by a well-organized Golan lobby and international pressures and focus to demonstrate Israel's connection to the Golan Heights.

There was significant external reaction to the annexation, including a critical United Nations Security Council Resolution and the Reagan administration's suspending a Memorandum of Understanding on Strategic Cooperation with Israel.

Trump's move on Golan occurred at a time when, both inside Israel and outside, there were no pressures on the country or the Netanyahu government to change the status of the territory. In fact, it was widely assumed that, because of the chaos created by the Syrian civil war and the pariah status of Syrian President Bashar Assad and his regime, any negotiations or status change regarding the Golan Heights were far-fetched and irrelevant.

Perhaps the administration didn't think through the implications of the Golan move, or didn't care. But U.S. recognition of sovereignty set a damaging precedent both in the Middle East and outside. - Aaron David Miller, vice president at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and former State Department adviser and Middle East negotiator

Unlike recognition of Jerusalem or opening a U.S. Embassy there, which had figured prominently in Republican and Democratic campaign commitments, there were no long-standing pressures to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan. Netanyahu had raised this issue off and on, and recently there had been legislation by Republican lawmakers, but those were hardly significant pressure points.

Encouraging unilateralism

Perhaps the administration didn't think through the implications of the Golan move, or didn't care. But U.S. recognition of sovereignty set a damaging precedent both in the Middle East and outside. It hardly matters if the administration believed that it was simply recognizing reality and that there were no prospects for any negotiation over the Golan or peace treaty with Syria. The administration's action created a new reality.

First, it undermined not only U.N. resolutions critical to the Arab-Israeli conflict but the U.N. Charter itself, including the principles of peaceful resolution of disputes and the unacceptability of the acquisition of territory by force. Validating Israel's sovereignty over Golan sent a powerful signal to authoritarian leaders everywhere that what they've done (see Russia in Crimea and Ukraine) or what they might do in the future would somehow be acceptable and go unchallenged.

There are major differences between territory Israel acquired after being attacked by Syria in 1967 and Russian aggression in Crimea. But the ultimate status of the Golan Heights — as many Israeli leaders including Netanyahu have acknowledged through their own peace efforts with Syria — might have been resolved through negotiations.

Israel was in fact prepared for full withdrawal from the Golan even after it annexed the area in 1981. It is doubtful, particularly after the Syrian civil war, the Iranian threat, growing support among the public for keeping the Heights and Trump's recognition of sovereignty, Israel would be prepared to do so again.

Undermining Trump's own agenda

The Golan move will also directly undercut the president's own commitment to broker the so-called ultimate deal between Israel and the Palestinians. The Arab states — even the Saudis — have rejected the move publicly. And if Trump was expecting their cooperation in either reaching out to Israel or pressuring the Palestinians, that's going to be much harder now.

Palestinians who have already been hammered by the Trump administration — the Palestine Liberation Organization's office in Washington was closed, U.S. assistance to Palestinians was cut — will rightly conclude that Trump has opened the door to Israeli efforts to annex part of the West Bank. Indeed, the prime minister asserted on returning to Israel that Trump's decision proved that you can keep occupied territory as long as it was acquired in a defensive war. A new Haaretz poll suggests 42 percent of Israelis favor some form of annexation of the West Bank. If Netanyahu wins the next election and his option is a right-wing government, the trend lines in favor of annexing part of the West Bank may intensify.

Indeed, the Trump ultimate deal initiative reportedly to be announced after Israel's April 9 elections was already facing long odds of success. The president's Golan decision may well ensure that the door to his Israeli-Palestinian peace plan remains closed for the season.

Ever since the news broke on March 15 of two consecutive mass shootings at the Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre in Christchurch, New Zealand, corporate media has been determined to establish that suspect Brenton Tarrant acted alone in the terrorist attacks that took the lives of 50 innocent Muslim worshippers and wounded 50 others.

While mainstream media has been predictably eager to parade the tragedy as another chapter in the wave of rising Islamophobia and right-wing extremism globally, they have put equal effort into conscientiously avoiding any evidence that contradicts the ‘lone wolf’ theory they decided on in the initial hours following the first mass shooting in New Zealand since 1997.

Whenever terrorism is committed by Arabs or Muslims, the fourth estate is usually anxious to speculate whether or not the suspect is connected to a larger radical syndicate. However, the same scrutiny is seldom applied to white nationalists like Tarrant.

In fact, they are even hesitant to label it ‘terrorism’ at all, with everyone from The Daily Telegraph to the fanatical Zionist Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News settling for the choice words ‘mass shooting.’ While Tarrant denies being part of any group in his public declaration, he does hint that he is part of a broader extremist network:

I am not a direct member of any organization or group, though I have donated to many nationalist groups and have interacted with many more. No group ordered my attack, I make the decision myself. Though I did contact the reborn Knights Templar for a blessing in support of the attack, which was given.”

As many have noted, the “Knights Templar” is the name of an anti-Muslim militant group that another infamous right-wing terrorist, Anders Behring Breivik, claimed to belong to. During the 2011 Norway attacks, Breivik targeted a government building in the city of Oslo and a youth camp of the ruling Labour party on the island of Utøya in a sequential car bombing and mass shooting that killed a total of 77 people.

However, the media and prosecutors in Breivik’s trial were insistent that the group was fictional and the only possibility was that he was an ‘army of one’ while suffering from a psychiatric disorder, another trait that is apparently only applicable to white-skinned terrorists. There was no serious inquiry into whether he was part of a larger nexus, even though he had direct contact with groups like the English Defense League (EDL), the British far right Islamophobic group led by neo-fascist agitator Tommy Robinson.

Breivik was portrayed as a fundamentalist Christian but was curiously a member of the Norwegian Order of Freemasons, an organization with a history of ties to the espionage world and susceptible to infiltration because of its inherent secrecy. The original Knights Templar, or “Templars,” were a Christian army founded in the 10th century who initially shielded pilgrims voyaging to the Holy Land and later fought against Muslims during the Crusades while the name is drawn from the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.

What has been downplayed by the yellow press is the specific brand of Islamophobic extremism that was the basis of Tarrant’s attacks. His ideology is revealed in a 73-page manifesto, entitled “The Great Replacement” in reference to the ‘white genocide’ theory held by white nationalist identitarians, which he dispatched less than ten minutes prior to the ambush in emails to several media outlets and Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s office.

While the corporate press is correct that Tarrant and Breivik clearly follow the practices of the anti-Islam xenophobic movement on the rise in Europe, North America and now Oceania, the key element they have deliberately avoided mentioning is a strong collective affinity for the state of Israel.

The coverage of Christchurch has repeated the same pattern displayed following the 2011 Norway attacks where the distinguishing characteristic of the extremism both culprits adhere to is of a staunchly pro-Zionist variety which has been decidedly overlooked. In the eight years between the two attacks, the pro-Israel European right has only augmented in size.

In his manifesto, Brenton Tarrant even boasted the unverified claim to have had “brief contact with Knight Justiciar Breivik” while taking “true inspiration” from him. His Norwegian idol had his own 1,500 page manifesto where Israel was approvingly name-dropped nearly 400 times while he declared:

So let us fight together with Israel, with our Zionist brothers against all anti-Zionists, against all cultural Marxists/multiculturalists.”

The combination of far right nationalism and support for Israel may seem like an unlikely combination, but it is an ideology shared by most of the Islamophobic and anti-immigrant political parties throughout Europe that have performed impressively well in European Parliament elections. These include Hungary’s Fidesz, the Italian League and Five Star Movement, the Flemish Flaams Belang, Poland’s Law and Justice, Belgian People’s Party, the Progress Party of Norway (of which Breivik was a member), True Finns Party, France’s National Rally, Alternative for Deutschland, and many others.

It is likely that Tarrant, like Breivik, is not anti-semitic and actually views Jews as ‘allies’ in a civilizational crusade against Islam. Just as Israel has helped orchestrate the US wars in the Middle East against its enemies that has contributed to the mass influx of refugees seeking asylum in the West, it has fostered the Islamophobic backlash to it by supporting the growing far right movement that is ascendant.

Following the tragedy in Christchurch, it was revealed that 28-year old Tarrant had traveled extensively throughout Europe, the Middle East and Asia, including to Afghanistan, Pakistan and even North Korea. The year prior, he also visited Israel for nine days, just as his fellow Christian Zionist Breivik had done several times prior to 2011. Tarrant’s journey in Europe included a stop in Ukraine, a hotbed of neo-Nazi activity and as it happens during the massacre he donned the SS wolf’s hook symbol used by the right wing paramilitary group Azov Battalion to which Israel has provided weapons support in its fight against pro-Russian separatists.

The blend of such considerable travel activity while stockpiling a cache of semi-automatic firearms with a digital footprint espousing his extremist views online makes the likelihood that Tarrant managed to remain under the radar of the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service (SIS) difficult to believe. It is especially doubtful they would be unable to detect him considering he was reportedly interviewed by New Zealand police prior to obtaining his firearms license in 2017.

Judging by the Facebook live-streamed video of the massacre shot by the suspect himself wearing a GoPro head-mounted camera that resembled a first-person shooter video game shows he was no amateur and possibly professionally trained as a militant. Given his extensive travel and the apparent expertise used to carry out the attacks, there are many legitimate questions about how his ventures were sponsored and whether he had accomplices.

Police found undetonated car bombs in addition to his arsenal and believe he was planning on carrying out a third attack with them. What was he doing in his travels? Was he really able to finance everything alone using crypto-currency investments as purported by the media? He could very well have been a patsy in a larger plot or received support from abroad. For instance, from a certain national intelligence service whose notorious motto is “for by cunning stratagems, you wage war.”

Mossad covert operations have been exposed several times over the years violating New Zealand’s sovereignty and international law which caused a series of diplomatic rows between the two countries. Most recently was in 2011 following a 6.2 magnitude earthquake in Christchurch which caused significant damage to the city and killed 185 people, coincidentally the very same week as the attacks in Norway by Anders Breivik.

Incredibly, a stone structure of a building collapsed onto a van during the earthquake which killed a man inside who turned out to be an Israeli national. His death accidentally unearthed a ring of Mossad agents after the man was discovered with multiple fake passports and USB flash drives which contained confidential data believed to have been illegally downloaded from the New Zealand police’s national computer system.

The other agents in the Israeli sleeper cell were able to flee the country less than a day after his body was discovered, probably to avoid the fallout that occurred after an earlier incident in the country just a few years prior. In 2004, two Israeli men who turned out to be Mossad agents were arrested trying to obtain fraudulent passports and travel documentation that included stealing the identity of a quadriplegic. The two men were subsequently jailed for six months for engaging in criminal enterprise.

Mossad seemed to have developed a habit of revealing themselves in light of the infamous arrest of five of its agents in Secaucus, New Jersey on the morning of September 11th, 2001 by the FBI who were tipped off that a group of men were observed suspiciously dancing and celebrating while watching the WTC towers ablaze and collapsing across the Hudson River.

The “dancing Israelis” were found with $5,000 in cash which raised suspicions while their vehicle was traced to a shady moving company called Urban Moving Systems that was suspected to be a front for an intelligence operation after their headquarters was abandoned and its owner, Dominick Suter, immediately fled to Israel following their apprehension. During their two month detention, the CIA intervened and halted the probe while the agents were subsequently deported in a deal with the Israeli government for overstaying their visas but not before it was confirmed that at least two of the men were intelligence officers and no ordinary moving company employees.

The world was briefly reminded of this mysterious case when Donald Trump as a presidential candidate in 2016 made the wild exaggeration that on 9/11 he had personally observed “thousands of Muslims” celebrating the destruction of the Twin Towers across the river in New Jersey. It is likely that Trump mixed up two different reports from 9/11, one of Reuters footage widely circulated by major networks of a small group of Arabs in East Jerusalem celebrating the attacks and the reports about the Israelis arrested in New Jersey who were initially believed to have been of “Middle Eastern appearance” and descent.

One wonders if Trump would accurately recall his other observations that morning now that he is in the service of his Saudi and Israeli masters. Needless to say, this widely suppressed story which should have been front page news led many to rightly suspect there was prior knowledge and even direct involvement among Israeli intelligence in the 9/11 attacks, along with a trove of other evidence.

The New Jersey cell were also in possession of foreign passports. Mossad has typically used fake passports, including that of Australians and Kiwis, regularly for its clandestine operations and carrying out assassinations like the 2010 targeted killing of Hamas official Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in Dubai which one of the spies apprehended in New Zealand, Zev Barkan, was involved in. After the arrest of the two spooks in New Zealand in 2004, the government imposed diplomatic sanctions against Israel and temporarily severed high-level contacts between the two countries in what became a significant diplomatic rift. WikiLeaks diplomatic cables revealed that the U.S. was not at all pleased.

Relations had returned to normal between the countries until December 2016 when along with Malaysia, Senegal, Venezuela and others, New Zealand co-sponsored the controversial United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 which condemned Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territories during the last months of the Obama administration. The same motion briefly became mired in the Trump-Russia investigation when former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn pled guilty to lying to the FBI about lobbying activities related to the resolution during the transition between administrations on behalf of Israel.

The Trump White House has since proven to be the most fanatically Zionist presidency since the foundation of the Jewish state in 1948. Over the years, New Zealand has shown a willingness to stand up to Jerusalem and its brazen disregard for international law that other nations could learn from. Despite being a small nation, it has played an important role in pro-Palestinian activism and the prospect of Palestinian statehood just as it did in protesting South African Apartheid in the 1980s.

In 2018, when New Zealand-born popular musician Lorde canceled a concert in Tel Aviv in solidarity with the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, she became the target of vicious Zionist smear campaign which saw right-wing Trumpist Rabbi Schmuley Boteach take out a full-page ad in The Washington Post denouncing her as a bigot while a $13,000 lawsuit was filed by the Mossad-linked Shurat HaDin lawfare NGO. Meanwhile, unlike Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Jacinda Ardern has been critical of the Trump administration’s move of the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, stating it undermines the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.

New Zealand’s relatively even-handed foreign policy has likely rattled the Zionists and their far right Islamophobic counterparts in the West and it is possible that it is viewed as a threat to the interests of Israel and the U.S. The feasibly manufactured terrorist attack against New Zealand has greatly disrupted the small country, a state which in 2018 had its lowest homicide rate in 40 years and averages well below 100 murders per year, making this attack an extremely rare occurrence for the peaceful country.

In light of the attacks on the mosques in Christchurch, it could now end up acquiring the police state model of the U.S. and Israel as part of the global ‘War on Terror.’ The country immediately issued a ban on semiautomatic weapons following the tragedy in a disturbing rollback of civil liberties while engaging in an unprecedented censorship effort to criminalize sharing and possession of Tarrant’s manifesto and video. Prior to Breivik’s perpetration of the attacks in Norway, there had been significant political tensions between Oslo and Jerusalem in the months leading up to the violence due to Norway’s intent to recognize a Palestinian state and the circumstances in relations between New Zealand and Israel prior to Christchurch is eerily reminiscent.

Israel has a storied history of being a state sponsor of international terrorism as well as the use of ‘false flag’ operations to achieve its political objectives, most notably in the 1954 Lavon Affair, codenamed Operation Susannah, where the Aman branch of its military intelligence services recruited Egyptian nationals to commit bombings to be blamed on the Muslim Brotherhood in order to maintain desired British military presence in Egypt.

It continues such cloak-and-dagger tactics to this day with the use of terror proxies such as the Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK) and Mojahedin-e-Khalq (MEK) to undermine Iran, as well as the arming and funding of al-Qaeda affiliated Syrian jihadist groups against the Assad government. If it is willing to co-sponsor radical Islamists with its ally Saudi Arabia to attack their mutual regional enemies, now that the ruling Likud Party has made strange bedfellows with far right Islamophobes in the West it is within the realm of possibility it would continue to do the same especially when the victims are Arab or Muslim.

Regardless of whether or not there turns out to be any Mossad fingerprints discovered on the Christchurch shootings, if the world is serious about confronting the emerging far right internationally it must be willing to accurately diagnose the phenomenon. One of its most distinctive attributes is its Christian Zionism and a shared belief that the Bible gives Israel evidential right to Palestinian land and that Jews are inherently non-indigenous to Europe.

The ever-expanding colonization of the West Bank and Gaza has solidified Israel’s nationalist foundations, especially now that Arabic has been removed as a second official language and the passing of the 2018 Nationality Law defining Israel as an ethno-nationalist state with Arabs officially second-class citizens. If Israel did not directly participate in the 9/11 attacks by infiltrating the al-Qaeda cell in Hamburg, Germany and directing the airplane hijackings as many legitimately suspect, it has certainly facilitated the U.S. wars in the Middle East against its regional enemies and now it is nurturing the Islamophobic far right in the West hostile to the flood of displaced refugees fleeing them.

Israeli policy has principally benefited from all this but one can only expect the hasbaric retaliation of ‘anti-Semitism’ smears like those against UK Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and U.S. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar of Minnesota for pointing this out. In the meantime, the Russiagate hoax has deflected attention away from Jerusalem toward Moscow in regards to foreign cultivation of the growing far right nationalist movement in the West. One hopes the recent bust of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report will put some of the distraction to rest and shift the speculation toward Israel where it belongs.

Finally, the political confusion of zealots like Tarrant needs to be addressed as entirely predictable instead of as unintended consequences of the War on Terror and the financial crisis. Recently, 2020 Democratic U.S. Presidential candidate Andrew Yang became the subject of establishment-led smears simply for acknowledging verifiable facts about declining birth-rates of white Americans where he was vilified as adjoining with the views of those like Tarrant. Yet these statistics designated by race that Yang recognized are expressions of the results of class conflict while genuine anger is being misdirected toward immigrants instead of capital and its never-ending changes in labor demands.

This is the cycle which must be broken if this holy war between the West and Islam stirred up by Zionists or what the orientialist Samuel Huntington called the ‘clash of civilizations’ is to end. If not, we cannot only expect the U.S. empire to continue its downward slide and its fear of a multipolar world to culminate in an internecine that will turn the whole world into a tragedy like Christchurch.

The Lead

The Liberal MPs on the House ethics committee have defeated a motion calling for Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott to appear before the body to testify on a proposed study into the SNC-Lavalin controversy.

Moved by Tory member Peter Kent, the motion won the support of the three opposition MPs during Tuesday’s special meeting, but it couldn’t draw any support among the six Liberals who sit on the committee. Conservative MP Bob Zimmer serves as chair of the committee.

“Well, the cover-up continues,” Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre told reporters after the meeting. “Liberals had a chance to put votes where their mouths were, and instead, they decided to vote for another cover-up.”

During the meeting, Liberal MP and committee member Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, speaking on behalf of his party colleagues, argued that the committee wasn’t the “right forum” for the study because one had already been undertaken by the justice committee and such an inquiry would be better suited for a parliamentary commissioner.

He also said it was “premature” for the ethics committee to hold a study since the justice committee has yet to receive emails and text transcripts promised by Wilson-Raybould to verify her allegations.

Jolson Lim has the full story.

In Canada:

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is dismissing suggestions of deep-seated fractures in the Liberal caucus, pointing to last week’s voting marathon in the House as helping in solidifying party unity.

“Because of the tremendous opportunity to vote as a team for 30 hours last week … our team has come out stronger and more united than ever before,” he told reporters Tuesday morning at the Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology in Winnipeg. He was visiting the school to tout the Liberal government’s new training benefit program unveiled in the 2019 budget.

Wilson-Raybould and Philpott recently resigned from cabinet over the lingering SNC-Lavalin controversy, with both openly criticizing how the Prime Minister’s Office has handled the issue. Also, outspoken MP Celina Casear-Chavannes left the Liberal caucus last Wednesday after publicly criticizing Trudeau for how he responded to her announcement that she would not run in 2019. Marco Vigliotti has more.

Interestingly, Erskine-Smith penned an op-ed for the Toronto Star on Tuesday urging Wilson-Raybould and Philpott to stay in the Liberal caucus, despite their disagreements with the government.

“I am a Liberal member of parliament and I continue to support our Liberal government. But that does not mean that I support every government action taken, or that I ought to refrain from public disagreement,” he wrote.

Back to Trudeau, he was also asked during his media availability about a story that broke Monday that alleged that the professional relationship between the PM and Wilson-Raybould “first began to fray” back in 2017 because of concerns over who to name to the Supreme Court.

Trudeau, though, said it would be inappropriate for him to respond to the media reports, adding that “the choice of Supreme Court justices and indeed, chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, is always a decision of the prime minister.” Vigliotti also this one.

Keeping with the SNC-Lavalin controversy, the Globe and Mail is reporting that the Prime Minister’s Office received information last fall suggesting an internal disagreement with dispute Director of Public Prosecutions Kathleen Roussel and “one of the lower-ranking prosecutors handling the SNC-Lavalin bribery and fraud prosecution.”

Ex-Progressive Conservative MPP Randy Hillier says he’s in talks with the province’s ethics watchdog about possible illegal or unregistered lobbying of the Ford government. In a lengthy Tuesday afternoon press conference, Hillier repeatedly slammed the culture of “fear and intimidation” in Premier Doug Ford’s government but gave no evidence to back-up his fresh attacks or his previous allegations of illegal activity.

He said he started speaking with Integrity Commissioner J. David Wake about “possible illegal and/or unregistered lobbying” soon after he was suspended from the Tory caucus on Feb. 20. Marieke Walsh has the latest.

Former Afghanistan hostage Joshua Boyle’s assault trial continued in an Ottawa courtroom on Tuesday, with the court hearing a frantic, late-night 911 call he made in December 2017 to say his wife Caitlan Coleman was threatening to kill herself, reports the Canadian Press.

The call was what eventually triggered an investigation that led to Boyle’s arrest just two months after Pakistani forces freed the couple from its kidnappers. Boyle is charged with offences including assault, sexual assault, unlawful confinement and causing someone to take a noxious substance.

After the call, Ottawa police showed up at the Boyle family’s apartment and it was on that day that Coleman was “finally able to walk away from Mr. Boyle” after months of alleged domestic abuse, Crown attorney Meaghan Cunningham told the court on Monday.

The NDP is calling for the federal government to extend its mission in Mali to October to meet a request made by the United Nations, even though the government has said it plans to stay in the West African country only until mid-summer. The Canadian Press reported late last week that the UN had asked Canada to keep its forces in Mali until October, when their Romanian replacements will arrive.

Since the Mali mission was announced, the Canadian government has maintained that it will end at the end of July 2019. Charlie Pinkerton has more.

Canada’s armed forces, the RCMP and the Canada Border Services agency spent a total of $158,000 to send 42 employees to what’s billed as the biggest small arms show in the world last January.

In a written question in the Commons, B.C. Conservative MP Todd Doherty asked for expenditure details about federal employees who were “sent” to the annual SHOT Show in Las Vegas, Nev.

The annual exhibit, held in the sprawling Sands Expo Centre on the outskirts of the city’s downtown casinos, is limited to representatives from armed forces, police services, tactical police units, the gun industry and related associations. It is not an event open to the general public, and no one under age 16 is allowed in. Tim Naumetz reports.

Internationally:

MPs in the U.K. Parliament took the unprecedented step Monday of seizing control of the parliamentary timetable as they look to resolve the deadlock over the terms of the country’s exit from the European Union. On Tuesday, they revealed the details of their plan to consider other Brexit options, as prime minister Theresa May was “warned more ministers could quit unless she changed course,” reports the BBC. The Commons will begin voting on alternatives on Wednesday, though this will likely continue into next week. MPs will complete a series of ballots to gauge support for different ideas.

The Democratic-controlled House in the U.S. fell short Tuesday in its bid to override the first veto issued by President Donald Trump, enabling him to divert more funding to build more barriers along the country’s southwest border with Mexico.

Lawmakers voted 248-181 in favour of overturning his veto of a motion passed by Congress annulling his national emergency declaration along the border, but it fell 38 votes short of the two-thirds majority required, reports the Associated Press.

Trump’s declaration allowed him to use a law that lets him shift already budgeted funding to address emergencies. This enabled him to move an additional $3.6 billion from “military construction projects to work on border barriers,” even though Congress voted this year to limit spending on such barriers to less than $1.4 billion.

The head of Algeria’s army is demanding that President Abdelaziz Bouteflika be declared “unfit to rule after weeks of protests against him,” reports the BBC. In a television address, the army’s chief of staff, Lt. Gen Ahmed Gaed Salah, said “we must find a way out of this crisis immediately, within the constitutional framework.”

Bouteflike has already agreed not to seek a fifth term in upcoming elections but they have been delayed in what critics say is a ploy to prolong his 20-year rule over the country. There have also been talks set up to draft a new constitution and set a date for elections but they have no scheduled start date.

Spain offered data to the FBI that it collected from a raid conducted against a self-proclaimed human rights group that allegedly led attack on the North Korean Embassy last month, the Associated Press reports.

National Court judge Jose de la Mata on Tuesday lifted the secrecy order in the case, saying it had found evidence of several crimes, such as trespassing, injuries, threats and burglary committed by “a criminal organization” at the Madrid embassy. He identified a Mexican, an American and a South Korean as the main suspects. Adrian Hong Chang, a Mexican national and resident in the United States, was named by the judge as the leader of a gang of 10 people who escaped on Feb. 22 after “stealing computers and documents from the embassy, where they shackled and gagged its staff.”

Last week, Ibibio Sound Machine’s third album, Doko Mien, marched into culture with the enthusiasm and blurring action of a parade. Their celebratory fusion of genres, musical periods, and languages (frontwoman Eno Williams alternates between singing in English and the Ibibio language of southern Nigeria) is as sturdy as ever and comes equipped with a palpable edge via the grit in Williams’s versatile blare, tactile synths, and frenetic rhythms.

Williams told Jezebel that the album came as a result of ideas grown on the road and developed in the studio by the London-based, eight-person group. “I would chant out certain lyrical melodies and Max [Grunhard] would record it and take it back to the studio and develop it from there,” she said of the conception of the album’s 11 songs. “Sometimes, we just had a title and would decide to create a melody with either Alfred [Kari Bannerman] on guitar, Max putting down some synth lines and then Anselmo [Netto] with the percussion. It kind of just morphed together.”

The multicultural band, which includes members from London, Ghana, and Brazil (Williams was born in London but lived in Nigeria from about age 4 to 21), sounds like a model U.N. at its most democratic. But it’s not all frictionless diplomacy all of the time—the name of the album, which means “tell me” in English, came from a song about creative disagreement.

“It’s got two meanings to it,” said Williams of the song. “The main meaning being asking the universe to tell me what to do and I’ll do it. And the flip side is about the commentary that women often get told what to do, but you still have to be able to speak up and air your views in a very political and diplomatic way, I guess. It happened because in that song there was a bit of going back and forth as to [Max saying], ‘My way is the right way.’ I’m like, ‘Yes, I know your way is the right way, but I want you to hear my way as well.’ But then we do come to a middle ground. Those kind of things come up in writing/production situations.”

Williams writes most of her band’s songs and counts Angelique Kidjo, Manu Dibango, Miriam Makeba, Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin, James Brown, even the Beatles, among her influences. She generally conceives them in Ibibio and translates them to English if she can get the syllables to fit and/or if she likes the sound. If she can’t, she leaves them in the Nigerian language. “If a phrase in English was maybe five words, in Ibibio it could be maybe 10 words,” she explained. “Trying to cut that and keep the melody line the same… some songs, the English just translated easier and flowed easily between English and Ibibio. Some other songs, we just kept it in Ibibio because it seemed fine.”

Conventional wisdom in the U.S., has been that music in languages other than English doesn’t attract an audience and is a hinderance, but Williams and her band have found great freedom in leaving their language options open. Below, Williams takes us through each Doko Mein track, filling us in on meaning, intention, and a glimpse into her creative process.

“I Need You To Be Sweet Like Sugar”

“When I was listening to the track, one of the stories I had growing up as a child just came to my mind, about the tongue being related to a love relationship, a couple who have their ups and downs and have to find a way to fix things. My grandmother would say, ‘Love is like the tongue. You get the sweet side, you get the sour side, the bitter side as well.’ That’s how love is.”

“Wanna Come Down”

“There’s sort of a poetic, metaphorical meaning to that because it just refers to a bubbling spring, the power of water, how it’s very healing and rejuvenates. We’re kind of asking this person who’s been sort of down and low to get down to the water and be renewed and revived. We’re also inviting the listener to join in on the celebration.”

“Tell Me”

“The [album] title came after all the songs had been put down. We thought, Tell Me, that kind of sums up the whole album. We’re asking the listener, ‘Tell me, I’m listening.’ The fact that it was also the back and forth process [between band members] kind of summed up the whole album. It has a kind of disco sound to it.”

“I Know That You’re Thinking About Me”

“I do love singing ballads because they’re a bit more reflective. We talked about it when we were recording the softer songs: ‘We’re known for the high-energy, high-octane sound, but we maybe need to break it up a little bit.’ Just to give a segue. I always say this could be a love song, depending on how you hear it, but it’s got kind of a different connotation to me. It’s talking about social media and the current obsession that usually only exists inside our digital curation. I try to be active on social media, but I’m so bad at it.”

“I Will Run”

“It was the last song [recorded]. We tried different things. We tried horns, we tried keeping it bare, we tried different vocals, but it just wasn’t getting there. And then we did that a vocal and we thought, ‘Let’s just keep it a cry-out kind of thing,’ and it just sort of worked. It’s talking about running to someone’s arms in times of trouble, but it could be anyone: God, a place.”

“Just Go Forward”

“I like that one. It’s kind of a mantra/chant, something we use to keep ourselves going. That mantra of perseverance, that constant drive that keeps the wheels of life moving. There’s no need to think about yesterday and things that could have been or could not have been. Just remembering that life is always about moving forward and change always happens, so we just have to go forward.”

It’s the whole concept of society being governed by money. It comes down to being happy with where you are.

“She Work Very Hard”

“That’s a folktale. It’s loosely [based] around being tied down by money and the fact that the rich are getting richer and the poor don’t seem to be getting anywhere. There’s sort of no middle ground between both sides of society. It draws back to a story of a young girl who was invited to a party and asked a friend to borrow her really expensive necklace, which she did. She got to the party and lost the necklace and ended up spending her whole life working to pay back the necklace. But it actually didn’t cost that much. She spent her whole life in bondage. It’s the whole concept of society being governed by money. It comes down to being happy with where you are.

“We do what we do because we love doing it. We’re not trying to make commercial music or anything to be like everybody else. We’re making music that hopefully appeals to people, more focusing on the creative side as opposed to the obvious and what people expect.”

“Nyak Mien”

“The title just means, ‘let me be.’ It’s just an internal conversation with any kind of negativity, which sometimes we all face. It’s about not wanting to have any negativity around, just trying to thrive through positivity.”

“Kuka”

Kuka is the imagination of an angel, whoever that might be, saying to the angel, “Stay right by me.”

“Guess We Found a Way”

“This is about trying to speak to people in a language that almost no one understands. I always get asked, ‘What are you singing about? We don’t understand.’ But then I say, ‘Well, music is a universal language so sometimes if you don’t understand what the singing is about the music has a way of getting to you so that you catch the vibe of the music so that you feel the energy or the emotion of the music.’ On the one hand, it’s talking about, ‘We found a way somehow to get this music across,’ and on the other hand, ‘I guess we found a way to speak to the eternal. I guess we found a way to communicate with each other.’ It’s letting the listener in on the storytelling process.”

“Basquiat”

“‘Basquiat’ is a celebration of the life of Jean-Michel Basquiat. We were asked to do a score for a [short] film that was done by Ephraim Asili for an exhibition that was done at the Barbican Center here in London. I did like his work a lot because I think it’s quite unique. In the same vein, he wasn’t perfect. I think he brought something very vibrant. Just going through his work and finding that he’d passed away, there’s a proverb in Ibibio that says, ‘The cow doesn’t know the use of its tail until it’s lost it.’ We lost him and now his work is everywhere, and everyone wants to own about him. We thought creating something celebrating his life would be worth giving to him.”",Ibibio Sound Machine Frontwoman Eno Williams on Her Band's Kaleidoscopic New Album,Jezebel,https://themuse.jezebel.com/ibibio-sound-machine-frontwoman-eno-williams-on-her-ban-1833616299

THE CANADIAN PRESS/ Tijana Martin

HALIFAX - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized Thursday for his sarcastic retort to an Indigenous protester who interrupted a Liberal fundraising event the night before in Toronto.

Trudeau said he's sorry for how he responded to the protester, who unfurled a banner at the foot of the stage in an effort to draw attention to the impact of mercury poisoning in the northern Ontario community of Grassy Narrows First Nation.

""Thank you for your donation,"" Trudeau told the woman as she was escorted out by security. ""I really appreciate your donation to the Liberal Party of Canada.""

Others in the audience, who paid $1,500 each in order to attend the event, cheered the prime minister's dismissive remark, which was captured by cellphone cameras and circulated on social media.

Trudeau showed more contrition when asked about the confrontation Thursday.

""As I think you all know, from time to time I'm in situations where people are expressing concerns or protesting a particular thing, and I always try to be respectful and always try to engage with them in a positive way,"" he said following an announcement in Halifax.

Indigenous people in Grassy Narrows, about 90 kilometres north of Kenora, Ont., have been contending for decades with chemical-waste mercury dumped into the English-Wabigoon river system throughout the 1960s and 1970s, poisoning fish and locals who rely on the river as a source of water and food.

The community hopes to build a world-class mercury treatment facility to help deal with the fallout from the poisoning, which causes often irreparable damage, including impaired vision, muscle weakness, speech, hearing and cognitive problems and and numbness or stinging pain in the extremities and mouth.

Grassy Narrows staff met with former Indigenous Services Minister Jane Philpott in December to discuss progress on the facility, shortly after giving the government a feasibility study for the project. At that time Philpott said the government was actively working to get it built.

Trudeau said he plans to follow up with Seamus O'Regan, who replaced Philpott on the Indigenous Services file in January, to ""make sure we are looking at exactly everything we can do to continue to work hard in resolving this situation.""

""It is something that is of real concern and a real piece of the path of reconciliation that we must walk on.""

The same principle would apply if the ...,"In understanding the politics of the Justin Trudeau/Jody Wilson-Raybould saga, it is useful to stand back and ask, what would happen if these were employees rather than elected officials? How would this play out in the employment law/corporate world?

The closest corporate analogy would be that of a chief executive arm-twisting the company’s chief financial officer to change a report or recommendation. The same principle would apply if the CEO pressured any executive with an independent oversight function respecting a company’s affairs, such as risk, compliance and internal and outside actuaries and auditors.

What happens in the workplace when that occurs? There is no question that, sometimes, a CEO considers it in the company’s interest for the CFO to write a report showing the CEO or the company in a better light. The CEO might have a personal interest in changing the CFO’s recommendation, such as helping that CEO keep the job, earn a bigger bonus or receive stock options. Or the CEO may have no such personal interest and simply disagree with the CFO.

In the Trudeau/Wilson-Raybould saga, the PM stated that saving SNC-Lavalin from criminal prosecution would help his own re-election bid as MP for the Montreal riding of Papineau and would assist the Quebec provincial Liberals in their own election.

Let me be clear. The conduct of the PM in constantly pressuring the AG to remove SNC-Lavalin from the criminal process to civil remediation is, in my view, obstruction of justice and therefore criminal. And any criminal conduct by a CEO (or any employee, whether it be Minister of Finance Bill Morneau, the Clerk of the Privy Council or a PMO staffer) is cause for discharge. In employment law, the more senior the position, the more likely dishonest or disreputable conduct will be found to be cause for discharge.

But a CEO pressuring a CFO, depending upon the circumstances, will not generally be criminal. And, for the sake of this analysis, I will assume that it was not.

Notwithstanding that, it remains a cause for discharge.

Ethics Committee rejects opposition call for new SNC-Lavalin probe

According to Richard Leblanc, professor of governance, law and ethics at York University, a CEO pressuring the CFO, or anyone with independent oversight, to move off of their independent judgment, so as to change their recommendation, report or decision, should be fired by the board of directors. Any good board, he tells me, would not hesitate to fire that CEO and a good CEO with a strong board would therefore never put undue pressure on those who are supposed to have independent judgment.

“Because there is so much gatekeeping now — the external and internal auditors and the CFO — there would not be very many areas where any pressure by a CEO to a CFO would be viewed as proper,” Leblanc says.

A CEO who has any concerns might speak up, but if the CFO’s opinion doesn’t change, a CEO would back off right away, Leblanc says. “The notion of repeated and sustained pressure, over multiple meetings and months, simply would never occur in any professional board. The CFO would go right to the audit committee to complain and the CEO would be disciplined or fired by the board.”

As Leblanc sees it, Wilson-Raybould was arguably retaliated against with her demotion to the veteran’s affairs portfolio from her position as justice minister and attorney general. Leblanc says such retaliation is highly unlikely to occur in any good company.

“The CEO would be immediately fired for any retaliation,” LeBlanc explains. “Good boards also oversee codes of conduct that address undue pressure. A breach of the code is grounds for discipline or firing.”

Of course, in the PM’s case, there is no enforceable code of conduct, no gatekeeping, no enforceable audit committee, no oversights and the chief civil servant, Michael Wernick, who was supposed to be the non-partisan adult in the room, came out as a shill for the Liberal Party and the PM, attempting to provide him partisan cover, rather than oversight. He should have been fired for that stunning breach of his duty of independence and non-partisanship.

I was shocked when I heard the sometimes maudlin testimony of this civil servant, duty-bound to objectivity, replete with references to citizens being shot in the election year, foreign interference in the upcoming election campaign, the “vomitorium” of social media, praise for Carolyn Bennett and other distractions, evasions and obfuscation. And then Trudeau chimed in, advising Canadians to listen to Wernick. It appeared that he was repaying Trudeau for appointing him. Wernick should have been the very first to be fired or resign, as he has.

Why is there so little protection in the political world compared to the systems of governance and transparency that have evolved in the corporate world? Should there not be more protection rather than less?

The fact that the conduct is, at the least, arguably criminal, makes the cause for discharge even more clear.

There is no ability to fire a prime minister, other than in a general election or a vote of the party. It is possible that the caucus could make life untenable and thereby force a leader to step down.

But the personal risks to caucus members are too serious to make that likely. The PM determines cabinet positions and committee appointments for caucus members. He can also decide whether to permit that member to run for the Liberal Party in the upcoming election or even remove that person from the party immediately, despite that member’s expressed interest in running again. So a caucus revolt is not a viable remedy. But no other mechanisms exist.

WATCH BELOW: Trudeau says Liberal caucus is ‘strong and united’

Given his position as finance minister, the same legal repercussions of dismissal for cause would befall Morneau as Trudeau. What about the PMO and Morneau’s staff, who were also pressuring Raybould-Wilson and her chief of staff? Is following orders sufficient to avoid the gravamen of their offence? Generally, it would be, but if the conduct was found to be criminal, it would be cause for their discharge as well.

It is otherwise for Gerald Butts, who resigned while the matter remained academic. Given his senior position, his impropriety would also be cause for his dismissal from the PMO, regardless of whether it was technically criminal.

There should be a royal commission, led by a judge or retired judge, to make findings as to what has occurred in this case. Its mandate should include making governance recommendations, at least as protective as those governing Canadian corporations, to ensure that such a debacle never recurs.

VANCOUVER—Though British Columbia should be fertile ground for the Liberals to grow support ahead of October’s general election, the party’s biggest asset in 2015 is now its biggest liability: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

That’s according to Martyn Brown, a former BC Liberal — a provincial party that has no ties to the federal one and is often aligned with small “c” conservative values — who was chief of staff for the province’s premier during the 2000s.

“B.C. is critical to the Liberals’ fortunes, as their strength in Quebec seems to be waning and in Atlantic Canada they’re grossly under attack. They have to look for where they can gain seats,” Brown said in an interview.

“As long as Trudeau is their leader, the party is bound to suffer big time.”

Brown’s comments follow a new Research Co. poll released on Tuesday that found a majority of British Columbians believe a new party leader would be better. A third of B.C. residents who voted for the Liberals in 2015 also believe a different party leader would do things better in Ottawa than Trudeau.

And that animosity toward Canada’s current prime minister is pervasive across the province, though strongest outside of the Metro Vancouver region, said Mario Canseco, president of Research Co.

Liberals block new inquiry into SNC-Lavalin

SNC-Lavalin controversy shows danger of dabbling in economic nationalism

Meanwhile, half of British Columbians think a different party is needed to lead in Ottawa. Notably, a majority of all age groups polled — from millennials to boomers and beyond — felt that way, as well as a quarter of 2015 Liberal voters.

“That’s the danger the Liberals are facing,” Canseco said. “This is more worrisome in urban areas where you can see people gravitate more to the NDP, which places a lot of seats in jeopardy.”

Prior to 2015, the Liberal party held two seats in British Columbia. But after “Trudeaumania” took the country, the Liberals went from third place in the House of Commons to holding a majority government. Now, they hold 17 seats in B.C.

Canseco questioned whether they could sustain that momentum.

And while there wasn’t much of a gender gap in 2015, men are now more likely to be critical and dissatisfied with the Liberals.

Canseco is closely following the millennial reaction to Trudeau, as the previous election saw a significant spike in the youth vote. For Canseco, the big question ahead of the fall election will be exactly where those votes go.

“It’s no longer the idea of Trudeau as a great unifier, and if they find a shinier object out there, will they support it?” he said. “If you’re disenchanted because of environmental decisions, or maybe electoral reform, or the SNC-Lavalin affair, do you stay home or vote Green or NDP?”

Poll results were based on an online study from March 8 to 10 among 800 adults in B.C., with a margin of error of +/- 3.5 percentage points 19 times out of 20.

Left-leaning progressives offended by the SNC-Lavalin affair may be tempted to vote for the NDP or Greens, Brown said, while centre-right leaning and “swing Liberals” will now be swayed to vote Conservative.

Disenchantment with Trudeau — particularly in B.C. — has risen because he has “failed” on so many files, according to Brown, such as proportional representation, balancing the budget, reconciliation and the purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline.

“(All that has) dramatically reduced his party’s fortunes in Greater Vancouver on progressive, environmentally conscious voters,” he said. “On so many files, he’s proven himself to be the opposite of what he purports to be.”

Braeden Caley, a Liberal party spokesperson, says Trudeau and the Liberals are focused on a strong plan for British Columbians “to build more affordable housing, invest in better roads and transit, grow the economy and protect a healthier environment for our kids and grandkids.”

A decline in support for the Liberals is exaggerated, according to Caley. He says grassroots support for the party continues to grow.

“More than 15,000 British Columbians have singed up as new Liberals in the past two years alone,” he said in an email. “The Liberal party is also continuing to be approached by a variety of talented community leaders interested in becoming Team Trudeau candidates throughout British Columbia, building on the strong growth that we’ve seen in our B.C. team and caucus in recent years.”

Brown has been publicly calling for Trudeau to step down to improve the Liberal party’s chances in October, amid the ongoing SNC-Lavalin affair which he said has “dramatically undercut” Trudeau’s personal brand of having the ethical high-ground.

He predicts an RCMP probe on the matter in the near future and told the Star the Liberal party will only have a chance in October if they find a new leader. Brown said that would be in their best “political self-interest,” especially with the support of Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott.

“If they went into an election with those two women behind them saying we’re cleaning up our act and we mean it,” Brown said, “it would suddenly turn the table and make the new Liberal leader potentially the voice of a new ethical government instead of the opposite.”

Grassy Narrows First Nation held a protest and demonstration in Toronto on Wednesday evening during a Liberal Party fundraiser to press the Trudeau government on its promise to fund a specialized mercury treatment facility in the northwestern Ontario community that's about 100 kilometres northeast of Kenora.

During the event, the protester appeared to be escorted out of the room while Trudeau thanked her for her ""donation.""

""From time to time, I'm in situations where people are expressing concerns or protesting a particular thing, and I always try to be respectful and always try to engage with them in a positive way,"" Trudeau told reporters in Halifax on Thursday morning.

""I didn't do that last night — last night I lacked respect towards them and I apologize.""

Grassy Narrows also is pushing for federal help for remediation of the polluted English-Wabigoon River system and better compensation for people affected by the toxic element.

In a video posted to the Council of Canadians' verified Facebook page Wednesday evening, a woman is shown standing in front of the stage where Trudeau is standing; she appears to unfurl a banner that references the prime minister and compensation for the ""mercury crisis."" She is heard saying ""people in Grassy Narrows are suffering from mercury poisoning, you committed to addressing this crisis,"" while appearing to be removed from the room.

Trudeau, still on the stage, is heard saying, while facing the direction in which the woman was taken out of the room, ""Thank you for being here, thank you very much for your donation tonight, I really appreciate it,"" which draws cheers and applause from the crowd.

The Grassy Narrows protest in Toronto was at the Omni King Edward Hotel, where Trudeau was scheduled to appear at a Laurier Club donor ""appreciation event.""

Former Indigenous services minister Jane Philpott pledged in late 2017 that Ottawa would fund the development and construction of a treatment facility for people exposed to mercury-related illnesses in Grassy Narrows. A number of studies have linked the comparatively poor health of people in the community to the dumping of mercury-contaminated effluent by Reed Paper, former owners of the mill in Dryden, into the river where members of the First Nation have traditionally fished.

The dumping also affected Wabaseemoong, another First Nation, about 100 kilometres northwest of Kenora.

""The situation in Grassy Narrows is one that we have been following for quite awhile,"" Trudeau said Thursday. He said representatives from his office will be in touch with the office of Indigenous Services Minister Seamus O'Regan.

Grassy Narrows submitted a feasibility study for the treatment centre in late 2018, said the community's environmental health co-ordinator, Judy Da Silva. But the community is now waiting for Ottawa to commit to funding a detailed work plan — the next step in the project, she said.

""We're really worried this promise won't be fulfilled,"" Da Silva said, with the 2019 federal election drawing closer. ""The crunch is coming ... and we need something concrete in place ... for the mercury home to be a reality.

""As we speak, our people are having to suffer in the Kenora hospital, or in Thunder Bay or in Winnipeg, and the numbers are growing,"" Da Silva said.

Judy Da Silva was in Toronto to help protest what the community is calling a lack of action by the federal government on the Grassy Narrows mercury treatment centre. (CBC)

""We're hoping that ... [Ottawa] will put something in place that will fulfil that promise for a mercury home and for mercury justice for our people.""

Da Silva said Grassy Narrows has also yet to secure a visit from Trudeau, despite chief and council requesting he come to the community.

William Olscamp, a spokesperson for Indigenous Services Canada, said in an email to CBC News that the department has reviewed the mercury treatment centre's feasibility study ""and is actively engaged with the community, the province and other technical experts to continue to effectively map out the required services against the technical requirements of the building.

""Once the requirements have been finalized, the next steps can get underway.""

The elevated levels of mercury in the river that runs adjacent to Grassy Narrows also closed a once-thriving fishery in the 1970s, decimating the local economy. Community leaders have called on senior levels of government for better compensation, saying the existing Mercury Disability Board, established in the 1980s and under provincial jurisdiction, has only resulted in about six per cent of Grassy Narrows members getting any compensation.

While the province has committed to indexing payouts to inflation, there's been little talk about changing the eligibility criteria.

Grassy Narrows highlighted by Amnesty International

The situation in Grassy Narrows was highlighted by Amnesty International on World Water Day in March as one example in Canada of ""environmental racism.""

""There are communities, particularly communities of colour and Indigenous peoples, who daily have to live with threats to their health and well-being from environmental contamination that would be unthinkable for so many other wealthier communities,"" said Craig Benjamin, Amnesty International Canada's Indigenous rights campaigner.

""Really, there's no clearer example of this than Grassy Narrows.""

Amnesty International has been working with the community for close to 20 years, he said, adding specialized health care should have been on the table years ago.

""This isn't something that should be delayed.""

Olscamp said in his email that Indigenous Services Canada ""continues to work collaboratively with the communities of Grassy Narrows First Nation, Wabaseemoong Independent Nations and provincial partners to address the specific health needs in these communities and reform the Mercury Disability Board.

""The timelines for completion of the treatment facility will depend on the project requirements and the final design agreed upon by the federal and provincial project participants and the Grassy Narrows community,"" he added.

Grassy Narrows is about 100 kilometres northeast of Kenora, Ont. (CBC)

""It is too early at this point to provide a definitive date for the project completion.""

Benjamin acknowledged the commitments made by both the federal and provincial governments as being much-needed positive steps that need to be adhered to.

""We also have the fact that there have been these long struggles for justice that, at this point, we finally see them bearing fruit,"" he said.

Speaking to reporters in Halifax on Thursday, Trudeau commented on media reports this week that said Jody Wilson-Raybould and Trudeau had a ""significant disagreement"" over the 2017 nomination to the top court.

CTV and The Canadian Press reported that Wilson-Raybould, then justice minister and attorney general, wanted Manitoba judge Glenn Joyal to be chief justice of the Supreme Court, while Trudeau thought he was too conservative a pick for a Liberal government that champions the Charter of Rights.

Typically, discussions linked to the sensitive judicial appointment process are treated as highly confidential.

""We condemn the number of leaks that have happened recently of confidential information that has been let out over the past weeks,"" Trudeau said.

""I certainly would wish that people who have access to confidential information would keep it confidential, but I know there are questions asked about the integrity of [the] process. We have the merit-based independent process to choose judges.""

PM would 'never leak'

The prime minister said his office did not have ""any part in leaking."" His office also issued its own denial late yesterday.

""We take the integrity of our institutions seriously,"" said PMO spokesperson Chantal Gagnon in a statement. ""The PMO would never leak who would be considered for a judicial appointment.""

Trudeau said he wants to assure Canadians they can have confidence in the strength of Canada's judiciary and its selection process.

""This is something that degrades people's confidence in the independence of our judicial system, and they need to know that they can still very much have confidence in our system,"" he said.

Wilson-Raybould also denied releasing the information and said Wednesday the leaks should be investigated.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh called the leaks ""deeply concerning"" and noted that some are suggesting the source is within the Liberal government itself.

""The fact that these leaks are coming out speaks to a broader narrative that's attempting to smear the former attorney general,"" he said today in Ottawa. ""And that is just completely inappropriate.""

Justice Minister David Lametti tweeted his own concerns about the confidentiality breach Wednesday, prompting Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer to point the finger at the prime minister.

Why are you tweeting something like this instead of calling your boss, Justin Trudeau, and asking him why he leaked it? 1/3 <a href=""https://t.co/Xl2kmIp7W7"">https://t.co/Xl2kmIp7W7</a> —@AndrewScheer

""Why are you tweeting something like this instead of calling your boss, Justin Trudeau, and asking him why he leaked it?"" Scheer tweeted.

""How about you do more than just express your concern and do something about it? Have you launched an investigation into who leaked it?""

Allegations of political pressure

Media reports about the 2017 rift between Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould over the appointment landed in the midst of an intensifying political controversy over the SNC-Lavalin file. Wilson-Raybould has alleged she endured sustained, intense political pressure and veiled threats meant to convince her to override the independent decision of the director of the Public Prosecution Service to deny the company a deferred prosecution agreement.

She has said she believes she was demoted to Veterans Affairs because she resisted that political pressure. Trudeau has denied her allegations, insisting that the issue amounts to a difference of perspectives.

Wilson-Raybould submitted a new written statement and copies of emails and text messages to the Commons justice committee this week, after the Liberal-dominated committee voted to close down hearings on the SNC-Lavalin matter without recalling Wilson-Raybould back to testify a second time.

Those documents are now being translated with personal information redacted, and are expected to be released Friday afternoon.","Trudeau condemns leaks to media on judicial appointments, denies PMO was source",CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-leaks-snc-lavalin-1.5074979

Mia Rabson, THE CANADIAN PRESS





HALIFAX -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who typically takes a more deferential, let's-talk approach when protesters get in his face, found himself delivering a rare and rapid apology Thursday for his sarcastic retort to an Indigenous heckler who interrupted his remarks during a high-end fundraising event.

Trudeau said he's sorry for how he responded to the previous night's protester, who unfurled a banner at the foot of the stage during a $1,500-a-ticket fundraiser in Toronto in an effort to draw attention to the impact of mercury poisoning in the northern Ontario community of Grassy Narrows First Nation.

""Thank you for your donation,"" Trudeau told the woman as she was escorted out by security. ""I really appreciate your donation to the Liberal Party of Canada.""

Others in the audience cheered the prime minister's dismissive remark, which was captured by cellphone cameras and quickly circulated on social media Wednesday night.

Less than 24 hours later, Trudeau sounded considerably more contrite.

""As I think you all know, from time to time I'm in situations where people are expressing concerns or protesting a particular thing, and I always try to be respectful and always try to engage with them in a positive way,"" he said following an announcement in Halifax.

""That's how I believe democracy should function, and I didn't do that last night. Last night I lacked respect towards them and I apologize for that.""

Any funds that the protesters contributed in order to gain access to the event will be refunded, he added.

""They wanted to express their concerns about an issue and I do take that seriously and I apologize to them.""

Afterward, Trudeau bypassed his motorcade and walked directly into the midst of a fresh group of protesters gathered outside the venue in Halifax, acknowledging their complaints and thanking them for sharing their concerns.

Indigenous people in Grassy Narrows, about 90 kilometres north of Kenora, Ont., have been contending for decades with chemical-waste mercury dumped into the English-Wabigoon river system throughout the 1960s and 1970s, poisoning fish and locals who rely on the river as a source of water and food.

The community hopes to build a world-class mercury treatment facility to help deal with the fallout from the poisoning, which causes often irreparable damage, including impaired vision, muscle weakness, speech, hearing and cognitive problems and numbness or stinging pain in the extremities and mouth.

Grassy Narrows staff met with former Indigenous Services Minister Jane Philpott in December to discuss progress on the facility, shortly after giving the government a feasibility study for the project. At that time Philpott said the government was actively working to get it built.

Trudeau should go to Grassy Narrows to apologize to the people there directly and in person, suggested Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde.

""This incident highlights the need for action now,"" said Bellegarde. ""There have been numerous commitments from different governments for action yet the people of Grassy Narrows First Nation and Wabaseemoong are still waiting while they face serious dangers to their health. It's time for action.""

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh called Trudeau's comments to the protester offensive and ""callous.""

Trudeau said he plans to follow up with Seamus O'Regan, who replaced Philpott on the Indigenous Services file in January, to ""make sure we are looking at exactly everything we can do to continue to work hard in resolving this situation.""

""It is something that is of real concern and a real piece of the path of reconciliation that we must walk on.""

As yet another poll shows Trudeau and his Liberals sliding, the PM continues to step in it, like he did on Wednesday night at a Liberal fundraiser.

A woman approached the stage as the PM was addressing the Liberal faithful at a reception for Laurier Club members, meaning people who had donated at least $1,500 to the Liberal Party.

“Prime Minister Trudeau, people of Grassy Narrows are suffering from mercury poisoning, you committed to addressing this issue, when will you keep that promise,” the woman said before security guards began to drag her away.

Trudeau’s response was nothing short of tone deaf.

“Thank you very much for your donation tonight. I really appreciate the donation to the Liberal Party of Canada,” he said.

So much for Sunny Ways.

Trudeau was elected on a promise of reconciliation with First Nations groups — he promised to fix this specific water problem that began back in the late ’60s and early ’70s, a time when his father was PM.

And yet when a woman asks him about it, he responds with thank-you for your donation.

The man that once seemingly could do no wrong with many voters, especially key demographics like women, like First Nations voters, with young people, now can’t seem to get it right.

He apologized on Thursday morning but it may be too late.

The latest poll from Angus Reid shows just how badly Trudeau is doing after weeks of mishandling the SNC-Lavalin file and weeks of blowing up his feminist image with attacks on two powerful women who quit his cabinet over matters of principle.

Nationally, the Conservatives lead the Liberals 37% to 28% in this latest survey.

While that number for Andrew Scheer and the Tories is the same as last month, Trudeau and the Grits are sliding. They have dropped three points.

The poll also shows people who voted Liberal in 2015 are looking elsewhere. Just 58% of those who said they had voted Liberal in the last election will do the same in October, while 13% say they will switch to the Conservatives, 11% to the NDP and 6% to the Greens.

Much of the support that Trudeau is dropping comes from women over the age of 35. While the Liberals hold a slight lead over the Conservatives with women, 31% to 29% support, that is down from 35% support among women for the Liberals last month.

The Conservatives already have a double-digit lead among men, with 46% saying they would vote for Scheer’s Tories compared to 25% for Trudeau’s Liberals.

The Liberals now trail the Conservatives in every region of the country except Quebec, where the two parties are in a statistical tie.

While SNC-Lavalin continues to dominate federal political news, there is a new battlefront about to open up.

On Monday, the carbon tax will kick in for Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and New Brunswick.

The Conservatives are already running radio ads reminding people that it will cost more money to fill the gas tank, heat their homes and buy groceries as a result of Trudeau’s carbon tax.

With motorists expected to see as much as a 10-cent-a-litre jump at the pumps, Trudeau can expect to see his voter support drop more as the Conservatives remind Canadians who it was that just made their lives more expensive.

Poor Justin must be wishing he was back in the sunny days and sunny ways of 2015.

Since the story first broke in early February about tensions between Trudeau’s office and Wilson-Raybound on the SNC-Lavalin file, there have been other leaks about cabinet discussions and Wilson-Raybould’s role as justice minister. And this week, CTV and Canadian Press reported confidential details of Wilson-Raybould’s pick for the Supreme Court, a choice of judge that was ultimately rebuffed by Trudeau. The details in those stories were condemned by legal associations, who said such disclosures could undermine the integrity of the judicial selection process. Wilson-Raybould herself denied she was the source and called for an investigation.

“We condemn the number of leaks that have happened recently of confidential information that has been let out over the past weeks. I certainly would wish that people who have access to confidential information would keep it confidential,” Trudeau said during a visit to Halifax. But as he did earlier in the week, the prime minister again refused to comment whether he would seek an investigation into the leak around the judicial selection, saying that the people should have faith in the “merit-based independent process” to select judges for the Supreme Court.

“We condemn it, as has been said. This was not something that my office had any part in leaking. This is something that degrades people’s confidence in the independence of the judicial system. They need to know that they can still very much have confidence in our system,” he said. Bruce Campion-Smith is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics. Follow him on Twitter: @yowflier

STEPHEN, N.B. — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau slammed New Brunswick Thursday for its opposition to the federal carbon levy, saying Conservative governments across the country ""don't think that fighting climate change is a priority.""

Trudeau made the comments in New Brunswick, one of four provinces where the federal carbon pricing backstop takes effect next week.

During a stop at the Garcelon Civic Centre in St. Stephen, Trudeau told reporters there needs to be a price on pollution.

""I regret that the government of New Brunswick doesn't think that putting a price on pollution is important,"" the prime minister said.

""It's the 21st century. We know climate change is real. We know that one of the challenges we have is that pollution has been free. We need to put a price on it.""

Ottawa has promised to return all the funds collected in rebates to individuals, businesses, local governments and other organizations.

""We are doing that in a way that right now at tax time, New Brunswickers are going to be able to get money directly back, which will more than cover, for the vast majority of families, any extra expenses attached to the new price on pollution,"" said Trudeau.

""It's a shame that the Conservative governments, not just here, but across the county, don't think that fighting climate change is a priority. But I know New Brunswickers and indeed Canadians know that we have to do it if we're going to keep our economy strong into the future.""

The federal carbon pricing backstop kicks in Monday in the four provinces that didn't have their own carbon pricing system — Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick.

In a news release earlier this month, New Brunswick's Energy and Resource Development Minister Mike Holland was critical of the carbon levy.

""Any new tax, especially a carbon tax that will make everything you buy more expensive, is not the best approach to change behaviours and will only add unnecessary costs that hurt the economy and negatively affect New Brunswick families,"" he said.

""This federal carbon tax will unfairly burden New Brunswick’s rural households, those families who heat homes with oil or gas, and those who do not have the option to drive less.""

Earlier Thursday, Trudeau met with seniors in Halifax as he made a quick swing through the region to talk about pharmacare and the federal budget.

Trudeau also spoke with protesters concerned with a plan to store natural gas in huge underground caverns north of the city.

For the past 12 years, Alton Gas has been planning to pump water from the Shubenacadie River to an underground site 12 kilometres away, where it will be used to flush out salt deposits, and create up to 15 caverns. The leftover brine solution would then be pumped back into the river over a two- to three-year period.

Darlene Gilbert, an Indigenous woman who has been protesting the Alton Gas project for several years, told the prime minister she wanted Ottawa to take a stronger stance - and reject the project's plan under the Fisheries Act.

She told him adding salty water to the Shubenacadie is a clear case of depositing ""deleterious substances"" into waterways frequented by fish, which is prohibited under the Fisheries Act unless a federal exemption is applied.

""You're not protecting our waterways. ... You're telling us to brine and poison our waters so you guys can make energy,"" Gilbert said to Trudeau.

Trudeau waited for the protesters to complete their points and then asked for an opportunity to respond.

""We're going to work with local communities. We're going to work with the chiefs, we're going to work with the provincial government. ...We're going to work with the grandmothers. We're going to work with the community to move forward on regulations in a way that addresses your concerns,"" he said.

""I very deeply respect your position on this as a grandmother. I do. My responsibility is to work with everyone and listen to everyone and make the right decision for the community,"" he said.

The federal government said last month that it will step in to regulate the company's plan in a way that would manage potential threats to fish, fish habitat and human health.

But Trudeau would not say Thursday if he would support an investigation into how the media obtained confidential information about the appointment process — a probe Jody Wilson-Raybould says should happen.

""This was not something that my office had any part in leaking,"" Trudeau told reporters in Halifax. ""This is something that degrades people's confidence in our judicial system and they need to know that they can still very much have confidence in our system.""

The prime minister also said he condemns ""the number of leaks"" of confidential information in recent weeks.

""I certainly would wish that people who have access to confidential information would keep it confidential.""

When asked, days ago, by reporters if his office was behind the leaked details of a Manitoba judge's candidacy for the top court in 2017, Trudeau declined to answer.

CTV News and The Canadian Press reported this week that Wilson-Raybould wanted Glenn Joyal, the chief justice of Manitoba's Court of Queen's Bench, to not only be named to the Supreme Court but also appointed chief justice.

Trudeau, the outlets reported, balked at appointing Joyal because of his past criticism about the court's activism on Charter of Rights and Freedoms issues. According to CTV, Trudeau was concerned Joyal would not protect abortion access and LGBTQ2 rights.

Trudeau later appointed Alberta judge Sheilah Martin to the Supreme Court and promoted sitting justice, Richard Wagner, to chief justice.

Still, the matter became a source of serious friction between Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould, according to ""well-placed"" sources in the reports. Wilson-Raybould, this week, denied there was conflict, but warned reporting on such conversations ""could compromise the integrity of the appointments process and potentially sitting justices.""

The Canadian Press Richard Wagner smiles during a ceremony marking his appointment as chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada in Ottawa on Feb. 5, 2018.

In another leak, a source told The Globe and Mail that Wilson-Raybould's advocacy on Joyal's behalf was part of a larger plan to see an Indigenous judge replace him on the Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench, which would have been a historic milestone.

Joyal, in a statement, said he took himself out of the running for the coveted top court seat because of his wife's breast cancer. The Canadian Press reported Joyal withdrew his candidacy after Trudeau told Wilson-Raybould he did not support her pick.

Joyal said he feared someone is using his earlier candidacy to ""further an agenda unrelated to the appointment process.""

The release of private details about the appointment process sparked outrage in the legal community, with the Canadian Bar Association saying such breaches demean ""the selection process and ultimately all those who hold the office of judge.""

Yet, in the thick of the SNC-Lavalin affair that has damaged Trudeau's government, the reports offered another potential reason as to why the prime minister might have wanted someone other than Wilson-Raybould to serve as attorney general and justice minister.

Wilson-Raybould told a House of Commons justice committee last month that she believes she was removed from the role in January because she would not help SNC-Lavalin secure a remediation agreement to avoid a criminal trial on corruption charges.

On Wednesday, deputy Conservative Leader Lisa Raitt wrote to Marc Giroux, the federal judicial affairs commissioner, to urge him to investigate the leaks.

Raitt said, in her letter, that it appears ""sources close to the prime minister"" shared private information to smear Wilson-Raybould's reputation. The controversy ""casts a cloud"" over the appointments of Martin and Wagner, and harms the ""perceived objectivity"" of Joyal's past and future judgments, she said.

""A plain reading of the facts strongly suggests that political actors have leaked the content of discussions regarding an appointment to Canada's highest judicial body,"" Raitt said. ""If indeed this is true, it is an egregious case of political interference and one that severely injures the independence of the judiciary.""

Giroux said he does not have investigatory powers to probe the matter, but noted he is also ""concerned and troubled"" by the stories.

Wilson-Raybould says she is not 'the source of any of these stories'

Wilson-Raybould told The Canadian Press the leaks need to stop and urged ""some sort of investigation"" into the matter.

""I do feel compelled to say that I have not — as some have suggested — been the source of any of these stories, nor have I ever authorized any person to speak on my behalf,"" Wilson-Raybould said. ""I strongly condemn anyone who would speak about or provide information on such sensitive matters.''

Her predecessor as attorney general and justice minister, David Lametti, tweeted Wednesday that he is also ""concerned by the publication of details of the most recent Supreme Court justice selection.""

I am concerned by the publication of details of the most recent #SupremeCourt justice selection. The integrity of our process depends on confidentiality for all parties involved. Canadians should have complete confidence in the administration of justice. — David Lametti (@DavidLametti) March 27, 2019

Tory Leader Andrew Scheer fired back by asking Lametti why he is tweeting ""instead of calling your boss, Justin Trudeau, and asking him why he leaked it.""

This is not the first time details surrounding a top court appointment have been shared with media. In 2014, The Globe and Mail obtained a short list of candidates for a top court vacancy that shed light on a public spat between then-prime minister Stephen Harper and the then-chief justice of the Supreme Court Beverley McLachlin.

Lee Berthiaume, The Canadian Press





OTTAWA -- Vice-Admiral Mark Norman's lawyer says she wants to see a secret 60-page memo the federal government's top bureaucrat penned to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about her client's case.

Lawyer Marie Henein revealed the existence of Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick's memo to Trudeau on Thursday as Norman's breach-of-trust case returned for another day of pre-trial hearings.

The revelation is the latest twist in Henein's months-long fight for thousands of government documents she says are essential to prove his innocence.

Subpoenas were issued last month for emails, BlackBerry messages and other internal communications from Trudeau, Wernick and other top officials about Norman as Henein seeks records to prove political interference in the case.

Henein told the court that she recently received a copy of Wernick's memo to the prime minister dated Oct. 24, 2018 as part of a larger trove of documents but she said the contents were completely blacked out.

""We received in the material that's come to us -- in completely redacted form for solicitor-client privilege -- a memo from Michael Wernick to the prime minister,"" Henein told Justice Heather Perkins-McVey.

""Mr. Wernick is not a lawyer, I don't believe,"" Perkins-McVey replied, though she quickly added: ""I'm not sure.""

It was at that point that Henein said she planned to present arguments on why the contents of that memo and others obtained from the government should be released.

Among the other memos were two sent to Wernick by the Privy Council Office's top lawyer, Paul Shuttle.

""These are the key documents that I can tell you were immediately concerning to me,"" Henein said.

Perkins-McVey agreed to set a date in mid-April for Henein and lawyers for the government to argue over whether the contents of the memos should be disclosed.

Norman, who previously served as the military's second-in-command, was charged last year with breach of trust for allegedly leaking government secrets to pressure the newly minted Trudeau government to approve a $700-million shipbuilding contract.

That contract, negotiated by the Harper Conservatives and finalized by Trudeau's Liberals in November 2015, involved leasing a converted civilian ship from Davie Shipbuilding in Quebec as a temporary naval supply vessel.

Norman has denied any wrongdoing and his politically charged trial is currently scheduled to start in August and run through much of the fall federal election.

The court also heard from lawyers for Davie and its bitter rival Irving Shipbuilding of Halifax, which offered, unsuccessfully, to provide its own interim supply ship to the navy until permanent replacements could be built.

Their appearance coincided with Perkins-McVey contemplating whether to release to Norman's lawyers documents deemed by government lawyers as commercially sensitive to the two companies.

Davie's lawyer, Sean May, told the court Thursday the company agreed to disclose the technical details about its ship, the MV Asterix, which is currently operating with the navy in the Pacific. However May said the company objected to the release of any financial information.

""Any information which would deal with specific ... commercially sensitive costs and related issues in that vein,"" May said. ""The numbers, essentially.""

Perkins-McVey agreed to that request following approval from Norman's lawyers as well as Irving's request that information dealing with its own bottom line be similarly withheld.","Top bureaucrat wrote 60-page memo to Trudeau about Norman case, lawyer says",CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/top-bureaucrat-wrote-60-page-memo-to-trudeau-about-norman-case-lawyer-says-1.4356015

“Thank you very much for your donation tonight, I really appreciate the donation to the Liberal Party of Canada,” Trudeau said in a video posted to Twitter.

Trudeau’s comments were in response to protesters from the Grassy Narrows First Nation, who for years have suffered health risks due to high concentrations of mercury in the English-Wabigoon river system.

The video showed Trudeau making a speech during a Laurier Club event at the Omni King Edward Hotel. Laurier events are party fundraisers and the protesters would have had to donate a minimum $1,500 to attend.

Opposition members of parliament and political commentators quickly criticized the comments on Twitter Thursday, with Conservative MP Michelle Rempell calling Trudeau “smug” and “arrogant.”

Trudeau has long framed his government as being conscious of First Nations issues and has said Canada needs to reconcile with its past and current wrongdoings toward Aboriginal people.

The prime minister quickly shifted his tone just after making the comments, saying immediately afterward that the Liberal Party “is filled with different perspectives and different opinions and we respect them all, and our commitment to reconciliation continues to be strong and committed…”

Members of the Grassy Narrows First Nation have been speaking out amid an ongoing health crisis in the community. A report in December found that mercury poisoning of the local river system was causing a number of health issues for youth in the community, particularly pregnant women, including anemia and attention deficit disorder.

Grassy Narrows is located about 100 kilometres north of Kenora, Ont. A mill upstream of the community had dumped effluent into the river in the 70s and 80s, leaving higher-than-normal concentrations of mercury in the local water supply.

The Ontario government has committed $85 million to clean up the river system, and Ottawa has said it will fund a wastewater treatment centre to lower levels of mercury and other contaminants.

Trudeau apologized for his comments Thursday morning, telling reporters in Halifax he regretted his response to the Grassy Narrows protestors.

“Last night I lacked respect towards them and I apologize for that,” he said.

Polls suggest the United Conservative Party is on course to win power in the province, Canada’s energy center, capitalizing on voter concerns about a struggling economy and lack of progress on new oil export pipelines.

However, UCP leader Jason Kenney, a former federal cabinet minister, polls behind New Democrat Party Premier Rachel Notley on a number of personal attributes such as honesty, likeability and trustworthiness, and is embroiled in a scandal over his successful party leadership bid in 2017.

Notley, whose late father led the NDP from 1968-1984, is polling well ahead of her party and seeking to profit from that edge.

To overcome that, the UCP is focusing on Trudeau, with repeated references to “the Notley-Trudeau alliance,” emphasizing her one-time close relationship with the prime minister, while images of their own leader are less visible.

Trudeau is an unpopular figure in Alberta, where many feel he failed to support the energy industry. The prime minister also faces a political scandal on whether he unduly pressured Canada’s former justice minister.

“If you look at the signs the NDP are putting up, their logos are not very prevalent, it’s all Rachel Notley,” said Gregory Jack, vice president at polling firm Ipsos. “The UCP signs are all about the UCP and their brand, and underplaying their leader to a certain extent.”

The UCP’s focus on Justin Trudeau may be effective with older Alberta voters who remember the unpopular National Energy Program in 1980, an effort by his prime minister father, Pierre Trudeau, that sought to give Ottawa more control over the oil and gas industry and a higher share of revenues.

“(The UCP) spin on it is Alberta has been mistreated by a Liberal government and the son of another prime minister who did not treat Alberta well,” said Jared Wesley, a political science professor at the University of Alberta.

Alberta’s energy industry contributes C$80 billion a year to Canada’s economy, but opposition from other provinces has shut down new pipelines like TransCanada Corp’s Energy East project and helped stall the Trans Mountain expansion plan.

Congestion on existing pipelines out of landlocked Alberta left crude bottlenecked in storage tanks and sent prices spiraling to record lows last year, prompting the NDP to mandate temporary crude production cuts.

Alberta has posted budget deficits since global oil prices started tumbling in 2014, and more than C$20 billion in foreign capital has fled its energy sector since 2017.

Notley and Trudeau came to power in the same year and initially forged a close partnership aimed at pleasing the oil industry and environmental groups with a dual strategy that supported new pipelines and introduced a carbon tax.

They fell out last year over delays to the Trans Mountain expansion project. Notley’s camp downplays the relationship that the UCP is working so hard to highlight.

“The job of premier is to work with anyone who has a stake in projects like pipelines. I wouldn’t call it an alliance,” said NDP campaign spokeswoman Cheryl Oates. “A lot of people feel Jason Kenney is stuck in Ottawa trying to rehash a battle that his party lost.”

Economists, think-tanks and credit rating agencies all warn that the prime minister’s big spending could spell trouble for the economy. And in a swipe at Trudeau, Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer says balancing the budget would be a top priority under a Conservative government.

But the big question is, do people really care about deficits? Do voters reward deficit hawks and punish free-spenders? Polling on the issue is a mixed bag, and the better gauge may be how people actually vote when faced the choice, such as in the recent Quebec election.

The topic, which could be a ballot box issue in the fall, took centre-stage after the Liberal government unveiled a budget that projects more deficits in a year the books were supposed to be balanced. Criticism flowed, along with warnings of potential economic disruption. The trouble is, despite such warnings in recent times, governments of all shades continued to ring in deficits — and win elections. Which leaves open the question of whether people are as concerned about deficits as some might think.

True, there was a time, particularly in the 1990s, when slaying the deficit was a national obsession. With the Ontario and federal governments facing record deficits and on the brink of economic meltdown, most people accepted deep and often painful spending cuts to rein in bulging deficits and soaring debt.

Jean Chretien’s Liberal government led the way, balancing the budget in 1997-98 and leaving a string of surpluses. Conservative Mike Harris also balanced the Ontario budget in 1999 and was rewarded with re-election. That was the golden decade of deficit-busting.

By the 2000s, however, the war on deficits appeared to lose steam.

Harris’s successor, Ernie Eves, recorded a deficit, and Liberal Dalton McGuinty who followed in 2003, ran more deficits than surpluses. Federally, Stephen Harper’s decade-long record was mixed.

Harper balanced the budget on occasion, but recorded several deficits. For both Harper and McGuinty, the 2008 global financial crisis may have been a factor, but importantly by that time, people appeared to have soured on austerity.

The governments of the day understood the changing mood, and the spending trend continued.

Ontario voters soundly rejected Conservative leader Tim Hudak’s plan for big spending cuts to balance the budget in the 2014 election. Liberal Kathleen Wynne, whose platform included significant spending, won.

Perhaps the most telling example of the shift in public mood was last October’s Quebec election. Premier Philippe Couillard inherited a deficit and chose to focus on its elimination in short order, slashing services, including education and health care.

He succeeded but Quebeckers were not amused. Instead of kudos for the man who slew the dragon, they sent him packing. Ironically, the new Coalition Avenir Québec government is splashing out on services with surpluses left behind by Couillard.

Next in line is Ontario Premier Doug Ford, a deficit hawk, whose budget comes down April 11.

Interestingly, the shift in the public mood is happening not just in Canada. Even in the United States, where cutting spending and deficits was religion to Republicans, President Donald Trump has been racking up deficits. The U.S. deficit is set to top $1 trillion this year, and Republicans just shrug their shoulders.

Reneging on his promise to balance the budget this year, and instead splashing billions on services, Trudeau is gambling that program spending will trump deficit reduction in the eyes of Canadians.

Scheer has taken the opposite view and when voters speak in a few months, we’ll know who got it right. Of course, the public mood can change quickly to Trudeau’s disadvantage if the economy tanks. Deficits don’t really matter to New Democrats, who want even more spending. But as the Conservatives digest the Liberal budget and plot election strategy, they may do well to reconsider deficit-slaying as the centrepiece of their campaign. The sand has shifted on the issue and on recent evidence, an arm-to-arm combat on the deficit with Liberals could be risky.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was confronted by protesters who hoped to draw his attention to mercury contamination in the First Nation communities of Grassy Narrows and Wabaseemoong during a Liberal fundraiser in Toronto on Wednesday night.

The prime minister’s response?

“Thank you for your donation.”

That was according to a video posted to Twitter that showed Trudeau delivering a speech during the Laurier Club event at the luxury Omni King Edward Hotel.

“Mr. Trudeau, people at Grassy Narrows are suffering from mercury poisoning. You committed to addressing this crisis,” a protester could be heard saying as she held up a banner calling on the prime minister to compensate people within the community.

The protester was subsequently ushered away. That’s when Trudeau addressed her directly.

“Thank you for being here, thank you for your donation tonight. I really appreciate it,” he said, to laughs, applause and cheers from the audience.

The prime minister then continued: “As you know, the Liberal Party is filled with different perspectives and different opinions, and we respect them all.”

Another protester, still in the audience, then said off-camera: “If it was your family that’s been waiting for 500 days, if your family was suffering from mercury poisoning, what would you do? If it was your family, would you accept it? Would you accept 500 days for one per cent?”

A Facebook event promoting the protest alleged that Trudeau is “failing to help Grassy Narrows, a key test of his ‘commitment’ to meaningful relationships with First Nations and to a healthy environment.”

The event post said that in November 2017, then-minister of Indigenous services Jane Philpott had “promised to build and operate a Mercury Survivors Home and Care Center in Grassy Narrows.”

However, 500 days have passed since that commitment, and “only one per cent of the cost to build the facility has flowed and the project has stalled.”

WATCH (Nov. 28, 2017): ‘Canada has to wake up’ to Grassy Narrows mercury contamination crisis

The event post went on to say that all but six per cent of Grassy Narrows people have received “no compensation for the intense impacts of the ongoing mercury crisis on their health, culture and livelihood.

“Instead of getting the support they need, they face chronic denial as they live with deep poverty and severe food insecurity.”

Philpott, who has since left the Liberal cabinet, indeed pledged federal funding to the Grassy Narrows First Nation to fund a treatment centre to help people suffering the effects of mercury contamination.

Mercury contamination has been an issue in the area for half a century, after a paper mill located in Dryden, Ont., dumped thousands of kilograms of mercury into the English-Wabigoon river system in the 1960s.

“This is what they need and should have, and we are very happy to support them in it,” Philpott said at the time.

A health survey published by the Grassy Narrows First Nation last year showed that the health of people there was “significantly worse” than other First Nations in Canada.

The community had fewer elders, and this survey suggested that people there were dying prematurely.

The Supreme Court of Canada has said it will hear a case over whether Ontario’s provincial government can force Weyerhaeuser Co. and Resolute Forest Products to clean the former mill site in Dryden.

The provincial government had ordered them to clean the site in 2011, but they claimed they had received indemnity.

Moe said he used a Tuesday phone call to push for escalating engagement with Chinese officials and federal help to protect farmers from a looming cash-flow crunch.

He said the talk convinced him the issue is a priority for Trudeau.

“I have every reason to believe that he is taking this seriously,” said the premier.

Moe said he raised three specific issues with Trudeau: research partnerships to prove Canadian canola is safe, high-level talks to push for a political solution and capital assistance to support farmers anxious about what the crisis means for them.

“We had a good conversation on continuing with the scientific engagement, supportive of moving that into the diplomatic and even political engagement, not just with China but also with the U.S., and last but not least, putting forward suggestions to ensure that our producers have access to capital come this spring,” he said.

“I was thankful that the prime minister took time.”

Moe offered the assistance of Saskatchewan’s research community, notably at the University of Saskatchewan, in ongoing efforts to convince China that Canadian canola is free from harmful pathogens. Chinese officials have cited pests as a pretext for halting canola shipments from Richardson International Ltd. Just this week, news broke that China is also blocking imports from Regina-based Viterra Inc.

Canada has brushed aside allegations that its canola is contaminated, and engaged in technical discussions with Chinese officials to prove it. Moe said he’s hopeful that will lead to a science-based solution. He stressed that Saskatchewan has the highest-quality canola in the world.

“We’re very proud of the product we produce,” he said. “And we are not in any way nervous about putting it through the most rigorous of cleanliness tests.”

But Moe said that might take time. So he added his voice to those who see a need to take the fight higher up the political ladder. Though he didn’t directly say the canola blockade is related to the ongoing dispute between Canada and China over the detention of a senior Chinese telecom executive, he said he called on Trudeau to seek a diplomatic or political solution.

“I always want it as fast as possible,” said Moe, who stressed that a resolution to the blockade is “imperative” to Saskatchewan.

The Chinese market absorbs roughly 40 per cent of Canada’s canola exports, about half of which come from Saskatchewan.

Moe said he was pleased to hear Trudeau announce during a visit to Winnipeg on Tuesday that the federal government is “certainly looking at” sending a high-level delegation to China to talk about Canada’s inspection and quality-control regimen. Moe said Saskatchewan would be happy to participate in any way, but he suggested there may soon be a need to take the campaign to where decisions are really made in China.

“Ultimately, the next steps would hopefully be at a political level,” said Moe.

Asked if Trudeau should call President Xi Jinping or Premier Li Keqiang of China to press for open access, Moe said “it’s a progression.”

“The engagement needs to happen right away and then it needs to escalate as quickly as possible until we can ultimately rectify the market access challenges that we’re experiencing right now,” said Moe.

There is widespread suspicion that China’s action is related to the arrest in Vancouver of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, who is facing a U.S. extradition request on charges she helped others circumvent American sanctions against Iran. Moe steered clear of calling on the federal government to address the Meng conflict as part of efforts to resolve the canola impasse.

But he said Canada can be “an advocate” for rebuilding a strong relationship between the U.S. and China.

“Ms. Meng, she is where she is because of an agreement we have with the U.S.,” Moe said. “A positive political relationship and trade relations… between the three nations can only enhance the conversation around other irritants that are on the periphery of that relationship, like the potential deportation of Ms. Meng.”

Moe’s last request for Trudeau focused on the capital needs farmers will face as they prepare for spring seeding. He said many still have canola in the bin, but plummeting prices have reduced the value of those stockpiles and could cut off the cash flow farmers need for the inputs this season.

Accessing credit could help tide them over in the meantime, but some of the most likely sources — including Richardson and Viterra themselves — are also likely to face troubles related to the standoff with China.

“If we can provide that access to capital… they can put the crop in,” said Moe.

He said the idea isn’t yet fully fleshed out, but he’s requesting federal assistance to move it forward. Moe said he’s not asking for a cash subsidy, since that wouldn’t be compliant with existing trade agreements.

Moe said the prime minister gave him an answer:

“We will absolutely look at this,” he quoted Trudeau as saying.

On the capital request for farmers, a spokeswoman from the Prime Minister’s Office said Ottawa is “looking at all options.”

“We understand how important canola is to Saskatchewan farmers, who produce half of Canada’s production,” Eleanore Catenaro told the Leader-Post, adding that three federal ministers have been all over the file.

She said the prime minister was “happy to speak with (Moe) on this issue given how seriously the federal government is taking it.”

Let Jody Wilson-Raybould have her (additional) say. Stop muzzling her with cabinet confidence and solicitor-client privilege. Waive it.

Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners Suddenly, New Attention for List of Harper-Era Abuses Traffic surges for Tyee’s 2015 compilation of 70 Tory law and ethics breaches.

“The longer he continues this cover-up,” Bergen said of Trudeau, “the longer he moves heaven and earth to keep himself protected, the worse this gets for him.”

Does it get worse? Or will Canadians tire of the saga and move on, as the Liberals this week bet by moving to shut down the inquiry?

Martyn Brown, who as premier Gordon Campbell’s chief of staff handled scandals buffeting the B.C. government during the 2000s, thinks that this week Trudeau has moved closer to the brink of disaster. The heightened prospect of an RCMP investigation makes Trudeau an anchor sinking the party he once rescued with his leadership.

Now, says Brown, it’s time for Liberal insiders to convince Trudeau to step down.

More bad days for the PM

In one twist this week, Wilson-Raybould promised to dump a pile of more documents on the Justice Committee in order to prove her allegations of undue political interference are correct, even if she isn’t allowed to testify in person.

In another turn, Celina Caesar-Chavannes, who said she’d been bullied by a shouting Trudeau, left the Liberal caucus to sit as an independent MP.

Meanwhile, SNC-Lavalin’s CEO said Trudeau’s team is wrong to imply that his company asked to be spared a criminal trial or else it would move from Montreal with 9,000 Canadian jobs sacrificed.

But the biggest bombshell, in Brown’s view, was dropped by former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott, Trudeau’s other cabinet minister to resign in dismay over LavScam.

What Philpott had to say in her interview with Maclean’s magazine on March 21 proves she’d “gone rogue,” says Brown.

“I’m not accusing anybody of anything illegal or contrary to the Criminal Code,” emphasizes Brown. But Philpott raised enough questions to possibly prod the RCMP to launch an investigation, and that would mean a severe hit to Trudeau’s political fortunes.

On the phone with The Tyee March 21, Brown laid out his reasoning:

Philpott is “now basically saying in this interview with Maclean’s that Jody Wilson-Raybould was bullied, that there is much more to the story. And so she’s flatly contradicting [Trudeau’s] version of events.”

Philpott has given “new legs” to the demand by five previous attorneys general and the Tories for an RCMP investigation. In Maclean’s she makes it clear she could not remain in “solidarity with cabinet,” because she “felt that there was evidence of an attempt to politically interfere with the justice system in its work on the criminal trial that has been described by some as the most important and serious prosecution of corporate corruption in modern Canadian history.”

She also reveals that she raised deep concerns about the DPA file on SNC-Lavalin a full month before the affair became public.

She says this, Brown notes, as we find out the PMO’s claims about harm to the public interest if SNC-Lavalin were to be criminally prosecuted are baloney.

“What we need to know is, in this period, particularly after Jan. 14 when the shuffle took place, was cabinet misled by false threats or false information of the sort we’ve now learned about? That SNC was leaving Montreal, which [we know] now is patently untrue. Or that Canada was going to lose 9,000 jobs, which the present CEO now says was patently untrue. Was cabinet misled by that? Because if so, that would be a reason for the RCMP to investigate.”

The Mounties would be particularly interested in finding out, says Brown, “if false information was used to try to pressure Jody Wilson-Raybould to get her to politically intervene for something that anyone in government knew wasn’t true. Or if the government knew that it wasn’t true that jobs would be lost, that the company would move, as it was trying to suggest to her was the reason in the public interest, then the public interest argument goes out the window.

“That’s the only legal argument the government currently has. Even though by law they’re precluded in the Criminal Code from considering the national economic interest, they’re trying to couch it in this phrase, ‘the public interest,’ to say that because it was in the public interest, that’s why they could talk to her.

“But if the public interest argument is based on a lie, and they knew that, then all that you’re left with is a political motive, an electoral motive that would be self-serving. And that to me would raise questions of obstruction of justice, breach of trust, all sorts of things that the RCMP would suddenly be concerned with.

“I think that’s what’s really changed, the stakes have been elevated by both what the present CEO has said and what Philpott has said.”

Veteran of scandal management

Brown was chief of staff for premier Campbell on Dec. 28, 2003, the day RCMP officers arrived at the B.C. legislature and carted away boxes of evidence for what would become a years-long scandal involving the botched billion-dollar sell-off of the province’s public rail system.

Neither Campbell nor Brown was charged with any wrongdoing. But eight years later, Brown was the first witness called for the resulting trial, which ended with guilty pleas to fraud by two ministerial aides.

If Trudeau gets a knock on his door by the Mounties any time soon, he might want to give Brown a call for a bit of advice.

Then again, the PM likely won’t like what he hears. Brown, who writes a column for the Georgia Straight, declares in his latest that the Liberals’ best chance of winning the fall election is to “lance the boil” that is Trudeau.

As he told The Tyee in an email today, “The fear of losing Trudeau needs to be flipped on its head if left-leaning progressives want to minimize the chances of a Scheer victory this fall. The Liberals can now only hope to regain the moral high ground that is so vital for securing the values they purport to represent by replacing their leader. They can own the ethical hill they are now choosing to die upon by defending the indefensible by selecting a new leader who the heroines Wilson-Raybould and Philpott and Celina Caesar-Chavannes can all rally behind.”

Brown figures, “I am perhaps one of the first to suggest that Trudeau should be dumped by his caucus in their party’s political interest.”

As such, he joins a club that includes The Tyee’s Crawford Kilian who wrote a column published here March 5 headlined: “Trudeau’s Resignation Is the Party’s Only Hope.”

Video from ...,"""I always try to be respectful…I didn't do that last night. Last night I lacked respect towards them and I apologize for that,"" Trudeau said.

The Star has reported extensively on the effects of an industrial mercury dump 50 years ago upstream from Grassy Narrows First Nation, revealing that fish near the community are the most contaminated in the province, that there is mercury-contaminated soil and river sediment at or near the site of the old mill, and the provincial government knew in the 1990s that mercury was visible in soil and never told anyone inGrassy Narrows or nearby Wabaseemoong (Whitedog) Independent Nations.

New research reported in December indicated children in Grassy Narrows whose mothers ate fish at least once a week while pregnant are four times more likely to have a learning disability or nervous system disorder.

People in the community have also developed tremors, slurred speech, impaired hearing and tunnel vision, and lost muscle co-ordination, the Star has reported.

On top of that, the fishing industry in the region has been decimated.

Trudeau's jibe toward demonstrators at the Liberal fundraiser was greeted with criticism. Perry Bellegarde, National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations, posted on Twitter that Trudeau's comments ""unacceptable and offensive"" and said he should apologize directly to those involved.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh told reporters on Parliament Hill Thursday that Trudeau's comment was ""callous."" He called the situation in Grassy Narrows a ""horrible tragedy"" that should be approached with compassion.

""I think we were all deeply offended by Mr. Trudeau's remarks,"" Singh said. ""The fact that Mr. Trudeau didn't respond with compassion maybe speaks to the fact that he doesn't actually care about what people are going through, and that's something that's really hurtful.""

Norman’s lawyer, Marie Henein, told an Ottawa court Thursday that the government redacted the memo claiming solicitor-client privilege, prompting the judge to point out that Wernick is not a lawyer.

Henein said there is a list of redacted documents the defence will challenge the solicitor-client privilege claim, but mentioned two other key documents: a 64-page memo from Privy Council Office lawyer Paul Shuttle to Wernick written on Oct. 19, 2018 and a 13-page memo from Shuttle to Wernick written on Dec. 22, 2017. Wernick’s memo to Trudeau was dated Oct. 24, 2018.

“The issue is whether there is a viable claim of privilege on this at all, and then, if there is a viable claim of privilege, whether or not an exception should apply,” Henein said.

Court will hear the defence’s application to lift the redactions on April 16 and 17.

Norman’s lawyers filed notice of application for third-party records on Oct. 12, 2018 — about two weeks before Wernick’s memo to Trudeau. That application set out in detail which government records the defence would be seeking.

The Privy Council Office is the government department that supports the Prime Minister’s Office and the federal cabinet. In previous court hearings, Henein’s lawyers have raised concerns that Privy Council lawyers were discussing trial strategy with Crown prosecutors — a claim the Public Prosecution Service of Canada has strongly denied. “The PPSC has not sought or received instructions in respect of the prosecution of Mr. Norman from the Privy Council Office or any other government department or body,” said a statement from the prosecution service on Feb. 12.

Norman, the former second-in-command of the Canadian Forces, is facing a criminal charge of breach of trust over an allegation he systematically leaked cabinet information about a $700-milllion navy supply ship procurement project.

Norman’s lawyers want to view the Privy Council memos in order to prepare their abuse-of-process motion, which was scheduled to be heard this week but is now pushed off until at least May due to delays in disclosure. The abuse motion will likely allege political interference, among other issues, and will seek to have the case dismissed before it gets to trial, scheduled for August.

Most of the case so far has been consumed by a fight over disclosure of documents, and Norman’s lawyers have been focused recently on a circle of senior government officials including Wernick and Trudeau. Justice Department lawyers told the court on Thursday they have now provided the judge with about 7,000 documents for her to review, and have about 1,000 documents still to go.

Before handing them over to Norman’s lawyers, Justice Heather Perkins-McVey reviews the documents for possible redactions and to determine whether they are relevant to Norman’s defence. She is expected to release a ruling shortly on which documents she determined were relevant.

But Henein told the court there had been almost no disclosure from Wernick until the redacted memo.

“As you know, we have been pursuing these documents and emails and all sorts of correspondence,” Henein told the court. “Mr. Wernick has not produced a single note. We’re advised there’s no note, there’s no email, there’s no nothing. And then we get a 60-page memo that’s redacted.”

She said she has asked Justice Department lawyers to go back to Wernick and his top staff to obtain a list of any meetings they ever attended on the Norman case and the names of those in attendance.

Wernick, the country’s top civil servant, has been the subject of controversy over his recent testimony in the SNC-Lavalin affair, in which he defended himself and Trudeau against the allegation they pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to defer a criminal prosecution of the Montreal-based engineering company.

During one of his appearances before the House of Commons justice committee, Wernick said he wasn’t a lawyer and thus couldn’t give legal advice on whether Wilson-Raybould was restricted by solicitor-client privilege. “I am not a lawyer, but I use them a lot,” he told the committee on Feb. 21. “I am in no position to give this committee legal advice.”

The Justice Department may argue, however, that the memo at issue in the Norman case contained legal advice from Privy Council lawyers despite being written by Wernick.

Wernick’s SNC-Lavalin testimony sparked backlash from opposition MPs who felt he was being too partisan in supporting Trudeau and the government. Wernick announced his early retirement on March 18, though did not give a specific day he would step down.

“Recent events have led me to conclude that I cannot serve as Clerk of the Privy Council and Secretary to Cabinet during the upcoming election campaign,” he said in his statement. “It is now apparent that there is no path for me to have a relationship of mutual trust and respect with the leaders of the Opposition parties.”

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ...","VANCOUVER — Justin Trudeau delivered a feisty, campaign-style speech in Vancouver-Kingsway Sunday night as he introduced former TV news anchor Tamara Taggart as the riding’s Liberal candidate in the fall federal election.

The prime minister fired off a flurry of verbal jabs at Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer, and also former prime minister Stephen Harper, giving a glimpse of what could be a heated campaign for the October election.

“Investing in people and communities is the way to grow the economy. Stephen Harper and the Conservatives still don’t get it. Andrew Sheer doesn’t get it either,” he said to a gym full of enthusiastic supporters.

“Under Stephen Harper, Canada had the worst growth rate we’d had since the depths of the Great Depression under R. B. Bennett.”

Trudeau then accused Sheer’s Conservatives of hoping to continue Harper’s policies by giving tax breaks to the wealthy while cutting programs for the middle and lower classes.

“They still think the way to create economic growth for everyone is to cut programs and give advantages and benefits to the wealthiest,” he said. “Well, that doesn’t trickle down to anyone and it didn’t work for 10 years.”

Trudeau pitched the upcoming election as an opportunity for all Canadians to step up and start talking about the kind of country they want to leave for their children and grandchildren.

“Do we want to invest in the middle class — shine on the world stage,” he asked, before warning that Canada “is seeing the rise of populism, aggressive, fear-based politics, just like the rest of the world.”

The crowd roared its approval when the prime minister suggested the best way to counter divisive populism is by recruiting “strong, compassionate people who’ve focused their lives on bringing people together and on empowering people.”

He lauded Taggart as one of those people from all walks of Canadian life who have invested in their communities in various ways to grow the economy, respond to the challenges of climate change and put Canada on the world stage.

Taggart admitted feeling a bit overwhelmed and emotional at being on stage, especially seeing her children holding up signs that read, “Team Tamara.”

The Order of British Columbia recipient said she wants to be the people’s voice in Ottawa, adding that her media career made her a good listener.

While Taggart steered clear of talking about the specifics of her campaign platform at the event, she has previously said that she wants to focus on affordable housing, protecting the environment while boosting the economy, and women’s health and safety.

She’s likely to face a tough challenge in Vancouver-Kingsway, which has been held by New Democrat MP Don Davies since 2008.

“Canada’s prime minister, embroiled in a political scandal, is now escaping to Southwest Florida,” announced NBC 2, a local news affiliate who got exclusive word of the visiting national leader.

The broadcaster dispatched a reporter to North Captiva Island, a largely recreational island where Trudeau reportedly rented two large homes for his family and entourage. For much of the prime minister’s visit, the affiliate also kept up a live feed on the prime ministerial plane, a “maple-leaf-emblazoned” Bombardier Challenger parked at Page Field, a small airport close to Fort Myers, Florida.

North Captiva Island is accessible only by charter boat, and cars are banned, with the only motorized transportation being golf carts. However, Trudeau appears to have been brought to the island by a vessel with U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

The NBC2 report described a team of 40 “Secret Service” protecting the prime minister and his family from a fleet of golf carts. Trudeau’s typical bodyguards are plainclothes RCMP who closely resemble the Secret Service details that typically surround U.S. presidents and VIPs.

However, as a visiting dignitary, it’s possible that Trudeau was supplied with U.S. Secret Service agents for added protection. His visit did indeed pull in assistance from local law enforcement, including a marine unit of the local Lee County sheriff’s office.

Trudeau is one of approximately 3.5 million Canadians who visit Florida every year. Canadians also constitute 27 per cent of the state’s foreign real estate buyers, purchasing $7 billion in Florida properties in 2017 alone.

The state is also notable as the frequent weekend getaway for the incumbent U.S. president, with Donald Trump’s Mar-A-Lago resort located almost directly east of North Captiva Island on Florida’s east coast.

The Trudeau family itself has long ties to Florida, with Orlando being where Justin’s grandfather, Charles-Émile Trudeau, died of a heart attack in 1935 while touring with the Montreal Royals baseball team, of whom he was a part owner.

While the Canadian public is normally informed of Trudeau’s whereabouts, all bets are off when he takes private vacations. For a similar Florida vacation in early 2018, officials in the prime minister’s office said only that he was “spending private time with his family in Florida.”

On Monday at approximately 6 p.m., the prime ministerial Challenger jet was seen departing Page Field.

Heckling from Conservatives over the SNC-Lavalin affair during budget day has not done Opposition leader Andrew Scheer any favours, according to a former Liberal strategist.

""Part of the Opposition's job is to oppose, of course, but the other job is to present themselves as a government-in-waiting — that was not a government-in-waiting,"" said John Duffy, who was an adviser to former prime minister Paul Martin, and is the founder of StrategyCorp.

As Finance Minister Bill Morneau delivered his budget speech Tuesday, the beginning of his speech was drowned out by noise from the benches opposite, in protest at the Liberal-majority justice committee shutting down an investigation into the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Duffy told The Current's Anna Maria Tremonti that the Liberals ""were pretty realistic about what the Opposition was likely to do yesterday.""

""What we didn't expect was the spectacle. The pounding, the stamping, the hooting and hollering … really looking like a tantrum from a daycare centre.""

""I don't think Mr. Scheer did himself any favours in that.""

Conservative MPs banged on desks and jeered loudly during Finance Minister Bill Morneau's budget speech making it nearly impossible to hear what Morneau was trying to say. 0:26

Speaking after the budget was delivered, Scheer said that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was using the budget to distract from the SNC-Lavalin affair, and accusations that former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould faced pressure to intervene in the criminal case against the company.

""Mr. Trudeau's plan is obvious. Massive deficits to distract Canadians from his corruption before the election. Massive tax hikes to pay for them after the election,"" he said.

He added that Canadians ""demand answers on the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal and Conservatives will do everything we can to get them.""

Angela Wright, a freelance political writer and Conservative strategist, said she understands ""where the frustration comes from"" for the Conservatives.

""Of course the government wants to talk about the budget, but they have to know that the Conservatives still want to talk about SNC-Lavalin,"" she told Tremonti.

Canadians should at least be able to hear what the finance minister has to say. - Angela Wright

However, despite their frustrations, they should recognize the importance of the budget, she said.

""If the government wants to deliver the budget, then Canadians should at least be able to hear what the finance minister has to say.""

""Then they can come out and continue to remind Canadians about SNC-Lavalin and the fact they're not going to let the issue go away.""

Leader of the Official Opposition Andrew Scheer threatens emergency actions to ensure Canadians hear the whole story on the SNC-Lavalin affair. 0:34

For their views on the latest from Parliament Hill, and how it could affect voters, Tremonti was joined by:

John Duffy, former Liberal strategist and advisor to former Prime Minister Paul Martin, founder of StrategyCorp, and author of Fights of Our Lives: Elections, Leadership and the Making of Canada.

Angela Wright, freelance political writer and Conservative strategist.

Kathleen Monk, former NDP strategist for Jack Layton, and a principal at Earnscliffe Strategy Group.

""Andrew Scheer here.""

If you live in the four provinces where the federal carbon tax is being introduced, you might get a text message from the Conservative Party leader telling you to fill your gas tank this weekend.

The mass-texting campaign against the carbon pricing policy that will take effect April 1 in New Brunswick, Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan will direct voters to the Conservatives’ petition against the carbon tax. And the texts might pop up on your phone even if you’ve never given your phone number to the Conservative Party of Canada.

In addition to pulling phone numbers from its own databases, the party will use software that auto-generates numbers with specific area codes in order to blast out the text messages.

One of those texts might look like this:

""Andrew Scheer here.

Trudeau’s carbon tax will raise gas prices on Monday.

So fill your tank!""

The party is also running radio ads against the carbon tax in Saint John, Ottawa, Toronto and Winnipeg, among other markets.

“This effort will be about informing Canadians about the cost of this Liberal tax on everyday items, including the price of gas, and how for wealthy Liberals like Justin Trudeau, an extra $100 a month on bills might not be a big deal, but it matters a lot to a family trying to make their household budget last to the end of the month,” Conservative Party spokesperson Cory Hann said in an email to CTV News.

Hann said there will also be co-ordinated social media campaigns and door-to-door canvassing efforts in the affected provinces over the weekend.

The Liberal government is requiring provinces to impose a price on carbon emissions, starting at $20 per tonne this year and rising by $10 per tonne annually until it hits $50 in 2022. Since Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and New Brunswick have refused to introduce their own carbon pricing plans, Ottawa is imposing its own tax on them.

The Liberals have said the carbon tax is necessary to combat the effects of climate change, and pointed out that rebates will be available to the residents of the four provinces through the tax system.

In his remarks to the Manning Centre networking conference on Saturday, Scheer said he ""unequivocally"" condemns hateful ideologies.

""The criticisms are completely baseless.""

Those criticisms have been plentiful in the past few weeks.

Says he misheard conspiracy question

Scheer has come under fire for speaking at the recent United We Roll rally on Parliament Hill, which had picked up participants who were making racist and anti-immigrant comments. The Prime Minister's Office also condemned Scheer for ""sharing a stage"" with Faith Goldy, a commentator who was let go from her job at Rebel Media after appearing on a podcast affiliated with the neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer.

Scheer was also chastised for not shutting down a question at a recent town hall about a widely debunked conspiracy theory connecting former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to a child sex ring.

In that particular instance, Scheer insisted he hadn't heard the question properly.

Whether racism or disinformation, Scheer says he and the Conservatives oppose such rhetoric.

""People know that the Conservative Party is open and welcoming,"" he said.

""We denounce any elements of society that would promote hate speech.""

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer says he didn't hear a portion of a question about the Clinton Foundation mentioning ""pizzagate."" 1:05

'Cheap political points'

His comments at the Manning Conference were the first time he's fully addressed the accusations against him, though he's taken questions on the matters at news events in the past few weeks.

Scheer was also heavily criticized for tweeting out his condolences to the victims of the New Zealand mosque attacks without mentioning the words 'Muslim' or 'mosque'.

In another statement later that day, Scheer did use both.

On Saturday, he accused the Liberals of targeting his post to ""score cheap political points in a disgusting manner,"" adding that Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale and Gov. Gen. Julie Payette released statements omitting both terms as well.

The Tory leader said it's important to speak out against those who put one group of people over another.

SNC-Lavalin still top of mind for the Tories

Scheer turned to the SNC-Lavalin affair as well, calling on Canadians to put pressure on Trudeau to allow all sides of the story to be heard.

The Liberal majority on the justice committee shut down an investigation into the matter, and now the ethics committee will begin its own.

Former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott are free to speak, the prime minister has said, but so far neither of them have taken that full opportunity.

Scheer said the crux of his issue with the conduct of top government officials is that politicians should not involve themselves in deciding what legal tools are available in prosecutions.

In what was clearly a speech with an eye toward the upcoming election, Scheer told the audience that being an Opposition leader isn't always easy, because you're not as high-profile as the prime minister.

However, now that the SNC-Lavalin affair is casting doubt onto Trudeau's character, it's easier for people to see ""the real Andrew Scheer,"" he said.

Scheer also shredded the new federal Liberal budget, calling it a multi-billion dollar attempt to distract from the ethical questions about the government.","'The criticisms are completely baseless,' Scheer says of claims he's too soft on hate groups",CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/scheer-pizzagate-united-we-roll-new-zealand-extremism-1.5069197

Scheer, in conversation with Global News’ Mercedes’ Stephenson, was seemingly referring to comments made by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau several years ago, suggesting that China’s authoritarian political system had contributed to their economic success.

“There’s a level of admiration I actually have for China, because their basic dictatorship is allowing them to actually turn their economy around on a dime and say, ‘We need to go green … we need to start investing in solar,” Trudeau said at a women’s event in 2013.

Trudeau received criticism for his comments at the time and later took to Twitter to offer clarification.

“I pointed out that globally, Canada is up against big countries (China, for one) that can address some major issues quickly,” he wrote on Twitter at the time. “It’s ridiculous for anyone to suggest that I of all people would trade our rights and freedoms for any other system of [government].”

Scheer went on to comment on the recent decision by the Chinese government to stop accepting shipments of Canadian canola oil. Earlier this month, China started blocking canola imports from Canada, citing the detection of “hazardous organisms.” International Trade Minister Jim Carr, however, denied this claim, as Global News previously reported.

The canola dispute comes shortly after comes Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Vancouver on behalf of the U.S.

Tensions between Canada and China have increased since she was arrested, as two Canadians in China were arrested and remain detained on espionage charges. The international community has called for their release.

Scheer blames the emerging trade obstacles on Trudeau’s handling of Chinese relations.

“Farmers in this situation are paying for the mistakes that Justin Trudeau has made,” he said.

Trudeau pledged near the end of 2018 that Canada was looking to broaden trade opportunities with China, potentially leading to an eventual free trade agreement between the two countries.

Scheer, however, suggested during his conversation with Stephenson that a free trade deal may be premature, given the robustness of China’s economy when compared to Canada’s.

The opposition leader also touched on several top-of-mind topics for Canadians.

Scheer also suggested that the SNC-Lavalin scandal currently plaguing the Liberals is only contributing to tensions with China.

“We have a very tense situation with the CFO of Huawei being with the extradition process, and our responsibility as a government, as a Canadian government, has been [that] we don’t interfere in the rule of law, we don’t interfere in criminal court cases, we respect the independence of our judiciary. That was the message to China,” he said.

“A couple weeks later, there’s Justin Trudeau interfering in a criminal court case, putting pressure on the attorney general to get a better outcome for his well-connected friends. That, I believe, is a big part of why this situation with China is further deteriorating,” he continued.

He encouraged Canadians to “put pressure” on Justin Trudeau to cooperate with the ethics’ committee investigation into the SNC-Lavalin affair, which gets underway next week.

“What we know for sure is that there is more to be said,” Scheer told the crowd. “Right now, [Trudeau] is engaged in a cover-up the likes of which we’ve never seen. He’s used a CAD$40 billion budget to distract us from it, making it the most expensive cover up in the history of cover ups.”

Since the story broke in early February, Trudeau and several close advisers have been facing accusations of pressuring the then-attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, to grant a remediation agreement to the embattled engineering firm SNC-Lavalin amid charges of fraud and corruption.

Trudeau countered Wilson-Raybould’s account of their conversations, saying that he and his advisers simply hoped to confer with her about her decision rather than apply pressure. Opposition members, including Scheer, have been consistent in calling for the prime minister to resign.

Both Scheer and Trudeau are ramping up their public appearances as they kick off an election year. Recent polls suggest that amid the SNC-Lavalin affair, Scheer’s Conservatives are beginning to gain headway on the Liberal leader’s largely bruised popularity.

It’s in the pizzagate.”

Scheer gamely answered the question as though he hadn’t just been asked about one of the most notorious (and widely debunked) conspiracies in modern political history. He later claimed to have not heard the question. To be fair to him, the audience began clapping loudly at the man’s suggestion that one of the biggest charities in America was secretly trafficking and sacrificing children. In any event, the question was indicative of the conundrum Scheer now faces, as he attempts to harness the raucous strain of anti-Trudeau animus sweeping across the country: embrace the motivated populist anger of these crowds, along with the unhinged bits seemingly inherent in them, or cede this support to his rightward rival, Maxime Bernier and the People’s Party of Canada. Scheer has chosen a third option, which is to welcome the crowds while denying the ugly bits even exist — even as they pop up in front of Scheer’s very eyes. Consider his February appearance at a rally organized by United We Roll, which has a well-established connection to the country’s yellow vest movement, the proudly anti-immigrant group that sprung up in the wake of a similar movement in France.

Article Continued Below

Scheer’s speech, which focused on Trudeau’s alleged hatred of the oil and gas industry, was a play for truckers and their supporters, United We Roll’s ostensible supporters. Yet an apparent conspiracy-obsessed heckler peppered his three-minute spiel with familiar “He’s attacking your children” rhetoric, while another wondered out loud, in both official languages, what Scheer was going to do about the United Nations. A sign outside Ottawa’s West Block also critiqued the U.N. and said Trudeau should be charged with treason. The relationship between Scheer and these populist crowds is mutually beneficial. He gets a friendly audience, while this audience has the implied stamp of approval from the man who may well be the next prime minister. The conspiratorial types who keep showing are just an unfortunate by-product, it seems. When I asked a Conservative adviser about them, he shrugged his shoulders. “We can’t control who shows up to these events,” he told me, seemingly by rote. Yet it is difficult to understate the danger of Scheer’s gambit. By appearing at events like United We Roll, Scheer gives legitimacy to voices that would otherwise (and deservedly) exist only on the fringes of Canada’s political discourse — and which have become notably loud and brazen over the last several years. It used to be that Trudeau’s critics pilloried the prime minister for his conspicuous liberalism. Now some are calling for his head. “You are working for your globalist partners. I wonder how much they are paying you to betray Canada,” a woman said to Trudeau during Regina town hall last January. “What do we do with traitors in Canada, Mr. Trudeau? We used to hang them, hang them for treason.” Scheer is in a difficult spot. Populist fury against the current government is widespread and politically active. Yet emboldened in part by the example of scorched-earth nationalism espoused by the current American president, it has also become decidedly more visceral and conspiracy-oriented as we march closer to the October election.

By all means, Scheer should criticize Trudeau for being an out-of-touch, tax-and-spend elite. But he should just as conspicuously call out those would-be supporters who believe the 23rd prime minister is but a product of their conspiracy-addled nightmares. Martin Patriquin is a Montreal writer, who has contributed to The Guardian, The Walrus and The New York Times.

In addition to calling it a cover-up and a snub to all Canadians, the leader of the official Opposition called it an attempt by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to undermine the role of Parliament.

“(Prime Minister Justin Trudeau) thinks today’s budget will distract Canadians from all of this. He is using the budget — a critical element of any government’s agenda — as nothing more than a political prop in an unprecedented cover-up,” Andrew Scheer said Tuesday.

The committee’s decision came on the same day as the federal budget was being tabled. So Scheer wove that into his broader criticism of the government, describing the budget as a “political prop” by a prime minister determined to divert the public’s attention from the scandal engulfing his government.

That raises a question that cuts to the core of this week’s two big national political stories, the budget and the everlasting SNC-Lavalin saga: can the regularly scheduled tabling of a federal budget be described as a political prop?

Spoiler alert: The Canadian Press Baloney Meter is a dispassionate examination of political statements culminating in a ranking of accuracy on a scale of “no baloney” to “full of baloney” (complete methodology below).

Scheer’s remark earns a rating of “a lot of baloney” — the statement is mostly inaccurate but contains elements of truth.

The facts

The SNC-Lavalin controversy slammed like a runaway train into Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s delivery of Tuesday’s budget, the government’s final spending blueprint before a federal election scheduled for this fall.

While the budget lockup was underway several blocks east of Parliament Hill, the Liberal majority on the House of Commons justice committee voted to end its five-week inquiry into the controversy, enraging Conservatives and New Democrats alike.

By the time Morneau reached the Commons to deliver his 4 p.m. budget speech, he faced some serious Conservative roadblocks. The Conservatives forced a vote on a motion to allow MPs on the fisheries committee to travel. Several Tory MPs voted both for and against.

But they each also managed to also denounce the Liberals’ earlier decision, which prevented former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould from reappearing before the justice committee. Chants of “Let her speak” filled the chamber, while more points of privilege and points of order ate up the clock.

Morneau’s speech was delayed an hour, and when he finally rose to speak, he was drowned out by opposition MPs. Eventually, the Conservatives walked out of the Commons, with Scheer calling the committee’s decision “an assault on democracy.”

Morneau’s budget aimed billions in new spending at a variety of areas ç from pharmacare to retraining workers to helping first-time homebuyers. It was a deficit-friendly, pre-election platform that contrasted with the Conservative mantra of balanced books. Morneau decided the government would use up a big windfall, and run near-term deficits of almost $20 billion. He offered no timeline for bringing the budget back to balance, and made no apologies.

The budget document credited a stronger economy for an extra $27.8 billion in revenue over the next six years, compared with the numbers in the government’s fall update. The new budget will spend about $22.8 billion of that additional cash, and the government said it has earmarked another $4 billion in spending since the fall update.

Morneau called this “investments to grow our economy for the long term – while we bring the books back towards balance.”

Trudeau, meanwhile, accused the Conservatives of using the SNC-Lavalin affair to avoid talking about their own “failed” approach to the economy. “The Conservatives still don’t want to talk about jobs, about growth, about investing in Canadians because they’re realizing they have no plan,” he said.

What the experts say

Financial experts say that while budgets can certainly be used by governments to make political gains, they are an annual ritual of government that are scheduled to take place on dates that are set weeks in advance.

“The content of the budget is the real issue, and here the claim the budget was used as a prop is weak,” said Brett House, the deputy chief economist at Scotiabank. “Though the revenue windfall was spent, and we would have preferred to see it saved, the amount was not large and wasn’t devoted to a big signature project or program.”

Kevin Page, the former parliamentary budget officer, agrees there is no single big initiative in the budget to draw attention away from other issues such as SNC-Lavalin.

“Budgets are not mandatory but it is a long-standing tradition and a best practice to table a fiscal plan before the start of the fiscal year,” said Page, the president of the Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy at the University of Ottawa.

“This budget does not look like a prop.”

Doug Porter, the chief economist of BMO Financial Group, says there is little doubt the government would like to shift the focus to other matters, including the economy and fiscal policy.

“But, it’s also fair to say that, as the quote suggests, a budget is ‘a critical element of any government’s agenda,”‘ he said.

Porter said the convention has generally become to unveil a new budget in February or March before the start of the new fiscal year on April 1.

“It’s a convention that is followed by all 10 provinces as well.”

The verdict

The government usually releases a budget at this time of year. Though a lot is riding on the pre-election blueprint the Liberals tabled Tuesday, and Trudeau wasted no time in using it to attack the Conservative record, it didn’t feature a showcase signature initiative aimed at changing the political channel.

For those reasons, Scheer’s assertion that the Liberals were using the budget as a political prop contains “a lot of baloney.”

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer holds a press conference on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on March 25, 2019. If Scheer truly wants to prove to Canadians that he isn’t courting racist voters he should do what the Toronto Maple Leafs did this month when defenceman Morgan Reilly was accused of uttering a homophobic slur on the ice, Emma Teitel writes. ( Sean Kilpatrick / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

The strange thing is that for a party so tough on crime that it states its position in capital letters, its leader is arguably less than tough when it comes to a force that drives crime: hate. Note that in February Tory Leader Andrew Scheer spoke at the same event as Faith Goldy — an Internet personality with white nationalist affiliations who once lent her voice to a Neo-Nazi podcast. Note that earlier this month Scheer neglected to include the words “Muslim” or “mosque” in his initial statement following the mosque attacks in New Zealand, when a white supremacist shot to death 50 Muslim people.

After a hefty dose of criticism (including some from the National Council of Canadian Muslims) Scheer produced a new statement that included both words, but it had the feeling of too little, too late. His initial decision to condemn the “attack on freedom” without specifically naming the faith group targeted was interpreted by some (myself included) to be a political manoeuvre by which Scheer could have his cake and eat it too: he could give the semblance of solidarity without offending the Islamophobes in his base. And then there’s Scheer’s legendary defensiveness. According to The Canadian Press, Scheer told attendees at the Manning Networking Conference this past weekend, that criticisms levelled at him on this issue are “completely baseless.” Ignoring the many ordinary Canadians who levelled those criticisms, he accused the Liberal party of inventing the controversy to “score cheap political points in a very disgusting manner.” He also said: “When you look at statements I’ve made condemning hateful ideologies, those who would promote any type of superiority of one race or religion over the others, I condemn that unequivocally.”

When asked about his apparent refusal to use the word “Islamophobia” he denied that this is true and referenced a recent motion condemning the mosque attack that passed in the House of Commons. He said: “I reject anyone who would speak out based on Islamophobic principles, whether or not that’s somebody who’s trying to lump all people of the Muslim faith together or whether it’s people who are trying to antagonize elements of society to have a more negative reaction to those who practice that faith.”

It’s interesting: he rejects them and yet he speaks directly to them and on the same stage as them. February’s United We Roll event where Scheer and Goldy spoke respectively wasn’t only about pipelines and economic anxiety. According to the Canadian Anti-Hate Network, a non-profit that monitors hate groups, the rebranded United We Roll movement (previously Yellow Vest Convoy) is also home to many members who peddle in racist conspiracy theory and hate speech about Muslims, immigrants, government, and media. None of this is to say that Scheer is responsible for any attack against any group. Crazy hateful people do crazy hateful things all the time absent the influence of politicians. But when they do these things it’s imperative that our leaders name and embrace the communities they target. It’s imperative that leaders do this immediately — not hours later after everybody else tells them to. And this one should be obvious: it’s imperative that they decline to speak at the same events as Neo-Nazi sympathizers. Scheer’s defensiveness in the face of wholly legitimate criticism this month is not only inappropriate; it undermines any genuine statement he does make condemning white nationalism. If he truly wants to prove to Canadians that he isn’t courting racist voters he should do what the Toronto Maple Leafs did earlier this month when defenceman Morgan Reilly was accused of uttering a homophobic slur on the ice. An NHL investigation cleared Reilly of the charge but Leafs management held a press conference anyway devoted entirely to the problem of homophobia in hockey. Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas and Morgan Reilly weren’t defensive in the face of these accusations. They were appalled. The notion that people believed a member of the Leafs organization was capable of such behaviour was reason enough to make a heartfelt, formal statement supporting its LGBT fans. In Dubas’ words: “Every time it’s even thought that those types of words are uttered in our facility or anywhere, we have to do our part to use this situation …to get rid of casual homophobia, vulgar homophobia, things that make people of any sexuality or sexual orientation feel unsafe or uncomfortable in our facilities.” This is how you clear things up. Not by going on the defensive and certainly not by saying one thing and doing another. If Scheer is genuinely tired of people accusing him of turning a blind eye to bigotry it would serve him well to hold a press conference of his own where he ditches the attitude, condemns white nationalism in crystal-clear terms and apologizes for taking the same stage as Goldy. And if he doesn’t do this then he might want to remove the Tough on Crime stance from the Conservative party’s platform. Because in a world threatened by white supremacist violence, you can’t be tough on crime if you’re soft on hate. Emma Teitel is a columnist based in Toronto covering current affairs.

Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer told a crowd at the Manning Centre Conference on Saturday that a Conservative government would balance the federal budget, but wouldn’t say by when.

“Yes, we will balance the budget,” Scheer said to applause at the conservative networking event, during a Q&A with Global News’ Mercedes Stephenson.

Scheer said balancing the budget would be done through “a combination of big ticket items with controlling the rate of growth.”

“There’s been such rapid increases in the rate of growth of government spending that we can get a lot of the way there just by restricting the growth of government spending back to closer to inflation and population growth,” Scheer said.

Scheer said a Conservative government would cut funding of the Canada Infrastructure Bank, which was established under the current Liberal government, as well as to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.

Scheer offered little specifics about when a Conservative government would deliver a balanced budget however, only saying it would be “over a shorter period of time,” if elected in the October general election.

The Trudeau government presented their final budget of this mandate, which projects a $19.7 billion deficit for 2019-20. In 2015, the Liberals ran on a campaign promise of returning to a balanced budget by the upcoming year. They have yet to post a surplus or an annual deficit less than $14 billion since assuming office that year. In this year’s budget, the Liberals are projecting the deficit to fall slightly next year, before declining to $9.8 billion in 2023-24.

The Associated Press

Andrew Scheer says criticism over his initial failure to mention that Muslims were targeted in the recent mass murder in New Zealand is “completely baseless” and driven by “disgusting” Liberal efforts to score political points from the tragedy.

But in answering a question Saturday about how he deals with that criticism, the federal Conservative leader once again initially made no reference to Muslims.

“I deal with it by pointing out that the criticisms are completely baseless,” Scheer told the Manning Networking Conference, an annual gathering of this country’s conservative thinkers, strategists and politicians.

“When you look at statements I’ve made condemning hateful ideologies, those who would promote any type of superiority of one race or religion over the others, I condemn that unequivocally.”

Scheer noted that the second statement he issued on the day of the New Zealand shootings “absolutely did include the reference to the faith community that was attacked,” although he did not at first identify that faith community.

On March 15, an avowed white supremacist shot and killed 50 Muslim worshippers at two New Zealand mosques. In a statement posted that day on Twitter, Scheer condemned the attacks as “a despicable act of evil” against “peaceful worshippers,” without specifically mentioning where they occurred or who was targeted.

A few hours later – after the initial statement drew criticism even from top aides of former prime minister Stephen Harper – Scheer issued a second statement, which he referred to Saturday as his “official statement.” It specifically referred to the horrific “terror attack on two New Zealand mosques” and voiced his “profound condemnation of this cowardly and hateful attack on the Muslim community.”

On Saturday, Scheer blamed the Liberals for stirring up the controversy, accusing them of attempting “to score cheap political points in a very disgusting manner.” Moreover, he argued that initial tweets by Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale and Governor General Julie Payette also didn’t specifically mention mosques or Muslims.

Later, as he took questions from members of the audience, Scheer was asked why he’s never said the word “Islamophobia.”

“I don’t believe that’s true,” he responded, noting that all parties supported a motion last week in the House of Commons. That motion, which he didn’t describe, condemned the mosque attacks and affirmed the need to “confront hatred, Islamophobia, and white supremacy, in all their forms.”

“I reject anyone who would speak out based on Islamophobic principles, whether or not that’s somebody who is trying to lump all people of the Muslim faith in together or whether it’s people who are trying to antagonize elements of society to have a more negative reaction to those who practice that faith,” Scheer added.

“To me the important thing is to speak out against those who in any way give oxygen or space to those who are trying to promote one group of people over the other.”

Scheer also used his appearance at the Manning conference to promise that a Conservative government would balance the federal budget — but he didn’t say when.

He said the Liberals have made such increases to government spending that a Conservative government could get most of the way to balance simply by holding annual spending increases to the rate of inflation and population growth. As well, he said billions could be saved by scrapping “some big-ticket items” introduced by the Liberals such as the federal infrastructure bank.

The longer Prime Minister Justin Trudeau goes racking up large annual deficits, the harder it will be return to balance, Scheer suggested. But he said Canadians have “a window” in this fall’s federal election to “limit the damage and get back to balanced budgets over a shorter period of time.”

Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s latest budget forecasts deficits of almost $20 billion in each of the next two years, declining to just under $10 billion in five years. It makes no attempt to forecast when the budget might be balanced.","Despite criticism, Andrew Scheer again declines to say victims of New Zealand massacre were Muslims",The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-despite-criticism-andrew-scheer-again-declines-to-say-victims-of-new/

The leaders of Canada’s largest labour organization and a prominent national Muslim group say Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is emboldening far-right extremists by failing to call out Islamophobia following the New Zealand mosque shootings and attending events with people who promote hate speech.

Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) president Hassan Yussuff criticized Mr. Scheer’s response to the shootings at two mosques in Christchurch last week that left 50 people dead and dozens more injured. Mr. Scheer issued a lengthy statement about the terrorism attacks Friday after his initial Twitter message on the shootings were criticized for failing to mention that the victims were Muslims.

“Unfortunately the opposition leader had to be shamed to do a 180-degree turn to actually acknowledge what happened. Had he not been shamed, I’m not sure he would have changed his position,” Mr. Yussuf said Thursday.

Ihsaan Gardee, the executive director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM), said Mr. Scheer’s initial decision to avoid saying that the victims were Muslims and the attacks took place at mosques “felt very deliberate.”

“There is a real danger that this kind of association helps to embolden others to feel like they now have licence to act out on their hatred and on their ideologies,” Mr. Gardee said.

Mr. Yussuf also condemned Mr. Scheer for sharing a stage with “racists and bigots” at a protest led by a convoy of pro-pipeline, anti-carbon-tax demonstrators in February. Former Rebel Media personality Faith Goldy also attended the rally on Parliament Hill, where she told Indigenous counterprotesters to leave Canada if they didn’t like it.

Mr. Yussuf said Mr. Scheer should know better than to attend events with right-wing figures such as Ms. Goldy.

A spokesman for Mr. Scheer said the Tory leader was “very clear and emphatic” in his condemnation of the anti-Muslim hatred that motivated the New Zealand mosque attacks.

“Further, in his speech to the House of Commons earlier this week, he called for action to defend a concept of Canada rooted in shared civic values, respect for the principle of universal human dignity and freedom of religion for all,” said Brock Harrison, Mr. Scheer’s spokesman.

The CLC and the NCCM shared their concerns at a media conference about the rise of Islamophobia in Canadian workplaces, where they released a new report on the matter.

The report cites a steady rise in hate crimes targeting Muslim communities in Canada over the past several years, fuelled by far-right politics at home and abroad. It makes several recommendations aimed at reinforcing the responsibility of employers to educate management and staff about legal obligations around human rights and religious accommodations for Muslims. It also calls on governments to do more to support anti-racism awareness campaigns and develop strategies to combat online hate speech.

“What we’re talking about here is the everyday micro-aggressions that inform this fearful environment that many Canadian Muslims exist in and infiltrates every aspect of their daily life,” said Leila Nasr, NCCM communications co-ordinator.

""To me the important thing is to speak out against those who would in any way give oxygen or space to those who are trying to promote one group of people over the other,"" he said.

Scheer was criticized this week for failing to do just that.



The president of the Canadian Labour Congress, Hassan Yussuff, told reporters Thursday that Scheer should be held responsible for failing to condemn yellow-vest protesters who showed up in Ottawa in February to demonstrate against pipeline delays while spewing anti-immigrant rhetoric.

""For the leader of the Opposition not able to condemn them ... and stand on a stage with someone who is associated with hate and racism and somehow to not acknowledge that? ... That is a fundamental, I think, failing on his part, and I condemn his behaviour,"" Yussuff said at an event outlining efforts by the union movement to combat Islamophobia and the steady rise in hate crimes targeting Muslims.

""I don't think he should be excused for it, because he should know better, and if he doesn't, something is fundamentally wrong with his leadership, in my view,"" Hassan said.

Scheer spoke to the crowd of protesters, many of whom had lost their jobs in the energy sector and driven from Alberta and Scheer's home province of Saskatchewan to make their point to the government. The protesters also heard from Faith Goldy, the social media personality with white nationalist ties.

Ihsaan Gardee, the executive director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims, said he was concerned that not calling out behaviour against Muslims would give licence to others to act on their hatred and their ideologies.

""We are looking to our leaders for leadership, and being naively ignorant or wilfully blind, neither is acceptable and Canadians should demand better,"" he said.

""I deal with [it] by pointing out that the criticisms are completely baseless,"" Scheer responded.

Last week, the Conservative leader was criticized for issuing a statement in response to the massacre in New Zealand without mentioning that the attacks had taken place in mosques, against Muslims gathered for Friday prayers.

He said his statement condemned hateful ideology by anyone who promotes any type of superiority of one race or religion over others. ""I condemn that unequivocally.""

The Liberals, Scheer said, had tried to ""score cheap political points in a very disgusting manner"" by politicizing his original statement and the attacks. The Liberals, he noted, did not levy the same criticism against Governor General Julie Payette's comments, which also did not mention the victims were Muslims.

The Tories, he said, are an open, inclusive and welcoming party for people of all faiths and backgrounds.

In a speech in the House of Commons on Monday, the prime minister said events such as the carnage in Christchurch were precisely the right time to talk about politics.

""The best way to support people is to acknowledge that there is a problem and take concrete steps to fix it,"" he said. ""As a global community, we have a choice to make. Will we denounce our leaders who turn a blind eye to those who incite violence?

""Undoubtedly, I feel more secure, among all the countries, in Canada right now,"" she said as Trudeau smiled, his head bowed. She received a standing ovation from the crowd.

The Liberals have sought to differentiate themselves from the Tories vis-à-vis their relationship with Muslim Canadians.

Scheer, in some ways, has helped them. He voted, for example, against a motion two years ago condemning Islamophobia and all forms of systemic racism and religious discrimination. The motion called for a study on Islamophobia, data collection on hate crimes and a government strategy to deal with religious discrimination.

Scheer argued that the motion, by singling out one faith, was not inclusive.

At a press conference this morning, Scheer demanded that the standing committee on access to information, privacy and ethics agree to hold a study of the SNC-Lavalin affair. The standing committee on justice and human rights ended a study of the matter last week, prompting accusations by opposition members of a Liberal coverup.

Conservative members will put forward a motion at tomorrow’s committee meeting, which will ask Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to waive all constraints currently preventing Wilson-Raybould from speaking fully.

In recent days, there has been public debate over whether Wilson-Raybould can speak freely without penalty in the House of Commons under parliamentary privilege or if another waiver from Trudeau is needed.

Scheer said the concern about parliamentary immunity is it doesn’t “absolve” the former ministers from the oaths they had taken, referring to the cabinet pledge to the Privy Council Office to “keep secret all matters committed and revealed to me in this capacity, or that shall be secretly treated of in Council.”

“That is what Justin Trudeau waived for Ms. Wilson-Raybould but only for a narrow period of time,” Scheer said, adding that Wilson-Raybould and Philpott should be allowed to speak about events occurring after the former justice minister resigned from cabinet on Feb. 12.

“Clearly there were events that happened after her time as attorney general.”

Last month, Trudeau waived solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidences about the SNC-Lavalin affair, but the order-in-council only applies to Wilson-Raybould’s time as attorney general and excludes discussions between her and the director of public prosecutions.

Asked about the potential repercussions of Wilson-Raybould speaking in the House, Scheer said there are “clearly consequences to people’s reputations when they’ve taken oaths.”

“We’re saying don’t put them in that position if you’ve really got nothing to hide,” he said.

Scheer added that after a number of Liberal MPs recently said Wilson-Raybould and Philpott should speak their mind in order to settle the affair, there is now “consensus” on both sides of the House that both former ministers should be able to speak freely.

The committee motion will also ask Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board President Jane Philpott to testify before April 5 and to allow the committee to table its findings in Parliament. Philpott resigned from cabinet on March 4 over the Liberal government’s handling of the SNC-Lavalin controversy.

There are nine voting members of the ethics committee, including six Liberals, two Conservatives, and one NDP. The chair, Conservative MP Bob Zimmer, does not have a vote.

The SNC-Lavalin controversy began on Feb. 7 when the Globe and Mail reported allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office inappropriately pressured Wilson-Raybould to reverse a decision made by the director of public prosecutions to move forward with a criminal case involving the Montreal-based engineering giant.

Since then, Trudeau’s principal secretary Gerry Butts, Wilson-Raybould, and Philpott have resigned from their jobs. Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick has also announced his retirement.

At a press conference in Ottawa Monday, Andrew Scheer again called on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to fully waive solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence for Wilson-Raybould ahead of an ethics committee meeting Tuesday on the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Scheer also said Trudeau must waive cabinet confidentiality for Philpott, who told Maclean's magazine last week that there is more to the controversy that must come out.

Watch:

The Tory leader noted how some Liberal MPs have, in recent days, publicly challenged Wilson-Raybould and Philpott to speak freely about the matter in the House of Commons, where parliamentary privilege protects members from facing legal action for their words.

Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould upped the ante in an interview with Global's ""The West Block"" that aired Sunday, saying that if both ex-ministers feel more needs to be said, they should ""put that on the record.""

""This is clearly a coordinated communications attempt over the last few days,"" Scheer told reporters.

There is ""now consensus on both sides of the House that both former ministers should be able to speak freely about their involvement in the SNC-Lavalin affair,"" he said.

If Liberals want to hear more from Wilson-Raybould and Philpott — who resigned as Treasury Board president over the government's handling of the controversy — then the prime minister should ""make it official"" and absolve them of constraints, the Tory leader said.

'When I take oaths, it's serious'

But Scheer, a former House Speaker, poured cold water on the idea that Wilson-Raybould and Philpott can easily stand up in the House and air things out.

While parliamentary privilege protects MPs from ""recourse about what they say,"" Scheer offered, it does not absolve them of the ethical and reputational consequences of breaking oaths without a greenlight from the prime minister.

""When I take oaths, it's serious. It's a matter of conscience for me,"" Scheer said. ""It's not something that I would break. There are clearly consequences to people's reputations when they've taken an oath. We're saying, don't put them in that position.""

Current and former cabinet ministers are part of the Privy Council, a body appointed by the Governor General on the recommendation of the prime minister to ""advise the Queen on issues of importance to the country."" Membership in the exclusive club comes with the title of ""Honourable"" and lasts for life, unless the appointment is withdrawn by the Governor General.

As a condition for joining cabinet, both Wilson-Raybould and Philpott swore they would:

""... be a true and faithful servant to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, as a member of Her Majesty's Privy Council for Canada. I will in all things to be treated, debated and resolved in Privy Council, faithfully, honestly and truly declare my mind and my opinion. I shall keep secret all matters committed and revealed to me in this capacity, or that shall be secretly treated of in Council. Generally, in all things I shall do as a faithful and true servant ought to do for Her Majesty. So help me God.""

Scheer took the same oath when he was sworn into the Privy Council in 2017. The Tory leader thanked Trudeau at the time for the honour.

Trudeau partially waived solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidences for Wilson-Raybould ahead of her explosive testimony to the House justice committee last month.

The waiver allowed the former attorney general to speak about the issues surrounding SNC-Lavalin's criminal prosecution when she served in the role, but not about the events that transpired after she was shuffled to Veterans Affairs on Jan. 14.

Over four hours, Wilson-Raybould told MPs that she faced sustained and inappropriate pressure from Trudeau and other government officials, when she was attorney general, to help SNC-Lavalin avoid a criminal trial on fraud and bribery charges.

Though her words sparked immediate calls from Tories for Trudeau to resign, the prime minister denied Wilson-Raybould's version of events. His former principal secretary later testified that Wilson-Raybould did not raise concerns about inappropriate pressure until she was shuffled from her powerful role.

Speaking about the issue with reporters in Maple Ridge, B.C. Monday, Trudeau said his government issued an ""unprecedented waiver"" which allowed Wilson-Raybould to speak about the specific issue of whether or not she faced undue pressure over SNC-Lavalin when she was attorney general.

Trudeau also said he had a ""cordial conversation"" with Wilson-Raybould last week. The Vancouver-Granville MP has said she will seek re-election as a Liberal MP this fall, as will Philpott in the Ontario riding of Markham-Stouffville.

""I look forward to continuing to engage with both Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott as they make their way forward,"" he said. ""They have both indicated that they look forward to running again as Liberals in the next election and I look forward to continuing to have their strong and thoughtful voices as part of our team.""

Wilson-Raybould promises more 'evidence'

Asked if he agreed with the growing number of Liberal MPs encouraging Wilson-Raybould and Philpott to speak out in the House, Trudeau said those are decisions to be made by the ex-ministers.

""What we have done as a government is grant an unprecedented waiver so that a full airing could happen at the justice committee of everything in regards to the SNC-Lavalin file and the time that is in question, when the former minister of justice was minister of justice,"" he said.

Last week, Liberal MPs on the justice committee ended the group's investigation into the matter. On Friday, Wilson-Raybould wrote to the committee to says she will make a written submission to the group and provide copies of emails and text messages she referenced during her testimony.

""I also have relevant facts and evidence in my possession that further clarify statements I made and elucidate the accuracy and nature of statements by witnesses in testimony that came after my committee appearance,"" Wilson-Raybould wrote.

Of all the reasons to give Justin Trudeau a pass on the SNC-Lavalin affair, the one the Liberals and their supporters seem most confident of is the existence of Andrew Scheer.

It’s pretty clear, at this point, that Justin Trudeau and his staff put pressure on the top law enforcement officer in the country to try to affect her decision about publicly prosecuting a large engineering company.

The Liberals are trying to suggest that it’s all a big misunderstanding and that the attorney general misinterpreted some everyday talk about this big issue. We’re all friends here, they say. Nothing to see here, they say.

And certain portions of the public have been more than ready to lap up whatever excuse the Liberals come up with because they are terrified of the thought of Andrew Scheer as prime minister.

Of course, Andrew Scheer’s existence is as relevant as my kid’s conjunctivitis to whether Trudeau acted wrongly or rightly.

If he was wrong, he was wrong even if you don’t want to vote for Scheer (or Singh or Bernier).

But what do you do, when everybody is due a thrashing? Holding your nose at the ballot box is a cliché because we accept that sometimes there is no great option.

If we should electorally punish those who do the wrong thing for political reasons, should we not also punish those who choose not to do the right things for political reasons?

One of the reasons people are so uncomfortable with Scheer is because of his and his party’s rhetoric over the past couple years on the topic of immigration, the border and other Trumpy topics.

Among all the many topics they can choose from, the Conservatives have been loudest about issues that, perhaps unsurprisingly, roil up the relatively tiny portion of Canadians who love to bash out angry caps-locked comments on Facebook.

To keep those folks from fleeing to whatever Maxime Bernier is doing, the Conservatives have railed against a tepid condemnation of Islamophobia and given voice to those fearmongering about a similarly bland United Nations migration agreement that will have not a whit of impact on Canadian policy.

There is little in Scheer’s background to suggest he is not a typical middle-of-the-road Canadian Conservative likely to continue with typically unoffensive Conservative immigration policy. He says the right things when pushed, and needs the votes of the huge number of Canadians who prize this country’s reputation for tolerance.

But recently, Scheer seems to have decided that the best political move is to avoid confronting those people who say Muslim immigrants are to be feared, not welcomed.

As a conservative, Scheer has credibility with those who detest Trudeau and are irrationally afraid of Muslims. At a town hall, John McCain famously defended Barack Obama as a good man, even as he strove to defeat him at the ballot box.

Scheer, similarly, has a chance – one that isn’t open to others – to try to de-radicalize a fearful segment of voters, while making it clear that a change in government won’t alter how welcoming Canada is to Muslims. He could forcefully and repeatedly try to reach that segment of the population and convince them that while he thinks policies should be changed, immigration does not pose a safety risk to Canadians.

He has not yet done so, but it’s still not too late.

Making decisions for political reasons is often, and thankfully, the worst political move of all.

Sometimes it’s best to just do the right thing and sleep well at night.

She will take over from Glen Hansman when his three-year term comes to an end on June 30.

Mooring has been a Vice President of the BCTF for the last six years. As well, she is currently serving as one of the federation’s lead negotiators in this round of provincial collective bargaining. Prior to moving to Vancouver in 2013, when she first became a BCTF Vice President, Teri served for five years as president of her local union, the Quesnel District Teachers’ Association. She came to that position thoroughly grounded in the classroom, with 20 years of experience as a Grade 6–7 teacher.

Teri’s hometown is Quesnel and she is very proud of her background growing up, working, and raising her family in a resource-based community. As a teenager and young adult, she worked at Cariboo Pulp and Paper in Quesnel where her father was the local union president. Her two adult children now live in Dawson Creek, and she has two granddaughters.

Teri first got involved in the union movement at home and in the pulp mill. Family discussions around the kitchen table were often about politics. In 1988, when she was just starting her teaching career, teachers in Quesnel and across BC first unionized. She was a young staff representative when Quesnel teachers negotiated their first collective agreement.

Teri first ran for a seat on the provincial BCTF Executive Committee with the goal of increasing the voice and presence of central and northern BC teachers.

""For people who are looking towards that election they should assume that they will get more of what they decided to hire us for in 2015 — a focus on people, a focus on investing in our collective future.""

Morneau also continued to make the case for more spending, saying now is ""exactly the wrong time"" to balance the budget quickly as the federal Tories believe.

He said to do so would bring higher unemployment and bigger economic problems.

Morneau said the Liberal government's goal is to spend while reducing the amount of debt as a result of a growing economy.

""We have the best balance sheet among G7 countries,"" he said. ""We are less than half the debt as a function of our GDP than the average among other countries in the G7, and we've reduced that debt as a function of our economy every single year. And we are going to keep doing it.""

The budget tabled on Tuesday projected a deficit of $19.8 billion in 2019-20.

Morneau said the budget is part of meeting many of the economic and social challenges that are evident in countries such as France, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

He said Canada faces challenges similar to its allies around making sure the economy works for everyone, while the immigration system also works the way it is intended to.

""But we have a lot of good fortune in this country that means that we are in a better position than many other places,"" he said.

Still, Morneau said he worries about things such as high household debt and the challenge of dealing with the country's aging demographic.

""We need to make sure we have as many people as possible getting success from our economy,"" he said.

To that end, Morneau highlighted several budget measures including preparing students for the job market through so-called integrated learning initiatives.

""Any time you achieve anything, there are so many people that made it possible. You never do it alone.""

He will enter the Commons on a busy week that includes a federal budget and continuing drama around the SNC-Lavalin affair.

He also spoke about the mosque attacks in New Zealand that left 50 people dead, saying it's time to tear down the root causes of hate, not just denounce the actions. He called for an end to policies and language that treat people as less than human.

Singh says his strategy in the House is to push for more affordable housing, an environmentally responsible economy, reconciliation with Indigenous peoples and better healthcare.

He says he'll treat his role as rooted in the Punjabi translation of the word 'leader,' which translates roughly into English as ""the one who serves.""

TORONTO -- NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is set to release a memoir, ""Love & Courage,"" in the lead-up to the federal election.

OTTAWA -- Nearly 18 months after taking over the leadership of the federal New Democrats, Jagmeet Singh made his long-awaited parliamentary debut Monday as he became the first visible minority to lead a federal political party in the House of Commons.

Escorted into the chamber by his NDP lieutenants, Singh waved to supporters in the public gallery before claiming the seat he won in last month's byelection in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South.

That byelection -- made possible by the departure of former Burnaby MP Kennedy Stewart -- ended a 17-month exile of sorts for Singh, whose lack of a seat in the Commons made doing his job as leader that much more difficult.

Singh used his first question as leader to press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the issue of housing, citing a mother from his riding who bought a home she can no longer afford and whose children are losing hope about their futures.

""The prime minister is telling families like theirs to wait for help,"" Singh said. ""I believe better is possible. Will the government commit to building half a million affordable homes?""

Trudeau did no such thing, instead congratulating the NDP leader, welcoming him to the House and urging his party to support Liberal government efforts to reduce child poverty.

By winning a seat in the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South, Jagmeet Singh becomes the first visible minority leader of a federal political party in this country’s history. He did so in the face of withering critiques, notably from former NDP leader Thomas Mulcair, as to his prospects and abilities, as well as a dominant narrative that suggested the Liberal Party of Canada was quickly usurping the NDP as Canada’s leading progressive voice. We are better as a country with Jagmeet Singh in Parliament.

Now the bad news. Though he is now leader of a political party with significant representation in Quebec, Singh soon wouldn’t be allowed to guard prisoners, police the streets, serve as a judge — or even teach schoolchildren in the province. That’s because the provincial government plans on banning religious symbols from the bodies of certain civil servants, teachers included, in the name of secularism.

And were Singh to show up at the National Assembly to protest the forthcoming legislation, he wouldn’t be allowed in. Unlike Canadian Parliament, the National Assembly still considers the kirpan, the ceremonial dagger worn by many practising Sikh men, to be a dangerous weapon. He wouldn’t make it past the X-ray machines.

I bring all of this up not to relive the long and often tiresome debate about the place and space allowed religious minorities in Quebec, but rather to illustrate the uniquely challenging political context Singh now finds himself in the very province that helped launch the NDP’s rebirth eight years ago.

In a few months’ time, Singh will be tasked with campaigning in a province that overwhelmingly supports the above-mentioned legislation. It has the potential to be a jarring spectacle. Policy-wise, the NDP under Singh, an unabashedly progressive counterpoint to Thomas Mulcair’s Liberalesque leadership, is the stuff of dreams to the province’s centre-left electorate. Yet it is tough not to see the party’s sudden and inherent disadvantage: its leader happens to be a brown guy in a turban.

Quebec’s political class is obsessed with identity issues like immigration, which took up an outsized proportion of the oxygen during the last provincial election, according to Influence Communication, a Quebec-based media analysis firm. For this you can at once point to history (francophone Quebecers’ collective and existential worry about the survival of their language and culture) and blame politicians for exploiting this worry for political gain.

This tinder is regularly turned to flame by way of certain columnists — almost all of whom are from the Journal de Montréal — who tend to portray Quebec’s religious minorities as an invading horde bent on undermining Quebec’s proudly secular society.

The end result is a zealous rejection of conspicuous religiosity. Consider how some 61 per cent of Quebecers, far and away the largest percentage of respondents in the country, say the wearing of the turban or other religious symbol by teachers is “unacceptable,” according to a national Léger Marketing poll published last December. Never mind that at least three teachers’ unions have said the government’s proposed ban is patently unworkable. The decade-long politicization of the issue has ensured gut feeling, not cold logic, rules the day.

Singh is about to step into this politically perilous breach, his religion conspicuously displayed. To be fair, he has a lot going for him. He’s good on TV and great on the stage — a necessity in the Trudeau age of campaigning. Most important, his French is excellent. And on the island of Montreal, at least, he has a multicultural beachhead where his appearance is an advantage, or at least less of a disadvantage.

But beyond our fair city? I worry we aren’t yet ready for a leader like Jagmeet Singh. I can only hope I’m proven wrong.

Check out Jagmeet’s first question and what Canadians are saying about this exciting and historic day!

Jagmeet Singh was sworn in to the House of Commons as Burnaby South’s newest MP on Sunday, March 17! Surrounded by family, friends, and our NDP Team, Jagmeet became the first racialized leader of a Canadian political party to be sworn in to the House.

People across the country watched as Jagmeet took his seat in the House and aksed his first question on Monday, March 18. He talked about the people he’s met who are struggling with the skyrocketing cost of housing – worried about how they’ll be able to make rent, pay their mortgage, or whether their kids and grandkids will ever be able to own a home.

He pressed Trudeau on refusing to address the housing crisis – and asked him to commit to half a million new units of affordable housing.

Jagmeet is in the House to fight for us. While Trudeau’s Liberal government keeps siding with their rich friends, Jagmeet and our NDP team are pushing for the solutions everyday people need now.

People across the country supported Jagmeet online, using #JagmeetintheHouse to share their excitement and hopes for the future. Here’s what people had to say:

Singh used his first speaking opportunity during question period to press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on housing.

He repeated a story he told many times during the byelection campaign, saying he met a teacher forced to live in her parents’ basement due to Burnaby’s unaffordable housing market.

Singh asked Trudeau whether the Liberal government would commit to building 500,000 new homes, alluding to the NDP’s proposal to do so over the next 10 years.

Trudeau welcomed Singh to Ottawa and said he hopes New Democrats back the Liberal government’s ongoing efforts to create affordable housing.

Singh also joined many Conservative MPs in calling on Trudeau to allow former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to testify in front of the justice committee for a second time to address the the SNC-Lavalin affair. He also repeated his call for the Liberals to launch a public inquiry into the case.

“For Canadians watching at home, this doesn't look any different than when the Conservatives were in power – special access for powerful corporations, a closed door for everyone else,” he said. “Why is this prime minister so afraid to launch a public inquiry?”

Liberal house leader Bardish Chagger deflected the calls from the opposition parties, saying Wilson-Raybould already had her chance to speak.

Singh also addressed the mosque shooting that killed 50 and injured dozens more in New Zealand last week. An avowed white supremacist has been charged in the massacre.

“That attack reverberated across the world. Though it happened in Christchurch, New Zealand, the pain impacted all of us,” he said. “It hurts here in Canada, where Muslim brothers and sisters – our friends, our close ones, people who work with us – are thinking about their own loved ones when they go to masjid, when they go to prayer, and how much it hurts to know that you're being targeted for being who you are.”

Singh said the attack was borne of white supremacist and Islamophobic hatred.

“Hate knows no bounds. Once hate is allowed to grow, it consumes all in its path. Hate is like a fire – once it's allowed to grow, it spreads, consuming everything,” he said.

Singh joined Trudeau and Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer in condemning Islamophobia and other forms of bigotry, but said Canada must go further by addressing the root causes of such hatred.

When people refer to migrants as “illegal” or “barbaric,” they dehumanize them, he said.

“The purpose is to dehumanize and then, once you dehumanize, it leads to fear and hatred,” he said. “Let's be conscious of the words we use so we never create any ground for hate to grow.”

Singh made the comments after Trudeau and Scheer made their own statements condemning the attack and expressing solidarity with the people of New Zealand and Muslims around the world.

Trudeau addressed the various forms of prejudice and discrimination he said lead to terrorist attacks around the world.

“It's anti-Semitic, Islamophobic, anti-black, anti-Indigenous, misogynistic, homophobic – the list goes on and on,” he said. “This rhetoric is dangerous, hateful and vile; it lives and festers online, spilling out into the real world with deadly consequences.”

Scheer expressed similar sentiments.

He said the attack in New Zealand was reminiscent of the 2017 attack on a Quebec City mosque in which a white nationalist killed six men in their place of worship.

Scheer called for unity among political parties in condemning hateful ideologies.

“I say to my colleagues in all parties, we certainly have our differences on important policy matters that deserve rigorous and spirited debate, but on this – the very compassion and humanity of our Canadian society – there can be no debate,” he said.","Jagmeet Singh presses on housing, calls out dehumanizing language in Parliamentary debut",Burnaby Now,https://www.burnabynow.com/news/jagmeet-singh-presses-on-housing-calls-out-dehumanizing-language-in-parliamentary-debut-1.23667389

On March 17, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh was officially sworn in as the MP for Burnaby South. The election of the first racialized federal party leader to Parliament is of great historic significance.

Wanting to do my part, I travelled to BC to campaign for Singh. I wanted to make a positive contribution to the effort in light of the gloomy press coverage (some predicting Singh’s demise) that was hanging over the campaign like a dark cloud.

I was eager to know what people on the ground were thinking and feeling about the by-election. It quickly became apparent that young people engineering Singh’s operation were enthusiastic, dedicated and curious.

There were also some of the more seasoned organizers. One who flew in from Brampton proudly told me that he just got accepted into law school at the University of Ottawa, my alma mater. I asked how it felt. He said it paled in comparison to the idea of Singh winning the riding. People were nervous as they confronted the weight of history.

This was no casual by-election. The media, taking the attitude of “do or die,” reminded us of that every day. This was an election that would either usher in a new era in Canadian politics or turn back the clock for under-represented communities.

So when the polls closed and the results finally poured in, the scene was electric at the Hilton Vancouver Hotel. We did it. The moment to shift the national discourse into an unapologetically progressive direction is here.

There is a real opportunity for an NDP breakthrough in this volatile political climate, but it must articulate a bold and truly transformative agenda on climate change, reconciliation with Indigenous peoples, electoral reform, criminal justice reform, pharmacare and the housing crisis. The plight of working-class people across this country demands aggressive no-nonsense representation.

In Burnaby, Singh was able to appeal to a multiracial working class constituency with a left-populist campaign that focused on the fundamental unfairness of the economy and issues of housing affordability. Throughout his political career, he has demonstrated an ability to appeal to marginalized communities that represent a growing share of the electorate.

Many activists on Singh’s campaign were inspired by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other left-wing women of colour recently elected to congress in the U.S. who are challenging conventional wisdom and calling for a Green New Deal, free tuition, medicare for all and immigration reform.

There are lessons to be learned here from this new group of political leaders south of the border. It’s time for a new generation of progressive activists in this country, ones who boldly stand for social and economic justice and reflect the diversity of modern Canada, to step forward.

He is the first leader of a major political party in Canada’s parliament who is not white, a distinction that Singh acknowledged after question period as something he never could have imagined when he was growing up.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is introduced by NDP MP Peter Julian and Ruth Ellen Brosseau as he takes his place in the House of Commons on March 18, 2019 in Ottawa. ( Adrian Wyld / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

“It’s an incredible honour. I’m humbled. I’m blown away by the immensity of the role I’ve been granted,” said Singh, a former criminal lawyer who was born in Scarborough and is the son of immigrants from India. “If I could have in some way broken down barriers for people, I would have done something good with my life,” he said. Singh’s debut in the Commons is a result of his Feb. 25 byelection victory in Burnaby South, the British Columbia riding he moved to last year in a bid to win his first federal seat. He used the occasion to press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the government’s affordable housing plan, demanded the Liberals increase carbon price charges on heavy polluters, and repeat his party’s call for a public inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin affair.

For Singh, the moment comes at a challenging time for the party he leads. Fundraising has sunk from $18 million in 2015 to around $5 million last year, while the party has taken out a $12 million mortgage on its national headquarters, the Jack Layton Building. Meanwhile, about a quarter of the party’s caucus has resigned their seats or announced they won’t run in the general election this fall, including veterans like B.C. MPs Nathan Cullen and Murray Rankin, Quebec MPs Hélène Laverdière and Romeo Saganash, and Ontario stalwarts David Christopherson and Irene Mathyssen.

Singh himself has received negative attention for communications stumbles, including occasions when he seemed unaware of his own party’s position on issues like the Liberal government gun legislation and the question of whether Canada was right to recognize Venezuela’s opposition leader as the country’s legitimate president. In the months leading up to his byelection run, as Singh toured the country in a series of “JagMeet and Greet” events, many NDP insiders argued he needed a seat in the Commons to change the narrative that had settled in over the first year of his leadership. On Monday, Singh finally appeared in the House, tapping the breast of his suit and waving to his family as he was escorted to take his seat at the head of the NDP benches. His younger brother, Ontario MPP Gurratan Singh, said afterwards that it was “an historic and momentous occasion for all Canadians.” He looked on from the public gallery with Singh’s wife and parents, and wore a yellow turban that matched his brother’s on the Commons floor below. “For people who don’t see themselves represented in politics, today was a milestone,” he said. Singh spent much of question period listening intently. During the opening exchange between Trudeau and Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, he pressed his earpiece against his head and took notes. Later, after he had asked his own questions, Singh got up and left for a few minutes. When he returned, he briefly walked down the wrong aisle and had to double back to get to his seat. He has seven months to learn where it is before he has to win it again. Alex Ballingall is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics. Follow him on Twitter: @aballinga

This is an issue the NDP leader pursued throughout his recent byelection campaign in Burnaby South and it is close to the heart of many urban voters, in particular in Vancouver and Toronto.

Those two electoral markets are central to New Democrat prospects in next fall’s federal campaign.

Justin Trudeau responded with a boilerplate statement about helping the middle class. He was probably happy to get a brief respite from the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Singh waited more than a year for his opportunity to question Trudeau face-to-face about Canada’s current housing situation.

But he may have to wait a few more months – until the leaders debates of the upcoming election campaign – for a more serious policy conversation with his Liberal rival.

The NDP leader’s belated entry in the Commons comes at a time when the current Parliament is on its last legs - with its most productive days behind it.

Tuesday’s budget – the last of Trudeau’s ongoing term in office – marks the non-official start of the election campaign. Tuesday may also be the last semi-normal day in the Commons for the foreseeable future.

In an effort to keep the SNC-Lavalin affair in the forefront and force the Liberal majority on the justice committee to agree to invite former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould for a second appearance, the Conservatives are gearing up for a procedural trench war with the government.

Even absent opposition obstruction, the SNC-Lavalin affair has already taken a toll on the government’s agenda.

One of the reasons why omnibus budget bills have become such a central part of the federal governance apparatus is because they allow policy initiatives to clear legislative hurdles over a matter of months rather than over a year or more.

But the SNC-Lavalin affair – and the news that a budget bill was used to introduce in the Criminal Code remediation agreements of the kind sought by the engineering giant to eliminate the risk of a criminal conviction – has made the practice of squeezing a host of non-budgetary stuff in bloated finance bills politically toxic.

As a result, some of the measures the government had hoped to showcase in its campaign list of delivered items will now likely end up in the Liberal post-election catalogue.

Trudeau and his team are not the only ones who are having to temper their hopes for a productive parliamentary spring.

So might Singh.

The SNC-Lavalin has solidified the notion that the next election will boil down to a duel for government between the Liberals and the Conservatives.

It is a perception that the NDP’s role as the second opposition party tends to reinforce. Jack Layton in 2011 and Trudeau in the last election both had to wait to be on the campaign trail to level the playing field to their advantage.

Until Monday, Joe Clark had been the last opposition leader to make his entry in the Commons in the dying days of a parliament. The next-to-last leader of the Progressive Conservative party waited almost four years before securing a federal seat in the summer of 2000.

On the day Clark finally took his seat, three Quebec MPs initially elected as Progressive Conservatives crossed the floor to the Liberals.

Jean Chrétien called a general election a little more than a month after that show of strength. It was the last campaign the Tories fought under their banner.

Trudeau did not have as unpleasant a surprise in store for Singh’s first full day as an MP. But the NDP does face an existential threat next fall as the Tories did at the time of Clark’s second coming to the House of Commons almost two decades ago.

Like Clark, who had to fend off the Liberals and the Canadian Alliance, Singh is threatened on two fronts. As the result of a string of provincial breakthroughs, the Green party is poised to enter the federal campaign with the momentum the NDP so lacks.

In last month’s Outremont byelection, Elizabeth May’s candidate finished ahead of the Bloc Québécois and the Conservatives. In the province that currently accounts for the largest number of New Democrat MPs, the most recent Léger Marketing poll pegged the Green party at nine per cent, two points ahead of the NDP.

The stars could be aligning for voters to rediscover May at the expense of her NDP rival next fall.

As if crossing swords with the Liberals across the aisle was not enough, Singh will have to spend the coming months looking over his shoulder.

The arrival of the turbaned leader into the house on Monday, cheered by all members, coincided with the induction of a senior woman member into Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's cabinet.

Singh, 40, the leader of the New Democratic Party, placed his hand over his heart as he walked into the House of Commons, the lower of house of Parliament, before the daily question period.

He was elected in federal by-elections held on February 25.

Singh's first words as an elected lawmaker were about last week's terrorist attack on two mosques in New Zealand.

""I want to begin by expressing our solidarity with the people of New Zealand who are mourning the attack on Muslim brothers and sisters... in Christchurch,"" he said.

About 50 people were killed last week in the Pacific country's worst-ever mass shooting.

He then launched his first question about housing in Burnaby-South.

""I met a mom in Burnaby. She bought a home, but cannot afford to live there anymore. Her daughter has a good job, but only gets by because she lives in the basement. Her son does not see a future. Like too many Canadians, he has lost all hope,"" Singh said.

""However, the prime minister is telling families like theirs to wait for help. I believe that better is possible. Will the government commit to building half a million new affordable homes?"" he said.

Prime Minister Trudeau responded by congratulating Singh for his entry into the Commons, before touting the government's record on fighting poverty.

Singh's remarks echoed the mood of the House on a crucial day when the prime minister beleaguered by the resignations of his two key cabinet colleagues.

Speculations are rife that the last budget of the Trudeau government with an eye on the general elections in October is expected to have several attractions for the middle class.","Indian-origin Jagmeet Singh creates history, becomes first non-white leader of Canada Parliament",Business Today,https://www.businesstoday.in/current/world/indian-origin-jagmeet-singh-creates-history--becomes-first-non-white-leader-of-canada-parliament/story/329428.html

Raising questions about affordable housing, climate change and the SNC-Lavalin affair, Singh became the first racialized leader in Canada to take a seat in the Commons.

""I think about growing up as a kid I would never imagine someone that looked like me running to become prime minister,"" said @TheJagmeetSingh after taking his seat as an MP and becoming the first racialized party leader in Canada's House of Commons.

Singh placed his hand over his heart and was greeted with a warm ovation from all sides as he walked into the Commons before the daily question period.

Singh took his seat, along with two other candidates elected in federal byelections held on Feb. 25, Liberal Rachel Bendayan and Conservative Scot Davidson.

Singh's first words as an elected MP were about last week's terrorist attack in New Zealand.

""I want to begin by expressing our solidarity with the people of New Zealand who are mourning the attack on Muslim brothers and sisters... in Christ Church,"" Singh said.

He then launched into his first question about housing in his new riding of Burnaby-South.

""I met a mom in Burnaby. She bought a home, but cannot afford to live there anymore. Her daughter has a good job, but only gets by because she lives in the basement. Her son does not see a future. Like too many Canadians, he has lost all hope,"" Singh said.

""However, the prime minister is telling families like theirs to wait for help. I believe that better is possible. Will the government commit to building half a million new affordable homes?""

Trudeau responded by congratulating Singh for his entry into the Commons, before touting the government's record on fighting poverty.

""I hope (Singh) and his party will support the work our government has done to lift hundreds of thousands of children across this country out of poverty,"" Trudeau told the Commons. ""We lowered taxes on the middle class and raised them on the wealthiest one per cent and indeed to end boil water advisories in so many communities across the country with more to do. These are the things we will continue to work on and we look forward to his support in creating a better and fairer Canada for everyone.""

Singh asked three other questions in French and English about climate change, and the recent controversy over the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, which has plunged Trudeau's government into a political crisis.

On climate change, Trudeau said that his government was taking action after previous Liberal and Tory governments had not done so.

""We have put a price on pollution. We have proceeded with a historic plan to protect the ocean, to protect the land,"" Trudeau said in French ""We have made record investments in renewable energy, in greener solutions for our businesses and entrepreneurs.""

The prime minister added that the government would continue its efforts, saying that the only way to protect the environment is to create economic growth at the same time, prompting a rebuke from Singh.

""Environmental leaders don't buy pipelines,"" Singh said.

In his last two questions, Singh pressed Trudeau to launch a public inquiry into allegations that the prime minister had pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin so that the Quebec engineering firm could get a plea deal instead of going through a criminal trial on corruption and fraud charges.

Trudeau, who has suggested that jobs would be at risk at SNC-Lavalin if it is forced to undergo a trial, responded by saying the issue was about the economy. The prime minister said that Canadians have created over 950,000 jobs since his government was first elected in 2015.

""We are of course going to make sure that we continue to maintain the trust and confidence that Canadians have in their institutions and why we are happy to answer all the various questions going on,"" Trudeau said. ""We will continue to stand up for jobs.""

Speaking to reporters outside the Commons, Singh said he felt ""humbled"" and ""blown away"" by the role he has been granted.

""I take that responsibility really seriously and I’m going to use every opportunity I get to make sure that Canadians know I’m on their side,"" he said. ""I’m going to fight for housing, for fighting climate change, make sure Canadians have access to medication. I’m going to make sure I use this role with the weight and responsibility that I feel...

""I think about growing up as a kid I would never imagine someone that looked like me running to become prime minister. That would never be in the world of my imagination. Standing in the chamber today asking a question directly to the prime minister, I think a lot of maybe young people out there who didn’t see themselves reflected might believe that if I could run the country maybe I can do anything. If I could have in some way broken down some barriers for people I would have done something good in my life.""

Sporting a bright yellow turban, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh entered the House of Commons for the first time as an MP Monday to loud cheers.

Singh is the first minority leader in the Commons in Canadian history.

The leader of the New Democrats had been left out of the political theatre of question period and he wasn't able to have an office on Parliament Hill.

Singh won his new Burnaby South seat in a February byelection sparked by the departure of former NDP MP Kennedy Stewart, who ran for mayor of Vancouver.

New Democrats are hoping Singh's presence in the House of Commons will help the party turn the page on a difficult period, marked by challenges with morale and fundraising.

Anyone who followed the 2013 B.C. election or the recently Nanaimo byelection will know that polls can be pretty unreliable.

article continues below

So keep this in mind while reading the results of a Nanos Research poll posted today that has the federal NDP – led by new Burnaby South MP Jagmeet Singh getting a pretty big bump in support.

The latest Nanos federal ballot tracking has the Conservatives at 35.5 per cent, followed by the Liberals at 32.6 per cent, the NDP at 19.9 percent, the BQ at 3.2 per cent, the Greens at 7.7 per cent and the People’s Party of Canada (PPC) at 0.5 per cent.

The NDP for the longest time has been mired at 13 to 14 per cent, with the party also struggling to raise money.

So to have a showing at nearly 20 per cent is to be considered positive news. The CBC’s poll tracker – which aggregates all publicly available polling data – has the NDP at 15.9 per cent.

The bad news for Singh is the other number Nanos had.

Nanos tracking has Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as the preferred choice as PM at 30.3 per cent of Canadians followed by Scheer (27.3%), Singh (8.9%), May (7.2%) and Bernier (2.8%). Twenty-two per cent of Canadians were unsure whom they preferred.

So Singh is way down the list and has a lot of work to do. Things could get better now that he is an MP and gets to speak in the House of Commons. He needs to build his profile and fast because October is getting closer and closer.

Singh is getting huge assists from Trudeau with SNC-Lavalin and Scheer with his blunder after the New Zealand massacre.

Let’s see what he can do with these missteps.

For theNanos poll, the data is based on a dual frame (land + cell-lines) random telephone interviews using live agents of 1,000 Canadians using a four week rolling average of 250 respondents each week, 18 years of age and over. The random sample of 1,000 respondents may be weighted by age and gender using the latest census information for Canada. The interviews are compiled into a four week rolling average of 1,000 interviews, where each week the oldest group of 250 interviews is dropped and a new group of 250 interviews is added.

A random telephone survey of 1,000 Canadians is accurate ±3.1 percentage points, plus or minus, 19 times out of 20.","NDP surges in poll, but Jagmeet Singh's own rating stays in single digits",Burnaby Now,https://www.burnabynow.com/opinion/blogs/ndp-surges-in-poll-but-jagmeet-singh-s-own-rating-stays-in-single-digits-1.23668370

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Wilson-Raybould's testimony underscored his party's calls for an independent inquiry to find out the truth of what happened between the former attorney ...,"OTTAWA — Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called on Justin Trudeau to resign Wednesday, saying former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould's troubling testimony about SNC-Lavalin proved the prime minister has lost the moral authority to govern.

Scheer threw down the gauntlet immediately after a three-hour Commons' justice committee meeting in which Wilson-Raybould said she felt pressure from Trudeau and others to head off a criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.

""Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this country now that Canadians know what he has done,"" Scheer said. ""And that is why I am calling on Mr. Trudeau to do the right thing and to resign.""

But Trudeau quickly rebuffed Scheer's demand as he touted his government's record defending jobs and ""the independence of our judiciary,"" adding Canadians will decide later this year whether to re-elect the Liberals or hand power to the Conservatives.

The back-and-forth marked the latest escalation in what has already been the most explosive political challenge facing the Trudeau government during its more than three years in power. The Official Opposition very rarely calls on a prime minister to resign.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Wilson-Raybould's testimony underscored his party's calls for an independent inquiry to find out the truth of what happened between the former attorney general and members of Trudeau's inner circle.

During her testimony, Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she withstood four months of relentless pressure to reverse a decision not to make a plea-bargain-type deal with SNC-Lavalin. She said the pressure came from Trudeau and other senior Liberal officials.

Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she believed the pressure, which also included ""veiled threats"" from the country's top civil servant, Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick, was inappropriate. But she added she did not think it was illegal.

Scheer nonetheless demanded Trudeau's resignation and called for the RCMP to launch a criminal investigation into what the Liberal government did to help SNC-Lavalin, which is facing criminal charges related to allegedly corrupt dealings in Libya.

""Jody Wilson-Raybould tells the story of a prime minister who has lost the moral authority to govern,"" Scheer said.

""A prime minister who allows his partisan, political motivations to overrule his duty to uphold the rule of law. A prime minister who doesn't know where the Liberal Party ends and where the government of Canada begins.""

The Conservative leader also called for Wernick to resign and encouraged the Liberal cabinet, which is scheduled to present a federal budget next month, to find a way to govern the country in a non-partisan way without the prime minister.

Scheer did not say what he would do if Trudeau refused to resign, such as calling a non-confidence vote.

For his part, Singh said Wilson-Raybould's testimony painted a picture of a prime minister and other members of government who were willing to disregard the rule of law and were more interested in helping powerful friends than average Canadians.

While the NDP leader said Trudeau and others may eventually have to step down, he said that determination should come after a public inquiry is held to get the bottom of what really happened.

Trudeau, however, indicated during a Liberal party event in Montreal a short time later that he had no intention of resigning. He rejected Wilson-Raybould's version of events, saying he and his staff ""always acted appropriately and professionally.""

He said Canadians will have ""a very clear choice in a few months"" in the October election about who they want to form government.

""There will be a clear choice to be made between the Liberal Party, this government that ... has consistently stood up for Canadian jobs, consistently defended Canadian jobs while defending our institutions and the independence of our judiciary,"" he said.

""And on the other hand there is a choice of the party that is still very much the party of Stephen Harper. That continues to attack, to divide, to play politics with big issues and (thinks) the best way to create economic growth is still to give advantages to the wealthiest.""

Alberta NDP Leader Rachel Notley is promising to hire nearly 1,000 more teachers this fall if her party returns to power after the April 16 election.

Notley says an additional 15,000 students are projected to be in classrooms when the next school year starts and it’s critical to give them the supports they need.

She says an NDP government would hire 600 teachers and another 400 would come through a $23-million increase in the province’s classroom improvement fund.

The fund is delivered to schools based on student enrolment and is meant to help retain teachers, hire new ones and pay for resources to help students with complex needs.

Notley is also promising that the NDP would spend $1.3-billion to build and upgrade another 70 schools. There would also be money to ensure every new and modernized school came with a playground.

Another $5-million a year would go to replace 100 aging and outdated play areas.

She criticizes her opponent, United Conservative Leader Jason Kenney, for failing to promise to fund enrolment growth. She says that would mean cuts and bigger classrooms.

“Parents need to know when they take their kids to school, they want to know that their child is going to be in a class that’s an appropriate size,” Notley said Thursday.

“(Failing to fund growth) will create chaos and will undermine the quality of education that our kids receive. There’s no need to do that. It’s just the wrong priorities.”

Kenney has said he would keep funding at current levels, and possibly increase it, but would be looking to find savings in administration to get more money to teachers.

The leader of Alberta’s United Conservatives says that, if elected, they would open more beds and expand treatment programs to help people battling drug and opioid addictions.

Jason Kenney says a UCP government would not approve new supervised drug consumption sites without extensive consultations with affected communities.

He also says those sites would ideally be accompanied by treatment services.

Kenney says it’s critical to balance help for users with safe neighbourhoods free of discarded needles and to avoid an increase in drug-related crime.

The opioid plan is part of a broader package of health reforms promised by Kenney in the campaign for the April 16 election.

She didn't have a campaign manager or many volunteers beyond family and friends.

Ganley, who later became Alberta's justice minister, rode a big orange wave that swept her and other New Democrats to power in a massive, historic upset.

In Calgary-Buffalo, her Progressive Conservative opponent Terry Rock spent $92,000 on the race. Ganley shelled out just $3,000 — and won. That works out to roughly 67 cents per vote.

""At the outset, 21 days out, no one really expected me to win,"" says Ganley, who's now running in Calgary-Mountain View. ""As things went along, that started to change.""

The NDP won in the traditionally conservative fortress of Calgary on a shoestring budget in 2015, clinching 15 of 25 seats, despite being outspent in every riding. Rachel Notley's popularity soared as voters soured on the PC dynasty that was besieged by claims of arrogance and entitlement.

'A different feeling'

This time around, New Democrats say they're better organized with a deeper war chest to wage a more meaningful contest on the ground in Calgary. Ganley now has a campaign manager, headquarters, funding and a small army of volunteers.

""There's a different feeling as well,"" she says. ""There's a lot of momentum. People are coming through the doors volunteering their money, their time to take signs, whereas last time, we didn't have that going on.""

But Jason Luan, a former Progressive Conservative who lost his seat to the orange wave in Calgary-Hawkwood in 2015, says he's seeing no evidence things have changed as he campaigns for the UCP in the redrawn riding of Calgary-Foothills.

It's déjà vu , says UCP candidate

Luan says he hasn't seen much of a presence from the local NDP candidate, while campaign materials emphasize Notley as the brand, rather than the party.

""It's like they're wanting to redo what they did last round, betting everything on this one person, Rachel Notley,"" he says.

Hit the drop-down menu to find out how much each of the three largest parties spent in your riding in 2015.

Luan's defeat in 2015 was a striking upset in Calgary. He was an incumbent MLA who spent $73,600 defending his seat, but he was toppled by the NDP's then-21-year-old Michael Connolly, who spent $840 in cash and in-kind donations. Connolly is not running this time.

Brandy Payne, another New Democrat who is not running again, had a $740 budget when she defeated one-time Tory cabinet minister Jonathan Denis, who marshalled a war chest of more than $85,000.

Like many other PCs in 2015, Denis had fundraised on his own, having amassed $30,000 from individuals and corporations who contributed more than $250 each.

Not a single NDP candidate in Calgary had raised any money. All of their financing came from the party.

Dirks outspent all Calgary NDP candidates combined

According to campaign filings, NDP candidates in Calgary spent a total of $135,800 in 2015, which is less than what the PCs spent on a single riding — Gordon Dirks shelled out $157,000 on his unsuccessful bid for Calgary-Elbow.

In total, PC candidates in Calgary spent a stunning $1.8 million.

David Stewart, a political science professor at the University of Calgary, says the NDP became better at fundraising in government, while also making it more difficult for opponents to raise and spend money. The Notley government banned corporate donations, which the PCs traditionally relied upon, and limited candidate spending in each riding to $50,000, a cap many PCs exceeded in 2015.

The New Democrats say things have also changed on the ground. They say that across the province, not just in Calgary, they've already quadrupled the number of volunteers they had at the end of the 2015 race and expect to keep growing.

Political analysts say the April 16 vote will be fought largely on the leadership and policies of UCP Leader Jason Kenney and NDP Leader Rachel Notley, which makes local riding contests less important. (Canadian Press)

Similarly, they say they had 21,000 campaign signs in place across Alberta as of Wednesday, compared with 21,200 signs that were up at the end of the 2015 contest.

""In terms of organization, it's night and day,"" says NDP incumbent Craig Coolahan, who clinched the Calgary-Klein seat in 2015 after spending less than $3,800, compared with PC Kyle Fawcett's nearly $68,000.

'Didn't matter last time'

Stewart says so-called ground game — door-to-door canvassing, identifying supporters and getting them to the polls — can make a difference in close races, not in lopsided ones.

But he predicts the April 16 vote will be based largely on the differences in policy and leadership between the NDP and UCP, which means ""the local candidate races are going to rank a very distant third.""

Barry Cooper, who also teaches political science at the University of Calgary, says he doubts the New Democrats will be able to harness a stronger organization on the ground to secure the same level of voter support they received in 2015.

Cooper says the NDP is defending a record in government while facing very different conservative opponents. He says it means each candidate's level of spending may not be enough to sway the vote.

""We know Fort McMurray needs a second route out, and we will get it done,"" Notley said at a news conference Wednesday at Shell Place recreation centre in downtown Fort McMurray.

""It won't solve all the problems that the fire raised,"" she said, referring to the May 2016 wildfire that forced more than 90,000 residents from their homes.

""But it will solve a problem. And it will help families sleep a little better at night.""

Highway 63 is the only route out of the northern Alberta city.

The lack of highway access became a public safety issue during the 2016 wildfires when panicked residents fled as fires encroached on the city.

The Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, which includes the city of Fort McMurray, has endorsed the $1.5-billion East Clearwater Highway project as the preferred option. The route would go east of the city and would eventually connect with Highway 63.

The ring road would connect northern communities such as Fort McKay, oilsands sites and Fort McMurray itself to Highway 881, offering a second escape route if Highway 63 was ever blocked, as it was during the May 2016 wildfire.

Notley said she plans to look at the proposal and other options as part of a consultation process that would include Indigenous people, municipalities, industry and other residents.

In May 2017, a year after the fire, the government committed $5 million to initial design and planning.

Notley also announced a plan to add 3,500 kilometres to the Alberta High Load Corridor, bringing the total to 10,000. The six-year expansion project would cost $1.35 billion. It would address gaps, Notley said, that currently force industry to make detours that can add as much as 200 kilometres to a trip, and cost an extra $10,000.

Notley unveiled her party’s education platform Thursday morning in the kitchen of a family in northeast Calgary. Much of it rests on or expands the NDP’s previous commitments to increase educational resources, especially given the 15,000 new students who are expected to walk into Alberta’s classrooms next fall.

Notley characterized the previously released United Conservative Party education platform as inadequate or even “detrimental” to Alberta students, noting the UCP commitment to replace the School Act — which includes an NDP bill that strengthens protections for gay-straight alliances. “Rather than putting our kids’ future at risk, we have a plan to invest in every single child,” Notley said. “Our plan will invest in our schools and support Alberta’s young workers, strengthening and modernizing our education system.” It includes plans to hire 600 new teachers and support staff to keep pace with Alberta’s growing student population, and boost the Classroom Improvement Fund to $100 million from $77 million — an initiative the NDP said would pay for another 400 teachers and support staff. Under the UCP education platform, unveiled Monday, the party said it would maintain or improve educational spending, but did not give precise figures.

UCP Leader Jason Kenney said his party, if elected into government, would replace the School Act — which includes Bill 24 — with the currently unproclaimed Education Act. While it does include language directing school administration to accept student clubs, including GSAs, critics note it doesn’t contain the same safeguards mandated by Bill 24. Notley described the move as “picking on gay students.” “GSAs are too important. They save lives. Students need them, teachers support them, and we’re going to keep defending each and every student,” Notley said.

Investments in building or improving 244 Alberta schools has been a frequent talking point of the NDP. But the party’s education platform also includes plans to build and upgrade an additional 70 schools to support the province’s population growth, and allocate $250,000 to fund a playground at each new or modernized school. The platform also promises $5 million per year to help older schools and neighbourhoods replace hundreds of aging playgrounds. An ongoing review of Alberta’s curriculum would also continue under an NDP government. Notley said the current one is roughly 30 years old and needs to be updated. By contrast, Kenney has promised he’d suspend the review pending further consultation with parents and educational experts. “That is what will undermine the quality of education received by our kids,” Notley said of a review suspension. The NDP also intends to create new provincial courses in Somali, Punjabi, Cantonese, and Filipino, which it says will “ensure more students are prepared for Alberta’s future in a global marketplace,” citing the success of its Arabic language program. Lacking from the NDP’s education platform was any specific mention of initiatives to support Alberta’s Indigenous students. Notley said her government has already made a number of significant investments in education for Indigenous students, including consultations with the federal government to ensure education in First Nation communities is appropriately funded, as well as the addition of more Indigenous-related material in the new curriculum. “It absolutely remains front and centre, but we’ve actually been working very closely with First Nations since Day 1,” Notley said.

Toronto’s Mike Layton is bringing a motion to city council this week asking for a report on the cost implications of climate change for Toronto and “any legal avenues to pursue compensation for those costs from major greenhouse gas emitters.”

The NDP’s Rachel Notley, left, and the UCP’s Jason Kenney, right, both issued statements Tuesday criticizing Toronto city councillor Mike Layton, centre, for proposing a motion to examine legal action against major oil companies over climate-change related costs. ( Jason Franson / Rene Johnston / David Rossiter / The Canadian Press / The Toronto Star )

A week into Alberta’s 2019 provincial race, that didn’t sit well with Alberta’s United Conservatives or New Democrats, and both parties have put Layton in their crosshairs. The motion — which still has yet to even be discussed in Toronto, and could end up instead being referred to a committee — says the city should consider taking major oil companies to court over climate-change related costs Toronto bears. “Just like tobacco companies knew their products caused cancer, but hid that information from the public, major oil companies have known for decades that their products would cause climate change,” the motion reads. “As tobacco companies have been held accountable for the health-care costs associated with smoking, big polluters should have to pay their fair share for building a climate-safe city.”

Kenney slammed the motion as “hypocritical and divisive,” describing it as an open attack on Canadian energy producers. He said it harms “national unity” and even raised the spectre of how he sees it stoking Alberta separatist sentiment. “The adoption of Councillor Layton’s motion would be seen by most Albertans as another example of a campaign to attack and vilify the essential role that our province plays in the Canadian economy,” Kenney said. “It would pour yet more gas on the flames of the growing national unity challenge.”

Article Continued Below

Hours later, NDP Leader Rachel Notley also condemned Layton’s motion, writing on Twitter that “it’s clear Mike Layton is out of touch with Canada’s economic reality and doesn’t see Alberta’s contributions because he has tunnel vision.”

She added that Layton would be “wise to read the federal budget and see exactly what Alberta contributes to Confederation.” Layton wrote on Twitter Tuesday that his motion has been “taken out of context,” adding that he’s simply asking for a report on climate-change costs and options for recouping them. A spokesperson from his office said he was not available for an interview Wednesday, as Toronto city council is in an all-day meeting. But Layton is the son of former federal NDP leader Jack Layton, and Mount Royal University political scientist Duane Bratt said that connection to the climate-change motion serves up a “gift to Kenney.” “They couldn’t have asked for someone better than Mike Layton to go after,” he said. “(The UCP) is trying to link that he speaks for Rachel Notley,” he said. “For them, this is proof that if Rachel Notley ever gets elected again, she will completely shut down the oil and gas sector in this province.”

Kenney began talking about strategies to “fight back” on behalf of Alberta’s energy industry last October, vowing to create a “war room” to issue real-time responses to “lies and myths” about the province’s oil and gas producers. He officially announced the initiative, with a $30-million budget, as part of his election platform just last week. Bratt said that even though Layton’s motion has yet to even hit the floor in council chambers three provinces away, it opens a campaigning opportunity for Kenney. “It’s part of (the UCP) platform to fight the rest of the country, and this just allows them to demonstrate how they’d do it. We’re seeing this play out in real time — how that would work.” Similar climate-change motions from municipalities in British Columbia have raised Calgary city council’s hackles in the past. When city council in Victoria, B.C., voted earlier this year to ask the Union of BC Municipalities to explore legal action against international oil companies, Calgary councillors were critical — Councillor Ward Sutherland issued an “Alberta challenge” to Victoria politicians, extending an offer for them to come to Alberta for a tour led by advocacy group Canada Action to highlight the ethical and environmental standards of Alberta’s energy industry. Victoria Mayor Lisa Helps ended up taking Sutherland’s offer. She’ll visit a project south of Fort McMurray in the spring. Last year, Calgary city council unanimously passed a motion declaring formal support for Alberta’s energy industry and the construction of new pipelines. Shortly before that, councillors also used their own office budgets to pay a PR consultant to produce videos and a social media campaign in support of oil and gas in the province. Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi also wrote a letter to Victoria city council in January to say Calgary stands with Alberta’s energy industry. Councillor Sean Chu made the request for that letter, and he said Wednesday that he plans to ask for the same in response to the Toronto motion, calling it “the stupidest thing.” “I would like to invite Councillor Layton to ride his bicycle to Calgary and see how we do business here,” he said.

The party also committed Thursday to fully funding growing student enrolment each year at an estimated cost of $72 million. It would add an estimated 600 new teaching and support staff positions for the 15,000 more students expected to arrive in Alberta schools by the fall.

“Notley’s plan for the next four years invests in education and supports Alberta’s young learners by strengthening and modernizing Alberta’s education system,” a Thursday news release from the NDP said. “Our kids deserve nothing less.”

United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney has said he will “maintain or increase” education funding, but has not provided specifics. His plan puts students’ education at risk, Notley said.

Notley announced the party’s plans sitting with supporters around a kitchen table in Calgary Thursday.

An NDP government would also make permanent and increase the classroom improvement fund (CIF) to $100 million a year from the current $77 million, a party news release said. It should add another 400 teachers and support staff to Alberta classrooms, Notley said. Schools and boards decide what staff to hire with their provincial funding allotments.

The classroom improvement fund was introduced in 2017 as part of a collective agreement with teachers. School boards must spend it on classroom personnel and to help students with complex needs and those learning English.

Notley said Thursday the NDP would next week release more detailed financing information for the party’s platform.

New language programs

In addition to a new K-12 Filipino language curriculum the NDP has already committed to introduce by 2020, the party pledged to introduce new provincial courses in Punjabi, Somali and Cantonese. The government already offers K-12 courses in 26 languages other than English and French. Although some schools may already offer classes in Filipino or Punjabi, school boards must develop and pay for the courses on their own.

The NDP also committed Thursday to continue a $5 million-a-year grant program, which offers up to $250,000 to replace playgrounds at schools in mature neighbourhoods. New and modernized elementary schools will also come with a promise of $250,000 for each playground.

A $16-million school nutrition program for 30,000 students would continue, an NDP spokeswoman said.

Following UCP Leader Jason Kenney’s announcement that he intends to roll back privacy rights and other legal protections for LGBTQ students and staff in Alberta schools, Notley said an NDP government would keep current laws in place.

The law requires all schools to publicly post policies outlining their rights, and requires school principals to “immediately” approve students’ requests to start a gay-straight alliance.

“It’s utterly cruel for us to be thinking of going backwards on this,” Notley said, saying there is no reason to re-litigate the issue.

A group of parents and private religious schools are challenging the law, saying it infringes on their religious freedom.

The NDP is also committing to completing its revamp of the K-12 curriculum in English and French. Kenney said a UCP government would “pause” the review to do further consultation.

The federal New Democrats’ fiscal plan for the fall election will be shaped by estimates of how much money Ottawa loses out on each year to international tax-avoidance schemes, the party’s finance critic says.

Peter Julian said the party intends to focus on Canada’s so-called “tax gap” to show it can finance big campaign commitments – in areas such as affordable housing and universal pharmacare – by cracking down on corporate tax avoidance, loopholes and offshore havens.

The tax gap, which one estimate said could be above $40-billion annually, is the difference between the amount of tax revenue that should have been collected in a year and what was actually brought in.

Julian said to reinforce its fiscal plan, the NDP is counting on the findings of an upcoming report from the independent parliamentary budget officer on the size of the tax gap.

“The whole issue of corporate taxation will be a stronger part of what we offer to Canadians, bolstered by the PBO report,” Julian said in an interview.

“You will hear us repeating what was found in the PBO report. Whether that number is $10-billion or $15-billion or $20-billion or higher … And we will be talking about the fair tax system as a foundation for making the kind of investments that will make a difference in people’s lives.”

Details about the NDP’s fiscal approach follow last week’s release of the final federal budget before October’s election.

The budget from the governing Liberals fed political debate on whether or not federal governments should strive to return the books to balance as soon as possible.

The document showed the Liberals are in no hurry. Their budget, which emphasized a need to continue making investments, projected annual deficits of almost $20-billion in each of the next two years and contained no timeline to balance the books.

A few days after the budget’s release, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer told a conference that a Tory government would bring books back to balance, but he didn’t say when.

The NDP has been less vocal about its pre-election fiscal vision thus far.

In the 2015 election, the NDP vowed to make major investments and still balance the budget by raising corporate taxes and cutting off tax havens.

Following the party’s poor results at the ballot box, former leader Tom Mulcair later laid part of the blame on the fiscal commitment, which he said overshadowed the NDP’s “social democratic economic vision.”

Julian declined to say whether the New Democrats will promise balanced books again in 2019 because NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh will roll out of the party’s plans over the coming months.

The NDP will renew its focus on corporate tax fairness – and he expects this time to be different.

“I think what we needed in 2015 is what we’ll have in 2019 – which is the PBO report on the tax gap,” Julian said. “In a sense, we’re coming with far more evidence to support what we’re saying about having to put in place a fair tax system.”

Other political parties have shown interest that the forthcoming tax gap report could be a source of new fiscal space for election promises, said Yves Giroux, the parliamentary budget officer.

But Giroux warned any federal government would need to make considerable efforts before they can turn the tax gap estimate into a source of revenue.

“We have to be somewhat prudent because even if we come up with an estimate that’s high – and I’m not saying it’s the case – it’s only the beginning,” Giroux said in an interview.

He said after identifying how much money is escaping the public treasury, the Canada Revenue Agency “has to have the willingness to get that money.”",NDP’s fiscal vows for 2019 election to reflect forthcoming ‘tax gap’ report,The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-ndps-fiscal-vows-for-2019-election-to-reflect-forthcoming-tax-gap-2/

The targeted signs in support of NDP Leader Rachel Notley and NDP candidate David Shepherd, who is running for re-election in the constituency of Edmonton City-Centre, were found early Wednesday spray-painted in black with swastikas and crude language.

“As a member of Rachel Notley’s team and the NDP candidate for Edmonton City-Centre, I am proud to represent a positive campaign that is focused on promoting hope, optimism, and inclusion,” said Shepherd in an email when contacted about the defaced signs.

“I will always fight to keep Alberta a province that is united, not divided. As an Edmontonian and Albertan, I denounce any and all forms of racism or discrimination.”

Shepherd on his Facebook page said that he appreciates “everyone who’s reached out to express their support as this has come to light.”

Edmonton police spokeswoman Cheryl Sheppard said Wednesday that officers have received a complaint and are investigating.

‘Something we see quite often during elections’

B’nai Brith Canada is a Jewish advocacy organization that tracks anti-Semitism and racism in Canada. Daniel Koren, spokesman for the organization, said the use of the swastikas has seen a “massive comeback” over the years and anti-Semitism is seen quite often during elections.

“There’s actually statistics that show that levels of anti-Semitism, whether it be vandalism, graffiti, harassment, discrimination, what have you, normally go up during election times,” said Koren.

He said the swastika is increasingly being used as a “de facto hate symbol.”

“We’re seeing it promoting against groups or organizations that either work with Jewish members or work with minorities, work with identity groups, work with anyone who isn’t seen to be kind of that quote-unquote white Canadian,” said Koren.

“I think for the NDP, a lot of their politics are in favour of supporting members of minority groups and supporting members of marginalized communities, that unfortunately because they take this position, this is something that we’re seeing.”

In 2017, there were 22 cases of anti-Semitism reported in Edmonton, according to an annual audit by B’nai Brith Canada.

More signs vandalized

Last week, Alberta Party candidate Joanne Gui spoke out after racist comments were written on one of her election signs in Calgary-Edgemont.

Gui said she reported the graffiti to the Calgary police.

Deborah Drever, who is running for re-election with the NDP in Calgary-Bow posted a photo to Twitter with a sign of hers that was also vandalized. The graffiti read “death to marxists.”

This was very troubling to wake up to this morning. This type of hate has no place in our province. I’m proud to be part of Rachel’s team that is promoting a positive vision for our province. One Alberta that sticks together and cares for each other – not tears us apart. #ableg pic.twitter.com/4EJv4jkj2r — Deborah Drever (@yycbow) March 21, 2019

On Twitter, UCP Leader Jason Kenney called the vandalism in Edmonton “repugnant.”

“Sad to see vandals defacing & destroying signs from all parties. People who do this are attacking our democracy,” Kenney said.

They are urging the public to be respectful of the signs.

On Tuesday, while adding $90 million in funding to speed some surgical procedures to the-now $2.76-billion spending pile, Notley said those dollars won’t torpedo her government’s plan to balance the budget by 2023.

“All of the things that are in this platform are costed into that,” Notley said, referring to the NDP’s Path to Balance strategy.

“I very much look forward to releasing the costing of our platform, which we will do fairly soon … we’ll roll that out when we roll out that platform in its fullness.”

The largest expenditure is $1.5 billion over five years to limit the cost of child care for parents to $25 a day. The NDP says the resulting greater employment participation will mean a $5.95 billion GDP boost.

Not included in that $2.76 billion is a pledge to double to $7 billion provincial incentives to upgrade petrochemical projects over the next decade, a move the government said will ultimately yield $75 billion in private investment and 70,000 jobs by 2030.

The NDP government’s fiscal performance is seen by many as its political Achilles heel, though the latest budget update has the 2018-19 deficit falling from an initially expected $8.8 billion to $6.9 billion.

“We’ve been able to keep our spending below population plus inflation,” Finance Minister Joe Ceci said a month ago.

The accumulated debt is now at $58.6 billion, up from $52.8 billion forecast in the second quarter of the current fiscal year.

It’s hard to say if the NDP’s spending promises, with more inevitably to come, would prevent that 2023 slaying of the deficit from being realized, said University of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe.

He said a bigger challenge in meeting that goal could be an overly optimistic energy royalties forecast the NDP is pegging at $12 billion a year by the early 2020s.

“I certainly expect an increase if prices don’t rise, but based on the National Energy Board’s projections, they’ll be $9 billion by 2023 … increased spending pressures will only increase reliance on royalties,” said Tombe.

“The government’s own forecast had been for $10 billion by that time.”

But he emphasized that the oil market’s notorious volatility could render all those forecasts moot.

By contrast, he noted the UCP’s platform has so far made few dollar pledges while relying more on restraint, along with axing the carbon tax and rolling back corporate taxes from 12 per cent to eight per cent by 2022.

“If you keep spending frozen, balancing the budget by 2023 is feasible even if you forgo the carbon tax and lower corporate taxes,” said Tombe.

But he said the UCP’s budget-balancing success depends on its stomach for spending restraint, or growth in expenditures, something that’s not yet completely clear.

“Where is that spending restraint going to be?” said Tombe.

And he said it’s unlikely the UCP’s plan to generate revenues from a corporate tax cut is realistic.

“Will investment grow as a result? There’s a lot of evidence it will, that is very uncontroversial,” he said.

“But revenue will fall, so we won’t see an increase in revenue.”

The UCP has said the first year of its tax cuts would result in a $348-million revenue loss but would result in a $1.2-billion gain by 2023 due to the resulting economic stimulus.

The bottom line, said Tombe, is flexibility remains in the province’s fiscal dynamics to make balancing a budget at least eventually possible within any of the political parties’ election platforms.

So far, the UCP has only detailed $45 million in spending, chief among it a $30-million “war room” to combat the efforts of environmentalists and their funders who attack Alberta’s energy industry.

The NDP has attacked the UCP corporate tax cut plan along with the vow to eliminate the carbon levy — which is expected to yield $2.4 billion in 2022 — as budget-busters favouring the elite.

“Those economics are based on a trickle-down approach that only works for people at the top,” said Ceci.

“We’re going to stick to what benefits everyone in society.”

But the NDP’s economic record shows it can’t be trusted to right Alberta’s fiscal ship and its campaign promises will only sink the province deeper in debt, said UCP MLA Ric McIver.

“On the ‘path to balance’ promise, the NDP has no credibility. In their 2015 campaign platform they promised that by 2019-20 there would be a $586-million surplus,” said McIver.

“In reality, we’re facing a $7.9-billion deficit for the year and are on track for an unprecedented $95 billion in debt.”

The UCP has taken to mocking Ceci’s financial acumen by issuing faux orange-hued $20 bills bearing the finance minister’s image with the message “master of six credit downgrades!”

Tombe said the NDP itself believes in the power of tax incentives as seen with its subsidies directed at the petrochemical industry and other measures.

Plans to double that petrochemical incentive, said the economist, “do come at the cost of a higher budget deficit.”

While it may not be direct spending, they do appear in budget documents “in the form of lower royalties than would otherwise be the case,” added Tombe.

All the other paperwork is done and work has already started on the natural gas liquefaction plant in the Kitimat region.

Getting the new industry to the starting line took almost 10 years. The tax changes are the final pieces of the process, Finance Minister Carole James said.

All that’s left for Premier John Horgan’s government to do is weather several weeks of incredulity at the brazen “hypocrisy,” the sheer “stupidity” and the epic amount of backtracking it took to manage such an about-face.

By the time the bill is passed, the cabinet will be wondering if the $40-billion contribution to the economy that is expected will be worth all the abuse.

“They’re going to have to eat a certain amount of crow,” B.C. Liberal MLA Rich Coleman said. “I look forward to pointing that out to them.”

Coleman spent years as the lead minister on the LNG file, courting investors all over the world and trying to close a deal. Through most of that effort the NDP slammed the Liberals for being overly generous and giving away B.C. resources.

Then they took power and looked at the potential for LNG. In the space of a few months they became just as enraptured as the B.C. Liberals were.

Opposition critics often have to drop their criticism and change their views once they take over government. But the NDP went well beyond simply switching from skepticism to favouring the new industry. They have taken several of the key Liberal breaks to which they objected and enhanced them. After spending years warning people the Liberal government was giving away the farm, they gave away even more farm to finally close the deal.

Liberals will still support the tax changes, because they’re too far down the LNG road to change course now. But they won’t be able to resist highlighting the vast gulf between what the opposition NDP said and what the government NDP is actually doing.

And when they get tired of reciting all those newly ironic quotes about giveaways, the B.C. Green caucus will take over where the Liberals left off.

Green Leader Andrew Weaver went into rhetorical overdrive Monday after his first look at the legislation. He said the NDP want to champion themselves as climate-change leaders while at the same time they introduce the single biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in Canadian history.

“It’s about cake and eating it too.”

Weaver equated it to professing to care deeply about the opioid crisis while “putting in an order for a massive shipment of cocaine from Colombia.

“This is the kind of stupidity – it doesn’t make sense.”

Weaver said: “To see the NDP take what the Liberals did to a whole new level can only be described as remarkable.”

He said he will be reading all the myriad NDP criticisms from the past into the record and will enjoy doing it.

The NDP’s LNG framework now notes that the Liberal version had impediments and risks to investors. So the LNG income tax, which was criticized for being too low, is abolished. The electricity rate for LNG processing is lowered to be compatible with all industrial users. LNG proponents will be exempted from paying PST up front during start-up. That’s a savings of almost $600 million, but companies will have to make up that amount through performance payments once plants begin operating.

The single toughest contortion the government had to make was in fitting the LNG plant into the stringent new emission-reduction scheme. There’s room in the plan for LNG Canada, but just barely, recognizing the plan only gets B.C. three-quarters of the way to its target.

And the industry gets an exemption from carbon tax hikes if it can maintain the cleanest possible standards.

Just So You Know: The PDA between B.C. and LNG Canada was released Monday.

It stands for Project Development Agreement, but it’s entirely fitting to think of the abbreviation as “public display of affection.”

The NDP event, scheduled for March 23, was going to give attendees levels of access and a staggered start-time based on how much money people spent on their ticket.

The top tier $800 ticket came with an extra hour of time with a private reception with Horwath and an open bar from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. Those spending $100 or $250 on their tickets were allowed entrance after 7 p.m. and no open bar.

The Progressive Conservatives criticized the party and Horwath for hosting such a event after she repeatedly criticized a fundraiser for Premier Doug Ford last month as an example of “cash for access.” Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner said just like the Tory event, the one hosted by the NDP would have also been “cash for access.”

Over the past two weeks, Horwath has consistently defended the event, arguing it did not run afoul of any fundraising rules.

“The rules of the legislature are as they are,” she said on Tuesday. “We provide tickets, we show up and we enjoy the time.”

After the party told iPolitics the $800 tickets were cancelled, Horwath said Wednesday the change was made because otherwise people who didn’t pay the higher amount would have had to wait around outside, having just spent the day together at the party’s provincial council meeting.

“It seemed a bit funny, a bit awkward,” Horwath said.

She repeatedly ignored questions about whether her party would hold future fundraisers where preferential treatment is given to those who pay more.

The party says it made the decision to cancel the $800 tickets on March 19 — that information was not given to iPolitics when it asked Horwath about the event last week.

In February, the Progressive Conservatives raised $4 million at a single fundraiser where the party charged $1250 per ticket.

The Toronto Star and Globe and Mail both reported that lobbyists were pressured to attend the fundraiser and sell tickets — or risk losing access to the government.

Horwath said those allegations are what made the February fundraiser problematic for the NDP, but the Tories say the opposition leader is speaking out of both sides of her mouth on the issue.

“It is very hypocritical of the NDP to criticize us for having a big fundraising dinner and then announce a week later that they’re doing the same thing,” Government House Leader Todd Smith said Wednesday.

Green Party wants stricter limits on paid events

Last fall the Progressive Conservatives changed fundraising rules to allow politicians to again attend paid-events. That had been banned by the previous Liberal government after a cash for access controversy of its own.

Schreiner argues that now that politicians are again allowed at events the upper limit on ticket-pricing should be in the range of what he says the average voter can afford.

[READ MORE: Ford government reopens door to cash-for-access fundraising]

“All of these high-ticketed events are cash for access so that’s why we should get rid of them,” Schreiner said.

“The fact that whether you’re paying $800 or $1250 or $1600, those kinds of events are inappropriate.”

He said parties should instead have an entrance fee that is affordable and then ask people who can to pay more once they’re at the event.

It happened during debate on Bill 10, the enabling legislation for some of the tax breaks and incentives in the NDP government’s deal with the LNG Canada project.

Weaver’s complaint being that the New Democrats were now engaged in the very thing they denounced when the B.C. Liberal government offered tax breaks and incentives to attract LNG investment.

“I have a litany of quotes that I will be reading during the course of the debate,” said Weaver at the outset of his remarks on Tuesday. “I had to ask my staff to pare them down because I’ve got 20 pages of quotes that I look forward to bringing in.”

Moreover, as the Green leader went on to show, in some cases the New Democrats were offering richer breaks and more incentives than the Liberals had done.

“This is a government, now, that literally hurled abuse, rhetoric, catcalled, name-called, all sorts of things for four years,” said Weaver at one point. “Now what they propose to do is take what the B.C. Liberals did to a whole new level.”

Not content with a general attack on his partners in power sharing, Weaver went after individual New Democrats in personal terms.

He quoted Energy Minister Michelle Mungall’s comments against LNG development from her days in Opposition. Then he noted that protesters in her Nelson-Creston riding were preparing to stage a “funeral” to memorialize the passing of her credibility.

“Well deserved, frankly,” said Weaver. “She has no credibility in this file.”

Next on the hit list was Agriculture Minister Lana Popham, who like Mungall was known as an environmental activist before she gained a seat at the cabinet table.

He quoted her on the LNG file circa 2016, when she faulted the Liberals for “not legislating like we’re in the most important races of our lives, the race to slow down the effects of climate change. This is not a joke.”

Now he sees Popham as part of a government engaged in a “despicable” version of “greenwashing.” He disputes the NDP claim that a massive increase in LNG production can be reconciled with targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Weaver to Popham: “Where are you now? Do you have the courage, do you have the moral fortitude to stand up for what you believe in and you said so back in 2016?”

While showing no mercy to ministers Mungall and Popham, when Weaver quoted some earlier words from NDP backbencher Doug Routley, he chose not to identify him in the usual way by naming his riding.

“I’ve become quite good friends with this member,” the Green leader explained. “I recognize that this member is probably struggling with the decision because I truly believe this member’s heart is in the right place. I’ll let you guess who this member is.”

But Weaver didn’t hold back when going after Premier John Horgan.

He quoted the NDP leader from his Opposition days, accusing the Liberals of giving away the store on LNG and covering up the details.

“If anything, we’re becoming less transparent from where we were with the B.C. Liberals,” said Weaver.

As for the alleged sellout, Weaver noted the NDP’s terms on taxes, electricity rates and carbon tax rebates were even more generous than those of the Liberals.

“The sellout on steroids,” said Weaver. “Hats off to LNG Canada negotiators. They really were dealing with a bunch of suckers, I tell you.”

The Green leader believes Horgan and crew missed the boat: “I don’t think the Premier and his party have thought this through. They haven’t reflected upon the comments they made historically and they don’t see how they apply now more than ever.”

Capping his comments was a question he put to everyone on the government side: “How do you sleep at night, knowing that you are putting before us a generational sellout that actually goes against everything you campaigned on in the last election?”

In reply, the New Democrats ignored Weaver, knowing the Greens will vote with them on confidence matters, as they have done twice in the current session.

The Greens, for their part, made two motions Tuesday and another Wednesday to try to derail the LNG legislation. Each was defeated by a massive margin, the Liberals joining the NDP in voting them down.

Much as the Liberals enjoy Weaver bashing away at the New Democrats, they recognize it as a pillow fight, and a one-sided one at that.

Weaver has no difficulty inhabiting two political worlds, the one where the New Democrats are hypocrites and generational sellouts with no credibility, the other where he votes to keep them in power.

His most useful contribution to the debate, other than documenting the NDP’s world class record of hypocrisy on the LNG file, was the airing of a letter alleging a massive giveaway on natural gas royalties in B.C.

Weaver did not name the author, saying only that he resigned earlier this year from the energy ministry.

Nor were the claims checkable within the narrow confines of legislative debate.

But the contents were sufficiently detailed to warrant further attention, if not by a legislature committee, then by the independent auditor general.

The federal New Democrats' fiscal plan for the fall election will be shaped by estimates of how much money Ottawa loses out on each year to international tax-avoidance schemes, the party's finance critic says.

Peter Julian said the party intends to focus on Canada's so-called ""tax gap"" to show it can finance big campaign commitments — in areas such as affordable housing and universal pharmacare — by cracking down on corporate tax avoidance, loopholes and offshore havens.

The tax gap, which one estimate said could be above $40 billion annually, is the difference between the amount of tax revenue that should have been collected in a year and what was actually brought in.

Julian said to reinforce its fiscal plan, the NDP is counting on the findings of an upcoming report from the independent parliamentary budget officer on the size of the tax gap.

""The whole issue of corporate taxation will be a stronger part of what we offer to Canadians, bolstered by the PBO report,"" Julian said in an interview.

""You will hear us repeating what was found in the PBO report. Whether that number is $10 billion or $15 billion or $20 billion or higher... And we will be talking about the fair tax system as a foundation for making the kind of investments that will make a difference in people's lives.""

Details about the NDP's fiscal approach follow last week's release of the final federal budget before October's election.

The budget from the governing Liberals fed political debate on whether or not federal governments should strive to return the books to balance as soon as possible.

The document showed the Liberals are in no hurry. Their budget, which emphasized a need to continue making investments, projected annual deficits of almost $20 billion in each of the next two years and contained no timeline to balance the books.

A few days after the budget's release, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer told a conference that a Tory government would bring books back to balance, but he didn't say when.

The NDP has been less vocal about its pre-election fiscal vision thus far.

In the 2015 election, the NDP vowed to make major investments and still balance the budget by raising corporate taxes and cutting off tax havens.

Following the party's poor results at the ballot box, former leader Tom Mulcair later laid part of the blame on the fiscal commitment, which he said overshadowed the NDP's ""social democratic economic vision.""

Julian declined to say whether the New Democrats will promise balanced books again in 2019 because NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh will roll out of the party's plans over the coming months.

The NDP will renew its focus on corporate tax fairness — and he expects this time to be different.

""I think what we needed in 2015 is what we'll have in 2019 — which is the PBO report on the tax gap,"" Julian said. ""In a sense, we're coming with far more evidence to support what we're saying about having to put in place a fair tax system.""",NDP focus on 'tax gap',Castanet,https://www.castanet.net/news/Canada/252577/NDP-focus-on-tax-gap

Out of eight days on the campaign trail, the premier has touched down in Calgary on five of them, where’s she’s unveiled some of her biggest election planks.

To political observers, that’s no surprise given polls have consistently shown for months the NDP lags badly behind the UCP in a city where 26 seats are up for grabs and is seen as the locale where the election will be won or lost.

NDP fortunes look brighter in Edmonton while being virtually comatose in rural Alberta, making Calgary the rubber match.

Notley kicked off the election campaign in Calgary a week ago and on Monday chose the city as the site to trumpet her priciest promise so far: a five-year, $1.5-billion plan to cap the cost of all child care spots in the province at $25 a day.

On Tuesday, she upped the ante in the always crucial health care debate by promising to slash wait times for cancer and cataract surgeries by 15 per cent, and cardiac procedures by five per cent.

“This means 40,000 Albertans will have less anxiety and fewer sleepless nights,” said Notley of the number of patients the plan is expected to benefit over three years.

Attached to that was a reminder that a government — hers — “finally” had forged ahead with a new, long-awaited cancer centre for Calgary.

Included in Tuesday’s speech, among a slew of Calgary-centred planks, was a reiteration of her plan to invest $1 billion in building an upstream reservoir to head off a repeat of the 2013 flood.

Though the campaign is only a week old, those moves and the resignations of two UCP candidates over racially intolerant social media remarks suggest there’s little to indicate the NDP has gained political traction in the city.

Recent polls have shown the party trailing the UCP in Calgary, a city where the NDP won 15 seats in 2015, by anywhere from 11 per cent to 21 per cent.

Last Friday, Notley readily admitted she’ll be spending lots of time in Calgary until the April 16 election “because Calgary matters.”

It certainly does, both politically and as an economic lynchpin, said Mount Royal University political scientist Lori Williams.

“Keeping or picking up seats in Calgary means winning the election or not,” she said, noting Calgary’s energy-related economic challenges are driving the Cowtown narrative.

But Williams said the NDP still has a fighting chance to make a decent showing in Calgary by hammering home Notley’s efforts at fighting for the Trans Mountain pipeline.

“She’s got an economic record to defend but it might also dawn on people on what reasonably can be done by politicians,” she said.

“The polls have not been predictive in the final analysis in the 2012 and 2015 elections … polls have been close enough that they can make inroads. It’s a steep climb but it’s no longer a foregone conclusion.”

When asked about how steep that climb is in Calgary, Finance Minister Joe Ceci sounded upbeat.

“I’m feeling extremely positive everywhere I go,” said Ceci, who’s running for re-election in the Calgary-Buffalo riding.

“With (campaign) signs, volunteers, it’s all coming together.”

Ceci is only kidding himself if he thinks his party has a realistic shot at keeping Calgarians’ loyalty, said Ric McIver, who’s hoping to keep his Calgary-Hays seat for the UCP.

The NDP can’t overcome the fact Calgary’s 7.6 per cent unemployment rate dubiously leads the nation or that nearly a third of its downtown office space is vacant, said McIver, a one-time PC cabinet minister.

“The Notley-Trudeau alliance has been exceedingly hard on Calgarians, as it has been for all Albertans,” said McIver in a statement.

“Calgarians want to get our province working again. They won’t fall for Rachel Notley and a desperate NDP trying to buy votes with taxpayers’ own money.”

Last week, UCP Leader Jason Kenney used a backdrop of Calgary’s downtown skyline with its many empty offices to hammer the governing party.

Pollster Marc Henry, whose survey conducted in the days preceding the election call showed Notley’s party behind by 21 points in Calgary, said it appears the NDP prospects in the city are grim.

“It’s the Calgary seats you have to watch … you can look at the seats they won in Calgary due to the vote splits but that split isn’t there any more,” said Henry, who runs ThinkHQ Public Affairs.

The committee is meeting on Friday, March 29th.

Canola growers are major contributors to our rural communities and are a vital component to our national economy, contributing $3.6 billion to our GDP. It is unacceptable that they have to pay the price for Canada’s strained relationship with China.

We call on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to do everything diplomatically possible to resolve the canola issue with China, including reaching out to Canada’s allies to put pressure on China. We also believe it is imperative for the Prime Minister’s Office to send a trade envoy to China to solve the canola seed ban, face-to-face.

Simard, who recently left the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party in protest over the treatment of Franco-Ontarians, was all set to ask a question about OHIP+ during question period on Wednesday. She represents Glengarry-Prescott-Russell.

Then came an accident at her home — colleagues were unsure what happened but she needed stitches — and she could not come to the legislature on Wednesday. She asked Liberal John Fraser to ask her question in her place, about the government’s elimination of universal drug coverage for young people.

But under the rules of the legislature, there is a strict rotation among the 11 independents, who each get a single question every eight days. (The seven Liberals do not have party status and are classed as independent.) And giving Simard’s question to Fraser would be breaking the rules.

This could have been allowed if the House had unanimously agreed to waive the rules for a day, but the Conservatives and NDP voted it down. The parties refused again when Liberal Marie-France Lalonde wanted to ask Simard’s question.

That’s when Fraser, representing Ottawa South, and Lalonde, representing Orléans, took to Twitter.

Fraser accused the Tories of using question period to set up an easy question from their own party.

“Today @mflalonde and I requested unanimous consent to ask a question on behalf of @ASimardL, who gave consent to ask her question. Both times, @OntarioNDP @OntarioPCParty refused to grant it, resulting in another friendly question for the government,” he tweeted.

He later tweeted: “That is not the point of question period.”

Lalonde said the other parties “robbed my constituents of the opportunity to have their voices heard.”

Part of having a healthy democracy is being able to ask questions of the government of the day. Today, the @OntarioNDP and the @OntarioPCParty robbed my constituents of the opportunity to have their voices heard. Shame! #onpoli https://t.co/TamqDU50gE — Marie-France Lalonde (@mflalonde) March 27, 2019

In an interview, Lalonde said she only wanted a little flexibility for someone who had been in an accident and could not attend. It was not “respect for an elected official,” she said.

“Honestly I think it’s arrogance, and my question to them would be: What are you afraid of?”

She added that she had spoken to Simard, who was not badly hurt.

Fraser said the stumbling block is an agreement between NDP and Conservative leaders on how to handle the current situation where the Liberals don’t have party status. He said this agreement allows one Liberal to replace another, which is what happens within official parties. But the system precludes other independents from having one replace another, and this is a formal system, not done on a whim.

“So a Liberal can give a Liberal a question but another independent cannot give a Liberal a question.”

He said it did not appear to be directed against Simard personally.

He also said the system has generally let Liberals switch places to ask a question when one of them is ill, but this is the second time the other parties have refused to let a Liberal step in and help Simard.

“If a Conservative member, or a member of a Conservative bent, wants to give a Liberal a question or give the Green Party a question, isn’t that the way it’s supposed to work?” he said.

“Here’s the point in the whole thing. There are 11 independent members,” representing more than a million voters in last year’s election, he said. “And they have one question a day.

“We are asking questions on behalf of our community. What we are asking is: you don’t have to call us an official party, just make sure the questions and the participation are commensurate with the fact that we represent a lot of people and they have an expectation.”

Fraser noted that the independents get along pretty well and often work together to make life run more smoothly, despite political differences.

The ...","VICTORIA — As the house resumed sitting Monday, Finance Minister Carole James introduced the enabling legislation for the deal that finally landed the $40 billion LNG Canada project for B.C.

The combination of tax relief and incentives was valued at $6 billion over 40 years when the New Democrats first dangled the terms this time last year.

After extensive consultations with the LNG sector, the New Democrats had crafted what would be necessary put B.C. on a competitive footing with rival jurisdictions for LNG development.

They calculated correctly. In October, Shell and its partners made a final investment decision on the Kitimat-based LNG Canada project, predicated on B.C. upholding its side of a signed, sealed and delivered project development agreement.

By the end of last year, the New Democrats had already guaranteed that the project would be eligible for B.C. Hydro’s low-end industrial electricity rate.

They also exempted the project from having to pay sales taxes up front, in exchange for it paying back the estimated $600 million in relief, interest free, over 20 years.

Monday’s legislation completed the package, with the repeal of a special LNG income tax brought in by the B.C. Liberals.

It also established a new tax credit for LNG companies based in B.C., pegged at three per cent of the cost of natural gas and valued at the equivalent of a three-point reduction in the 12 per cent provincial rate for corporate income tax.

On first reading of a government bill, the usual practice is for the house to allow it to go forward without objection, ensuring it can be debated in principle and examined in detail before being passed into law.

But when James moved first reading on the LNG bill, there came the unmistakable voice of the Green leader, Andrew Weaver, calling for division — meaning a recorded vote.

On no subject does Weaver differ more strongly with his partners in power-sharing than LNG development. He’s called the LNG Canada deal an exercise in hypocrisy and a generational sellout.

At one point earlier this session, Weaver cast himself as a passenger on the Titanic with Capt. John Horgan “looking straight at the LNG iceberg and hitting accelerate.”

He is especially vehement against the NDP claim that this project can be easily reconciled with targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions: “They want to have their cake and eat it, too.”

By calling division Monday, Weaver created the opportunity for he and Green MLAs Adam Olsen and Sonia Furstenau to record their opposition to the LNG legislation from the outset.

But what he also did is confirm their isolation on this issue.

When the MLA roll was called and the vote announced, the result was 80 votes in favour, three against. All 39 Liberals present joined the 41 New Democrats in supporting first reading.

If the Liberals voted with the Greens, they could have stopped the bill in its tracks. Not that there was the slightest chance they would do so, given their own longtime support of LNG development.

Rather, they will focus their attention on questioning some aspects of the NDP deal, never mind that their own efforts fell short.

For example, B.C. Liberal Mike de Jong questioned whether the New Democrats had done enough to ensure the project would use B.C. natural gas as opposed to possibly cheaper product from Alberta or Saskatchewan.

He also wondered about the value of promised relief from future increases in the carbon tax, above and beyond the current rate of $30 a tonne.

Apparently that value is being kept confidential, according to de Jong, who as finance minister in the previous government steered the Liberal enabling legislation for LNG through the house.

The Liberals may have more to say after digesting other details of the project agreement released Monday, which runs to several dozen pages.

When the bill reaches committee stage — clause by clause debate — the Liberals may also move some amendments to tweak the legislation.

But no chance they will defeat it. As James herself put it to reporters after tabling the bill, she has every confidence that the legislation will pass.

On this one the New Democrats don’t need to worry about support from the Greens because they have the Liberals.

The New Democrats are likewise confident that the project itself will now proceed to the finish line.

Construction is already underway at the Kitimat site, with 600 people already employed there. The government estimates the project will account for 10,000 jobs at peak construction in 2021, tapering down to when LNG Canada starts shipping product in 2024.

There remains a First Nations encampment in the path of the pipeline that would transport natural gas from the northeast to the terminal.

But work is proceeding elsewhere along the right of way. The New Democrats have retained Murray Rankin, the retiring federal NDP MP for Victoria, to sort out the impasse with the holdout group of Indigenous people. They hope he’ll succeed.

Nor do New Democrats make apologies for the multi-billion dollar package that brought the project to B.C., though they hate it when critics use the word “subsidy.”

The finance ministry reckons that even with the estimated $6 billion in relief over 40 years, the province would still reap $22 billion in revenues over the same period. Without the project, returns would, of course, be zero.

Photo: BC Government Flickr.","B.C. Agriculture Minister Lana Popham has been under fire over changes that would prevent individual farmers from applying to remove land from the province’s Agricultural Land Reserve, but a former head of the Agricultural Land Commission says the government is making a needed change.

Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners Suddenly, New Attention for List of Harper-Era Abuses Traffic surges for Tyee’s 2015 compilation of 70 Tory law and ethics breaches.

Richard Bullock, who chaired the commission from 2010 to 2015, said the changes would send a strong message to would-be speculators of B.C.’s agricultural land.

“Some believe there is a ‘right’ to apply to exclude land from the Agricultural Land Reserve,” said a statement from Bullock. “After almost 50 years of opportunity for individual landowners to make an application to remove land from the ALR, the proposed change to that process is the next logical step.”

The ALR — intended to protect farmland, with restrictions on non-agricultural uses — includes 4.6 million hectares, almost five per cent of the province.

Earlier this month the government introduced Bill 15, the Agricultural Land Commission Amendment Act, but it has not yet been called for further debate.

“This bill really focuses on the governance of the Agricultural Land Commission and the way applications are processed,” Popham said.

The opposition has criticized how the bill defines “person” so that individual farmers aren’t included among those who can apply to have land removed from the reserve.

On Monday, BC Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson said during question period that farmers who were visiting the legislature were fed up and angry with the government.

“They need to be able to manage their lands to produce food. They’ve found that under this agriculture minister, their property rights are being seriously trampled on,” he said.

Popham responded to Wilkinson that the government is doing a lot to support farming.

“You can’t really farm if you don’t have an Agricultural Land Reserve to do it on,” she said. “We’re making sure that we’re revitalizing that reserve. We’re making it stronger than ever.”

The changes will make it more viable for farmers to make a living, she said.

Wilkinson quoted a farmer named Ben Dhiman who’d participated in a rally in Surrey, saying, “There’s been a constant attack on our way of life... and, most importantly, our rights as property owners.”

Popham said that Wilkinson and other BC Liberals had been misleading people in their constituencies.

“I understand why the Official Opposition is so upset. For 16 years, they considered the Agricultural Land Reserve a bank for development,” she said. “Well, we consider it a reserve for agriculture and food production. I’m sorry if that upsets you.”

In an interview, Popham said that the BC Liberals have used a two-week break in the legislature to “spread misinformation about the bill.”

Landowners have always had to go through a municipality if they wanted their land removed from the ALR, she said, but in some cases municipalities forward those applications to the land commission without commenting on whether or not they support the withdrawal.

The commission then has to go through an onerous process, meeting with owners and local government representatives to see if the proposal fits with official community planning, she said. About 40 of the 600 applications the commission received last year were for the removal of land from the ALR.

The change the government is making will make the process more efficient for the commission and more transparent for landowners and local governments, Popham said.

ALR Chair Told Libs: Don't Do It read more

“If the landowner wants to have an application to exclude land, they would work with local government, and local government would submit an application on their behalf after running through whether or not there’s a community benefit to doing so.”

The landowner can still correspond with the commission to express what they want to happen with their land, she said. Landowners can also still make other kinds of applications to the commission.

“It’s really about protecting the Agricultural Land Reserve,” Popham said, adding that most people who are farming don’t want to get their land out of the reserve, and the bill sends a strong message to people speculating on farmland. “We’ve tightened that up, so it’s not as easy to do.”

In his statement, Bullock said the changes would protect farmland and make it more affordable than it otherwise would be.

“As chair, I observed that the large majority of the exclusion applications were not from farmers and ranchers, but instead from folks looking to make a substantial gain from paving over good agricultural land,” he said.

“Moving to have exclusions of land from the ALR be part of a broader joint local government and commission land use planning exercise makes sense.”

Are the Province’s Agricultural Land Protectors Overwhelmed? read more

People often forget the commission and local governments have already made a lot of effort to refine the ALR boundary, he said.

“This is not about property rights. It is about reducing speculation on agricultural land. As long as the ‘door is open’ to an individual or company to make an application to remove agricultural land from the ALR, speculation on these lands will continue.”

Bullock’s term as chair of the commission ended early when the BC Liberal government fired him in 2015, saying that the government was changing regulations and it was time for new leadership.

Bullock had been strongly critical of those changes.

During the fall sitting of the legislature, the BC NDP government passed legislation it said would strengthen the land reserve.

It restricted the size of homes that can be built in the ALR, reversed a decision by the former government to split the reserve into two zones with different levels of protection, and increased penalties for breaking the law.","NDP Changes Will Better Protect Agricultural Land Reserve, Says Former Commission Chair",The Tyee,https://thetyee.ca/News/2019/03/28/NDP-Changes-Agricultural-Land-Reserve/

Contrary to what Tom Moore thinks, the cartoon of Jasmeet Singh does not depict a political opportunist. When Singh relocated from Brampton, Ontario to Burnaby, B.C. for work, he was just exercising one of his constitutional rights as a Canadian citizen.

That being said, I believe the NDP would probably be better off right now if it had either stuck with Thomas Mulcair until the next general election in October or if it had nominated a NDP member as the new leader who was already a member of Parliament.

As a former resident of Burnaby, I think that Peter Julian, who has been the MP for Burnaby-New Westminster since 2004 and who is widely respected as an ""honourable"" politician, would have been a great choice as NDP leader.

As a member of Parliament for the past 15 years, Julian would also have been able to speak for other social democrats in the House of Commons over the past couple of years (since Mulcair's departure as NDP leader in 2016).

EDMONTON – Alberta NDP Leader Rachel Notley is promising to hire nearly 1,000 more teachers this fall if her party returns to power after the April 16 election.

Notley says an additional 15,000 students are projected to be in classrooms when the next school year starts and it’s critical to give them the supports they need.

She says an NDP government would hire 600 teachers and another 400 would come through a $23-million increase in the province’s classroom improvement fund.

The fund is delivered to schools based on student enrolment and is meant to help retain teachers, hire new ones and pay for resources to help students with complex needs.

Notley is also promising that the NDP would spend $1.3 billion to build and upgrade another 70 schools.

There would also be money to ensure every new and modernized school came with a playground.

Another $5 million a year would go to replace 100 aging and outdated play areas.

Not surprisingly, Uber and Lyft — the two biggest ride-hailing companies — both argued against a Class 4 licence, saying a standard Class 5 driver’s licence should be adequate.

But Trevena said it’s about keeping passengers safe.

“If your kid is getting into an Uber or a Lyft, you want to know they have the safest possible driver,” Trevena said. “That’s why we’re sticking with Class 4.”

The Opposition Liberals say the government is just trying to protect the taxi industry from new competition.

“The fix is in,” said Liberal MLA Jas Johal. “This is all about keeping Uber and Lyft out and pleasing the taxi lobby.”

LISTEN: This week on In The House, Mike Smyth and Rob Shaw discuss the B.C. Green Party’s effective and harsh criticism of the new NDP legislation on LNG, the questions left unanswered after a new report on ride-hailing and the politics being played with big changes and caps to auto insurance.

But it’s tough to stifle a gag reflex while listening to the Liberals on this one. They had years in power to deliver Uber and Lyft and were just as obedient to the powerful taxi cartel as the NDP.

I also think the focus on licensing is overshadowing the bigger issues in this fight.

Despite their bluster, I doubt Uber and Lyft will bail out on B.C. if the government insists on a Class 4 licence for their drivers. There are lots of would-be Uber drivers out there willing to jump through the extra hoops.

The bigger threat to Uber and Lyft is the government’s plan to place a strict cap on the number of ride-hailing drivers allowed on the road. An all-party committee of the legislature this week recommended no maximum limit on the number of ride-hailing drivers, but Trevena is evasive on the point.

“We’re going to be working with the Passenger Transportation Board on flexibility to ensure that people can get rides when they want, where they want,” Trevena said.

So does that mean caps or not?

“We’re looking at all options,” she said.

The government is also still deciding whether ride-hailing companies will face operational boundaries or government price controls on their fares.

Trevena promised again that ride-hailing will finally arrive by the end of the year. But there are still many ways the government can screw this up.

During the budget presentation in Victoria ...","British Columbian families will be forking out about $687 more to the government this year, so don’t let politicians tell you there are no new taxes.

During the budget presentation in Victoria, the NDP-Green government said we aren’t getting tax hikes this time around, delivering what many called a “nothing budget” — but that’s far from the case.

Don’t believe it? Let’s add up the bills and take a look at the total.

ICBC rates are going up this year by an average of $133 per driver for the basic rate. For a two-vehicle household, that’s an extra $266 per year. The government still hasn’t released its optional rate increase, which could be in the double digits. (The Canadian Taxpayers Federation has filed a freedom-of-information request to find out how much the optional rate increase will cost.)

The government will argue that insurance premiums aren’t a tax. In most places, they’re not. But in B.C., ICBC is a monopoly. British Columbians aren’t allowed to shop around for the best price on insurance. That makes ICBC rate hikes a lot more like taxes than premiums.

The B.C. carbon tax is being jacked up again to $40 per tonne, translating to a hike of 9.8 cents per litre of gasoline, including the GST tacked on top of the tax. If you have a two-vehicle household with a Toyota Camry and Dodge Ram and you fill up once a week, this hike to the B.C. carbon tax is going to cost your family an extra $146 per year for commuting to work, dropping the kids off at school and driving to the grocery store.

Tax-hike subtotal: For insurance on our vehicles and the carbon taxes to fill them up, our bills are going up by $412 for the year.

If this family lives in Langley and they pay the Metro Vancouver TransLink tax on gasoline, which is being hiked another 1.5 cents per litre of gasoline, that means they will pay an extra $146 per year.

Tax-hike subtotal: $558 more per year thanks to this government, and we’re not even out of the car yet.

Average households will pay an extra $21.75 on their natural gas bills thanks to this carbon tax hike, so it will cost you more to heat your home and cook your meals.

Tax-hike subtotal for driving, heating and eating in B.C.: $579.75.

The carbon tax and ICBC aren’t the only tax and rate hikes this year. The Employer Health Tax, EHT, has kicked in, on top of the Medical Services Premium. Most job creators with a payroll of more than $500,000 per year need to pay this new tax. The City of Vancouver is jacking up property taxes by 4.5 per cent in 2019, with an average increase of $108 per year per household, largely because of the EHT also hitting municipalities.

For many employers in B.C., the EHT is a quadruple tax kick.

The Canadian Taxpayers Federation has spoken with small-business people who are getting hit hard. First, they already pay the MSP. Second, they are being forced to pay the new EHT. Third, since municipalities need to pay the EHT, that means the job creator’s business location is getting a property tax hike. And fourth, business owners also face a personal property tax hike on their homes. That’s getting taxed four ways from Sunday for the sin of employing people in this province.

All told, this year’s tax increases will cost your household an average of $687 more.

When provincial politicians tell you that they aren’t costing you more this year, do the math and hold on to your wallet, because their promise is as good as three-dollar bill.

The writer makes excellent points, but there is still much to celebrate in “Together B.C.” A progressive change sounded the death knell of one of the most diabolical pieces of legislation ever to hit the political history books.

article continues below

Minister Shane Simpson’s poverty-reduction plan states the following measure: “Ending early CPP: Currently people between the ages of 60 and 64 who access assistance are forced to take early pension payments with the Canada Pension Plan. Because there are financial penalties for accessing these retirement benefits early, we will eliminate that requirement.”

That law, enacted during the welfare “slash and burn” days of Mike Harcourt’s NDP government, has been causing hardship, suffering and financial losses to our poorest and most vulnerable citizens for more than 20 years. Its demise is a massive grassroots victory for people, including myself, who voiced strong opposition to the policy.

While I am happy for present clients spared the hell of that legislation, where’s the justice for those of us still in chains because of it? The “financial penalties” for me are lifelong: An almost 40 per cent reduction in my monthly CPP payments and lowered GIS payments due to the extra pension income forced upon me.

The B.C. NDP owes the victims restitution for all the money they lost in the past because of the CPP policy, and it should end all ongoing financial losses to ex-clients by allowing them to cancel the CPP applications completed under duress and reapply at the optimal rate in their own time.

The NDP government made the announcement Thursday, though most of the details released were already known. British Columbians will no longer pay the MSP premiums as of Jan. 1, 2020.

The MSP program will continue to provide health benefits, and residents of the province are still expected to enrol.

The government estimates the move will save about $900 a year for individuals and up to $1,800 a year for families.

Under the title ""Medicare Protection Amendment Act 2019,"" the NDP would take out sections of the previous act related to the premiums.

The legislation would also amend parts of the act that give power to the Medical Services Commission, a nine-member board that sets and collects premiums.

The MSC will continue its other responsibilities, including enrolment of residents in MSP and collecting unpaid bills, the province said in a statement.

""After years of MSP premium increases, our government is proud to be moving forward in meeting our promise to end this regressive tax,"" Health Minister Adrian Dix said in the statement.

""Through this legislation, our government will eliminate MSP premiums in January 2020 and make life more affordable for British Columbians.""

You’ll hear this ad nauseam during this Alberta campaign: the race will be fought and won in Calgary. But if Rachel Notley somehow retains her hold on Cowtown yet loses her stranglehold on the ridings around Edmonton—“the donut,” as some campaigners know it—her government is still toast.

Rather than launching in the provincial capital (and her hometown), Notley announced the April 16 election in Calgary. The NDP won 15 of the city’s 25 seats last time. The party can afford to lose only eight in the province to retain a majority in the 87 seat legislature. Keep that number eight in mind: she has nine seats to defend in the bedroom communities and “rurban” areas that circle Edmonton, including mid-sized cities Sherwood Park, Spruce Grove and St. Albert. Think of it like Toronto and the 905—they’re demographically and culturally distinct, but a successful party can win both.

Notley did so in 2015. She swept Edmonton and most of the outlying area: you have to drive far in most directions from downtown’s Jasper Avenue to get to UCP country. Jason Kenney’s fight to retake the region starts in the donut, where 2015 NDP victories were narrower and the electorate is more blue-collar, and then the party chews its way into Edmonton via the suburbs. Small wonder that Kenney’s Day 1 began with an announcement in industrial Leduc, just south of the city, and ended with a rally downtown.

Polls show the UCP close or tied to the NDP in the capital region, which means Notley has work to do the surrounding smaller towns that often crave visits from party leaders, and can reward them with big front-page photos in the local newspapers. Notley made several spending announcements for road expansions and industrial projects before the campaign, but didn’t venture outside Edmonton in Week 1. She’s scheduled to give the donut some attention next week. Her candidates will be grateful.

Kenney vs. “the modern world”

Jason Kenney encountered furor from many corners for his pledge to replace the NDP’s bill to protect gay-straight alliances with a weaker one from the bygone Tory days. He maintains it’s still the most generous in Canada, but it erases rules on publicly declared LGBTQ-friendly policies in private schools, and which limit teachers’ abilities to inform parents their kids are in the peer support groups—a policy the NDP enacted to limit risk of schools outing students as gay.

LGBTQ rights advocates, other party leaders and the Alberta Teachers Association denounced the UCP’s plan as dangerous and retrograde. A normally pro-Kenney voice may have been heard loudest, though. National talk-radio host Charles Adler, a conservative who considers Kenney a friend and often lionizes him, spent much of Tuesday night’s show with guests who warned about grave harms to at-risk youth if Kenney enacts this reform. Adler seemed to fight back tears throughout his program. “Modern-day democratic parties in the modern world don’t roll back rights and don’t roll back protections for minorities,” Adler said.

The new foe: some Toronto councillor

A key undercurrent in Alberta’s political mood is the external menaces to its oil prosperity. Enter Toronto city councillor Mike Layton, stage left, pursued by sabre-rattling Conservative. Layton, son of former NDP leader Jack Layton, has proposed Toronto consider launching a class-action lawsuit against oil companies to recover the costs of climate change costs, as New York and San Francisco have attempted.

In an Alberta feeling besieged and alienated with its oil pipelines consistently thwarted, them’s fightin’ words. Kenney brandished a letter he’s written to Toronto’s mayor about this being divisive and “injurious to national unity.” He read parts aloud at an unrelated news conference. “Albertans are tired of being a punching bag for virtue signalling political efforts that seek to apply a higher standard to our oil than OPEC oil or other sectors in our economy,” he said about a proposal that seems to not single out western Canada’s oil over any foreign entity’s. Later on Tuesday evening, Notley tweeted her own displeasure, not wanting to be seen as squishier than her rival on defence-of-oil postures.

Saying ""the cat's out of the bag"", Smithers Mayor Taylor Bachrach announced on Facebook yesterday that he's running to be the next NDP candidacy in Skeena-Bulkley Valley.

Bachrach says he wants to ensure the voices of the northwest are heard when decisions are made affecting the region.

He says he also wants to bring people together.

""Unfortunately more and more we see a politics of division and contempt and I don't think that's the way we move forward together. I believe that we need to show respect for each other, regardless of our differences and regardless of whether we agree -- in fact, maybe especially when we disagree,"" he said.



Bachrach began his political career 11 years ago when he was elected as a councillor in Telkwa -- he then ran successfully for the mayor's chair in Smithers in 2011.

The riding has been held by New Democrat Nathan Cullen since 2004, but at the beginning of this month, Cullen announced he would not run for re-election in October.



The NDP riding association hasn't announced a date yet for a candidate selection meeting.

Liberals frustrate NDP again over SNC Lavalin scandal

The federal New Democrats are frustrated about what they insist is a lack of transparency in Ottawa after the Liberals again shut down debate over the SNC Lavalin controversy.

On Tuesday, Essex MP Tracey Ramsey requested the Ethics Committee investigate alleged interference from the Prime Minister’s Office. She had hoped the committee would agree to hear testimony from former attorney general Jody Wilson Raybould and former Treasury Board President Jane Philpott.

Instead, the Liberals used their majority on the committee to reject the motion.

The NDP had been counting on a yes vote from Liberal MP Nathaniel Erskin-Smith who had supported calls for an independent public inquiry, but instead, he voted Nay.

According to the Globe and Mail, he called the motion premature, saying MPs should wait until Wilson-Raybould’s written submission is provided to the Justice Committee. He also pointed out that the Ethics Commissioner is already investigating the SNC Lavalin scandal.

Last month, the federal cabinet approved a waiver to lift cabinet confidentiality and solicitor-client privilege regarding the conversations that took place while Wilson-Raybould was attorney-general, but it does not apply to the criminal prosecution, and only applies to the Justice Committee.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had told reporters there was no need to grant a second waiver since the Justice Committee had a “full airing”.

“Canadians are having a crisis of confidence in Justin Trudeau and his Liberal government,” said Ramsey. “If nothing inappropriate happened, then the prime minister has to give permission to the former attorney general and former president of the treasury board to tell their full story to Canadians.”

Both opposition parties want Wilson-Raybould and Philpott to tell their stories with no restrictions.

The controversy erupted when Wilson-Raybould claimed she was pressured to help the giant Quebec engineering company avoid criminal prosecution in connection to bribery allegations in Libya.

New Democrat Opposition leader Ryan Meili needs to pick a lane ...","For an Opposition already driving rather erratically, Wednesday’s 2019-20 Saskatchewan budget won’t make their trip any easier.

New Democrat Opposition leader Ryan Meili needs to pick a lane — preferably, one not on the left-hand side of the road where he risks slamming into on-coming traffic. In Saskatchewan, we don’t normally drive on the left side. Meili, who has a natural tendency to drift left, needs to present a better argument why we should. Wednesday’s budget won’t help him make that case.

This is not to suggest Finance Minister Donna Harpauer’s budget was especially left wing, nor is it that there isn’t anything to criticize. No budget is bullet-proof.

A great starting point for an Opposition that vowed to make this spring sitting all about kids might have been to observe advanced education spending went nowhere, and whether K-12 truly got anything more than commitments to replace a few schools.

Education was one of the last things Meili noted in his embargoed press conference Wednesday. Instead, he questioned whether the budget was really balanced and whether the public debt was too high.

To be clear, public debt increasing to $21.7 billion by the end of the 2019-20 budget year and to as much as $26 billion by March 2023 is an issue.

But budgets for both governments and oppositions quickly become all about making your case as to whether the financial plan does or does not work. For the Opposition, that means focusing on a consistent theme and sticking to it.

Ryan Meili is not leading the budget criticism because he’s swerving all over the place. Pick a lane, sir.

In Thursday morning’s question period, Meili opened up by chastising the government for it’s “mission accomplished” and “strange sort of self-congratulations”. “This was a budget with a huge deficit … (although) maybe not by an accounting deficit.” Huh?

Sure, governments are always far too self-congratulatory, but this was a budget that had the Saskatchewan Association for Applied Behaviour Analysis (Sask-ABA) offering congratulations “for increasing the amount of funding available to families of autistic children under the age of 6”. It had the Saskatchewan representative of the Canadian Mental Health Association calling the additional $30 million for mental health funding a good first step.

These stakeholders aren’t Saskatchewan Party government cheerleaders. Many of them have come to the legislature — often, accompanied by the NDP — with specific spending requests. Many such requests were met Wednesday.

(Interestingly, one of the NDP’s traditional allies — the Saskatchewan Government and General Employees Union — was talking Wednesday about government getting a bigger share of cannabis profits. Why? Well, maybe because the list of 2019-20 government employees released Wednesday show only six less full-time jobs.)

One of Meili’s more telling comments was his suggestion the Sask. Party stole NDP ideas. Indeed they did: Mental health, focusing on highway intersection safety as opposed to more visible and popular paving, and a royalty rate review so that potash companies paid a fairer share through royalties.

So unbeknownst to potash companies like Nutrien, which seemed rather unhappy, the Sask. Party government changed outdated incentive programs, enabling it collect an additional $117 million for provincial coffers. New Democrat finance critic Trent Wotherspoon in his budget reply Thursday morning described this as a shoddy way to treat world-class companies. Again; huh?

Finally, you need a ballpark explanation of what you would do differently if you are going to clamour for balanced budgets and lower debt. Meili’s response Wednesday was it’s too early to have that conversation. A third time: Huh?

The Dominion Bond Rating Service credit rating agency issued a statement Thursday morning suggesting the Sask. Party government “has fulfilled its three-year commitment to balance the provincial budget” — this despite DBRS’s own misgivings about whether it’s a balanced budget in 2019-20 when you properly account for capital spending.

So where does Meili’s “off-balance” criticism go? What would he do differently from a government that stole his ideas? How would his ambitious spending agenda lower the debt?

What is Meili driving at?

Former Liberal ministers Jody Wilson-Raybould, leff, and Jane Philpott have quit cabinet but remain in the federal caucus. ( Sean Kilpatrick / THE CANADIAN PRESS )

If Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott’s motives were pure, they would be following her lead. It makes no sense to claim non-confidence in the government and stay in caucus. Caucus is the legislative branch of government, empowered to act on cabinet’s executive direction. Cabinet and caucus go hand in hand. You can’t have one without the other.

Article Continued Below

A caucus is a place where members speak freely without fear of public broadcast or leaks. Trust is an important part of building political confidence. Opposing view: Should dissident Liberals stay in caucus? Yes Neither former minister trusts Trudeau, and the feeling is mutual. I have received dozens of communications from Liberal caucus members who do not feel comfortable speaking freely in the presence of two members engaged in derailing their leader. In every profession, people work with colleagues whom they may not like. Former Prime Minister Jean Chrétien and his finance minister, Paul Martin, were not exactly bosom buddies. But together they produced results. But not being friends, and working actively to dislodge your leader, are two different things.

The Big Debate

Philpott claims there is more to come. Their ongoing whisper campaign is strengthened by their presence inside the Liberal tent. Once departed, the bleeding would be cauterized very quickly. Canadian Liberal parliamentarians could learn from long-serving American politician Mo Udall. The self-described one-eyed Mormon Democrat from Conservative Iowa once said, “When the Democratic Party forms a firing squad, we form a circle.”

Article Continued Below

The firing squad facing Justin Trudeau is just such a circle. The leaks did not come from the opposition. Nor did they stop with an unprecedented invitation to speak to cabinet and more than four hours of justice committee testimony. When is enough, enough? Both women want this issue in the headlines, but refuse to avail themselves of their right to speak in Parliament, protected by privilege. If they stayed, it wouldn’t be the first time enemies worked together. But participating in caucus involves speaking and listening, something that Wilson-Raybould does not appear to embrace. THE BIG DEBATE: For more opposing view columns from Toronto Star contributors, click here. A former Vancouver riding president said they parted company because of her unbridled resistance to listen to anyone. During her parliamentary committee testimony, Wilson-Raybould produced copious notes from assistants. But she could not name a single colleague with whom she had consulted on the deferred prosecution agreement question. The self-described truth teller did not tell the whole truth about her cabinet move to veterans affairs. The prime minister asked her to lead the dissolution of the Indian Act as minister of Indigenous services, an offer she conveniently omitted from her lengthy testimony. The offer was subsequently compared to having Nelson Mandela administer apartheid. She is no Nelson Mandela. He embraced the challenge to dismantle apartheid. She spurned it. Philpott’s explosive Maclean’s interview also confirmed that Wilson-Raybould did not complain to the prime minister about undue pressure. So what is the end game? Just last week, Wilson-Raybould penned a 684-word letter to constituents. She confirmed that she “currently” plans to run for the Liberals in the next election. This bizarre descriptor was the only Liberal mention made, even though the letter was supposed to explain her decision to stay. Wilson-Raybould went to great lengths to explain how she was so different from other self-serving politicians who came before her, writing “I found myself in a situation I never expected to be in. I was just doing my job, and I did not expect it to become a national focus.” That statement is a blatant lie as personal details leaked to the Globe and Mail could only have come, directly or indirectly, from her. Philpott and Wilson-Raybould refuse to leave the caucus. Instead, from the inside, they co-ordinate a full court assault on the leader. Another Udall aphorism outlines the difference between a cactus and a caucus. “On a cactus, the pricks are on the outside.” This caucus must be pruned. Sheila Copps is the former Liberal heritage minister, environment minister and deputy prime minister of Canada.

He dragged along Bernadette Jordan, the minister of rural economic development, in order to give the Nova Scotian a little positive press instead of having to hear the vitriol being hurled around Ottawa over the Lavscam scandal.

And, it conveniently got Justin Trudeau the hell out of Dodge, too, although he did make a fool of himself the night before when he yelled out, “Thank you for your donation” to a fundraiser crasher in Toronto who was protesting the decades of mercury poisoning at the Grassy Narrows First Nations reserve.

But we have grown to expect such arrogant flippancy from our leader.

The Trudeau Liberals are desperately trying to turn the page on the SNC-Lavalin cockup, of course — the cabinet resignations of marquee players like Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, the abrupt “retirement” of Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, as well as Trudeau’s principal secretary Gerald Butts martyring himself in an attempt to save Trudeau from his sorry self — and move on to discuss, or at least remember, that there was a budget recently tabled.

There were approximately 400 pages in that budget, if memory serves, so it is not something to just toss in the recycling bin with a thud, walk away, and then forget that it ever existed.

There’s supposedly very important stuff in that document, the kind of stuff the Trudeau Liberals would love to ride to victory in October’s election if that pesky two-month-old Lavscam controversy would simply dry up.

But it’s hanging on like a bad rash.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau, the blue-chip Bay St. chap who tabled that budget, and who has been out in the hustings promoting how the Liberals are fighting for the middle class “and those who want to join it,” started the week on Global TV’s The West Block, defending himself to host Mercedes Stephenson from assaults coming from the big shots in business that he “failed to address the fundamental issues” facing Canadian companies.

It was the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, after all, and not some backwater organizational rube, that accused him of not doing enough to help businesses become more globally competitive.

“I don’t agree with them at all,” said Morneau, stating there were measures in the budget that propose to make it a lot easier for Canadian companies to attract and train the employees who will ultimately enhance their bottom lines.

The key word, of course, is “propose.”

If the Trudeau Liberals are not re-elected, well, it all dies on the vine, including the pharmacare measures that will supposedly assist geezers like me as we make our way towards the inevitability of eternal rest.

In between pitching the positives in his budget, Morneau attended a $500-a-plate fundraiser in Edmonton to support the local Liberal riding association, as other highfalutin Liberals fanned out across the country to trumpet the budget.

Like Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor; Employment Minister Patty Hajdu; Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau; Social Development Minister Jean-Yves Duclos; Treasury Board President Joyce Murray; Seniors Minister Filomena Tassi in Nanaimo; and Public Services Minister Carla Qualtrough.

That’s a lot of Liberals trying to turn the page.

But, then again, their political lives depend on it.

On Monday evening, hours after Manitoba Chief Justice Glenn D. Joyal got dragged into the mess for no good reason — pending further excavations — she finally hit rock bottom.

Joyal is a highly respected jurist who had been shortlisted by a non-partisan committee for appointment to the Supreme Court. But in Copps’ telling he is “homophonic (sic), anti-abortion (and) anti-Charter” — and former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, for some crazy reason, wanted to make him Chief Justice.

To the extent that’s based on anything, it’s on accounts by anonymous sources to CTV News and Canadian Press alleging Wilson-Raybould and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau very much disagreed on the appointment.

Former AG decries release of CONFIDENTIAL (her caps) discussions re. Trudeau’s refusal to support her recommendation of a homophonic, anti-abortion, anti-Charter Chief Justice. Who released CONFIDENTIAL details of her discussion with the PM 7 weeks ago? — Hon. Sheila Copps (@Sheila_Copps) March 26, 2019

Well, I say “alleging.” It’s not actually controversial: No one disputes the appointment was ultimately the PM’s to make, or that the justice minister was allowed to have her opinions. No, this is just sort of an FYI leak. People thought we should know that Wilson-Raybould supported a Supreme Court candidate whom Trudeau worried (per CTV correspondent Glen McGregor) “wasn’t committed to protecting rights that have flown out of interpretation of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, particularly LGBTQ2 rights and even abortion access.”

“Well-placed sources say the former justice minister’s choice for chief justice was a moment of ‘significant disagreement’ with Trudeau, who has touted the Liberals as ‘the party of the Charter’,” Joan Bryden reported for CP. “Internal discussions about a Supreme Court appointment … are typically considered highly confidential,” Bryden added. But, you know, Anonymous Sources just thought we should know Trudeau had done his research, and had come across a speech Joyal gave to the Canadian Constitution Foundation in 2017.

In that speech, he soberly explains his entirely mainstream concerns that Canadian courts have over the years progressively asserted a policy-making dominance over the legislatures that the Charter’s framers had never intended, and with some deleterious effects to the country’s “political culture.” Perhaps Trudeau might also have come across Joyal’s 1993 Master’s thesis from the University of Manitoba, in which he makes similar arguments and analyzes R v. Morgentaler, among other cases.

“Irrespective of one’s position on the excessively difficult substantive issue, abortion like capital punishment was undeniably one of the two subjects mentioned in the discussion before the Parliamentary committee about which it was assured that such substantive outcomes would be left to Parliament,” he wrote in his thesis. If stakeholders had known what Charter cases would look like in 35 years, in other words, we might not even have the Charter.

Joyal doesn’t ever seem to have articulated a personal position on abortion. I can’t find a word he’s said about same-sex marriage in any context. To imply such a person is unfit for the bench is outrageous. To impute from his analysis of R v. Morgentaler that he’s anti-abortion and homophobic is almost parodic demagoguery. It makes “Why do you hate the troops?” look like something out of Plato’s Republic. As for “anti-Charter”: “Put simply,” Joyal told the CCF, “as a foundational part of Canada’s constitutional architecture, the Charter deserves our respect and demands our compliance.”

Many Canadians seem to truly believe that Margaret Atwood’s Gilead is but one misplaced ballot and one moderately conservative judge away

This is all a brand new low for the Anonymous Sources. But it’s entirely typically Liberal thinking, as well: “Joyal has concerns about judicial overreach. Therefore he is a conservative. Conservatives hate abortion and gay people. Ergo Joyal applied to sit on the Supreme Court in hopes of repealing R v. Morgentaler and the same-sex marriage reference and goodness only knows what else. QED.

“So obvious and appalling is this, furthermore, that we must suspect Jody Wilson-Raybould of holding similar hidden aspirations — or at the very least of woeful incompetence.”

After 10 years of Stephen Harper doing nothing on abortion, and with Andrew Scheer understandably pledging to continue doing nothing, many Canadians seem to truly believe that Margaret Atwood’s Gilead is but one misplaced ballot and one moderately conservative judge away. Three-quarters of Canadians now think it’s “great that … two people of the same sex can get married,” according to a 2017 CROP poll — up from just 41 per cent 20 years earlier. No one is challenging same-sex marriage in court. No prominent Conservative politician has made a peep about it in at least a decade. But the Anonymous Sources want us to believe the Chief Justice of Manitoba poses a mortal threat to marriage equality.

Incidentally, one of the deleterious effects of Canadians becoming so used to “judicial adjudication of political and social issues,” Joyal argued in his CCF speech, is that there is “less room for long-term legislative results and solutions premised upon the tools of negotiation, persuasion, bargaining and compromise.” Whatever the disease, the symptoms are acute. Ideally, the utter shabbiness of the Liberals’ behaviour since the Lavalin story broke might help wake us from this never-ending paranoid fever dream that passes for election-year politics.

The coalition has been strongly opposed to controversial Liberal gun-control legislation, Bill C-71, while the sporting arms group has advocated for firearm businesses and ...","Canada’s armed forces, the RCMP and the Canada Border Services agency spent a total of $158,000 to send 42 employees to what’s billed as the biggest small arms show in the world last January.

In a written question in the Commons, B.C. Conservative MP Todd Doherty asked for expenditure details about federal employees who were “sent” to the annual SHOT Show in Las Vegas, Nev.

The annual exhibit, held in the sprawling Sands Expo Centre on the outskirts of the city’s downtown casinos, is limited to representatives from armed forces, police services, tactical police units, the gun industry and related associations. It is not an event open to the general public, and no one under age 16 is allowed in.

The annual event is put on each year by the U.S. National Shooting Sports Foundation — a lobbying arm for the U.S. Firearms Industry Trade Association. The industry generates $13.6 billion annually manufacturing small arms and ammunition in the U.S. and another $3.1 billion at the retail end.

Attendance to the Vegas trade show has grown to more than 62,000 from around the world. The events website totals over 500 suppliers, with more than 1,600 exhibitors.

Under the rules of procedure for government responses to the order paper questions from MPs, all departments had to submit responses to the question under Doherty’s name.

Only three departments or services responded that employees had attended the mammoth Jan. 22 to 25 exhibit — the Department of National Defence and Canadian Armed Forces, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canada Border Services Agency.

The amount spent by all three branches on flights, accommodation, meals and other costs totalled $158,431, with the DND contingent accounting for the lion’s share of the expenses, reporting $130,961 in costs. An RCMP troop of three Mounties who attended submitted expenses totalling $10,992 while expenses for five CBSA agents who also attended came to $16,478.

Doherty did not respond to a request for an interview for this story. His office connected iPolitics with Mathew Clancy, a press secretary for the Conservative shadow cabinet in the House of Commons. Clancy, by email, responded on behalf of Quebec MP Pierre Paul-Hus, the party’s critic for public safety.

“It is unacceptable that Justin Trudeau’s government sent dozens of public servants and spent hundreds of thousands of taxpayers’ dollars to attend a conference in Las Vegas,” Clancy’s email said. “This is yet again another example of Justin Trudeau’s lack of respect for Canadian taxpayer dollars,” Clancy quoted Paul-Hus as saying.

Word that the government agencies assigned personnel to the show spread quickly. Doherty, or a member of the Conservative caucus research bureau on his behalf, tabled the written question about government expenditures for the show on Jan. 29 — the first Commons sitting day after the show ended.

There were at least two other Canadians related to the arms industry who also attended the arms bazaar: Rod Giltaca, founder and head of the fledgling Canadian Coalition for Firearms Rights and a qualified firearms licence instructor, and Alison de Groot, managing director of the Canadian Sporting Arms and Ammunition Association.

The coalition has been strongly opposed to controversial Liberal gun-control legislation, Bill C-71, while the sporting arms group has advocated for firearm businesses and retailers as the bill has made its way through Parliament.

All three government branches responded to Doherty’s request for department rationale for sending personnel to the event.

The RCMP response explained that federal cabinet and Treasury Board had approved ongoing funding for the annual RCMP attendance at the trade show in 2005. The response did not mention it, but a Liberal government was in place at the time.

Two of the Mounties who participated are with the RCMP Specialized Firearms Support Services Unit, which the response described as the “policy centre” for national firearm classification in Canada.

The unit is responsible for development and maintenance of the Firearms Reference Table, a national database accessible only to licensed firearm businesses and firearm officers. The response describes the database as the “most comprehensive, single-source firearms reference in existence” and said it is used by law enforcement and other agencies in 190 countries via Interpol.

The other participant in the Mountie contingent was the senior armourer and technical authority for the RCMP’s National Armoury Program, which approves all firearms and accessories procured by the national police force.

The Canada Border Services Agency said its agents focused on knowledge of trends, innovations and health and safety regulations, as well as shooting range design, development and maintenance. The CBSA is still monitoring and reviewing the use of sidearms by its agents at borders, in a program that began in 2006.

By publication time, the Department of National Defence and Canadian Armed Forces had not yet responded to questions about its contingent, but pointed to the rationale the department explained in its response to Doherty’s question.

“These employees attended the event to improve corporate knowledge of innovation within the industries of small arms, ammunition and accessories for law enforcement and military applications, and to meet with different vendors,” the department’s House of Commons response said.

The department later provided a lengthy explanation of personnel work at the exhibit.

The Department of National Defence and Canadian Armed Forces contingent included staff from the department’s science and technology branch, the assistant deputy minister of materiel branch, the Canadian Army and the Canadian Special Operations Forces Command.

The group included members of a coalition project involving Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States that is developing a new-generation digital night vision goggle. A senior technician from the same branch attended to view new technology involving day and night vision rifle scopes.

Another member came from the Canadian Army Infantry School Sniper cell, while members of a Force Development team responsible for next generation weapons, ammunition and optic systems also attended.

“While no purchases were made directly as a result of attending the SHOT Show, attendance at these types of events helps to ensure that the CAF remains a first-class military, ready to face the challenges of the 21st century by helping to identify and target the requirements of the CAF,” said media liaison officer Daniel Lebouthillier.",Tories blame Liberals for federal spending on Las Vegas arms show,iPolitics,https://ipolitics.ca/2019/03/26/tories-blame-liberals-for-federal-spending-on-las-vegas-arms-show/

The Liberal majority on the committee voted down a motion backed by Conservatives and New Democrats that would have seen former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott testify about the controversy.

“The coverup continues,” Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre said after the meeting ended.

Wilson-Raybould told the justice House of Commons justice committee last month that she was pressured by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his senior advisers and senior ad visors to the finance minister, to overrule the decision by the director of public prosecutions not to negotiate a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin rather than proceed to a criminal trial on fraud charges.

She believes she was shuffled out of justice in January because she wouldn’t change her mind.

Trudeau has denied anything improper occurred but has been unable to change the channel from the saga that has badly hurt his public image. He said the whole thing boils down to a breakdown in trust between him, his aides and Wilson-Raybould.

During the almost two-hour-long meeting Tuesday, Conservatives and New Democrats urged their Liberal colleagues to put partisan issues aside and agree to have the ethics committee take on the probe after the Liberals ended the justice committee’s investigation last week.

Liberal MP Nathaniel Ermine-Smith, who voted in favour of an NDP motion in February to hold a public inquiry on the matter, said at the ethics committee Tuesday a new probe may only result in relitigating what has already been said at the unless the two former cabinet ministers were granted wider waivers to testify on the issue.

Trudeau has not indicated any willingness to do that saying the waivers were already unprecedented and allowed for the facts relevant to the matter at hand to be made public.

The justice committee heard from 10 witnesses over five meetings but opposition parties say Wilson-Raybould named 11 people who she felt crossed the line and all of them should be asked to testify. Only two of those people were among the witnesses the justice committee did hear from.

Trudeau faced renewed questions about the controversy during a morning event in Winnipeg where he was trying to promote his government’s budget introduced one week ago. He would not, however, say whether he rejected Wilson-Raybould’s 2017 recommendation for chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada.

Sources told The Canadian Press that Trudeau turned down Wilson-Raybould’s recommendation that Glenn Joyal be elevated from chief justice of Manitoba’s Court of Queen’s Bench to chief justice of the Supreme Court over Joyal’s views on the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Shortly after Trudeau told Wilson-Raybould he did not support her choice, the sources said Joyal withdrew his name from consideration.

In a statement Monday, Joyal said he submitted an application for consideration for the Supreme Court in 2017, only to be forced to withdraw his name for personal reasons related to his wife’s health.

Instead, Trudeau appointed Sheila Martin to the high court and named Richard Wagner as chief justice. Former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper appointed Wagner to the high court.

Trudeau said Tuesday he would not discuss the matter nor would he say whether his office was involved in the leak of what is usually a highly confidential appointments process.

Trudeau said it is the prime minister’s choice of who to nominate for the Supreme Court, as well as for chief justice, and that Canadians can and should continue to have faith in their judicial system.

Speaking at the ethics committee meeting, Kent said the breach of a highly confidential judicial appointment process would warrant a parliamentary investigation on its own. He also said the story could compromise the integrity of the appointment process, and possibly some sitting justices.",Liberals deny second committee request to investigate alleged political interference in SNC-Lavalin case,Canoe.com,https://canoe.com/news/national/trudeau-stays-mum-on-clash-with-wilson-raybould-over-high-court-pick-info-leak

“The government of New Zealand has swiftly and responsibly responded to the atrocities…by almost immediately committing to ban the type of weapons that facilitate such extreme violence,” Natalie Provost told CBC News.

Provost is a survivor of the 1989 gun massacre at École Polytechnique in Montreal in which 14 women were shot and killed.

Provost’s view was echoed by Heidi Rathjen, a coordinator with the gun control group PolySeSouvient, in a CBC interview.

“The huge difference is that New Zealand is acting and Canada is not–and yet we have a government that promised to get handguns and assault weapons off our streets,” Rathjen said.

“The Liberals are so terrified of this. The public is in favour of a ban but they’re terrified of the gun lobby, which is extremely active and threatening in terms of elections and votes.”

New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, moved quickly following the mosque attacks, issuing a cabinet order that bans people in her country from owning semi-automatic firearms and semi-automatic firearms capable of use with a detachable magazine that holds more than five rounds.

She is also moving to a ban on gun accessories like bump stocks that enable a firearm to discharge ammunition faster.

Firearms commonly used by farmers and hunters, such as rifles with small, non-detachable magazines–will be permitted.

Canadian activists want Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government to pass what the activists see as mainly timid reforms in Bill C-71 and then move to more controversial changes, such as a handgun ban.

Possession of fully automatic firearms is prohibited in Canada, any would-be gun owner must submit to a background check and Canadians must register restricted firearms, including handguns, with police.

Although none of their biological parents is Canadian, Alexandra and Calder are Canadian citizens because they were born in the country, and their fathers say it's an important part of their heritage.","With two kids under two, the Berney-Edwards household in southeast England is a busy one. There are toddlers running all over the place. One pokes his dad in the eye and laughs before accidentally hitting his sister with a toy vacuum cleaner, causing her to wail. It can be a bit chaotic.

But Graeme and Simon Berney-Edwards wouldn't have it any other way. As gay men, there was a time when they thought they could never have any of that.

Now, however, they have their twins, the result of an arrangement involving a Canadian surrogate and Canadian surrogacy laws they feel are more progressive than those on the books in the United Kingdom.

""You see them tearing around and they're having fun, and just for a moment, you just sort of step back and go 'Wow, this is it. They're here,' "" Simon Berney-Edwards said in an interview at their home in Redhill, south of London.

""It can be very surreal,"" his husband Graeme Berney-Edwards chimed in.

When they decided surrogacy was the way they would have a family, they reached out to a surrogacy organization that helped them understand their options.

That organization connected them with a clinic in Las Vegas where in vitro fertilization took place. That's also where they learned they could have twins and each be a biological father to one child by fertilizing half of their American donor's eggs with Simon's sperm, the other half with Graeme's sperm, and then implanting the embryos in the same surrogate.

It means Alexandra and Calder, now 21 months old, are twins but only half-siblings. Born just minutes apart, they have the same biological mother, but different fathers.

They quickly chose to have the birth take place in Canada rather the U.K. That was because, they say, the surrogacy laws in their country are dated, primarily as a result of the U.K. considering the surrogate, and her partner, if she has one, to be the legal parents for the first six weeks of the child's life.

""And in that time, if the surrogate decides to change their mind, you have no recourse,"" said Simon Berney-Edwards. ""Basically, that's it. Your child is gone.""

Andrew Spearman, a British fertility and surrogacy lawyer, said the U.K. laws are ""archaic"" and that many of his clients turn to Canada for surrogacy.

""I think it gives an element of certainty. It gives the transparency, which we can't offer always, and it gives a very clear structure,"" he said in his London office.

Graeme and Simon Berney-Edwards were pleased to welcome their twins in Hamilton on June 25, 2017. (Submitted by Simon Berney-Edwards)

Spearman said while U.K. surrogates and intended parents do draw up contracts outlining their agreement, the contracts aren't legally binding as they are in Canada.

Neither country allows surrogates to be paid, other than to cover their expenses, which Spearman said helps British parents explain the process to English courts when they return home. They still need to get a ""parental order"" in the U.K. that makes them legal parents and gives their children U.K. citizenship.

The Berney-Edwards say they were also drawn to the altruistic nature of Canadian surrogacy because they wanted more than a ""transactional"" experience.

""We wanted someone that was prepared to be part of a family throughout the children growing up,"" said Graeme Berney-Edwards.

After consulting a website that has profiles of women wanting to be surrogates, they found that in Meg Stone of Hamilton, Ont. Stone said that's also what drew her to them.

""They mentioned that they wanted twins and I'm always up for a challenge,"" she said. ""And they also said they wanted lifelong friendship, which was also something I wanted.""

After a couple of false alarms that saw the dads dashing off to Canada early, Alexandra and Calder were born on June 25, 2017, in Hamilton, where they stayed for the first seven weeks of their lives.

Stone, who has two of her own children, has continued to watch the twins grow from afar, swapping messages and photos and even making the trip to England for the twins' first birthday.

Her 12-year-old son, Jeffrey Seroski-Stone, said he's proud of his mom for helping to create a family.

""I think it's exciting how my mom ended up helping them out by giving them children, and I think we usually have a really good time, so I consider them to be like family to me,"" he said.

Stone is pregnant with twins again, helping another same-sex family have children.

""I love being a mom and why wouldn't I want to help somebody else do that, too?"" she said.

She maintains she wouldn't want to be paid for helping others have children, but there is a debate in Canada about whether paying surrogates should be decriminalized.

Simon and Calder have fun at a park near their home in Redhill. (Kayla Hounsell/CBC)

The current Canadian law came into force in 2004 and prohibits paying surrogates other than to reimburse them for certain medical and maternity costs.

The federal government is reviewing the legislation, including identifying categories for reimbursement and making them more clear. A Liberal MP tabled a private member's bill that would decriminalize payments to surrogates but opponents say it amounts to commercializing a woman's body.

Stone disagrees with the idea that a surrogate be given the chance to change her mind, as is set out in the current U.K. law.

""I never felt like they were mine to give away,"" she said. ""They were [with] me to watch and nurture until Simon and Graeme were able to.""

The Berney-Edwards say when it comes to surrogacy law, Canada has it right, but that doesn't mean it was easy or cheap.

They won't put a figure on it, but experts say they would have spent tens of thousands of dollars on Stone's expenses, agency and legal fees, not to mention three trips back and forth to Canada.

""But it was worth it,"" said Simon.

""Every single penny, cent, was worth it,"" said Graeme.

Hajdu, who was in Saskatoon this week to promote what she signalled is likely to be a Liberal Party of Canada plank in the upcoming federal election, acknowledged that it’s too soon to say how much national pharmacare would cost or when it could be available.

She noted, however, that it has been on the government’s agenda since at least last year.

In his last budget, Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced the creation of an advisory council on national pharmacare. That group’s report is not expected until later this spring, but Morneau’s 2019 budget included more than $1 billion in new spending aimed at making drugs affordable.

That includes $35 million over four years to set up a Canadian Drug Agency to negotiate better drug prices and create a national formulary, and $1 billion over two years, beginning in 2022-23, to help people with rare diseases more easily acquire costly medications.

The budget also contemplated $500 million in ongoing annual spending beyond 2024-25 to help cover the cost of expensive drugs.

“Responsible leadership is about making investments in ways that are going to pay off long-term, and prevention is always a difficult argument because you can’t see it right away. You can’t actually see prevention the minute you spend,” Hajdu said.

“Is it in an election-year budget? Yes. Will it be in our platform? Yes. It’s the next logical step to the kinds of things that we’ve been investing in,” she added.

Hajdu made much the same pitch at a campaign-style event at a Saskatoon seniors’ home.

According to a Canadian Institute for Health Information study published last year, prescription drug spending in Canada was forecast to hit $33.7 billion in 2018, up four per cent from 2017. Around $14.4 billion of that total was expected to have been publicly funded.

The institute said in the same report that the 14 per cent of beneficiaries who received $2,500 or more from publicly-funded drug programs in 2017 accounted for 70 per cent of all public spending on pharmaceuticals.

Public drug programs paid $2,500 or more toward drug costs for 13.8 per cent of beneficiaries — 2.3 per cent received $10,000 or more — accounting for 69.7 per cent of all public drug spending, the institute said in the report.

In his budget, Morneau said the country’s “patchwork” of drug coverage, including more than 100 programs and 100,000 private insurance plans, “is not well equipped to handle the increasingly expensive drugs now coming to market.”

According to the government, the proposed Canadian Drug Agency could cut the cost of drugs by $3 billion per year.

It is not clear, however, what national pharmacare would look like. Hajdu said the new spending — in a budget with a deficit pegged at $19.8 billion and forecast to decline to $9.8 billion by 2023-24 — represents the “first steps” toward such a program.

While the Liberals have struggled in recent years to elect candidates in Saskatchewan — only one of the province’s 14 MPs, Ralph Goodale, represents the party in Ottawa — Hajdu said she hopes the new pitch will help pick up seats in the fall.

The federal government is not likely to be aided in that mission by the Saskatchewan government, which has wasted few opportunities to blast Ottawa for failing to stand up for oilpatch jobs and imposing a “job-killing” price on carbon.

289,Politics,2019-03-28T14:56:00.0000000Z,"If I had paid more attention to literally any of my Canadian public administration profs a decade ... and that the leak will actually be roundly applauded by the ambient cloud of Liberal and Liberal-adjacent opinion, which became self-aware this weekend ...","We have learned so much. Within minutes Monday afternoon, two good reporters had stories (here and here) about the Chief Justice of Manitoba, who was a candidate to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada and who, later, wasn’t. Both reporters unfurled similar yarns about a lone Prime Minister standing athwart the tide of conservatism by blocking—shudder—a Harper appointee from sitting on the top court. Jody Wilson-Raybould plays the role of villain in the piece.

Both reporters decorously neglect to mention that Trudeau’s choice for Chief Justice, Richard Wagner, was a Harper appointee.

There are many things we can say about this story, working outward in concentric rings from the thing itself. First, Glenn Joyal’s views, as expressed in speeches that were said to alarm the prime minister, are almost comically orthodox. I first became aware of the notion that Charter litigation systematically airlifts important matters from the parliamentary arena and into the realm of jurisprudence in a Chantal Hébert column in the late 1990s. If I had paid more attention to literally any of my Canadian public administration profs a decade earlier I would have caught the argument then, because it is canvassed in every Canadian political science class. This is not wild-eyed Hayekism.

Second, perhaps the many thousands of Canadians who have applied for federal government appointments under what they thought was a confidential process, introduced by this prime minister, will want to contemplate a class-action suit against him. Because it is now radiantly clear to each of them that their CV is being held hostage by a claque of embattled sorcerers’ apprentices who will cheerfully wheel it over the transom to any waiting scribe if anything about them—their opinions, a fallen political star’s unfortunate decision to argue for their advancement—becomes politically inconvenient. This is the very stuff of the police state.

It was immediately fashionable to wonder on social media how everyone would react if Stephen Harper had done such a thing. It’s germane to note that Stephen Harper never did. Because he had more class. Welcome to the Tet offensive of Charter rights: This was the week it became necessary to destroy the village of good government in order to save it.

Third, Justice Joyal’s wife was in poor health. Apparently we are to believe that 9,000 jobs depended on your knowing that.

If the Trudeau government is not the source of the leak, I assume we will see spectacular efforts deployed in the next 36 hours to find the leaker. Mark Norman-scale efforts. But I’m pretty sure that we needn’t hold our breath, because the government is the source of the leak; that the amiable chap who currently sits in the office once occupied by the Attorney General of Canada will not bestir himself to question Monday’s sickening attack on due process; and that the leak will actually be roundly applauded by the ambient cloud of Liberal and Liberal-adjacent opinion, which became self-aware this weekend and decided Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott are a virus endangering the party’s re-election chances and must therefore be stopped.

That’s right, it’s Judgment Day. As early as March 5, it was possible for Andrew Cohen to publish a column identifying Philpott and Wilson-Raybould as enemies of the (right-thinking) people. But not for the first time, Andrew was ahead of the moment, and when that column ran, he found few takers. The news that the Criminal Code had been amended in ways SNC-Lavalin found congenial as it faced a criminal trial for serious alleged misdeeds was interesting to millions of Canadians, including many Liberals. Justin Trudeau’s slow, tentative response was worrisome to lots of people who support the government, just as it was to many others. It was still possible for many minds to find room for both general support for Liberal re-election and general interest in what Wilson-Raybould and Philpott — recent Liberal rock stars, after all — had to say.

Then Maclean’s published my interview with Philpott last Thursday morning. On Thursday night’s At Issue panel, Chantal said that with Gerald Butts and Michael Wernick no longer working in government, Philpott and Wilson-Raybould were clearly looking for someone else to lose a job, and it must be Justin Trudeau. This interpretation became popular quickly (and probably would have even if Chantal hadn’t given it voice). By Saturday it was easy to find Liberals and friends of Liberals — pollsters, the odd political scientist, about half the party’s Ontario caucus — attributing the worst motives to the two former ministers. They were “infatuated with ephemeral attention,” said Frank Graves. They were committing “an attempted coup d’état,” wrote a lawyer with impressive credentials, Ishat Reza. This behaviour is, she added, “disqualifying.” This is understatement: Historical penalties for coup plotting have been harsher than exclusion from a governing caucus.

Qui veut noyer son chien l’accuse de la rage, we say in Quebec. When you want to drown your dog you say it has rabies.

This SNC-Lavalin business has been bewildering — honestly bewildering, in ways that are surely easy to understand — for many Canadians with good hearts since it began. It is an odd scandal by many standards. No money changed hands illegally, or at least not after the Qaddafis were executed. None of the assorted Liberal staffers and high officials who came at Jody Wilson-Raybould was seeking personal advancement, except insofar as many of them wanted to be on the winning side in an election and, she asserts, kept telling her so. They kept asking whether she’d seek outside advice on a decision that was the public prosecutor’s to make and the AG’s to review. When they were done asking, the prosecutor’s decision held. That would have been the end of that, if she hadn’t been shuffled. Then it became a duel of assertions and interpretations.

It’s easy to understand why all of this would seem minor and technical. An interesting theological debating point, but surely not worth more than a month of headlines and anguished commentary. So it didn’t get real, for many people, until Conservatives took the lead from Liberals in the polls — and Jane Philpott, whom Trudeau had been busy promoting in cabinet, announced that she too doesn’t like whatever she says she knows.

This puts the stakes high indeed. Everything Trudeau advocates is endangered, not by his own increasingly conspicuous limitations as a public administrator, but by the shorter route of a possible Conservative election victory this autumn. So it is all Liberal hands on deck. All of this is easy to understand.

I felt something like this was coming when I wrote, near the bottom of a column I wrote last November that was published in December, that an election is “the crudest possible instrument” for fixing serious shortcomings in public administration. It’s simply not true that if you don’t like something a government does you must replace it. But nor should re-electing the Liberals mean endorsing Justin Trudeau’s increasingly obvious flaws. The issues raised by the SNC-Lavalin controversy shouldn’t be settled by an election. Some misdeeds are worth dealing with as themselves, when they come up. And then let the election settle the election.

What is at stake in this affair is whether you can get the rules changed in mid-stream if you have the right friends or can hire them. Whether the decisions of competent professionals — beginning with an experienced prosecutor and defence lawyer, Kathleen Roussel — should be trumped by appeals to a preferred electoral outcome. This sort of system-rigging has been at the heart of, for instance, Poland’s confrontation with the European Union over judicial “reforms” that systematically benefit associates of the current regime. Reforms that are immensely popular among people who agree with the ruling party that they tilt the balance back toward fairness in a confrontation against political opponents they judge to be moral failures. Because it’s not only in Canada that you can win many arguments by saying, “Of course this helps our side, but that’s okay because our side is right.”

There’s a neat symmetry here. Jody Wilson-Raybould claimed she was approached, again and again, by people who said things had to work out a certain way because it was an election year. The emerging Liberal argument this month has been, not that this claim was untrue, but that of course it is true and should be. Wilson-Raybould and Philpott have sinned against a higher virtue so sure of itself that it cannot be troubled with the fine print. This sin is deemed disqualifying. They will soon be disqualified by their fellow Liberals, for the (synonymous) good of the party and the nation. And if you’ve sent your CV to Ottawa, have no fear. It probably won’t get leaked until it needs to be.

He also agreed with the Conservatives and denounced what seemed to be a deliberate leak to CTV and Canadian Press aimed at showing relations between the prime minister and Wilson-Raybould ...,"""No one is going to hold her back,"" and he added, ""I understand all of that information is to be made public.""

""So one, this is appropriately before justice and we ought to see what justice does in the wake of information that is provided, and two . . . I have not found committees like ours to be very effective at conducting inquiries,"" said Erskine-Smith, who was the only Liberal to speak at the meeting.

Pointing to its earlier investigation of the Cambridge Analytica affair, he said committees are not best placed to do investigations.

""We ran into roadblocks and were unable to proceed based on our inability to compel document production in the same way, revisit previous testimony in the same way, frankly the tools we have at our disposal are more cumbersome.""

Still, Erskine-Smith broke with many of his Liberal colleagues, saying that if Wilson-Raybould and Philpott feel they cannot speak fully on the issue, then the prime minister should act to ensure they can.

He also agreed with the Conservatives and denounced what seemed to be a deliberate leak to CTV and Canadian Press aimed at showing relations between the prime minister and Wilson-Raybould had soured as early as 2017 when they disagreed whether a conservative Manitoba judge should be named to a Western vacancy on the Supreme Court. The reports named the judge, Glenn Joyal, who was forced to publicly disavow his candidacy, saying he withdrew his name because his wife had cancer.

""It is outrageous that there's a leak with respect to the Supreme Court judicial appointment process and without question that kind of leak undermines the confidence in the judicial selection process and appointment process. So I think people from all parties ought to condemn that kind of thing. Completely inappropriate.""

Wilson-Raybould told the justice committee last month that she faced ""inappropriate"" and ""sustained"" political pressure from Trudeau and senior officials last fall to mediate criminal charges against the Quebec construction and engineering company.

Trudeau and his team deny they pressured her, and said they only urged her to consider a second outside legal opinion. A mediated agreement would allow the company to avoid a criminal prosecution and with it, a 10-year ban on federal contracts, which had sparked fears within government of job losses.

Ramsay, who is a vice-chair of the justice committee, said there is little hope that committee will resume its hearings into the affair.

And she said the Liberal chair Anthony Housefather has publicly declared there's nothing more to be studied, he'd made up his mind.

In an opinion piece in the National Post last week, Housefather wrote that in his view it is ""duty"" of an attorney-general to consider new facts relative to a possible remediation agreement ""seriously and on an ongoing basis.""

David Moscrop, a political scientist with the department of communication at the University of Ottawa, said the day's proceedings left him ""frustrated."" He said he doesn't believe the office of the federal ethics commissioner is well-suited for this sort of inquiry. And he said the shutdown of the justice committee and now the refusal of the ethics committee to launch an inquiry underscores his belief that a public inquiry is the only forum to get at the facts.

""This is the sort of information that Canadians would like to have ideally before the election so it was frustrating to watch,"" Moscrop said an interview.

""It raises the broader question, can the House and its committees effectively hold the government to account in the current system, I think the answer is not really,"" he said.

""The only thing that's going to ultimately, I think, result in fundamental changes is if voters decide they're not going to have any of it,"" he said.

Public opinion data released Tuesday by the Angus Reid Institute through a quarterly survey on premiers’ performances, finds a slight warming towards many leaders — besides Premier Stephen McNeil of Nova Scotia and Ontario’s Doug Ford.

McNeil, currently also Canada’s longest-serving premier, has the lowest approval of any premier at 24 per cent. That’s a drop of six points from last quarter, when he sat at 30 per cent. The Liberal leader has faced criticism in Nova Scotia in past years in the government’s treatment of teachers, the film industry, and more recently their handling of what nurses, paramedics, health-care unions and more have called a “crisis” in hospitals across the province.

Last week, the Liberals were also under fire for spending an estimated $8.5 million to renovate a ferry terminal in Maine, to help prop up a service running between the state and Yarmouth, N.S. Transportation Minister Lloyd Hines has said the ferry is a vital part of the province’s transportation system and is important to the tourism industry. The only other premier to lose approval points in the new data, Ontario’s Doug Ford, dropped four points this quarter to 38 per cent.

According to the Angus Reid release, Ford has faced criticism for his government’s decision to increase class sizes under the province’s new education plan. Ford was, however, cleared of personal wrongdoing in an ethics investigation looking into the appointment of his long-time friend Ron Taverner as Ontario Provincial Police commissioner. While Ford was found to have remained “at arm’s-length” during the process, the integrity commissioner did express serious doubts about the fairness of the process.

As NDP Premier Rachel Notley fights for re-election in Alberta, voters appear to approve of her more today than they have at any time in the last three years, the release said. Although Notley faces “long odds” ahead of the April 16 election, according to polls which point to a lead for the opposition United Conservative Party, Notley’s personal approval continues to rise.

For the fifth consecutive wave of this quarterly survey, Notley’s approval has increased and is now at 40 per cent compared to 36 per cent last quarter. Quebec Premier François Legault topped the list as the country’s most popular premier (60 per cent), followed by Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe (59 per cent), and British Columbia Premier John Horgan in third with 52 per cent. Horgan, the NDP leader, saw a jump of 9 percentage points since December, when 43 per cent approved of his performance. The release said Horgan’s current number ties with his highest mark as premier, which was set in March 2018.

B.C. Premier John Horgan saw a significant jump in support according to the new poll. ( CHAD HIPOLITO )

Horgan’s resurgent popularity comes as opposition leader Andrew Wilkinson has struggled to connect with British Columbians, the release said. Wilkinson been accused of being “out of touch” over — among other things — comments he made about renting, a touchy subject in and around Metro Vancouver because of ongoing affordability issues. The rest of the provinces are rounded out with Blaine Higgs of New Brunswick sitting at 49 per cent, Manitoba’s Brian Pallister rising to 44 per cent, and Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Dwight Ball at second-last with 35 per cent.

Economists, think-tanks and credit rating agencies all warn that the prime minister’s big spending could spell trouble for the economy. And in a swipe at Trudeau, Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer says balancing the budget would be a top priority under a Conservative government.

But the big question is, do people really care about deficits? Do voters reward deficit hawks and punish free-spenders? Polling on the issue is a mixed bag, and the better gauge may be how people actually vote when faced the choice, such as in the recent Quebec election.

The topic, which could be a ballot box issue in the fall, took centre-stage after the Liberal government unveiled a budget that projects more deficits in a year the books were supposed to be balanced. Criticism flowed, along with warnings of potential economic disruption. The trouble is, despite such warnings in recent times, governments of all shades continued to ring in deficits — and win elections. Which leaves open the question of whether people are as concerned about deficits as some might think.

True, there was a time, particularly in the 1990s, when slaying the deficit was a national obsession. With the Ontario and federal governments facing record deficits and on the brink of economic meltdown, most people accepted deep and often painful spending cuts to rein in bulging deficits and soaring debt.

Jean Chretien’s Liberal government led the way, balancing the budget in 1997-98 and leaving a string of surpluses. Conservative Mike Harris also balanced the Ontario budget in 1999 and was rewarded with re-election. That was the golden decade of deficit-busting.

By the 2000s, however, the war on deficits appeared to lose steam.

Harris’s successor, Ernie Eves, recorded a deficit, and Liberal Dalton McGuinty who followed in 2003, ran more deficits than surpluses. Federally, Stephen Harper’s decade-long record was mixed.

Harper balanced the budget on occasion, but recorded several deficits. For both Harper and McGuinty, the 2008 global financial crisis may have been a factor, but importantly by that time, people appeared to have soured on austerity.

The governments of the day understood the changing mood, and the spending trend continued.

Ontario voters soundly rejected Conservative leader Tim Hudak’s plan for big spending cuts to balance the budget in the 2014 election. Liberal Kathleen Wynne, whose platform included significant spending, won.

Perhaps the most telling example of the shift in public mood was last October’s Quebec election. Premier Philippe Couillard inherited a deficit and chose to focus on its elimination in short order, slashing services, including education and health care.

He succeeded but Quebeckers were not amused. Instead of kudos for the man who slew the dragon, they sent him packing. Ironically, the new Coalition Avenir Québec government is splashing out on services with surpluses left behind by Couillard.

Next in line is Ontario Premier Doug Ford, a deficit hawk, whose budget comes down April 11.

Interestingly, the shift in the public mood is happening not just in Canada. Even in the United States, where cutting spending and deficits was religion to Republicans, President Donald Trump has been racking up deficits. The U.S. deficit is set to top $1 trillion this year, and Republicans just shrug their shoulders.

Reneging on his promise to balance the budget this year, and instead splashing billions on services, Trudeau is gambling that program spending will trump deficit reduction in the eyes of Canadians.

Scheer has taken the opposite view and when voters speak in a few months, we’ll know who got it right. Of course, the public mood can change quickly to Trudeau’s disadvantage if the economy tanks. Deficits don’t really matter to New Democrats, who want even more spending. But as the Conservatives digest the Liberal budget and plot election strategy, they may do well to reconsider deficit-slaying as the centrepiece of their campaign. The sand has shifted on the issue and on recent evidence, an arm-to-arm combat on the deficit with Liberals could be risky.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Brian McInnis

CHARLOTTETOWN – Prince Edward Islanders will be going to the polls on April 23, Premier Wade MacLauchlan announced Tuesday night.

“This is Prince Edward Island’s time,” he told a nomination meeting for a local candidate at a Charlottetown hotel. “This is a time to decide if we go forward.”

The Liberal government didn’t have to take voters to the polls until Oct. 7 under the province’s fixed-date election provisions, but there was an apparent desire to avoid overlap with the federal election this fall.

In his speech, MacLauchlan called the Tories a party of division and opposition, and said support for the surging Greens would be an expensive social experiment.

He touted advancements made by his government on housing, lower taxes and reducing child poverty by more than half.

“Prince Edward Island is working,” he told the partisan crowd. “There are now more opportunities for Islanders to get ahead and strive.”

Despite a booming economy, polls suggest the Liberal party is likely facing a rough ride, with the Green party seen as a legitimate contender for power.

A Corporate Research Associates poll released this month suggests the Greens had a healthy lead, followed by the Progressive Conservatives, who picked a new leader, Dennis King, in February.

The Liberals were in third place, the poll suggests.

The Island has only ever been governed by the Liberals or Tories.

Green Leader Peter Bevan-Baker became the first party member elected to the legislature in 2015, and he has worked to build the Green brand, mainly by challenging the notion that the party is devoted to nothing more than environmental activism.

The party snagged a second seat when Hannah Bell, the 48-year-old head of a businesswomen’s association in Charlottetown, won a 2017 byelection.

The Liberals have been in power since 2007, and there are signs MacLauchlan – a longtime academic who began his political career in 2015 as premier – is personally unpopular.

The last time a minority government was elected in P.E.I. was 1890.

MacLauchlan said Tuesday night that he notified the other party leaders earlier in the day.

The election will also include a binding referendum on electoral reform – asking voters if they wish to stay with the current first-past-the-post system or change to a mixed-member-proportional-representation model.

EDMONTON – Alberta Liberal Leader David Khan says he would give municipalities a veto over oil and gas drilling within their boundaries if his party were to win the April 16 election.

He says that would allow local governments to plan for safe and sustainable growth and development.

Khan also says he would provide municipalities greater autonomy by amending the Municipal Government Act to formally recognize them as “a new order of government.”

New revenue-generating powers would go to Edmonton and Calgary, and those cities and their voters would be free to make decisions on taxes and spending.

A Liberal government would open talks with smaller municipalities to come up with similar powers.

Khan says he would also create an equitable cannabis revenue-sharing model.

“The NDP government has unfairly compensated cities on cannabis sales relative to the costs they are incurring for legalization,” he said in a release Wednesday.

Urban municipalities currently face unpredictable funding, downloading of costs and a lack of co-operation, he said.

“Our municipalities play an increasingly important role in the life of Albertans, but they are disrespected by higher orders of government.”

But the biggest bombshell, in Brown ...","On Friday, Conservative House Leader Candice Bergen offered some advice to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that he is likely to ignore. Let Jody Wilson-Raybould have her (additional) say. Stop muzzling her with cabinet confidence and solicitor-client privilege. Waive it.

Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners Suddenly, New Attention for List of Harper-Era Abuses Traffic surges for Tyee’s 2015 compilation of 70 Tory law and ethics breaches.

“The longer he continues this cover-up,” Bergen said of Trudeau, “the longer he moves heaven and earth to keep himself protected, the worse this gets for him.”

Does it get worse? Or will Canadians tire of the saga and move on, as the Liberals this week bet by moving to shut down the inquiry?

Martyn Brown, who as premier Gordon Campbell’s chief of staff handled scandals buffeting the B.C. government during the 2000s, thinks that this week Trudeau has moved closer to the brink of disaster. The heightened prospect of an RCMP investigation makes Trudeau an anchor sinking the party he once rescued with his leadership.

Now, says Brown, it’s time for Liberal insiders to convince Trudeau to step down.

More bad days for the PM

In one twist this week, Wilson-Raybould promised to dump a pile of more documents on the Justice Committee in order to prove her allegations of undue political interference are correct, even if she isn’t allowed to testify in person.

In another turn, Celina Caesar-Chavannes, who said she’d been bullied by a shouting Trudeau, left the Liberal caucus to sit as an independent MP.

Meanwhile, SNC-Lavalin’s CEO said Trudeau’s team is wrong to imply that his company asked to be spared a criminal trial or else it would move from Montreal with 9,000 Canadian jobs sacrificed.

But the biggest bombshell, in Brown’s view, was dropped by former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott, Trudeau’s other cabinet minister to resign in dismay over LavScam.

What Philpott had to say in her interview with Maclean’s magazine on March 21 proves she’d “gone rogue,” says Brown.

“I’m not accusing anybody of anything illegal or contrary to the Criminal Code,” emphasizes Brown. But Philpott raised enough questions to possibly prod the RCMP to launch an investigation, and that would mean a severe hit to Trudeau’s political fortunes.

On the phone with The Tyee March 21, Brown laid out his reasoning:

Philpott is “now basically saying in this interview with Maclean’s that Jody Wilson-Raybould was bullied, that there is much more to the story. And so she’s flatly contradicting [Trudeau’s] version of events.”

Philpott has given “new legs” to the demand by five previous attorneys general and the Tories for an RCMP investigation. In Maclean’s she makes it clear she could not remain in “solidarity with cabinet,” because she “felt that there was evidence of an attempt to politically interfere with the justice system in its work on the criminal trial that has been described by some as the most important and serious prosecution of corporate corruption in modern Canadian history.”

She also reveals that she raised deep concerns about the DPA file on SNC-Lavalin a full month before the affair became public.

She says this, Brown notes, as we find out the PMO’s claims about harm to the public interest if SNC-Lavalin were to be criminally prosecuted are baloney.

“What we need to know is, in this period, particularly after Jan. 14 when the shuffle took place, was cabinet misled by false threats or false information of the sort we’ve now learned about? That SNC was leaving Montreal, which [we know] now is patently untrue. Or that Canada was going to lose 9,000 jobs, which the present CEO now says was patently untrue. Was cabinet misled by that? Because if so, that would be a reason for the RCMP to investigate.”

The Mounties would be particularly interested in finding out, says Brown, “if false information was used to try to pressure Jody Wilson-Raybould to get her to politically intervene for something that anyone in government knew wasn’t true. Or if the government knew that it wasn’t true that jobs would be lost, that the company would move, as it was trying to suggest to her was the reason in the public interest, then the public interest argument goes out the window.

“That’s the only legal argument the government currently has. Even though by law they’re precluded in the Criminal Code from considering the national economic interest, they’re trying to couch it in this phrase, ‘the public interest,’ to say that because it was in the public interest, that’s why they could talk to her.

“But if the public interest argument is based on a lie, and they knew that, then all that you’re left with is a political motive, an electoral motive that would be self-serving. And that to me would raise questions of obstruction of justice, breach of trust, all sorts of things that the RCMP would suddenly be concerned with.

“I think that’s what’s really changed, the stakes have been elevated by both what the present CEO has said and what Philpott has said.”

Veteran of scandal management

Brown was chief of staff for premier Campbell on Dec. 28, 2003, the day RCMP officers arrived at the B.C. legislature and carted away boxes of evidence for what would become a years-long scandal involving the botched billion-dollar sell-off of the province’s public rail system.

Neither Campbell nor Brown was charged with any wrongdoing. But eight years later, Brown was the first witness called for the resulting trial, which ended with guilty pleas to fraud by two ministerial aides.

If Trudeau gets a knock on his door by the Mounties any time soon, he might want to give Brown a call for a bit of advice.

Then again, the PM likely won’t like what he hears. Brown, who writes a column for the Georgia Straight, declares in his latest that the Liberals’ best chance of winning the fall election is to “lance the boil” that is Trudeau.

As he told The Tyee in an email today, “The fear of losing Trudeau needs to be flipped on its head if left-leaning progressives want to minimize the chances of a Scheer victory this fall. The Liberals can now only hope to regain the moral high ground that is so vital for securing the values they purport to represent by replacing their leader. They can own the ethical hill they are now choosing to die upon by defending the indefensible by selecting a new leader who the heroines Wilson-Raybould and Philpott and Celina Caesar-Chavannes can all rally behind.”

Brown figures, “I am perhaps one of the first to suggest that Trudeau should be dumped by his caucus in their party’s political interest.”

As such, he joins a club that includes The Tyee’s Crawford Kilian who wrote a column published here March 5 headlined: “Trudeau’s Resignation Is the Party’s Only Hope.”

According to data collected by the Canadian Institute for Health Information, surgical wait times have increased significantly during MacLauchlan’s tenure. In 2015, 85 per cent ...","CHARLOTTETOWN, P.E.I. —

Liberal Leader Wade MacLauchlan began his second day of campaigning by focusing on the thorny issue of health care access in P.E.I.

At an announcement at the Murchison Centre in Charlottetown March 28, MacLauchlan pledged to increase health-care spending by $200 million over the next five years. The spending commitment included $50 million focused on recruitment, retention and training of staff and the establishment of a new primary health-care clinic in Queens County.

MacLauchlan also pledged to improve emergency room services at the Kings County Memorial Hospital.

""We will reopen the emergency services at Kings County Memorial Hospital on a 24-hour basis,"" said MacLauchlan. ""In addition, we will invest in the development of a long-term health services plan that is modern and responsive, through the Kings County Memorial Hospital, to patients needs in the region.""

The emergency room had its hours reduced by two hours in July due to a shortage of physicians.

MacLauchlan committed to improving walk-in clinics, increasing the number of family doctors in rural areas, doing away with ambulance fees, reducing wait times for surgical procedures such as hip and knee replacements, and providing financial support and subsidized Confederation Bridge passes for off-Island health appointments.

MacLauchlan said other health-care announcements focusing on mental health, addictions, seniors and West Prince issues would be forthcoming.

""Our Liberal health-care plan is comprehensive, it is realistic, it is costed and it will put patients first,"" MacLauchlan said.

Over the tenure of MacLauchlan, the complement of family physicians has largely remained unchanged. According to Health P.E.I., between 2015 and 2018, the number of family physicians working P.E.I. has remained at 120, although the number of specialists has increased from 100 to 109.

Currently, 12,904 Islanders lack access to a family doctor. The numbers are highest in Queens county at 8,584.

Incumbent Health Minister Robert Mitchell said the Liberal plan would result in an addition to the total complement of family physicians, but these would be concentrated in the new collaborative practice clinic in Queens County.

""The vision for that would be probably four family physicians, three or four (nurse practitioners) and then all resource staff that would be required for that,"" Mitchell said.

The new clinic would be a collaborative practice and would allow access to a variety of health professionals, Mitchell said.

According to data collected by the Canadian Institute for Health Information, surgical wait times have increased significantly during MacLauchlan’s tenure. In 2015, 85 per cent of patients needing hip replacement surgery, and 83 per cent of patients needing knee replacement surgery, received them within six months. By 2018, only 49 per cent of hip replacement surgeries and 26 per cent of knee replacement surgeries took place within six months.

In 2015, the Liberal platform included a pledge to reduce wait times for hip, knee and cataract surgery, as well as a promise to ensure provincial return-in-services agreements would ensure “adequate physician resources,” particularly in rural regions.

We’ve all seen the video of the Viking Sky cruise-ship disaster.

The water rushing in. The chaotic scenes from the bow as the ship is tossed to-and-fro. The helpless tub, dead in its tracks, threatening to crash on the rocks.

Ah, yes. The Leaky Ship Liberal.

Perilously listing. Its passengers screaming for help. A showpiece of negligence and neglect, going nowhere fast.

With Captain Trudeau asleep at the wheel and his first mate Lametti lounging as it leaks. Both are completely confounded by the sudden turn of events that has set their once proud and seemingly invincible ship-of-state reeling.

Holy crap. Now we learn that the former chair of the Liberal Agency of Canada audit committee is bolstering calls for a public inquiry into the LavScam debacle.

Do they even know how ridiculous they look, trying to maintain a stiff upper lip while doing diddly squat to respond to their government’s latest self-inflicted catastrophe?

Do they have the faintest clue how inept, insensitive, and foolhardy they appear in posing as mere bystanders in the accident-in-the-making in the name of the partisan flag now in tatters?

I am referring of course to the appalling attempt by some unknown miscreant to discredit former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould by leaking confidential information aimed at painting Chief Justice Glenn Joyal of the Manitoba Court of Queen’s Bench as an avowed enemy of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

If you are not yet quite up to speed on that fiasco—perhaps, because you’ve been too busy throwing up from the other endless sickening swells in the LavScam disaster—you can learn all about it here, here and here.

The attacks on Justice Joyal were vicious, malicious, and possibly criminal in their motivation, in their abuse of power and position, and in their potentially defamatory content and design.

They were enough to prompt him to respond with remarkable self-restraint, “I fear that someone is using my previous candidacy to the Supreme Court of Canada to further an agenda unrelated to the appointment process. This is wrong.”

They were enough to prompt Conservative MP Lisa Raitt to write to Marc Giroux, Commissioner for Federal Judicial Affairs, urging him to investigate the matter.

He responded by stressing that “The release of any such confidential information is wholly inappropriate,” but that “in light of [his] particular role and [its] enabling statute, he is “not in a position to accede to [Raitt’s] request to investigate”.

The deputy leader of the Conservatives, Lisa Raitt, wants an investigation into the leak concerning the chief justice of the Manitoba Court of Appeal.

And what of the intended target of the Liberals’ scurrilous leaks intended to present her as a de facto anti-Liberal, whose own first choice as chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada was supposedly someone who stood to undermine Trudeau’s father’s proudest legacy?

Puglaas has proved yet again that she is a woman of dignity, sound bearing, and righteous resolve who is not to be trifled with or so easily disparaged by those on her Liberal “team” (“more united than ever!”) who are so intent on doing her harm.

She forcefully responded with a call to investigate the breach of confidence, to find the leaker, and to hold him or her or them duly accountable. We should expect no less of her, as someone who could give current attorney general David Lametti lessons in what the office she held really demands in its leader.

“I do feel compelled to say that I have not—as some have suggested—been the source of any of these stories, nor have I ever authorized any person to speak on my behalf,” she said.

“I strongly condemn anyone who would speak about or provide information on such sensitive matters. Any commentary/reporting in this regard with respect to a SCC [Supreme Court of Canada] appointment(s) could compromise the integrity of the appointments process, our institutions and potentially sitting justices.”

And JWR and Raitt were far from the only persons sending out an SOS.

Others called out the nefarious leakers and urged the prime minister and Lametti to act.

The Canadian Bar Association offered this condemnation:

“There is a process to get informed input about the merits of the applicants. It rightly goes on behind closed doors. Keeping the deliberations confidential respects the privacy of applicants and guards against interference,” said CBA president Ray Adlington.

“Breaching confidentiality by releasing the names and commenting on the suitability of the other applicants after the appointment demeans the selection process and ultimately all those who hold the office of judge.”

The Law Society of Manitoba issued this statement:

“The Law Society of Manitoba is very concerned when circumstances arise that will weaken the public’s confidence in the administration of justice. A highly confidential process has been established to encourage the best and brightest candidates to put their names forward for appointment to all levels of courts.

“The integrity of that process is called into question when the confidentiality of deliberations and discussions about candidates appears not to have been maintained.

“Confidentiality is critical to protecting the reputation of all applicants including sitting judges, who are not able to respond to unjust criticism. The aspersions cast in recent media reports on Chief Justice Glenn Joyal of the Manitoba Court of Queen’s Bench represent an unwarranted attack on a distinguished judicial career.”

Oh, yes. Trudeau’s leakers also had no compunctions about compromising CTV’s journalistic best interests in choosing that esteemed forum as the most suitable outlet for their spurious counter-rationale for JWR’s supposed longstanding friction with the prime minister.

A false twist on the true treachery, as it were, that was supposed create new cover for Trudeau’s firing of the main person who could be trusted to protect the rule of law and the independence of her office as Canada’s first Indigenous attorney general.

David Lametti was sworn in as attorney general and justice minister at Rideau Hall as Justin Trudeau looked on. Adam Scotti/Prime Minister's Office

Yet despite that crescendo of outrage crying out for action, echoed by so many pundits, columnists, and others, what have we heard in response from Trudeau and Lametti?

After three days, no less?

Absolutely nothing of hard consequence.

Neither Trudeau nor Lametti apparently have any intention of investigating that wanton breach of public trust.

They have so far failed to take any action to investigate that egregious violation of personal privacy and that calculated smear on a sitting justice and on JWR, which is at its core yet another deliberate affront to justice.

Lametti’s Twitter response was pathetic.

It was as weak as Trudeau’s mealy-mouthed prattle that could be interpreted as he damn well knows or suspects that the leaks came from within his own office. And it seems he won’t be doing anything to try to identify and potentially prosecute the person(s) responsible.

Video of Raitt demands investigation into SCC appointment leaks Watch Lisa Raitt tell CTV why she thinks there needs to be an investigation.

This, from the guy who only last month waxed on about his father’s deep commitment to justice.

Who bleated that “those principles of justice are fundamental to me in what we are as a country, what we want to be as a society. And I have spent my entire political career fighting for justice and for people … the SNC-Lavalin file was not an exception.”

Some fight. He has done more in his single term in office to erode Canadians’ confidence in justice and the rule of law than any other prime minister in living memory.

Meanwhile, the whole Liberal crew hides behind the ludicrous tweets of Sheila Copps, who seems to be quite comfortable debasing herself with no end of attacks aimed at discrediting JWR and former treasury board president Jane Philpott and driving them both out of caucus.

The party that once held itself above all others as a moral force of international repute is now a rudderless vessle awash in its own bilge water.

It doesn’t look, act, or smell anything like its former “renewed” post-Adscam, self. And that won’t change as long as the guy with the real dirt on his hands is at the helm.

His arrogance knows no bounds, as he demonstrated yet again at the Liberal fundraiser in which he laughed off protesters from the Grassy Narrows First Nation who were concerned about mercury contamination in their communities with the sarcastic dismissal: “Thank you very much for your donation tonight. I really appreciate the donation to the Liberal Party of Canada.”

This is what it’s come to, really? Making jokes aimed at disparaging Indigenous peoples whose health is being threatened by mercury poisoning and tainted water supplies that successive governments have done nothing about?

Yeah, that’ll go a long way to advancing the goal of reconciliation.

Despite his belated apology after getting pounded by all who watched the clip, that type of “leadership” goes a long to explaining why Trudeau’s approval rating is now lower than Donald Trump’s, according to one new poll.

I say again, it ought to be Trudeau who walks the plank if his battered ship is to have any chance of winning back the public confidence needed to convince Canadians it’s safe to ride for another term in government.

And if the contrast between Puglaas and Lametti previously flattered the former, the latter is now also looking like he might be unworthy of the independent office that he was invited to uphold.

Get off your sorry butt and at least pretend that you are not so afraid to offend your sinking captain by getting to the bottom of this matter that was so wrongly initiated under his watch and in his perceived partisan interests.

Like the greater LavScam scandal that gave rise to this new wrongdoing, this fiasco threatens to corrode and degrade all it touches in its filthy wake.

Anyone involved in it deserves to be royally keelhauled.","Martyn Brown: Lametti lounges on the Leaky Ship Liberal, as Puglaas issues an SOS",The Georgia Straight,https://www.straight.com/news/1220131/martyn-brown-lametti-lounges-leaky-ship-liberal-puglaas-issues-sos

After 40 years of farming, 20 of those years on the farmer elected advisory committee to the Canadian Wheat Board (CWB) and one term (the first term) on the Board of Directors who were to control the CWB, I thought I had heard and saw it all.

article continues below

I was at the table when embargoes were placed on Canadian grain for one reason or other, I saw the federal Government implement Ad Hoc piecemeal programs to help take the sting away when agriculture was financially hurt for so many different reasons. The worst of all that changed the prairie landscape was when USA started a trade war against the European Economic Community and Canada was seriously got in the cross fire on Wheat prices. That trade war appeared to last forever and almost bankrupt 1/3 of Western Canadian primary agriculture. I was at the table where I saw the rise and the disasterous fall of Farmer Owned Canadian Grain companies, the likes of UGG, MPE, AWP, and of course SWP which sometimes I still can’t believe it happened. Many today who exited their farms during that period are still being dogged by debts and judgements that carried forward with their names. I was also at the CWB table through those dark days when just about everyone turned on the CWB as the cause of there personal problems. I sometimes wish I could have kept footage of public meetings when individuals heaped UN-imaginable criticism on myself and others for the financial demise of their farms, personal bankruptcies, family breakdowns and even divorces and suicides where all pointed at, that the CWB was the reason why. People don’t care who or why a situation occurs all they want to do is blame someone for there own personal problems. And the Right -Wing Zealots of Western Canada led the way in the all out character attacks until they won the day with the Previous Harper Conservative Government to, sabotage and destroy the CWB, kill any essence of orderly marketing and single desk selling in Canada, take away from western Farmers the business contacts, the infrastructure, the contingency fund (which was in the millions and all Western Canadian Farmers Money) sell most of the assets for pennies on the dollar to a multi-national and place all the funds (I hope) to the general receipts of the Government of Canada.

So what has all this to do with the current situation of China refusing to buy Canadian Canola? Which is known as Canada’s Cinderella crop. Pretty much everything, let me explain. Firstly with China normally purchasing about 40 percent of Canada’s Canola, which amounts to billions of dollars of trade, it is no wonder the price is dropping faster then the Titanic sunk, and we may have not seen the bottom yet.

Does anyone wonder why Richardson Pioneer has been singled out in this new trade war?

Well in case you don’t know your facts, Richardson is one of the last of solely a Canadian Grain Company and as well a big player on the crushing side of Canola and canola meal. So this attack is on Canada, Canola is a Canadian oilseed developed from Rapeseed which was used for industrial oil, but Canadian plant scientist and pathologists worked endlessly to create one of the Worlds best, most popular and healthiests oils and rightfully so named it Canola as in Canadian Oil. The other multi-national companies who buy and sell canola in Canada can move this product to another Country of Origin and continue selling to China under a different disguise. This was done in the past when Canadian cereals where embargoed by certain Countries, The prices dropped in Canada to ridiculous amounts, but yet through multinationals that operated in our and other countries their exports to the country of question would go surprisingly up through one of their other country operations. However Western Canadian products may still be bought but at a much much lower price. Yes Cinderella may have just lost both her glass shoes in Canada.

So if this is a attack on our Canadian Government then we need a all out effort by the Trudeau Governemnt at this time to bring a sensible solution to a unrealistic situation. Please remember China does like and want our Canola Meal, and Canola both raw and manufactured But I would bet anything that talks have been and are going on now between Chinese importers and Canadian Multinationals as to how that product can be redirected through other countries of choice. Remember there is no maple leaf in shipments of Canola so games will be played.

So think about it how can western Canadian Farmers get strong action from the Trudeau Liberals?

I guess our Provincial Premiers could and should get the ball rolling, Oh that’s right most of them are fighting, and in Saskatchewan’s case in courts with the Federal Government over the introduction of a carbon tax. Oh well back in the day this would somehow be turned into a “its the CWB’s fault that this has happened”. So who can we blame now??

[Please note, this is a very long read.]

I am beginning to think that maybe Justin Trudeau’s best hope for burying his LavScam scandal might be to hire Donald Trump’s attorney general, William Barr, or perhaps his former nemesis and now BFF, Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

Barr’s summary of the Mueller report findings reads like The Donald’s wet dream.

No (new) indictments. No evidence of collusion to conspire or coordinate with the Russians for electoral advantage. And not enough evidence to warrant charges of obstruction of justice.

Obstruction of justice? Pfft. “Totally exonerated,” says Trump.

“While this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.”

Many Liberals would probably be quite happy with a similar ambivalent outcome from the ethics commissioner or—god forbid, from the RCMP—as their beloved leader heads into the fall campaign.

Enough of being haunted by “groundless” suspicions of collusion aimed at the obstruction of justice in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, they might now be thinking.

When the chips are down, who you gonna call? Ghost busters.

Mueller might be available, if a special prosecutor was ever required to step in for director of public prosecutions (DPP), Kathleen Roussel.

That might be a challenge if the RCMP ultimately declines to investigate the scandal. So far, the five former federal and provincial attorneys general and Conservative leader Andrew Scheer who have all called for a police probe are still in the dark, like all Canadians.

More to the point, Canada doesn’t have a clear legislated and/or policy process for appointing special prosecutors in such politically charged cases—unlike British Columbia and some other provinces, or for that matter, the Canadian military.

It is astounding, when you think about it, that the Department of Justice Act or the Criminal Code doesn’t already explicitly empower the DPP to unilaterally appoint a special prosecutor in any situation where the AG’s legal oversight is itself untenable.

Leaving the AG even notionally in charge of a prosecution involving the prime minister who appointed her or him to their job and to cabinet should be legally unthinkable and impermissible.

Ditto for a prosecution of anyone accountable to the PM, or of a person or corporation with obvious political connections to a political party. Especially those who have been large donors to party coffers, or one that illegally contributed over $100,000 to the governing party.

Conceptually, it's an inherent conflict of interest.

As such, I can’t imagine that Canada’s current AG, David Lametti, would ever see fit to even titularly oversee the charge assessment process or prosecution of any political figures in this case, if it should ever come to that.

And that is a big “if”, no doubt. But it is one we should all be thinking about now, if the stuff that has already hit the fan turns out to be as stinky and sticky as the odour emanating from the justice committee and from what’s leaking about all that’s gone on behind closed doors.

David Lametti (second from right) is in an awkward legal position, given what's been declared to date by Jody Wilson-Raybould (far left). MCPL MATHIEU GAUDREAULT, RIDEAU HALL

David Lametti's predicament

Someone should ask Lametti what steps he might take to prevent the appearance or reality of a conflict of interest in any such hypothetical scenario.

What process would apply for appointing a special prosecutor that would completely extricate him from his statutory oversight in such instances?

What process would further apply in appointing a special prosecutor to also remove Ms. Roussel from having further false aspersions cast on her conduct, decisions and/or judgement—especially by those acting on behalf of the prime minister?

Which is really at the root of this scandal. To say nothing of the implied lack of confidence by the prime minister and his crew in the former AG’s judgement, competence, and statutory decision-making.

It was that that gave rise to the pressure they allegedly exerted on her to commission an outside “expert” to “help” her overrule the DPP and to “help” her provide “cover” for taking and defending their desired actions, which ran counter to her own unwelcome professional assessment.

Maybe Anne McLellan should add that requirement for appointing a special prosecutor in such cases to her “to do” list.

She, who has been tasked as the prime minister’s handpicked special advisor, to submit “independent” recommendations for reforming the AG’s role.

She, who can no longer attend Liberal fundraisers to help her party fight the opposition parties that hope to convert this controversy into votes and seats for themselves.

Apart from being the right thing to do, it could be worth its weight in gold and goodwill for her party, as it struggles to regain public confidence in a leader who seems genetically incapable of understanding the concept of prosecutorial independence.

After all, it would be tough to imagine that Lametti would ever preside over the criminal prosecution of anyone in the Trudeau government on the LavScam file.

I mean, given that his predecessor (JWR) feels she was fired from that same office that Lametti now holds, allegedly, for not bowing to her boss’s desire to politically intervening in a criminal prosecution. In respect of the same subject that he maintains may yet qualify for a DPA, because no decision is ever final until a verdict is rendered.

Not that there’s any reason to believe that will ever come pass, as things stand.

Which is also not to confuse the potential for criminal charges with the likelihood (or unpublicized reality) of an RCMP investigation.

Obstruction of justice and breach of trust are notoriously hard to prove, as Trump has now happily discovered in the first instance. And as I expect Vice-Admiral Mark Norman will yet again confirm in the second instance.

It is ironic that even Trump allowed for the special prosecutor’s investigation to go forward that Trudeau is using the full weight of his office to prevent from ever materializing in getting to the bottom of his scandal.

To date, most of the focus in the LavScam controversy has centered on two provisions of the Criminal Code.

Section 139(2) makes it an offence to willfully attempt to “obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice in a judicial proceeding”.

Section 423.1(1) makes it an offence “to engage in any conduct with the intent to provoke fear” in a “justice system participant in order to impede him or her in the performance of his or her duties”.

Of course, both are relevant concerns that Canadians deserve to be assured are either pertinent or inapplicable in this affair.

The mainstream media and opposition parties might also want to focus more attention on s. 122 of the Criminal Code, which deals with “breach of trust by a public officer.”

In R. v. Boulanger the Supreme Court of Canada set out a five-point test for establishing that crime. The Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the following:

The accused is a public official; The accused was acting in connection with the duties of his or her office; The accused breached the standard of responsibility and conduct demanded of him or her by the nature of the office; The conduct of the accused represented a serious and marked departure from the standards expected of an individual in the accused’s position of public trust; and The accused acted with the intention to use his or her public office for a purpose other than the public good, for example, for a dishonest, partial, corrupt, or oppressive purpose.

The first four of those points would all seem to apply to at least some of the individuals and conduct that JWR identified and illuminated in her testimony to the Commons justice committee.

But it is the last point that is really key in this instance. For it speaks to whether anyone used their public office for “a purpose other than the public good, for example, for a dishonest, partial, or corrupt purpose”.

Now, I am just a layman, but my reading of that test suggests it might extend to anyone who deliberately misled an attorney general and/or cabinet about a supposed “public good” rationale for politically intervening in a criminal prosecution.

Say, for the “dishonest, partial, or corrupt purpose” of winning votes in Quebec and elsewhere.

Say, for an ulterior purpose of saving seats for the governing the party, including the one held by the prime minister, or maybe benefitting a company that has been a major donor to the Liberal party.

I’m not suggesting that’s the case here; but it begs to be examined and explicitly ruled out if all is as legally defensible as the prime minister would have us believe.

The truth, as it were, should set him and his government free from all suspicion and doubt, if he has nothing ontoward to hide.

My point is, it is not just the prospect of some illicit personal benefit or monetary gain that constitutes a breach of trust, which no one is now suggesting might be applicable in this instance.

But also, whether information was illegally shared and used in tandem with other inappropriate conduct for “dishonest, partial, or corrupt purposes” of partisan advantage, masked as having been pursued in the “public interest”.

Lest there be any doubt, I am not accusing anyone of any criminal wrongdoing in this LavScam controversy.

Not being a lawyer, or privy to any inside knowledge of the facts beyond those reported by the media, I am left with only my political antennae in trying to guess at where this affair is now legally heading.

Yet my political ""spidey sense"" tells me that the threads of truth that are gradually coming to light are all spinning out a web of intrigue that raise grave questions about the legality of the conduct at issue.

Questions that cry out for closer inspection by the RCMP.

Staff reporting to Bill Morneau and Justin Trudeau repeatedly tried to get Jody Wilson-Raybould to consider a deferred prosecution agreement for SNC-Lavalin.

Why is Trudeau obfuscating?

Despite JWR’s statement to the justice committee that the pressure she experienced was inappropriate, but probably not illegal, it is what she doesn’t know and what she was not aware of that begs to be scrutinized by someone beyond the ethics commissioner.

For as Jane Philpott rightly said, “My sense is that [the commissioner’s office] will not have the appropriate tools to be able to get at all of this.”

That is obvious, which is why Trudeau has tried so hard to suggest the opposite.

It is why he is so content to hide behind the ethics commissioner’s review, hoping that Mario Dion’s severely constrained legal mandate will preclude him from really addressing the most serious questions. Whenever he returns from his “prolonged” medical leave.

It is why Trudeau is so deathly afraid of extending the privilege waiver to release JWR from her sworn oath of cabinet confidence beyond January 14.

It is why he has refused to fully release her from solicitor-client privilege restrictions that he well knows still prevent her from speaking freely about what happened outside of the justice committee that has now terminated its investigation.

He knows that she risks being disbarred for violating that tenet, which she is now being urged to do by those who suggest she should cast caution to the wind and “let 'er rip” in Parliament.

It is why he won’t release Jane Philpott to say anything that would reveal what she knows that might now be protected by cabinet confidence.

And as we all know, she maintains “There’s much more to the story that should be told.”

As she said, “I believe the former attorney general has further points to make. I believe that I have further issues of concern that I’m not free to share.”

It is why seasoned Liberal lackeys like MP Judy Sgro are now attacking JWR and Philpott, challenging them to “put up or shut up”, when their own leader is doing his level best from allowing that to happen.

What Sgro, her cowardly caucus colleagues, and the Liberal social media trolls all really mean by that appalling slapdown of two brave women who had the courage of their convictions to speak truth to power is to just “shut up"".

Because they know that neither of the courageous women they accuse of not being team players are not keen on simply ignoring their sworn oaths and saying their piece under the questionable protection of parliamentary privilege.

That is, to the extent that they might even be afforded a few minutes to make a statement in the House, which really needs to be fully aired and questioned through many more hours of committee testimony.

To make their case in Parliament, they would have to obtain the Liberals’ consent to be heard, which is ridiculous, given how they are the only reason why JWR and Philpott have been largely silenced.

If they really mean what they say, those Liberals should add their voices to those calling on the prime minister to remove any need for parliamentary privlege to trump cabinet privilege or solicitor-client privilege.

They should be calling on him to simply release JWR and Philpott to share their full story, instead of supporting his efforts to clam them up and prevent the truth from outing.

It is now patently clear that the prime minister is panic-stricken by the prospect of allowing his two former senior ministers to say anything about what really transpired from the date of the cabinet shuffle through their respective resignations from cabinet.

He surely must know that something very damaging to him and his government hangs in the balance of their forced silence.

The muzzle that he has put on JWR and Philpott is intended only to prevent him from experiencing the harsh truth—that their bark is itself their bite.

He is terrified of inviting any new testimony from the officials that JWR has identified as key players in this controversy, or from others who may have done things that might provoke an RCMP investigation.

He is petrified at the prospect of anyone being called to testify under oath, at penalty of perjury for lying, to prove his laughable contention that he did nothing wrong.

And yet, the hits just keep on coming.

With every new front-page scoop in the Globe and Mail. With JWR’s next round of written evidence soon to be submitted to the justice committee.

And despite his Liberal lapdogs’ incorrigible attempts to silence JWR and betray that forum’s mandate by shutting down its investigation.

RCMP hasn't revealed anything yet

All of which isn’t just dumb politics on the PM’s part that is backfiring, big time, on him and his party. It further reinforces the need for an RCMP inquiry.

Indeed, I’d wager that an RCMP investigation may already be underway, if only because of its deafening silencing in either confirming or denying whether one has been initiated.

Sure, that’s the standard line they usually give when they don’t want to compromise an active or prospective investigation.

It is one thing to refuse to “confirm” that an investigation is taking place, if it is, and you don’t want to alert its subjects of that fact. Which seems unlikely in this instance, given what it would entail and who the RCMP would be obliged to talk to.

It is quite another thing to refuse to “deny” that an investigation has been launched if it has not been, regardless of what might happen in the future. Especially when it is the government itself and the prime minister’s political neck that is on the line.

When such denials are not forthcoming, inquiring minds race, and rightly so.

Because where there’s smoke, there is usually fire, whether or not it rises to a level hot enough for anyone to get burned with actual criminal charges being laid.

I submit, there is already more than enough on the table to warrant a formal investigation by the RCMP. Especially in the absence of any parliamentary process to help clear the air that is now choking us all in clouds of suspicion, doubt, and poisonous particles of toxic truth.

Here is just some of what we know.

We know that one or more individuals in the prime minister’s office were aware of highly sensitive and privileged information about the status of the SNC-Lavalin prosecution that they should not have been in any position to have.

Information that ostensibly did not come from Public Prosecutions Services and that conflicting accounts suggest may or may not have come from SNC-Lavalin. Information that might have been illegally shared.

I would think that that question and how (or if) SNC-Lavalin might have also been privy to such privileged information is a mystery that cries out for a closer look by the RCMP. Now more than ever, in view of the Globe and Mail's latest story.

We also know that numerous direct overtures were made by SNC-Lavalin officials and/or designates to the former head of the Privy Council and others, through activities that were not listed by the company in its monthly lobbyist activity reports.

What was said, implied, requested, or not in those unregistered communications is unknown.

Nor is it clear if any of those conversations, meetings, and/or written contacts may be construed as constituting lobbying activities as defined under the act.

SNC-Lavalin assures us that all of its communications were in total compliance with the law. I have previously speculated why I believe that is probably the case.

However, we also know that the company’s president and CEO, Neil Bruce, has publicly stated that at no time did he or his agents threaten to move SNC-Lavalin’s head office. Nor did he ever suggest that 9,000 were at risk, or did he or his company ever argue for a deferred prosecution agreement based on national economic interest arguments that would be against the law.

In fact, he said he never asked for a DPA on any of those bases, noting that “Yes, the 9,000 people will get a job. I have no doubt whatsoever about that … But they’ll be working probably for a U.S. company.”

All of which stands in direct contrast to the rationale cited by the prime minister and his senior staffers in pressuring JWR to overrule the director of public prosecutions to help SNC-Lavalin avoid a criminal trial for fraud and corruption.

Note as well that the company’s recent statement to clarify Bruce’s earlier statements really do little to change that fact. It said this:

“Mr. Bruce indeed stated the Government of Canada was never threatened by SNC-Lavalin, however, the company had made it very clear to the Government through its advocacy campaign that the implementation of a remediation agreement (RA)—also known as a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA)—was the best way to protect and grow the almost 9,000 direct Canadian SNC-Lavalin jobs, as well as thousands of indirect jobs through its more than 5,000 suppliers across Canada. The company still asserts this position.” [Emphasis added.]

None of which changes Bruce’s fundamental assertion: that SNC never threatened to move its HQ from Montreal, that it never threatened that jobs would be lost, and that it never suggested that such economic interest imperatives should make it eligible for a DPA.

SNC-Lavalin tried to clear the air this week with a statement clarifying the CEO's previous remarks. JeanGagnon

Political considerations and legal concerns

We also know that those false threats of economic sanctions were advanced, either deliberately or unwittingly, by people within the Trudeau administration.

To convince JWR to politically intervene in a way that she and her chief of staff repeatedly expressed would be clearly inappropriate and that had never been done before in a criminal prosecution.

To pressure her to make “her own decision”, using what she perceived to be “veiled threats”—including that she might be fired as AG if she refused to act against her expressed will and contrary to her repeatedly asserted position.

All in an effort to reframe the “national economic interest” considerations, which are expressly outlawed in the Criminal Code in determining whether to grant a DPA, as instead of “public interest” arguments that might be used to effectively nullify that prohibition.

We know that several senior officials in the PMO, the PCO and the finance minister’s office repeatedly tried to convince JWR and her chief of staff to get an outside legal opinion that would give the attorney general reason to politically intervene in a way in which she was unwilling to do.

We know that multiple officials from the prime minister, on down, repeatedly cited ulterior electoral considerations that pointed to political motives.

And that those considerations were communicated to JWR and to her chief of staff in pressuring her to “get it right” by politically intervening on behalf of SNC-Lavalin to overrule the DPP’s decision and spare it from a criminal trial and prospect of being barred from bidding on government contracts for up to 10 years. A benefit that could potentially be worth billions of dollars in new business for the company.

Those suggested political considerations had nothing to do with the public interest and everything to do with partisan interests that were of concern to the prime minister if the company didn’t get the special deal it was after.

Political interests that were heightened by conversations with the premier of Quebec and which JWR says she directly warned the prime minister were plainly inappropriate to raise with her or her staff. Legal advice he ignored.

His “people” persisted in advancing false economic arguments, which we know Quebec’s justice minister also says she also refused to entertain and advance on SNC-Lavalin’s behalf in pressuring her federal counterpart for a DPA.

And finally, we also know that the Federal Court has rejected SNC-Lavalin’s application for judicial review of the DPP’s decision not to negotiate a DPA.

Justice Catherine Kane stressed that the DPP had duly considered the “extensive information” and “had conducted a detailed review of the documents submitted” by SNC-Lavalin “regarding how they met the relevant criteria” in making her decision.

Yet, despite that fact, which JWR had reviewed and properly supported, the Liberals repeatedly tried to undermine her decision.

They ostensibly did so on the basis of their ill-informed judment that she had not given due regard to the economic threats that have now been exposed as groundless, and equally, to the partisan political imperatives that she rightly refused to entertain.

JWR feels she was harangued, threatened, and ultimately fired from her post for being seen as either too politically obstructionist for the prime minister’s liking, or too resistant to accommodate his desire to do things that no one in her former position should be asked to do.

The worst of it is, that is not even the half of what we already know.

And it is only a fraction of the hard truth that screams to be fully heard and thoroughly investigated by the RCMP.

So many other factors reinforce that need.

They include how the prime minister’s people are now all lawyered up.

They include how the prime minister’s former principal secretary was so rapidly given access to records that he relied upon for his testimony to the justice committee. Which stands in stark contrast to the interminable process that Vice-Admiral Mark Norman has gone through in trying to get access to his own records in defending himself in court. Why the difference?

They include the extraordinary efforts that the prime minister has taken to prevent JWR and Philpott from sharing their evidence.

That includes the unconscionable actions just taken by the Liberal members of the Commons ethics committee, who used their majority to block the opposition’s efforts efforts to have that forum complete the work that their Liberal colleagues on the justice committee brazenly voted to short-circuit.

They include the disturbing attacks on JWR’s character that Liberals have advanced in trying to justify the PM’s decision to dump her as AG.

One of those spurious assaults relates to JWR’s supposed attempts to isolate the PMO from information about potential Supreme Court nominees. Specifically, her alleged recommendation to appoint Chief Justice Glenn Joyal of the Manitoba Court of Queen’s Bench as the SCC’s chief justice.

As a conservative appointee of Stephen Harper who had challenged certain aspects of judicial interpretations of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, those Liberals who tried to raise his appointment in trying to undermine JWR only added new fuel to their party’s own fire.

In trying to besmirch her character and her commitment to the charter, they apparently also leaked confidential cabinet information and tried to sully a sitting judge in the process.

It obliged Justice Joyal to issue an extraordinary statement.

“I fear that someone is using my previous candidacy to the Supreme Court of Canada to further an agenda unrelated to the appointment process. This is wrong,” he said.

No kidding, that’s wrong, like the other examples I have summarized above. All of it stinks to high Heaven.

With JWR’s evidence expected later this week, that smoke that the prime minister’s team has tried so hard and so unsuccessfully to douse will only grow bigger and blacker.

The longer Liberals ignore it and try to pretend that all is well, when they should know their collective goose is already being savagely cooked, just makes them look foolish.

Odds are, no one will ever be charged with a crime in this scandal, given how hard the government is trying to suppress the truth and how hard it is to prove criminal intent.

Nevertheless, the prime minister’s personal handling of this fiasco is a politically criminal abdication of leadership and an abuse of Canada’s highest elected office.

And whether this scandal ever results in criminal charges, which now seem unlikely, I predict the RCMP will inevitably feel compelled to investigate this firestorm. If it isn’t doing so already.

Because no privilege—not parliamentary privilege, not cabinet privilege, and not solicitor-client privilege—should ever protect a party that is trying to hide behind those shields to frustrate the evidence that goes to the heart of the rule of law.

Valid questions and concerns demand to be explored and answered.

Ones that are not simply political in nature, but that are also of legal and potentially criminal consequence.

The best way to truly clear the air in this case is to insist on an RCMP investigation that has the full force of the law behind it.

Preferably, under the auspices of a special prosecutor.

Because if even if Trudeau somehow reverses course and decides to let JWR and Philpott speak, that will not and should not be the end of it.

All of the actors and evidence in this controversy need to be exposed and duly questioned.

As I believe they will be, by those whose only interest is to serve and protect us and our democratic institutions—the RCMP.

The province’s NDP Leader Rachel Notley said the price cap would apply no matter what a parent has been currently paying for child care, and expands a pilot program that capped daycare costs at $25 daily at 7,300 spaces in 122 locations.

Prices across Canada

While the province has Canada’s largest gap between men and women in labour force participation, it’s not the only place in Canada where daycare costs have been a source of controversy.

Families across Canada have been pushing for governments to help lower the costs. And it’s something think-tank Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives keeps close tabs on.

In February, the organizations reported that daycare prices across Canada have dropped — or barely inched up — in some Canadian cities in what might be early signs of the influence of federal child-care money.

However, it also noted that fees for full-time, regulated child-care spaces have risen faster than inflation in 61 per cent of cities reviewed.

The fees were highest in Toronto and the surrounding area, where fees for children under 18 months average $1,685, and $1,150 a month for older preschoolers.

Cities in Quebec had the lowest fees for full-time, regulated spaces across the country, followed by Winnipeg and Charlottetown — in the three provinces that have fixed fees for years.

David MacDonald, a senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, explained to Global News that three provinces have intervened in child care and set fees at lower costs than the market rate.

Quebec, Manitoba and P.E.I. have lowered the costs for residents by setting a maximum price, MacDonald said.

WATCH: New Brunswick PCs expand on Liberals daycare plan, offering designation to home-based centres

“They’re making up the difference as a transfer to providers,” he noted. “In the Canadian context, that appears to be the most effective way of reducing child-care fees for parents.”

He cited Montreal as an example, where the average daycare cost is around $200 per month.

MacDonald added that three other provinces are mulling similar moves — Alberta, Newfoundland and Labrador and British Columbia. He also noted the federal government has signed bilateral agreements to support provinces who take on lowering child care costs.

“I don’t think there can be any doubt that the federal money is helping to expand those programs possibly more rapidly or possibly to more spaces.”

University of Manitoba professor Susan Prentice, who specializes in child care policies, explained to Global News Quebec will have cheaper child care than Alberta even if Notley’s pledge materializes.

“The leader in Canada for child care has been for over two decades, Quebec,” Prentice said. “Their child care is much more developed and much more affordable.”

How other countries compare

But Prentice said Nordic countries are “miles ahead” the rest of the world when it comes to nationally subsidized child care programs, specifically highlighting Sweden.

In Sweden, Prentice said municipalities must have a child care spot ready within three months of a request.

“The average family pays between three and five per cent of their family income, and often less,” she added.

According to a survey by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development based on 2016 statistics, parents in Sweden spend around four per cent of their family income on child care — among the lowest in the world.

Other countries that rank the lowest — all under five per cent — on spending include Austria, Greece and Hungary.

Canada is above the average, with residents spending an average of 22.2 per cent of their family income on child care.

The United Kingdom ranks the most expensive in the group at 33.8 per cent of family income going toward child care. The United States was at 25.6 per cent.

Posted on March 27, 2019 by Sunny South News

Government budgets often offer some benefits for voters, but when the budget precedes an election, there’s a lot in common with Christmas — there are plenty of gifts, and you try not to think about having to pay for them later.

So it is with the Liberal government’s federal budget tabled last week that will dole out billions of dollars in new spending on all sorts of goodies for Canadians — many of them aimed at helping middle-class voters save money.

The Liberals were aided by the fact that a stronger economy has produced higher-than expected revenue — a projected extra $27.8 billion over the next six years.

Based on Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s plan, the Liberals will spend $22.8 billion of that additional money.

The budget includes: $1.7 billion over five years, and $586 million a year after that, for a Canada Training Benefit to help workers upgrade their skills and learn new ones while staying in their current jobs; $1.18 billion over five years to tighten border security, including hiring more judges to handle judicial reviews of asylum applications; $3.9 billion for farmers (the majority of them in the vote-rich provinces of Ontario and Quebec) in supply-managed industries affected by new trade agreements with the U.S. and Asian countries; $2.2 billion for municipalities’ and First Nations’ infrastructure projects; $950 million for municipal governments to make their buildings more energy-efficient and to provide subsidy programs to help homeowners do the same; $300 million over three years for rebates of up to $5,000 on electric or hydrogen-fuel-cell vehicles.

The budget also calls for putting money toward lowering the interest rate on Canada Student Loans to the prime rate, and to create a new Canadian Drug Agency to centralize evaluations of new drugs and to buy in bulk nationwide, instead of province-by-province.

The provisions include measures to make housing more affordable, particularly for first-time buyers, by increasing the amount they can borrow from RRSPs and by having the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. contribute a small share of equity for down payments.

The budget also provides new rules that will let working seniors keep more of the money they earn before triggering a claw-back in the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS).

The Canada Training Benefit will provide a tax credit of up to $250 per year to help with covering up to half the cost of job training, such as fees for a college course or other professional training programs. Such training is increasingly becoming crucial to help workers keep their skills up to date in a fast-changing workplace.

Similarly, helping working seniors keep more of their earnings in their pockets will be useful in a world where more seniors are having to remain on the job in order to make ends meet.

Of course, all these goodies have to be paid for, and the money for that ultimately comes from taxpayers’ pockets.

The Canadian Press points out the new budget will result in a 2019-20 federal deficit projection of $19.8 billion, including a $3-billion “risk adjustment,” an increase of $200 million from last year’s forecast. The Liberals’ plan includes a gradual reduction in the deficit, but that will happen more slowly than the government anticipated last year.

Morneau’s 460-page budget is titled “Investing in the Middle Class,” but it could perhaps be more appropriately called “Investing in Middle-Class Voters.”

Rather than using the unexpected windfall to reduce the debt or balance the budget, the Liberals have opted to spend the money like a carefree Vegas vacationer who just got lucky at the slot machines.

It was met with an unseemly display by the Opposition in which they repeatedly chanted, jeered, and carried on with such vigour that no one could hear the minister speak. The Speaker of the House shut down all of the microphones but it didn't help.

article continues below

I say ""unseemly"" but perhaps ""childish"" would be a better term. Yes, getting to the bottom of the Jody Wilson-Raybould affair is important but by protesting in the house during the reading of the budget speech, the Opposition did neither themselves nor the public a favour.

If I was leading the Opposition right now, I would stop talking about the whole affair and let it play out on its own. The Liberals seem to be doing a good job of shooting themselves in the foot all by themselves. They don't really need a hand at this point.

Instead, I would use the time devoted to the budget to focus on the budget. It has an interesting take on our finances going forward but perhaps more importantly, it is not the balanced budget we were promised during the last campaign and in the first budget after the election. Essentially, the government is once again putting off the payments for another year.

Why is that? And what would the Conservatives, for example, do differently?

After all, the last two times the Conservatives were in power, they ran up the national debt to record levels and in unprecedented fashion. For a party which claims to be fiscally conservative, it is hard to understand how they can be so irresponsible with our money.

Perhaps this is why Minister Morneau's speech was turned into a tantrum about a completely different issue. It allowed the members of the opposition to avoid providing an alternative vision for our finances. After all, if you can't beat them with logical sound arguments, maybe a smoke screen is the next best approach.

However, as the Conservatives have yet to provide us with a vision of how they would handle the economy, we are left to speculate based on their previous performance. And in this case the Liberals win, hands down.

The central theme of the budget was ""Investing in the Middle Class."" The Liberals argue they have been doing this since day one and it has resulted in well-paying jobs, a stronger and more connected country, and opportunities for our youth and Indigenous people.

They claim the creation of 900,000 jobs over the past four years - most of which are full time and 54 per cent going to women in the last year alone. Their stewardship has led to the lowest unemployment rate in 40 years.

Our economy hasn't led the world in growth, but that is to be expected as some countries are so far behind and racing to catch up. But within the OECD, we are doing very well and amongst the G7, we are second to the U.S.

If, as pundits often say, ""It's the economy, stupid,"" then the Liberals have done their job. They have strengthened the middle-class. They have provided a stronger economy. They have lowered unemployment or increased employment rates. They have engaged in diversification. They have done much for the average Canadian and haven't really disadvantaged the rich.

To my mind, this is one of the hallmarks defining the different approaches taken by the Liberals and the Conservatives. Under the previous Conservative governments, the approach taken was to give big tax cuts to the wealthy so they will spend their money in a way that it trickles down to the middle class. Give the rich more and everyone else will benefit.

Except it doesn't actually work. Instead, we have a ridiculous situation where the average CEO earns as much money in their first day of work in any given year as their average employee makes in 365 days. How is this allowed to happen? The Conservative argument is wealthy people will give to and provide for those less fortunate. But is this really the case?

The Liberals take a much more direct approach. Instead of providing for the top few earners and hoping the largess will wind its way downward, they are targeting the middle class directly.

Participation in the U.K. scheme was ""very high,"" but ""given the far less generous nature of the Canadian version, all else equal we might expect a boost to construction of 5 per ...","The federal Liberals' plan to help homebuyers could slow down home sales in the coming months, while doing little to improve affordability, analysts say.

As part of the budget, Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced last week a plan to help homebuyers struggling with the worst home affordability levels Canada has seen in three decades.

The plan surprised many observers by not including a number of measures the industry had been pushing for, such as a loosening of the mortgage stress test and an increase in insured mortgage amortizations to 30 years.

Watch: Ontario's most and least affordable housing markets. Story continues below.

But it did put in place some unexpected measures, including a First-Time Homebuyer Incentive that will see the government-run Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. (CMHC) contribute up to 10 per cent of the price of a new house, or five per cent of the price of an existing home, to qualifying first-time buyers.

CMHC would recoup its money only when the home is sold, though it's not clear if the plan is for the corporation to take back the initial capital, or a percentage of the home's sale price.

The program could mean ""turbulence"" in Canada's housing markets in the coming months, Royal Bank of Canada said in a recent client note, because first-time buyers will be tempted to sit out the spring season and wait for the new aid program, which launches in September.

""This could depress the market even further during that period,"" RBC economic analyst Robert Hogue wrote. Those delayed purchases could mean a bounce-back in activity come September, Hogue noted, ahead of the fall federal election.

Not much help for Toronto, Vancouver

Analysts have also pointed out that the program will be of limited use to homebuyers in Toronto and Vancouver, Canada's priciest cities. It's available to households earning no more than $120,000 a year, and the mortgage plus CMHC's contribution can't be more than four times household income, or a maximum of $480,000.

By Hogue's calculations, this means the maximum house price a buyer can afford under the program is $505,000 with a 5-per-cent down payment, or up to $600,000 with a 20 per cent down payment. That's perfectly reasonable in Calgary or Ottawa, but it is well below the selling price of a majority of properties in Toronto and Vancouver today.

The CMHC program ""may be enough to buy a small- to medium-size condo apartment in those markets but probably not a family-friendly home,"" Hogue wrote.

A boost for home construction?

The CMHC program was designed to boost construction of new homes by making support more generous for new-home purchases — 10 per cent of the purchase price, versus 5 per cent for existing homes.

According to Capital Economics, a similar scheme introduced in the U.K. in 2013 boosted home construction in that country by 10 to 15 per cent.

But the U.K. program was more generous, with the government offering to cover 20 per cent of the purchase price outside London, and 40 per cent of the price in London.

Participation in the U.K. scheme was ""very high,"" but ""given the far less generous nature of the Canadian version, all else equal we might expect a boost to construction of 5 per cent at the very most,"" economist Stephen Brown wrote in a client note.

The U.K. program did coincide with a spike in house prices. The average house price in the U.K. had seen no growth for years until 2013, when it began to rise, jumping nearly 23 per cent in the following three years.

The Canadian experience may prove to be different.

British Columbia itself tried out something similar in recent years with a fund that contributed 5 per cent to the purchase price of a home. The province shut the program down last year, due to a lack of interest from homebuyers. It had received 3,000 applications, well short of the 42,000 the province had been expecting.

""First-time home buyers found the program difficult to understand and unappealing to have the government co-own their home,"" said James Laird, co-founder of mortgage comparison site Ratehub.

Polls suggest the United Conservative Party is on course to win power in the province, Canada’s energy center, capitalizing on voter concerns about a struggling economy and lack of progress on new oil export pipelines.

However, UCP leader Jason Kenney, a former federal cabinet minister, polls behind New Democrat Party Premier Rachel Notley on a number of personal attributes such as honesty, likeability and trustworthiness, and is embroiled in a scandal over his successful party leadership bid in 2017.

Notley, whose late father led the NDP from 1968-1984, is polling well ahead of her party and seeking to profit from that edge.

To overcome that, the UCP is focusing on Trudeau, with repeated references to “the Notley-Trudeau alliance,” emphasizing her one-time close relationship with the prime minister, while images of their own leader are less visible.

Trudeau is an unpopular figure in Alberta, where many feel he failed to support the energy industry. The prime minister also faces a political scandal on whether he unduly pressured Canada’s former justice minister.

“If you look at the signs the NDP are putting up, their logos are not very prevalent, it’s all Rachel Notley,” said Gregory Jack, vice president at polling firm Ipsos. “The UCP signs are all about the UCP and their brand, and underplaying their leader to a certain extent.”

The UCP’s focus on Justin Trudeau may be effective with older Alberta voters who remember the unpopular National Energy Program in 1980, an effort by his prime minister father, Pierre Trudeau, that sought to give Ottawa more control over the oil and gas industry and a higher share of revenues.

“(The UCP) spin on it is Alberta has been mistreated by a Liberal government and the son of another prime minister who did not treat Alberta well,” said Jared Wesley, a political science professor at the University of Alberta.

Alberta’s energy industry contributes C$80 billion a year to Canada’s economy, but opposition from other provinces has shut down new pipelines like TransCanada Corp’s Energy East project and helped stall the Trans Mountain expansion plan.

Congestion on existing pipelines out of landlocked Alberta left crude bottlenecked in storage tanks and sent prices spiraling to record lows last year, prompting the NDP to mandate temporary crude production cuts.

Alberta has posted budget deficits since global oil prices started tumbling in 2014, and more than C$20 billion in foreign capital has fled its energy sector since 2017.

Notley and Trudeau came to power in the same year and initially forged a close partnership aimed at pleasing the oil industry and environmental groups with a dual strategy that supported new pipelines and introduced a carbon tax.

They fell out last year over delays to the Trans Mountain expansion project. Notley’s camp downplays the relationship that the UCP is working so hard to highlight.

“The job of premier is to work with anyone who has a stake in projects like pipelines. I wouldn’t call it an alliance,” said NDP campaign spokeswoman Cheryl Oates. “A lot of people feel Jason Kenney is stuck in Ottawa trying to rehash a battle that his party lost.”

The report’s key findings, according to the CWTA, “shows the significant positive economic impact the industry makes when it comes to GDP, jobs and capital investment,” with year-over-year growth.

Specifically, the CWTA says “in 2017, Canada’s wireless industry contributed $27.5 billion to the Canadian GDP, an increase of 9.1% from $25.21 billion 2016.”

When it comes to jobs, the wireless sector had 151,550 full-time equivalents (FTE) jobs in 2017, an increase of 9.8% over 2016.

As for capital investments, Canadian wireless operators had spending totalling $2.92 billion in 2017, an increase of 13.2% compared to 2016.

“The Nordicity report highlights the critical contribution our industry makes to the Canadian economy,” said Robert Ghiz, President & CEO of CWTA, in a statement.

While the benefit ""is no panacea ...","Investors are becoming increasingly convinced that Canada is headed towards recession.

A key indicator of rough times ahead, known as the yield curve, recently inverted for both the U.S. and Canada, something that usually happens shortly before the economy starts shrinking. Long story short, investors are betting Canada's interest rates are going to be coming down, which usually is a sign of hard times.

Couple that with the economy's surprisingly weak showing at the end of last year, and you have a recipe for trouble ahead. But one major part of the picture is signalling just the opposite: Canada's labour market, which is going from strength to strength these days.

Watch: Canada's most in-demand jobs in 2019. Story continues below.

Statistics Canada data released Monday showed there were 548,000 job vacancies nationwide in the fourth quarter of 2018, up 16.6 per cent in a year. All 10 of the largest industrial sectors saw an increase in job openings. Among provinces, only Saskatchewan saw a decrease in job openings, and only by about 500 jobs.

Even with anemic exports and consumer demand slowing down (retail sales have fallen for five of the past six months), Canadian employers are showing no signs of slowing down their hiring.

Long-term job vacancies are also on the rise, with the number of job openings sitting vacant for three months or more hitting record highs around 400,000 over the past year, according to data from the Canadian Federation of Independent Business.

This shortage of workers means that Canada's employers are — finally — beginning to seriously raise the wages they're offering to new hires. The average offered hourly wage in Canada jumped 5.2 per cent over the past year, to $21.10.

Ontario saw the strongest spike in offered wages, up 7.6 per cent in a year, to $21.85, though this coincided with the large increase to the province's minimum wage at the start of 2018, StatCan noted.

HuffPost Canada

The job vacancy rate ""points to further employment gains ahead,"" wrote Krishen Rangasamy, senior economist at National Bank of Canada, in a client note.

But while the labour shortage is good news for those looking for work or a raise, at these elevated levels it's actually beginning to harm the economy.

A report from the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC Canada) issued in January found 53 per cent of small and medium-sized businesses say the shortage will cause them to limit business investment this year.

That's a bad sign for Canada in the longer term, because business investment is pretty much the only thing that drives job growth in the private sector.

Some businesses ""will not accept new clients, they will refuse contracts. They just can't do it,"" BDC Canada chief economist Pierre Cléroux told HuffPost Canada last month.

Skills 'mismatch'

Rangasamy believes the spike in the job vacancy rate over the past few years, as the jobless rate dropped, is a sign of ""inefficiency and (a) skills mismatch"" in Canada's labour market.

This argument is strengthened by the fact that, despite record low unemployment rates recently, the average length of unemployment in Canada is nearly as long as it was in the last recession.

Simply put, the 1.1 million people on Canada's unemployment rolls today largely don't have the skills employers are looking for (or are unwilling to work the jobs available for the pay being offered).

Policymakers are waking up to the problem.

The federal Liberals' latest budget, unveiled last week, included the creation of a new Canada Training Benefit to ""help pay for training, provide income support during training, and, with the cooperation of the provinces and territories, offer job protection so workers can take the time they need to keep their skills relevant,"" according to Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC).

That program is also meant to address the growing risk of automation, with one in 10 Canadian jobs at ""high risk"" of being replaced by machines, ESDC said.

By Nia Williams

(Reuters) - A judge in Alberta, Canada, ruled on Monday that the war crimes sentence of a Canadian man formerly held at U.S. military base Guantanamo Bay in Cuba has expired, making Omar Khadr a free man.

Khadr was 15 when he was captured in Afghanistan in 2002 and sent to Guantanamo Bay, charged with throwing a grenade that killed U.S. Army Sergeant Christopher Speer.

He was later transferred to Canada, where he was handed an eight-year sentence in 2010, before being released on bail in 2015. Khadr's sentence would have expired last year had he remained in custody.

Court of Queen's Bench Chief Justice Mary Moreau ruled that the nearly four years Khadr spent on conditional release counted toward his sentence.

Speaking outside the court in Edmonton, Alberta, the now 32-yaer-old Khadr said he was pleased with the decision.

""I think it's been a while but I'm happy it's here, and right now I'm going to just try to focus on recovering and not worrying about having to go back to prison, or, you know, just struggling,"" Khadr said.

In 2010, the Canadian Supreme Court said Canada had breached Khadr's rights by sending intelligence agents to interrogate him in Guantanamo and sharing the results with the United States. He pleaded guilty to Speer's murder but later recanted, and his lawyers said he had been grossly mistreated.

Canada formally apologized to Khadr in 2017 and paid out C$10.5 million ($7.83 million) in compensation, acknowledging Canadian government officials had played a role in the abuse he suffered. It was a controversial decision that attracted fierce criticism from many Canadians.

""We are a country that respects the rule of law and very much respects the judicial process,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said when asked about the ruling on Khadr's sentence.

In 2016, Trudeau's Liberal government dropped a bid to return Khadr to prison that had been launched by the previous Conservative government.

Khadr's lawyer, Nate Whitling, said the judge's decision meant his client would not have to live under any further conditions and there was no longer the risk he might have to return to prison.

Khadr is also seeking dismissal of his U.S. conviction for war crimes. Whitling said that appeal had been obstructed and delayed but they were still pressing ahead with it.

U.S. authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

On average, homes are twice the cost here than in the U.S., though traditionally the two numbers have been at parity. Even with some easing in ...","With last week’s budget, Ottawa reversed course somewhat on measures to cool the country’s overheated housing market. Having tightened borrowing rules to reduce the risk of people defaulting on their mortgages and help ease the unsustainable upward pressure on home prices, the government is looking to make borrowing easier for first-time buyers.

Over three years, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) will make up to $1.25 billion available under the First-Time Home Buyer Incentive. The program will provide such buyers a shared equity mortgage equal to five per cent of the cost of a resale home or 10 per cent for new construction. Only households with annual incomes of less than $120,000 qualify, with the maximum mortgage value set at four times household income.

The maximum rate will cover the average sale price in much of the country, but not in the particularly troublesome markets of Toronto and Vancouver, where average prices are $765,000 and $925,000 respectively.

The budget also boosts the Home Buyers’ Plan (HBP) tax-free RRSP withdrawal limit to $35,000 from $25,000.

The government’s moves are something of a pre-election sop for millennials – the entire budget is an attempt at vote-buying, of course – and will be welcomed by groups that balked at the previous measures, particularly those who profit on the backs of homebuyers. They want to see the government back into pumping the real estate market that’s driven a good chunk of the economy while putting Canadians even deeper into debt, all the while excluding growing numbers of people with artificially high prices.

The bigger picture must be taken into account, particularly the on-again, off-again bursting of the housing bubble.

A series of reports, from agencies with no horse in the race, raises doubts about the sustainability of a decade-long upward trend that slowed only marginally during the worst of the 2008 recession, the same one that continues to plague housing prices in parts of the U.S.

There are glaring differences between the housing markets in the two countries. Where the U.S. wilted under foreclosures and soft sales, the Canadian market remained hot in many quarters. On average, homes are twice the cost here than in the U.S., though traditionally the two numbers have been at parity.

Even with some easing in Vancouver and Toronto, average home prices remain far out of reach of many residents.

None of that sounds sustainable. Some economists and market watchers are waiting on a correction. Still, there are plenty of us who see housing as a safe investment, unlike, for instance, the stock market, which remains volatile. Both markets are a gamble, however, and both were and continue to be heavily manipulated by the financial sector, the very industry responsible for the systemic corruption at the root of our economic woes.

Speculation, of course, is another word for gambling. When you buy stocks, you’re betting they’ll go up in price (or down, if you’re shorting). Other than securities, there are a host of speculative investments for those willing to take the risk. Speculation also extends to the housing market. This applies not only to people who buy homes to flip them, or farmland in the hope of a future subdivision, but to many who’ve entered the housing market in recent years.

Moves that counter risk and end the speculative aspect of real estate can only be a good thing. The real goal is housing people, after all, and the lower the price, the better.","Looking for votes, Liberals change tack on housing issues",ObserverXtra,https://observerxtra.com/2019/03/28/looking-for-votes-liberals-change-tack-on-housing-issues/

315,World,2019-03-28T17:37:00.0000000Z,"The bill, presented Thursday, also includes two notwithstanding clauses to override guarantees in the Quebec and Canadian human rights charters ... The main opposition Liberals and the second opposition Québec Solidaire caucus remained seated Thursday ...","QUEBEC — Teachers, judges, lawyers, transit commissions, municipalities, school boards and the staff of provincial government bodies would be bound by the Coalition Avenir Québec’s proposed bill enshrining “the laicity of the state.”

Immigration Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette called the bill “the logical followup” to Quebec’s Quiet Revolution, a period of rapid social change in the 1960s, when the role of the Roman Catholic Church in education and health care was scaled back.

The bill would amend Quebec’s human rights charter to affirm the religious neutrality or “laicity” of the state.

A ban on wearing religious signs by designated officials, including the Speaker and Deputy Speakers of the Quebec National Assembly would be imposed under Bill 21, which the government of Premier François Legault hopes to see adopted before the assembly’s summer adjournment.

The bill, presented Thursday, also includes two notwithstanding clauses to override guarantees in the Quebec and Canadian human rights charters protecting fundamental rights, including religious freedom.

“It’s a very important day today,” Legault told reporters on his way into the assembly.

“What I want to try to do in the next few weeks is to unite as many Quebecers as possible.”

And he appealed for a “serene debate,” although Quebec’s human rights commission and religious minorities in the province have expressed opposition to the bill even before it was presented.

Legault said the issue of dealing with religious differences has been left unresolved in the province for too long, calling his bill “an important act” to resolve an issue that should have been dealt with “years ago.”

In Halifax Thursday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said “it is unthinkable for me to legitimize, in a free society, discrimination against citizens based on their religion.”

To get more support for his bill, making Quebec officially a secular state, the premier said, he has agreed to remove the crucifix from the National Assembly and has agreed to a “grandfather clause” that would allow teachers who wear them on the job to continue to do so.

“Because my goal is really to unite Quebecers,” he explained.

Bill 21 makes no mention of the crucifix, leaving it to the assembly to decide. However, the assembly voted unanimously Thursday morning to remove it.

Judges in the province have told the government they cannot be bound by a ban on religious signs, under the separation of powers protecting the judiciary. The bill calls on Quebec’s Conseil de la magistrature to enforce the ban.

Bill 21 does not appear to apply to federally-appointed judges, named to Quebec Superior Court, Federal Court and the Quebec Court of Appeal.

While teachers, principals and vice principals in public schools would be subject to the ban on religious signs, their counterparts in Quebec’s subsidized private schools could still wear religious signs.

In Quebec, there are few religious signs worn by judges, prosecutors or peace officers. Some teachers, who are Muslims, do wear the hijab head covering. In addition to judges, court staff such as clerks, sheriffs and bankruptcy registrars could not wear religious signs on the job.

The ban would apply to Quebec prosecutors and persons designated by the National Assembly, as well as police and other peace officers.

Bill 21 also includes provisions banning the Islamic niqab and other face coverings, with such a ban applying to elected members of the National Assembly, municipal councillors, school board commissioners, National Assembly and Lieutenant Governor’s staff, and peace officers.

The ban on face coverings applies to doctors, dentists and midwives and daycare staff.

As well, people seeking public services, such as driving tests or health care and those boarding public transit could be refused these services if they refused to uncover their faces.

Exceptions are allowed for reasons of health, disability “or because of the requirements tied to their functions or the performance of certain tasks.”

The Parti Québécois, now the third opposition in the assembly, with nine seats, said it would be willing to support Legault’s bill if he agreed to a grandfather clause, allowing affected employees now wearing religious signs, to continue to do so.

She has put one between her upper legs on virtually every changeover during the week — even Saturday ...,"MIAMI — And on the seventh day, Bianca Andreescu rested.

The 18-year-old from Mississauga, Ont., bookended the craziest, most successful week of her young career with another win over world No. 4 Angelique Kerber of Germany.

This one came late Saturday night — technically early Sunday morning — in the third round of the Miami Open. It was a rematch of the BNP Paribas Open final from a week earlier, when Andreescu won her first career Premier Mandatory-level tournament on the WTA Tour.

There were words of praise from Kerber after the Canadian’s win at Indian Wells. But in Miami, there was some drama.

Both Andreescu and Kerber were trending on Twitter in Canada on Sunday morning. It was all because of a few choice words from the 31-year-old German as she approached the net after her loss.

“You’re the biggest drama queen ever,” Kerber said.

Combine that with a runner-up “drive-by” handshake — the slightest, barest brush of the fingers and no eye contact at all — and you have the makings of a salty rematch when these two players meet again.

Shortly before lunch hour Sunday, Kerber issued a tweet in which she congratulated Andreescu “for a great performance and a well-deserved win.”

Tough battle out there last night @miamiopen! Congrats to Bianca @Bandreescu_ for a great performance and a well deserved win. 👍 pic.twitter.com/IpXzAJRNpi — Angelique Kerber (@AngeliqueKerber) March 24, 2019

If it wasn’t a direct apology, it was at least a tacit admission that the match was won with the tennis, not because of any drama.

The Canadian briefly addressed the situation after the match to a small group of media members.

“Really? I have no idea. I don’t even want to know,” she said, acknowledging that she did realize something was said, and it wasn’t the typical handshake. “For sure (I noticed). I just didn’t say anything,” Andreescu added.

The handshake itself wasn’t all that unusual. But the choice words were quite rare.

Kerber told German reporters that she wasn’t at all pleased with the scheduling this week. After a first-round bye, the former world No. 1 and current No. 4 was relegated to the small, noisy Court 6 for her second-round match.

The late start on the stadium court Saturday night only exacerbated her annoyance. The match was scheduled for a “not before 9:30 p.m.” start but a long day session and a three-set win by David Ferrer over No. 2 men’s seed Alexander Zverev meant the match didn’t start until 11:18 p.m. local time.

Kerber had injury issues of her own to worry about, with a thick wrap around her left upper leg. Combine those elements with the notion of losing to a teenager twice within a week, and her post-match mood was grim.

At times Saturday, Kerber almost appeared to be giving the match away to her younger opponent. Down 6-4, 4-1, Kerber rallied just long enough to win the second set, although her movement appeared compromised at times.

“I did feel that a bit. So I kind of fed off of that,” Andreescu said of Kerber’s fluctuating intensity level. “I think I really deserve to be where I am right now, I’ve been working really hard, and hopefully I can keep it up.”

It wasn’t clear what Kerber was upset about in the Andreescu match.

The Canadian took a medical timeout after seven games to receive treatment on her right arm. The trainer returned on two other occasions to work on the arm and shoulder area.

Fellow Canadian player Felix Auger-Aliassime said Kerber’s comment was “kind of a shame,” but added that it’s not unusual in sports.

“It’s too bad (Kerber) made that comment. I don’t think it was necessary. But then again, those things happen in sports. It’s not that rare,” he said.

Andreescu’s plan for Sunday was to catch up on sleep and get plenty of treatment for her various aches and pains. She’ll play No. 21 seed Anett Kontaveit of Estonia in the fourth round on Monday.

The teenager has been making liberal use of ice towels and ice bags at the event. She has put one between her upper legs on virtually every changeover during the week — even Saturday night, with the temperature holding steady at 20 C and the sun not a factor.

Andreescu, the world No. 24, would need to reach the final to break into the top 20.

The highest seed left in her quarter of the draw is No. 13 Caroline Wozniacki after top-seeded Naomi Osaka suffered an upset loss Saturday.

Islanders will go to the polls April 23 in a provincial election announced late Tuesday.

Recent polls have put the Greens out in front, and leader Peter Bevan-Baker believes his party can win a province that has only ever been governed by the Liberals or Tories.

“That possibility is there. Emotionally, politically and intellectually, I feel like I’m ready for that challenge, in a way that I wasn’t perhaps a year ago,” he said.

“This could be a truly historic moment not only in Canadian politics but for the future of our grandchildren.”

Bevan-Baker, 56, grew up in Scotland and immigrated to Canada in 1985, living in Newfoundland and then Ontario before settling in Prince Edward Island in 2003. He became a Canadian citizen in 1992.

A dentist by profession, he became his party’s first member of the P.E.I. legislature in 2015, following nine unsuccessful bids provincially and nationally for the party.

Since then, the Greens captured a second seat on the Island, and have been successful in getting members elected in other provinces, including three during last year’s New Brunswick election.

Bevan-Baker – who celebrated Tuesday’s election call by playing “First Call” on his trumpet at a nomination meeting – said he believes the time for the Green party has arrived.

“That sort of global movement away from conventional politics and unimaginative politicians, you see that expressed everywhere,” he said, citing recent elections in U.S. and Ontario as expressions of disgruntlement with conventional politics.

“I think what’s happening on P.E.I. is a local expression of that global phenomenon,” he said.

WATCH: New Brunswick election: Elizabeth May congratulations Greens for big win

A Corporate Research Associates opinion poll released this month suggests the Greens had a healthy lead, followed by the Progressive Conservatives, who picked a new leader, Dennis King, in February.

The Liberals were in third place, the poll suggests.

Bevan-Baker said that both delights and surprises him. He said he has to accept the possibility of forming government.

“We’ve crafted a platform, that for perhaps the first time ever in Canada, a Green platform that might have to be implemented. You come at it with a different lens. You can’t be just aspirational and vague and uncosted. You have to have a detailed and costed platform, which we have,” he said.

But Liberal Premier Wade MacLauchlan has issued a caution about the Green party, saying the province’s future is too important to risk on uncertain expensive social experiments.

Bevan-Baker said he’s not sure what MacLauchlan is referring to, but believes it could be his suggestion that P.E.I. would be a good place for a pilot program for a universal basic income. He said that would be expensive at first, but pay off in the long run.

For his part, MacLauchlan used the first full day of the campaign to promise at least 3,500 new jobs over the next four years.

He said that’s in addition to the 5,000 full-time jobs added over the last four years.

“As I have said numerous times since I became premier, the creation of jobs and job choices for Islanders has to be the number one priority of government.”

“Our record in this field is strong. However, our present success is no reason to take the foot off the gas. Support for workers, for employers and for the next generations of workers needs to continue.”

The announcement includes a $4.5 million P.E.I. Worker Benefit to assist 12,600 low-income Islanders.

The Liberals would also spend $750 million on infrastructure programs to improve roads, bridges and schools, with a focus on job creation.

MacLauchlan said money would also be spent on a number of training programs, including new vocational facilities at Island high schools, and the small business tax rate would be reduced to 2.5 per cent by 2020.

Repeated calls requesting an interview with Progressive Conservative Leader Dennis King were not returned Wednesday.

Bevan-Baker said his party’s platform will be released in its entirety – likely next week.

While the parties have begun to pitch their issues, Don Desserud, a political scientist at the University of Prince Edward Island, said he believes the election will come down to personalities.

“It’s going to be an election based on the personalities of the leaders and people are going to vote according to whether they like or dislike the leaders of the parties,” Desserud said.

“The Progressive Conservatives are rising in the polls. The Liberals are falling in the polls and the Greens are staying quite steady high in the polls. I think it all has to do with the leaders and how well they’re liked,” he said.

The Island economy has been strong and the Conference Board of Canada recently said P.E.I. would lead the country in economic growth for the year ahead.

Desserud said voters blame the government when the economy is bad, but unfortunately for the Liberals, they don’t often credit the government with the economy is good.

“The Green party has been prudent in the way in which they have presented themselves and their policies and have appealed to the small ‘c’ conservatism of the Island. That’s worked really well for them, but I think right now they’re benefiting from the fact they are the alternative,” Desserud said.",Prince Edward Island’s Green leader keen to make electoral history,Global News,https://globalnews.ca/news/5103444/pei-election-green-party-leader/

Health Blue-green algae can have major effects on Canadian lakes Thursday, March 28th 2019, 2:41 pm - New research indicates an increase in blue-green algae found in Canadian lakes may have longterm effects. If you’re a Canadian cottager, your lake, or one nearby, has likely experienced a blue-green algae bloom in the past decade. Until recently, however, any health concern was limited to those who might have had direct contact with the algae, either by drinking the water or swimming in it. But new research out of Florida Gulf Coast University (FGCU) reveals that particles can become airborne and travel, getting into the lungs of those as far away as two kilometres from the algae itself. RELATED: Blue-green algae made a stink in Toronto last summer Blue-green algae is cyanobacteria, which contains the toxins microcystin and BAMA, both of which are dangerous to humans and animals. What isn’t yet known is at what levels they cause negative health issues and over what length of exposure. SEE BELOW: THE EFFECTS OF BLUE-GREEN ALGAE

Michael Parsons, a professor of marine science at FGCU and one of the researchers, isn’t sounding the alarm yet, though he says more research is crucial to find out whether these detectable levels of toxins can negatively impact health. “There are World Health Organization guidelines that say don’t get in the water if the microcystin concentrations are above a certain level,” says Parsons. “But for the air, there are no strict guidelines around when you should be avoiding the air or not breathing without a filtration device and so forth.” What’s more, he says, “we have no idea how long these toxins stay in our system.”

The bacteria can be found in almost every Canadian lake, David Schindler, a professor of ecology at the University of Alberta, told CBC News last summer, after the deaths of three dogs in New Brunswick were blamed on the bacteria. Most of us don’t notice the presence of the bacteria until we can see it in the form of a bloom and, often, smell it.

John Cassani’s primary concern is chronic exposure. Cassani is the Calusa Waterkeeper in southwest Florida for the Waterkeeper Alliance, a global organization dedicated to preserving water quality. He says that a lot of people are nervous about these new findings. “We’d all like to know more about what it means,” he says, noting that these blue-green algae blooms are happening more frequently and covering a broader area.

Until we get more answers, Parsons encourages cottagers to stay out of the water (and keep pets out) when there’s a bloom. And, he says, “listen to your body. If it smells bad, and you’re not feeling well, avoid the area.”

322,,2019-03-26T10:38:00.0000000Z,"For them, it’s their green-reading books ... Early returns on the RBC Canadian Open’s new date have been positive. Rory McIlroy’s decision to play this year at Hamilton Golf and Country ...","Every week on the PGA Tour you will see spectators standing 10 feet away from Tiger Woods or Rory McIlroy staring at a four-inch screen in their hand instead of watching their favourite golfer hit a shot.

We’ve become so in love with technology that even when the real thing is right in front of us, we can’t pull ourselves away.

But it’s not just the fans. Golfers have gone down the same path. For them, it’s their green-reading books.

With tour pros so obsessed with ‘staying in the moment’ it’s a little ironic that many of them constantly bury their noses in a book that tells them what is happening on the very green they are standing on.

“Hmm, it says there’s a little knob in the green right there.”

YES, AND IT’S ACTUALLY RIGHT THERE.

Paul Casey was asked about greens books on Sunday after his win at the Valspar Championship. One point he made was that if the information is available, players will use it because nobody wants to be left behind.

“I’m not a massive fan of them, but I do use them, I mean seriously, if there’s any advantage I’m going to take it, if I can get it,” he said.

While knee-high ball drops and caddies lining up players have gotten much of the revamped rules discussion, new limitations on green-reading material also came into effect on Jan. 1, 2019. The main differences are a scale limit (any image of a putting green must be limited to a scale of 3/8 inch to 5 yards, or smaller), a size limit (any book must not be larger than 4 ¼ inches x 7 inches), and any hand-written notes must be done by the caddie or the player and follow the same size constraints.

The USGA notes that this is a first step and the books will remain under review for 2019.

Casey, who uses the information predominantly for approach shots and to double-check what he sees in the green, said they have created a gray area and he thinks the governing bodies should decide one way or the other whether to allow them.

“I say either let them happen or ban them. That’s kind of my position on a lot of this stuff. I don’t like gray area,” he said.

Originally, there were going to be further limits on hand-written notes but that plan was tossed out during the feedback period prior to Jan. 1.

“Luke Donald, for example, writes down every single putt he hits and draws that into a book and has that information with him,” Casey said. “That’s his right, that’s his advantage, that’s his homework that he’s done.”

“I don’t know what the solution is, I’m not a rule maker, I would probably ban printed books and allow guys to draw whatever they want.”

CANADIAN OPEN EH-OK!

Early returns on the RBC Canadian Open’s new date have been positive.

Rory McIlroy’s decision to play this year at Hamilton Golf and Country Club provides a level of star power that is just one rung – albeit a large one – below Tiger Woods. McIlory is the game’s second biggest star and an immediate illustration of how much better the pre-U.S. Open date is compared to the post-British Open date.

Canadian Roger Sloan told Postmedia before the McIlroy announcement that he thinks the new date is full of promise.

“I think you might not see the benefits for another couple of years, but you obviously have the factor that guys want to play the week before the U.S. Open,” Sloan said “Especially at Hamilton you are going to have challenging conditions for a national open. I think a few more guys will end up playing it and I think it’s great for the tournament.”

Bubba Watson, whose wife Angie is from Ontario, has played in three of the past four RBC Canadian Opens, and you can count on him coming to Hamilton this June.

After finishing tied for fourth on Sunday at the tough, shot-makers Copperhead course at Innisbrook, Watson was asked about the upcoming Masters, where he is a two-time champion. In a Bubba stream-of-consciousness answer he went past Augusta National, all the way north to Canada, and back to the 2006 champion at Hamilton, Jim Furyk.

“Going to Augusta I feel good, I love that place,” Watson said. “Looking forward to the other tournaments, Hamilton is going to be amazing up there in how difficult that golf course is and so maybe I’ll plot myself around it there, too. Jim Furyk’s done all right doing that, so maybe I’ll copy Jim.”

BRACKET TIME!

This week, we're featuring one of our favourite greens: spinach!

Spring is trying very hard to get here but the weather is cooperating to varying degrees (literally) depending on which part of the country you're in! But we're gonna guess that you're probably over winter and you're dying for some green. Any kind of green!

Enter one of our favourite green veggies - spinach! This is one green that's packed with good stuff - vitamin C, vitamin A, beta-carotene and it's a great source of iron. No wonder Popeye's muscles popped whenever he ate his spinach.He knew what he was doing!

Spinach is great in the kitchen. It's crisp, with a mild flavour when it's raw - making it perfect for smoothies and salads. Cook it up and the flavour intensifies. It can also add some very vibrant colour to your plate, which is great when you're so done with winter. And, it's a very easy veggie to sneak into a wide array of dishes if you've got some picky eaters who struggle to get their veggies.

Spinach decreases in volume dramatically when it's cooked so don't panic if a dish calls for cups and cups of raw spinach. That's going to shrink tremendously once it starts to cook up. Spinach also release a lot of water when it's cooked (which is why it shrinks so much). So keep that in mind when you're experimenting on your own with adding spinach into a cooked dish.

We've got a great collection of recipes here for you today - there's some delicious dips and salads as you'd expect but there's also some great recipes to help you avoid food waste like a Savoury Croissant Casserole with Mushrooms, Spinach and Cheese and some Spinach and Cheese Potato Pancakes.

There's some hearty soups like White Kidney Bean and Spinach Soup, Creamy Spinach Tortellini Soup with Chicken and Velvety Spinach and Cauliflower Soup With Tahini.

If you want to sneak some spinach in to dishes kids will love try the Green Monster Muffins or the Spinach Brownies!

And spinach teams up perfectly with eggs for breakfast and brunch like Baked Feta, Dill and Spinach Frittata, or Bacon Egg and Spinach Muffin Cups. We also love the Spinach and Caramelized Onion Breakfast Brioche.

So, we invite you to ""go green"" with over 30 spinach recipes that are sure to add some vibrance and flavour to your plate!

The last time I ate at 100 Laurier, it was still called the Canadian Museum of Civilization — I was 13; it was a cafeteria, nothing “spectacle,” as they say across the river.

Now, with Bistro Boreal, there are more varied and sophisticated food offerings. Located on the Laurier side of the building, the restaurant is a calm space that mirrors the museum’s graceful curves. (Though it’s a shame it doesn’t take in the waterfront view.)

The menu offers plenty of meat and cheese dishes, as well as creative sandwiches and salads. The salmon rillettes, for example, is presented as a tower of diced salmon atop stone-milled toast, adorned with a caper aioli and pickled red onion. Salmon can be light, but this is different, and the richness is welcome on a chilly day. The wilted micro-greens tossed haphazardly on top, however, signal an issue with the ingredients, the service, or some combination of the two.

Those same greens appear on my open-faced chicken sandwich. The meat portion is huge and surprisingly moist. We are excited to see mention of “local” regarding the brie; however, when asked about the source, the server replies “somewhere in Quebec.” In the end, the chicken overwhelms the brie.

On another lunch visit, the soup of the day is a creamy, subtle purée of carrot and squash with maple notes. The braised-beef poutine is good, though it would benefit from a tangy element. The bison burger is cooked to perfection, and the grilled naan wrap — with juicy chunks of chicken breast in an aioli sauce — is a hit. And the fries are excellent.

Desserts include a bread pudding that is more like fruitcake, but that’s fine — it is warm and comforting and much better than the typical museum café treats. Servers are friendly, but not well informed about the menu. The drinks list offers Canadian and international choices in beer and wine, and a display of Quebec gin hints at an effort to connect with its suppliers.

Overall, there is a sense that Boreal is a cafeteria growing up into the kind of modern eatery people are coming to expect. There are hits and misses at Boreal, but it is heading in the right direction.

Isle Royale National Park superintendent Phyllis Green says the wolves were moved over the weekend from Michipicoten Island, where the pack was at risk of starvation, to Isle Royale in Michigan.

The wolves first got over to Michipicoten Island in the winter of 2014 when ice allowed them to cross over from the Ontario mainland.

After gradually killing off the caribou they preyed on, the wolves on the island were in danger of dying of starvation without intervention.

Green says many of the wolves on the island were in poor condition when they were caught.

She says the six wolves will be reunited on Isle Royale with two other wolves that had been previously moved off the island a month earlier.",Canadian-U.S. team saves six wolves from starvation on Lake Superior island,O Canada,https://o.canada.com/news/six-wolves-saved-from-starvation-on-lake-superior-island-sent-to-michigan/wcm/b6dbc7ab-5346-4fa3-a3be-4e2fdac488be
329,Business,2019-03-27T11:00:00.0000000Z,The discounted price for Canadian heavy crude remains significant ... Certainly we can do the same in Alberta. Kenneth Green is an analyst at the Fraser Institute.,"Imperial oil recently announced its approved $2.6-billion oilsand project (the Aspen project), which was expected in 2022, will now be delayed by at least one year.

Rich Kruger, chairman of Imperial, blamed the decision to delay on “uncertainty in the current business environment” and concerns over the Alberta’s government’s decision to curtail oil production in an effort to shore up the price Canadian producers receive for their oil.

Kruger is not alone in his concern about uncertainty in the current business environment, particularly here in Alberta.

The Fraser Institute annually surveys senior executives in the upstream oil and gas sector to record their perceptions of the regulatory environment.

The news for Alberta was not good in the recent 2018 survey.

Oil and gas executives continue to indicate there’s considerable uncertainty and barriers to investment compared to 2014 results.

This year Alberta was once again unable to return to the top 20 ranked jurisdictions worldwide, where it had scored from 2012 to 2014.

Since 2015, the Alberta government has implemented a number of changes in policies that affect the oil and gas industry, including higher corporate and personal income taxes, a cap on GHG emissions from oilsands production, a new carbon tax, a review of royalties that created some uncertainty but left the royalty framework relatively unchanged, and most recently the curtailment of oil production.

All these changes in the policy environment come at a time when Canada continues to struggle to build new pipelines to access tidewater and access higher global prices.

The discounted price for Canadian heavy crude remains significant, meaning Canadian heavy oil producers receive less revenue than other producers.

In fact, according to a recent study, Canadian heavy oil producers will lose $15.8 billion in foregone revenues due to insufficient pipeline capacity in 2018.

Back to the survey of oil and gas executives, Alberta’s rank dropped from 33 (out of 97) in 2017 to 43 (out of 80) in 2018.

And Alberta remains the second-least attractive jurisdiction to invest in Canada just ahead of British Columbia.

This continues a trend. Alberta’s dropped from 14 (out of 156) in 2014 (and the third most attractive jurisdiction in Canada) to 43rd (out of 80) in 2018 and the fifth most attractive jurisdiction in Canada.

Poorer perceptions of the province’s regulation and taxation regimes have driven much of the change since 2014.

In particular, more than 50% of survey respondents in 2018 see fiscal terms and taxation as deterrents to investment.

While 73% of respondents cited the cost of regulatory compliance as a deterrent to investment this year.

Overall, Alberta’s scores dropped on all of the survey questions pertaining to regulatory enforcement, disputed land claims and quality of infrastructure when compared to last year’s results.

Clearly, Alberta urgently requires regulatory reform to stem the steady bleeding of investment and capital flight from the province.

The tools are well-known — a deregulatory czar to find unneeded regulations and a target of eliminating several old regulations for every new one floated (on a cost basis).

B.C. successfully trimmed its regulations back, as did New Brunswick.

Certainly we can do the same in Alberta.

A contracted capture crew and Ontario’s Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry performed the operation on Friday and Saturday, taking the wolves from Michipicoten Island to Michigan’s Isle Royale. The Canadian-U.S. team also moved over one wolf from Ontario’s mainland.

“The Michipicoten wolves were in poor condition,” said Isle Royale National Park superintendent Phyllis Green. “It was pretty much their last chance.”

The Michipicoten wolves were at risk because the caribou they had preyed on for years had either been killed off or had largely been moved off the island in two separate operations last year.

READ MORE: Ontario First Nation and province to remove caribou from wolf infested island

In those moves, the province with the help of the Michipicoten First Nation, transported a total of 15 caribou off the island. Nine went to the Slate Islands and after pressure from the First Nation, six more were moved to Caribou Island – both in Lake Superior.

That was a last-ditch effort to save a once-thriving caribou herd – a population that numbered at 700 after starting with eight animals in 1982. It had been a ministry conservation success story.

Things changed, however, when the wolves arrived on the island via an ice bridge formed in the winter of 2014.

By last winter, few caribou remained before they were moved away.

“They basically have outstanding hunting skills, given their demolishment of the caribou herd,” Green said of the wolves, adding that she’s thrilled to have the new pack in her park. They join two others that were captured from Michipicoten last month.

Isle Royale is currently trying to grow its decimated wolf population that had dwindled to two – a father-daughter-half-sibling inbred pair. The wolves are an important part of the longest-running predator-prey study in the world, which officials hope to continue.

There is an overabundance of moose now on Isle Royale, numbering about 1,500 Green said. That population was long held in check by the wolves.

“The Michipicoten wolves face a lot tougher prey species in the form of a moose, but between their skills and genetics, they are an extremely welcome addition to Isle Royale National Park,” Green said.

There are 15 wolves on the U.S. island now: the two native wolves, two Minnesota wolves brought in last fall, eight from Michipicoten and three wolves from Ontario’s mainland not far from Michipicoten First Nation.

Last week, two U.S. charities – the National Parks of Lake Superior Foundation and the International Wolf Center – had raised money with the hopes of saving the remaining Michipicoten wolves, Green said. They raised $100,000 that covered the cost of the move, she said.

John Yakabuski, Ontario’s minister of natural resources and forestry, called the wolf move a “tremendous success.”

“This is done, quite frankly, at no cost to the taxpayers,” he said, adding that he believes all the remaining wolves have now been moved off the island. “It was always our hope to have the wolves taken off Michipicoten because we were quite justifiably concerned they were going to starve.”

But Aaron Bumstead, the director of lands and economic development with Michipicoten First Nation that helped with the previous caribou and wolf moves, criticized the ministry.

“They went behind our backs and took wolves off the mainland rather than focus on Michipicoten,” Bumstead said, referencing the earlier move in February where weather challenges meant only two wolves were moved off Michipicoten.

“Then they did it again with another wolf from the mainland this weekend. They’ve stopped listening to us, it’s not a partnership anymore.”

The First Nation is happy the wolves were saved, Bumstead said – although they still think there may be a wolf or two left behind – but sad about how the operation unfolded.

They still plan to pressure the government to come up with a plan to return caribou to Michipicoten, which he called “pristine habitat” for the threatened species.

Yakabuski said he hasn’t had any long-term discussions about returning caribou to the island.

“We’re always open to discussing any issue that would enhance the diversity of our wildlife,” he said.",6 wolves on Lake Superior island saved from starvation by Canadian-U.S. team,Global News,https://globalnews.ca/news/5094395/wolves-michipicoten-island/

Logan Boulet's parents will be in Ottawa next week to talk about ""Green Shirt Day"" and organ donation.

The parents of a Lethbridge hockey player, killed in the Humboldt Broncos bus crash last April, are heading to Ottawa to help Canadian Blood Services kick off Organ Donation Awareness Month.

Toby Boulet says he and his wife Bernie will be in the nation's capital this Sunday through Wednesday. Canadian Blood Services is hosting a luncheon for Members of Parliament and has invited the Boulets to be the keynote speakers. Toby says it will be an honour to speak on behalf of their son Logan and all angel donors and their families.

The Boulets will also be promoting the inaugural ""Green Shirt Day"" on April 7th which aims to raise awareness for organ donation and continue the momentum of the ""Logan Boulet Effect.""

The 21 year old was a registered organ donor and since his death has inspired tens of thousands of Canadians to sign up to become organ donors as well.

Nick will ultimately be headed to Sweden ...","

Jeremiah Rodriguez, CTVNews.ca Staff





Two Canadian brothers Nick and Will Laporte have been stranded after Icelandic budget airline WOW Air shut down on Thursday.

Nick was set to fly to Sweden from Toronto while his brother Will was scheduled to fly back home to Toronto from Sweden. But both of their flights were cancelled, with both brothers saying they were confused by the lack of clear communication from the airline.

Icelandic budget airline WOW Air ceased operations on Thursday, stranding passengers across two continents. In a statement on its website, the airline, which had earlier suspended all its flights, told passengers there would be no further flights and advised them to check for flights with other airlines for ways to reach their destinations.

Nick told CTV News Channel that -- on his way to the airport -- he initially received a text message from WOW Airlines stating his flight would be delayed by half an hour.

“So no big deal,” he recalled thinking. But the flight kept being pushed back. Nick said after some confusion over the status of the flight, it was eventually cancelled for good.

Will was genuinely thankful for the “very helpful” airport staff not associated with the airline. “I know there were some frustrated passengers that weren’t exactly polite to these people. So it was a tough situation all-around,” he said.

Meanwhile, his brother Will was headed home to Canada after wrapping up his hockey season in Sweden.

He’s now stranded in Osby, Sweden. He told CTV News Channel that he had initially received an email stating his flight was being delayed by 10 hours.

“But this morning, I read the news that they were no longer running their airline … it’s very disappointing,” Will said. He was later informed by an airline employee he “wasn’t entitled to a refund.”

His brother Nick said he’s since had difficulty reaching any representative from WOW Airlines, but has seen that Icelandic Airlines is offering discounted flights to stranded passengers if they filled out a form.

“I’m waiting to hear back from them and as soon as I get the green light for discounted airfare, I’ll be on my way to Iceland,” he said. Nick will ultimately be headed to Sweden for a training camp he hopes can help him qualify for the men’s 100-metre sprint at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.

“So I’m just kind of sitting tight until then,” he said.

Three students from Kitchener were also affected by the shuttering. They were returning home from Copenhagen and only realized something was wrong when they reached the airline’s front desk and realized no one was there.

Erin McBurney told CTV Kitchener they had to take a costly $1,300 detour in order to return to Toronto. She said their only other options at the time were a $2,000 three-day flight with Air Canada with layovers or a $5,000 direct flight through another airline.

Other passengers have taken to twitter to voice their own frustrations with the flight cancellations.

Hydroponics are systems for growing plants in water— without soil. The co-op's food is growing in a greenhouse made out of an upgraded shipping container from Ottawa-based company The Growcer.

The Growcer's greenhouses use water enriched with nutrients, an artificial light source and carbon dioxide to grow plants ""as quickly as possible,"" said Corey Ellis, a company co-founder. He said the greenhouses can grow seeds into full plants in about six weeks.

The sea cans are outfitted to keep plants growing when outside temperatures drop as low as -52 C. Ellis said the greenhouses use about as much electricity as an air conditioner that's running 24/7.

He said the Yellowknife Co-op should be able to stock its vegetables the same day they are harvested, ""which is pretty unique and I think something [customers] will really appreciate.""

The Yellowknife Co-op's sea can greenhouse isn't the first in the North. Ellis said his company has installed them in Kugluktuk, Nunavut, and Kuujjuaq, Que., as well.

Right now, the Co-op is growing kale, spinach and bok choi, as well as a variety of lettuces and herbs.

Nelson said the plants are pesticide-free and when harvested, are expected to be fresher and last longer than their counterparts trucked up from the South.

If all goes well, he said, the store will harvest about 400 plants a week.

Curious Yellowknife Co-op shoppers will be able to watch the in-house farming live.

Cameras have been set up in the greenhouse and the plan is to broadcast a livestream onto a large-screen TV set up in the produce department, said Nelson.

Nelson said the idea is not to produce a cheaper vegetable.

""Power and heat up here isn't cheap, so this isn't something to subsidize produce here,"" he said. ""Produce is cheap, it's no different than other locations in the South.""

The hope is to make a profit off the home-grown greens, said Nelson, and then return those profits to co-op members.

It’s no secret that the cannabis industry is blowing up. Earlier this year, investors received hard numbers to support the hype.

In 2018, more than five million Canadians purchased cannabis worth at least $6 billion. Over the next few years, spending is expected to reach $9 billion in Canada alone. Increased spending in the U.S. could more than triple that market size.

In January, an analyst at Cowen estimated that the U.S. marijuana market will be worth at least $40 billion over the next few years. By 2030, the U.S. market should surpass $80 billion. Internationally, the pie grows even bigger.

In 2018, nearly every cannabis stock was a winner. As the market matures, it will likely become more difficult to simply ride the wave. That means picking the right stocks will prove increasingly important.

Two of the most popular cannabis stocks are Green Organic Dutchman Holdings (TSX:TGOD) and Aurora Cannabis (TSX:ACB)(NYSE:ACB), both of which have very different futures. Which stock should you buy to take advantage of the booming cannabis markets?

Pay attention to this factor

There should be plenty of ways to make money through cannabis, but for the biggest gains, companies need to look internationally. Aurora’s $13 billion market cap greatly exceeds Green Organic’s $1.3 billion valuation for this exact reason.

Already, estimates show that the Canadian cannabis market is two-thirds penetrated. Over the next decade, new growth opportunities may only add around 50% to the market’s value. That’s nothing the sneeze at, but it’s significantly smaller than what can be achieved internationally.

The U.S., for example, still hasn’t legalized recreational use on a national level. That leaves room for the market to expand by leaps and bounds over the next few years. A handful of states could double the market in a single year.

Outside the U.S., opportunities grow even larger. By establishing itself early in a fully legalized market, Aurora is positioned as the best cannabis stock for tapping global growth.

Today, Aurora is the largest legal marijuana producer in the world. Sales span 22 countries across five continents, giving it the biggest market share for medical marijuana in both Europe and Latin America.

Green Organic, for comparison, is largely a specialty Canadian play. Its focus on purely organic cannabis should be a profitable differentiator over the next few years, but its international focus lags considerably. Apart from its 49% interest in Jamaica-based Epican, Green Organic simply cannot match Aurora’s size and scale on the international stage.

Which stock wins?

Importantly, both companies look well positioned to dominate their areas of focus. Aurora is clearly focused on tapping the massive global demand for cannabis, while Green Organic is looking to avoid the specter of commoditization by focusing on value-added items like organic and Jamaican-branded products.

While both companies should do well, Aurora is the clear choice. As noted earlier, the U.S. alone has ample space to double or triple its market size over the next few years. Adding in growth from every country in Europe, Asia, and beyond only magnifies this opportunity.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Parliament in Ottawa on March 19. (David Kawai/Bloomberg News)

Contributing columnist

This week, the Canadian Parliament’s Liberal-dominated Justice and Human Rights Committee closed down its investigation into the SNC-Lavalin affair. The controversy has plagued the Canadian government for weeks, raising questions about the inner workings of its machinery and whether politicians, staffers and civil servants put inappropriate pressure on former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to secure a deferred prosecution agreement for Quebec-based engineering giant SNC-Lavalin. The scandal has produced four resignations, including one of the prime minister’s top aides, the country’s top civil servant and two cabinet members.

But will any of this matter when Canadians go to the polls in October? Perhaps a bit, but less than you might expect.

After the Liberals on the committee ended their investigation, arguing they had learned everything they needed to learn and that no rules or laws were broken, opposition members threatened retaliation. The Conservative Party committed themselves to delaying the budget. That didn’t work. There was some parliamentary stalling — including a marathon, overnight voting session— and a walkout that caught the eye of keen observers, but the stunt failed. Then, former cabinet minister Jane Philpott gave an interview in which she said “there’s much more to the story that needs to be told.” After that came leaks about Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his former justice minister, Wilson-Raybould, clashing over a Supreme Court of Canada nominee, and yet another Liberal blocking move, as government-side members of Parliament on the ethics committee shut down attempts to launch an investigation into the matter.

Opposition frustration is palpable. The desire to know more is understandable. Both might also be futile.

The Liberals are playing a cynical game of stalls and half-measures, but it looks like they have a good shot to win it, and the upcoming election. It’s hard to imagine that the SNC-Lavalin story and the feud within the Liberal Party will ever end. But it will. Everything does.

The Liberal strategy is sneaky and clever. Their plan is to shut down the committee investigation, repeat “jobs, jobs, jobs” as a defense, claim that the ethics commissioner’s probe is plenty (the commissioner is on medical leave, and his office is not, strictly speaking, geared toward such matters), appoint a former Liberal cabinet minister — highly respected and competent — to look into splitting the attorney general and justice minister positions, kick the can down the road to the election, and wait for rally-time come the fall.

Those who support the government and argue there’s nothing to the SNC scandal, or it’s about other, more nefarious things that have nothing to do with the well-meaning prime minister and those around him, may be right.

But I’m not convinced. The fact is that we don’t know. That’s the problem. We have a series of incompatible stories and inconsistent interpretations of events. It seems there were no laws broken, importantly, but those involved in the affair may have crossed ethical boundaries. Voters, the ultimate judges of the political record, will have to make up their minds based on the information they have — or can remember in six months. That’s probably good news for the lot that’s currently in power.

The Liberals are banking, surely, on the hope that they’ll be seen as having done something about this despite preventing a proper and full investigation — or public inquiry — and depriving the kerfuffle of the oxygen it needs to keep going. In June, the House of Commons is expected to rise for the summer. That’s the end of parliamentary mechanisms and tricks for the opposition parties. Clever, clever.

The government should be able to ride the recently released budget (which received muted coverage) and some end-of-calendar bills through the spring, deflecting opposition attacks, and calming and rallying their own caucus. Next, they’ll hope that Canadians will have already made up their minds about the SNC affair, get tired of the whole mess and move on before summer hits and everybody tunes out. Then it’s the fall and time to vote.

During the election, the Liberals will warn Canadians about the Conservatives, scaremongering by citing the possible return of “Harper’s party,” thus simultaneously fighting the election against the old boss and signaling the inadequacies of the new boss. In 2015, the Liberals ran a slick campaign, and they’ll be well-positioned to do it again — even if they can’t adopt the hopeful rhetoric that helped them form government in the first place. The Conservatives, New Democrats, Greens and also-rans might try to remind the country about SNC and other scandals, but that messaging will be trickier in the context of an election in which voters will not just be focused on past misdeeds but also on what parties are offering to do for them going forward.

More than a century ago, Canada’s first and booziest prime minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, was called a drunk by a supporter of the opposition leader George Brown. “Yes,” Macdonald replied. “But the people prefer John A. drunk to George Brown sober.”

Trudeau finds himself in a similar spot, and he’s betting his government that the people will prefer him surrounded by a haze of uncertainty over the SNC-Lavalin affair to Andrew Scheer or Jagmeet Singh. It’s a bet he might very well win.

How to recycle, reduce and reuse are all part of being green in the environmental sense. There are many things we do in the kitchen to be green. So, how do we go green in the bathroom?

Installing low-flow shower heads, dual-flush toilets and efficient lights is part of the answer. Once that’s done, there are other things you can do about your habits using this most personal of rooms.

When it comes to decor, choosing a fabric shower liner over a vinyl one is a simple thing that will pay for itself in a very short time. Vinyl liners tend to get grungy pretty fast, not to mention tearing away from the shower curtain hooks at either end. A fabric liner washes with your towels, hangs back up to dry and will last years. Plus, it doesn’t have that funky vinyl smell when you open it.

As for towels, choose good towels made from Turkish cotton or bamboo to save you money. These towels become more absorbent with use. The fabrics last longer, hold the colour and will look better hanging on the bar. Cotton from India is also absorbent. Typically, cotton from China is less so.

When you’re laundering towels, never use fabric softener as a liquid or dryer sheet with any towels (kitchen or bath). The chemicals in the softeners coat the fibres of the towels to reduce static. Over time, this also reduces the absorbency factor. That’s why the towel just seems to swish the water around your skin rather than absorbing it. Wool dryer balls are a fabulous alternative to help reduce static, decrease drying time and increase absorbency.

As for garbage, Joseph Joseph has a great garbage can with one lid and two openings. The larger hole is for paper, recycled with the other household waste. The other, smaller opening is for garbage. Both holes are too small for the dog to put her nose into (another plus).

When it comes to cleaning, we are all wooed a bit by the ease of cleaning liquids. Who doesn’t want a tub or toilet that practically cleans itself with a squirt or two of something that smells fresh? In reality, those chemicals are going down the drain and out into our environment. Using vinegar or baking soda with a good toilet brush, such as the Joseph Joseph silicone choice, and my other favourite, the tub scrubber from OXO Good Grips, means the cleaning is done naturally, with a bit of elbow grease and no kneeling awkwardly on the floor. Fill a spray bottle with water, add a drop or two of lemon essential oil and your bathroom smells fresh when you spritz.

Bath bombs, scrubs, salts, soaps and lotions are part of our bathroom routine. Look for ones scented with essential oils and using natural ingredients. Use a foaming pump to decrease the amount of liquid soap used. Look for Canadian products, such as those made by Earth Luxe, Bee by the Sea or Barefoot Venus, when it comes time to soak or slather. One of our all-time favourites is the Mustard Bath soak from Barefoot Venus.

As you get ready to embrace spring and possibly some spring cleaning, look for ways to make your bathroom greener. It becomes a habit to be green, naturally.

Beeswax candles are natural air fresheners. They burn with little or no smoke and clean and gently scent the air.

Westway LAB, Portugal’s first showcase festival and professional music conference, will take place for the sixth consecutive year from 10th to 13th of April in Guimarães, Portugal. Founded in 2014 with a clear mission: to operate a cultural, social and economic transformation through music, crossing borders enabling the construction of sustainable internationalization of artists and professionals from Portugal. During the 4 day event, Guimarães becomes a music city, combining in an innovative way the realization of an event based with three dimensions: Process (artist residencies), Thought (PRO Conferences) and Product (showcases and headline concerts).

According to Rui Torrinha, artistic director of the festival, “continuing to think about the cosmos from this unique place has made Westway LAB a powerful world of possibilities on a human scale, in which the time and space generated have allowed us to recover the original meaning of the word … quality. Not everything here can be said, so discover it and let yourself be discovered but do not miss out, because the spirit is of inclusion.”

And Canada’s stars will be shining soon in Guimarães when the CIMA gang heads to sunny Portugal for a Canadian Country Showcase at Westway Festival! “The Canadian Independent Music Association (CIMA) is always striving to increase export markets for our stakeholders. Westway LAB has an excellent reputation in Europe as a small but bustling festival and conference. We are honoured to have Canada selected as their country of focus for the 2019 edition. The focus on Canada not only strengthens relationships and opportunities between the Portuguese and Canadian delegates but also allows another opportunity for other countries in Europe and abroad to draw their eyes on the talent we have in Canada,” says Trisha Carter, CIMA’s Music Export Manager. “Westway LAB has provided our delegation of artists and companies with curated business-to-business events, market development, showcase opportunities and artistic collaboration. We are proud to include 10 established business professionals from coast to coast and a group of 5 diverse artists within our Westway LAB Canadian contingent. We anticipate great results from this initiative.”

MEGAN NASH

On her new album, Seeker, Saskatchewan Juno Nominee singer/songwriter Megan Nash collaborates with ambient/alt-rock unit Bears In Hazenmore with brilliant results. In sharp contrast to the starkness of her previous acclaimed album Song Harvest Volume One, Seeker takes Nash’s roots-based songwriting into a bold new sonic territory, displaying the undeniable chemistry she has forged with the group over the past year. That shared excitement was the hallmark of the sessions that produced Seeker over the winter of 2017 with engineer Orion Paradis (Library Voices), held at Soul Sound, a space shared with a contemporary dance studio. The flexibility of the location offered Nash the freedom to fully explore the range of her new material, from the atmospheric “Girl Vs Ocean” and “Summer,” to the anthemic “Lavender & Leather” and “Bad Poetry.”But as the concept of Seeker (embodied as well in its title track) suggests, Megan Nash is in the midst of her personal quest for spiritual meaning on her own terms. Her chosen path is through music, and as an artistic statement, Seeker displays the breadth of Nash’s talents as a songwriter, vocalist and producer—the culmination of one stage of her journey while simultaneously beginning the next.

TRIBE ROYAL

From Canada's capital city of Ottawa to the ""Hit Recording Capital of the World"" in Muscle Shoals, Alabama to record with legendary producer Norbert Putnam. Everything changed in 2018 for the fast-rising eclectic quartet when they played Live at Heart Sweden and Live at Heart Newfoundland, which has now led them to upcoming showcases in France at MIDEM, back to Live at Heart Sweden, Milwaukee Summerfest in the USA and now to the prestigious and innovative WESTWAY LAB in Portugal. With a sound that's hard to peg, but familiar nonetheless, the band are commonly marked as having a fresh vibe - vintage sound', nostalgic yet entirely their own; touching on sounds where acts such as The Eagles, The Lovin’ Spoonful, The Beatles and even the late Tom Petty left off. Their sound and style span decades from the clean, warm pop ballads of the early 1960s to the gritty rock of the mid-1970s modernized by the bands own musical era; the alternative rock of the mid-1990 's-early 2000s. Managed by the team at Entertainment Music Group (EMG) Tribe Royal is excited to hit the stage in Guimarães and show how you can become part of the Tribe!

THE EAST POINTERS

The East Pointers - fiddler/singer Tim Chaisson, banjoist Koady Chaisson and guitarist Jake Charron – write about real life, sketching out its joys and sorrows in vivid strokes. That palpable authenticity makes their instrumental tunes practically cartwheel and infuses their lyric-driven songs with poignancy. And it’s why listening to The East Pointers’ brilliant and hotly anticipated second album What We Leave Behind – produced by superstar East Coast-bred songwriter/producer Gordie Sampson – is akin to meeting up with an old friend. As a follow-up to 2015’s internationally acclaimed, JUNO Award-winning debut Secret Victory, What We Leave Behind shares stories previously unheard but framed by a familiar context. The album reflects on the traditions of Canadian Celtic music, where it comes from, and what it means to the people, but also strides in new directions. With a captivating balance between their traditional-sounding instrumental tunes and catchy radio-ready songs, The East Pointers reach out with open arms to a wide range of listeners, inviting them to discover a new love of folk music. The East Pointers continue to blur the lines between traditional and popular music while developing a devoted fan base around the globe.

344,Business,2019-03-25T08:00:00.0000000Z,"The B.C. Greens have committed to supporting the B.C. NDP government ... This was addressed in a policy note last year by Marc Lee of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. ""LNG Canada claims its planned facility would be twice as efficient in ...","1 of 3 2 of 3

The B.C. Greens have committed to supporting the B.C. NDP government on supply and confidence bills.

But Andrew Weaver and his two B.C. Green caucus colleagues have no intention of voting for Bill 10, which would provide a natural gas tax credit for ""qualifying corporations"".

Effective January 1, 2020, this tax credit can be used to reduce B.C.’s corporate income tax rate for eligible companies from 12 percent to 9 percent.

They must be involved in the following activities:

(i) the exploration for or development of petroleum or natural gas;

(ii) the production, gathering, processing, refining, marketing, storage or disposal of petroleum, natural gas or LNG;

(iii) the construction, use or operation of a major LNG facility;

(iv) the liquefaction of natural gas;

(v) and a prescribed activity.

Weaver said that this incentive runs counter to the objectives of the CleanBC plan, which his party supported, to create a more sustainable economy and shrink B.C.'s carbon footprint.

“Continuing to push for LNG development is short-sighted and works directly against CleanBC objectives,” Weaver stated in a party news release. “After years of criticizing the B.C. Liberals for their generous giveaway of our natural gas resources, the B.C. NDP have taken the giveaway to a whole new level. The legislation brought forward by this government is a generational sellout.

“We have only identified a pathway to take us only 75 percent of our 2030 emissions goals, yet we know that LNG Canada will emit an additional 3.45 megatonnes of greenhouse gases every year within our province alone, contributing massively to this gap,"" Weaver continued. ""Government is demonstrating hypocrisy by supporting both LNG and CleanBC. They want to have their cake and eat it, too.""

Finance Minister Carole James, on the other hand, insisted that this legislation will benefit the province.

“British Columbians are counting on us to attract LNG investment that meets strict conditions: delivering jobs and financial benefits to B.C., creating economic partnerships with Indigenous peoples, and protecting our clean air, land and water,” she said in a news release. “This legislation completes the process of creating a fiscal framework that invites investment while supporting those conditions.”

Finance Minister Carole James says incentives for LNG producers will benefit the province.

If passed, Bill 10 will repeal the Liquefied Natural Gas Income Tax Act, which was passed by the former B.C. Liberal government.

According to the NDP government, that ""created barriers for investment in B.C.’s natural gas sector"".

Bill 10 will also repeal the Liquefied Natural Gas Project Agreements Act. According to the NDP government, this legislation left British Columbians ""vulnerable to footing the bill for special industry tax and regulatory protections"".

The new legislation sets the stage for LNG Canada to proceed with a $40-billion investment in an LNG plant near Kitimat and a pipeline to bring natural gas from northeastern B.C.

Even if Bill 10 were defeated, it wouldn't bring down the NDP government and force an election. That's because it's not a confidence or supply bill.

Meanwhile, Peter McCartney, climate campaigner for the Wilderness Committee, has accused Premier John Horgan of ""talking out of both sides of his mouth on climate change"".

“British Columbians are all doing their part to cut carbon pollution while at the same time he’s giving $6 billion in tax breaks and subsidies to construct the most polluting project in the province,” McCartney said in a news release.

The Wilderness Committee's Peter McCartney thinks the premier is talking out of both sides of his mouth when it comes to protecting the climate. Charlie Smith

Last year, the director of external relations with LNG Canada, Susannah Pierce, wrote a commentary on Straight.com saying that at full build-out, the project would emit four megatonnes of carbon dioxide.

""While we will be adding to B.C.’s CO2 emissions, the net gain in reducing global CO2 emissions will be significantly more based on life cycle analyses conducted on B.C. LNG,"" she stated.

McCartney, however, claimed that when completed, LNG Canada's project would be responsible for 8.6 megatonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. And he insisted there's been no proof that production of LNG will reduce greenhouse gas emissions in other countries, despite claims by advocates of the project.

“British Columbians are lurching from one extreme weather event to the next and this government still can’t get serious about what needs to be done,” McCartney stated. “This effort is going to be extremely challenging already, without making it even harder on ourselves.""

The discrepancy between the carbon-dioxide estimates of McCartney and Pierce related to emissions further up the gas supply chain.

This was addressed in a policy note last year by Marc Lee of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives.

""LNG Canada claims its planned facility would be twice as efficient in terms of GHG emissions per tonne of LNG produced, but such a bold claim should be treated with skepticism,"" Lee write. ""The proposed facility would use some B.C. Hydro grid electricity, but only to keep the lights on; the liquefaction process itself would burn gas—a lot of it.""","B.C.

Based on current weather reports West of the green line should be to warm for ice like that. #ForTheThrone pic.twitter.com/7ugDFULBaU — Erik (@Adremdico) March 25, 2019 Though ...","And it seemed the show's Alberta fans were at least partially right. On Monday evening, YouTube user COWanderer commented on the 360-degree video, saying they had had a ""strange request"" to ship a 600-lb. throne to Tumbler Ridge, in British Columbia. They followed up with a link to a video of Lower Babcock Creek, near Tumbler Ridge, which people can ski up in the winter. Twitter users got to work verifying the claim.

Tumbler Ridge is a nine-and-a-half-hour drive from Calgary, just over the provincial border on the eastern side of the Rockies. The large icicle formations seen in the HBO video and videos of Babcock Creek are ""seeps,"" which emerge from the rocky banks.

YouTube user anathema replied to the supposed throne deliverer saying they drove out to check the location and found Babcock Creek almost entirely melted.

""If you tried to walk on it, you'd be swimming,"" they commented, adding that fans may have to ""bushwhack"" through the forest instead of trekking up the once-frozen creek.

Kevin Sharman, who is retired and spends his winters skiing at Babcock Creek and other nearby locations, told The Star earlier Tuesday that the HBO video was clearly filmed ""several weeks ago."" Now, he said the unusually early warmth is melting the ice in the area, and he and his wife had their last ice ski of the season a couple of days ago.

He said it would be tough to get to the location, and ""brutal"" to go through the forest.

Babcock Creek is likely only knee-deep in most areas, he said, but falling through the ice is still no joke. He added that Babcock Creek rises significantly once spring melting is in full force. By early May, the creek will be ""roaring,"" he said, and guessed the throne could be swept away by the water.

But the moment he saw the 360-degree video, Kevin said he knew where the throne was. In the first interview, he said he played it cool, saying he might try to find the throne in a couple of days. He added in an email later that in fact, he was ""on the phone with one hand and packing with the other.""

Sharman ventured out with his wife to try to find it. When they got to the base of the creek, they saw snowmobiles and a trailer and thought somebody had beaten them to the punch.

In reality, Babcock Creek was melting just as Kevin said it would — the ice was cracked and water was rushing, he said — and so HBO had moved the throne to a location that wouldn't endanger the lives of fans who were looking for it.

Two men emerged wearing long fur coats and leather garb for the throne ceremony, Kevin said, and in ""typical Canadian fashion,"" he and Birgit had trouble deciding who would sit on the throne. In the end, Birgit did, and posed for a photo with the two robed men, wearing a large golden crown. (The heavy crown, which comes with its own stand, is so big that Kevin said he'd need to wear a ball cap for it to fit).

""We were very excited,"" said Kevin, adding that they got to keep the crown.

He made that for a 67 to get into the final group.","PALM HARBOR, Fla. – The final hour changed the dynamics of the Valspar Championship, just not the lead.

That still belongs to defending champion Paul Casey, and he saw only the upside of having his three-shot margin shrink to one, and going from a final round pairing with a player who is 0 for 195 on the PGA Tour to playing alongside the No. 1 player in the world.

On a Saturday at Innisbrook that began with all 70 players who made the cut still very much in the mix, Casey surged to a three-shot lead until a bogey on the 18th hole for a 3-under 68 that left him one shot ahead of Dustin Johnson.

Nick Taylor of Abbotsford, B.C., was tied for sixth, four shots back of Casey, Mackenzie Hughes of Dundas, Ont., was tied for 14th at 3 under and Roger Sloan of Merritt, B.C., was tied for 27th.

At stake for Casey is a chance to become the first back-to-back winner of the Valspar Championship since this PGA Tour event began in 2000.

Behind him is Johnson, who is going for his second victory in three starts.

“Of the guys on the leaderboard, he’s the one I would want to be paired with, so it doesn’t bother me,” Casey said. “Obviously, two shots would have been nicer than one, but one is better than level, or one behind.”

Johnson had some say in that final margin with one of his best shots of the day, a 9-iron from a bunker a few paces in front of a steep lip to the front shelf of the 18th green, 10 feet behind the hole. He made that for a 67 to get into the final group.

And that was good news for Casey?

“He’s the best player in the world. That’s why I work and I do what I do, because I want to play against the best in the world,” Casey said.

He also pointed to Johnson being the favourite, at least in the eyes of thousands of fans on a warm, sun-filled day at Innisbrook, the kind of buzz it had last year when Tiger Woods played for the first time.

“I actually feel very little pressure,” Casey said. “You look at my results versus Dustin’s. He’s the better player, so it’s pretty simple. If I go out tomorrow and beat him, I actually might win, plain and simple. Great scenario.”

Only it’s not that simple, and no one knows better than Casey.

A year ago, he rallied from five shots behind with a 65 and wound up winning by one shot over Woods and Patrick Reed. That’s a tribute to Innisbrook, which players regard as one of the purest tests of the year, certainly in Florida.

Casey was at 8-under 205. Eight players had a share of the lead in the third round, and 10 players finished within four shots of the lead.

That starts with Jason Kokrak, winless in his 195 starts as a pro over the better part of eight years. He showed how quickly fortunes can change when he made three birdies in five holes to start the back nine, and then smashed an 8-iron with a breeze at his back that rolled across the 15th green and into the cup for a hole-in-one .

“You can be three, four, five shots out at this golf course and really make some noise if you get it going early,” Kokrak said.

Kokrak shot 30 on the back for a 66 and was poised to play in the final group until Johnson made his birdie on the 18th. Luke Donald, a past winner at Innisbrook playing for only the second time this year – and first since January – grinded his way to a 70 and joined Scott Stallings (70) three shots behind. Louis Oosthuizen, who had a 66 despite two bogeys on the last three holes, and Jim Furyk were among those four behind.

Casey seized control with three birdies in a five-hole stretch to start the back nine. But on the final hole, after Johnson made his birdie, Casey went into the first of a series of miniature church-pew bunkers on the 18th, couldn’t get to the green and missed his 15-foot par putt.

Johnson looked to be giving up plenty of opportunities, especially on the par 5s. He had an iron into the green on Nos. 1 and 11, just missed and chipped to short range before twice missing birdie chances. And then he picked up a birdie on the par-5 14th in the most unlikely way .

From light rough with trees partially in his way, he tried to hammer a 5-wood 290 yards. But it came out with too much wind and floated into the wind, hit a tree well short of the green and nearly went into water that isn’t typically in play. Still, he had a tree between his ball and the green. Johnson hit a hard pitch from 73 yards to the right of the tree and let the hill bring it back to the green. And then he made a 35-foot birdie putt.

“Makes up for the other two,” he said, walking to the 15th tee.

But the big shot was on the 18th, and the birdie got him into the final group in his first trip to Innisbrook since 2010.

“I’m in a good position … because this golf course, it’s tough,” Johnson said. “If I can go out and shoot a good score, then I’ve got a chance.”",Canadian Nick Taylor sits T6 ahead of Valspar finale,Golf Canada,https://golfcanada.ca/article/canadian-nick-taylor-sits-t6-ahead-valspar-finale

OTTAWA – Export Development Canada has provided a guarantee to support a $1 million credit facility extended by a Canadian bank to Clear Blue Technologies – a Canadian cleantech company that helps remotely manage and control power for critical infrastructure in 35 countries worldwide.

“For promising cleantech companies like Clear Blue Technologies, we know that with the right support they can seize incredible growth opportunities through international trade,” said Carl Burlock, senior vice-president of Financing and International Growth Capital at EDC, in a prepared statement. “We are dedicated to supporting Canadian cleantech companies, providing them with knowledge and financial solutions to help them succeed internationally.”

The engineers at Clear Blue Technologies developed smart off-grid technology that remotely manages, monitors and controls wind, solar and hybrid-powered systems such as a telecom tower, street light or security camera. EDC says this technology has already helped bring internet and cell service to people in the Amazon rainforest and in isolated parts of Africa.

“EDC has been at the table helping us build our company from an early stage. The support we have received will provide us with working capital flexibility to deliver on larger orders, adding to our growth this year,” said Miriam Tuerk, Clear Blue Technologies co-founder and CEO. “In emerging markets, financing isn’t an afterthought, it has to be part of your deal, so having EDC by our side makes a significant difference.”",EDC provides $1M financing for Canadian cleantech company,Canadian Manufacturing,https://www.canadianmanufacturing.com/financing/edc-provides-1m-financing-for-canadian-cleantech-company-229802/

After years of little or no employment growth, the labour market improved marginally in 2018. Overall employment increased by 2.1%, and the unemployment rate decreased from 8.2% to 6.9%, still significantly higher than the national rate of 5.8%. These aggregate figures, however, obscure regional and demographic differences. Employment continues to decline in regions such as the North Shore, the Annapolis Valley, and especially Cape Breton, where the unemployment rate increased to 16.7%. Province-wide, the youth unemployment rate remains high at 13.4%.

Despite the incremental improvement in Nova Scotia’s aggregate employment statistics, real wage growth is non-existent. In 2018, average weekly earnings increased by only 1.2%, barely keeping pace with inflation and less than half the national growth rate of 2.6%. Earnings growth is on a downward trajectory, falling in each of the past four years. The province’s anemic earnings growth is only worsened by provincial government policies, such as maintaining the lowest minimum wage in the country and labour contracts forcing real wage cuts on teachers, nurses, and other public servants.

Economic growth remains sluggish. The Finance Department’s December Forecast Update projects real GDP growth of only 1% in 2018 and 0.6% for 2019. Since the current government came to power, real economic growth averaged a paltry 1% compared to 1.9% for the national economy. With provincial government spending making up roughly a quarter of its economy, Nova Scotia’s performance has not been helped by its government’s spending restraint to generate surpluses and achieve arbitrary budgetary goals.

The small gains in the Nova Scotian economy are not trickling down to our most disadvantaged citizens. To paraphrase former US President Harry Truman, the measure of any society (and, by extension, its economy and government) is how it treats its most vulnerable members. By this measure, the Nova Scotia economy and government fail miserably.

High Poverty Rates

Nova Scotia has the highest poverty rate in Canada, at 12.8%. The poverty rate for couple-led families with children increased between 2016 and 2017 to 12.3%, the highest in Canada. Along with the persistently high level of poverty for lone parent families (26.4%), these high poverty rates affect Nova Scotia’s children where the poverty rate of 17.1% is by far the highest of any Canadian province and almost twice the national rate of 9.0%. Those who rely on social assistance do not receive enough support to cover their needs; for example, single people receive 38% of the income needed to buy a basic basket of goods. The 2-5% increase promised by the current government, is insufficient and indeed shameful given that the lowest poverty gap for a family with two children would require an increase of 29% to meet their basic needs for food, shelter, clothing.

What about our fiscal health? The budget is balanced, and in 2016-17 and 2017-18 the provincial government generated surpluses of $151 million and $230 million respectively. The debt-to-GDP ratio has fallen to 34.6% and is projected to fall further. Our debt-GDP ratio is much lower than Ontario’s or Quebec’s which have projected ratios of around 40%. With continuing low interest rates, the government is trading in high cost for low cost debt. Consequently, the interest on its debt is in decline, and the ratio of debt servicing costs to revenue has fallen considerably over the past five years, from 8.8% to 7.0%.

The government’s primary focus on fiscal health means that it largely neglects the health and wellbeing of Nova Scotians. Our government has missed opportunities over the last 6 years to make critical public investments that would see our province shift to a bottom-up inclusive green growth strategy, from one centred on failed payroll rebates to profitable companies while denying that our planet’s very existence is in peril.

Address the climate crisis

The government must use this opportunity to be bold, to address the climate crisis and make a significant investment in a just transition to renewable energy and a green economy. A Green New Deal is being proposed in the United States and is now being discussed in Canada, with many aspects echoing the visions of the Leap Manifesto and the 2030 Declaration. These blueprints for change have indeed been the backbone to alternative budgets in Nova Scotia, and federally. The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives’ lens for creating the alternative federal budget and the Nova Scotia alternative budget combine social, economic and environmental justice.

Nova Scotia needs to set targets in line with the Paris Agreement’s goal of keeping warming below 1.5C, by setting a target of at least 50% below 1990 levels by 2030. By achieving this goal, and making investments in the just transition to a green economy, Nova Scotia can create more than 30,700 jobs, according to the Green Economy Network. The development of a green jobs plan could be a starting place.

Our analysis shows what governments could and must do to begin to invest in the tenets of a green new deal for Nova Scotia – within a framework that is fiscally sustainable. Table 1 compares the fiscal baseline projected by the Nova Scotia government to our fiscal situation should we invest an additional billion dollars. Our projections also include a cost of living increase in current expenditures, reallocate some revenue, raise additional revenue by improving the progressivity of the tax system and generating revenue from a strengthened carbon pricing initiative. The result is the debt to GDP ratio increases only slightly, remains fairly stable and in 2022 starts to decline. Concern about overburdening the next generation with debt payments is misplaced; Debt is deferred taxation that is spread out over a lifetime. There are not many opportunities left before we ‘burden’ the next generation with a dead planet.

*From NS Budget December, Update, 2018.

What do we propose to do with this new billion-dollar investment and what impact could it have?

Green New Deal

The green new deal we propose builds on the successes of the original new deal President Roosevelt instituted to address the first great depression in the United States. We need to see similar urgency and level of investment to stimulate the economy, to share the prosperity that exists, to address income inequality, injustice, and the climate crisis.

Our alternative budgets have proposed investments to reduce GHG emissions while ensuring energy is accessible to all Nova Scotians, regardless of income, through fair and progressive taxation and smart investment decisions. (See our spreadsheet for a detailed breakdown of spending and revenue reallocation and generation.) Our proposed investments in climate change mitigation result in lower energy costs and reduced debt by improving energy efficiency, will make our homes more comfortable, and will make it easier to use public transportation. These investments, including in reskilling and training, will support the increased growth of green-sector jobs to support a low-carbon transition.

Our alternative budget backgrounder lays out in detail how the government could enact this plan. These investments will also reduce illness and healthcare costs as pollutants related to fossil fuel combustion decrease. By phasing out coal-fired electricity by 2030, Nova Scotia can avoid 11 premature deaths, 1,200 asthma episode, 19,000 days of breathing difficulty and more than $54 million in healthcare costs. In short, this plan must ensure that those who have been burdened disproportionately by the climate crisis, and who are largely not to blame, do not now bear the costs, including our youth, workers in the non-renewable energy sector, those living in low income, people of colour, and Indigenous Peoples. We must commit to building a just, green economy and society now.

Our alternative budgets prioritize investment to create jobs in the parts of our economy that are already green –those parts focused on caring, sharing, educating our people, building community, and on supporting everyone’s health and wellbeing. Investment to improve access to primary health care, while working to prevent problems from arising in the first place because of poverty conditions, is investing in good jobs that serve the needs in our community. For example, we invest to significantly reduce poverty by investing in the poverty reduction credit (an increase of $2000 per adult), increase the affordable living tax credit ($450 per adult and $120 per child) and double the Nova Scotia Child Benefit, plus providing an increase to social assistance rates themselves and instituting a carbon benefit to offset carbon price increases for people living on low incomes. Investments in real affordable and supportive housing options across our province are critical.

The biggest bang for our investment dollar is undoubtedly in our children and thus investments in early learning and child care and our primary to 12 education system, must be prioritized. Our youth should not have to incur such huge debt loads for post-secondary education. We can reallocate resources and invest to reduce and eliminate tuition fees and to forgive student loans. Our arts and cultural sector, our libraries, our museums, are undervalued critical community infrastructure. Investments in this sector are not only reasons people come to visit, social and cultural infrastructure along with quality public services, and decent jobs, are why they choose to stay.

Nova Scotians need to raise their expectations for what our government can achieve, and what we can achieve collectively. We can build a greener, healthier and just province. This is the lens through which the government’s 2019-20 budget should be judged.

The recently announced public art program is open to both Canadian and international artists.

Stage 2 will add 24 new stations, extending the O-Train lines farther south, to Limebank Road and the airport; east to Trim Road in Orléans; and west to Baseline Road and Moodie Drive.

However, 24 new stations does not mean opportunities for 24 artists. With a budget of close to $7 million, the O-Train Stage 2 Public Art Program will engage five artist teams to design for several stations at once.

These stations are clustered by geography, which the City website says is meant to create “a cohesive narrative between and along” the O-Train line.

Artist teams will be given the opportunity to transform the following stations and surrounding landscape:

East: Montreal Road, Jeanne d’Arc, Place d’Orléans, Trim, Orléans Blvd.

PORT AUX BASQUES, N.L.—The Canadian Coast Guard is monitoring a tanker carrying eight million litres of refined petroleum and additional fuel that lost steering off the southwest coast of Newfoundland on Thursday morning.

The Jana Desgagnes sustained damage to its rudder southwest of Port aux Basques while en route to Montreal.

The coast guard said in a statement Friday that no pollution has been released and the vessel and its 17 crew are not in immediate danger.

Coast guard ice breakers arrived on the scene Thursday night and have remained in the area since then.

The vessel was about 27 kilometres from Cape Ray, N.L., as of Friday afternoon and is being watched by coast guard and environmental response specialists.

Ice conditions have slowed the recovery process but a commercial tugboat is en route and officials say the plan is to tow the vessel to port in Sydney, N.S.",Coast guard working to retrieve drifting tanker carrying 8 million litres of petroleum,Canadian Manufacturing,https://www.canadianmanufacturing.com/risk-and-compliance/coast-guard-working-to-retrieve-drifting-tanker-carrying-8-million-litres-of-petroleum-229552/

And this is a man who is, for the most part, dismissed as a buffoonish and aggrieved crank with no ...","For more than a week, ever since a heavily armed white man charged into the Masjid Al Noor and opened fire on worshippers, I’ve been heavily occupied with thoughts of cowardice. That of the shooter, of course, but also my own. In fact, cowardice is the reason I’ve been putting off the writing of this column.

Let me explain.

A few weeks ago, Edmonton-based writer and educator Minister Faust asked if I would consider writing about the populist movement coalescing in Alberta, known as the Yellow Vests. I gave it some thought, but decided it was too niche of an issue to pitch my editor. I’ve written about the ideological capture of populist movements by hate groups before, of course. But I rationalized the Yellow Vests as an astroturfed campaign by oil interests which would, much like America’s Tea Party, amount to a brief and self-annihilating costume party for aggrieved white xenophobes.

After the shooting, I exchanged messages with Bashir Mohamed, another Edmonton-based writer, regarding the tendency of Alberta politicians to be photographed or associated with white nationalists. They did so without the prospect of being shamed into resignation by Canadian media. Mohamed was interested in writing a column specifically calling out Kerry Diotte, Member of Parliament for Edmonton Griesbach, and I recommended he broaden the scope to include other politicians, lest the pitch come off as a vendetta column and not cogent political analysis.

In both of these instances, and other conversations I’ve had with writers of colour lately, I did what I promised myself I would never do as a Black writer with a platform, which was to play the role of gatekeeper. I told myself that I was looking for angles that could find a foot through the door of the notoriously white-centred Canadian media. In reality, I had been cowed by hate groups and their enablers in my industry into silence, and I was unconsciously passing on the memo to others.

In January, after I wrote a column asserting the MAGA hat is a symbol of hate, a deluge of racist emails poured into my inbox. Normally I expect hate mail whenever I write about right-wing white populism, but this was not long after I’d received death threats (that, strangely enough, stemmed from another article I’d written years ago), so something about this iteration of being called a “subhuman,” a “savage,” and a “n–ger piece of s–t” got under my skin. It was followed by a brigade of harassment spurred by a Rebel Media reporter (with his own ties to white nationalism), who took one of my tweets and turned it into a streeter for Yellow Vest supporters in Sudbury.

I’ve spoken often with my fiance, family members, and friends about prioritizing my family’s safety over writing and community work. We’ve been recognized in public and approached, and while it’s so far been in a friendly manner, the threats and hate mail I’ve received are never far from the imagination when a stranger comes up to us to say hello. The thing is, while my fiance, children, and I are quite obviously Black (and therefore potential targets for hate crime), we’re also Christians. Our racialization isn’t further complicated by visible markers of religious affiliation—she doesn’t wear a hijab, and I don’t wear a topi cap. My beard grows free and styled according only to my own tastes. Nobody bats an eyelash when we say grace before meals when we dine out.

This isn’t the case for Bashir and other members of the Somali community in Edmonton, a city which is quickly becoming a cancerous node in the spread of overt white supremacy throughout Canada. This also isn’t the case for someone like Ginella Massa, a visibly Muslim anchor for CityNews Toronto, who recently needed to ask security to escort her to her vehicle after a Peterborough-based neo-Nazi made a “hypothetical” open call for the killing of media figures and anti-racism organizations. It wasn’t the case for the Muslim family confronted by a drunk and belligerent white man at Toronto’s Harbourfront, who shouted slurs and told them to “get out of my province,” nor for a Muslim man subjected to a “citizens arrest” on the way out of a London-area Sobeys.

I’ve been occupied with cowardice because, in the wake of the most deadly shooting in New Zealand history, I have shrunk back from my responsibility as a journalist to swing the glare of public discourse towards hatemongers, as well as their enablers in media and government. This is something I profoundly regret.

But there’s a different metric at work when it isn’t your own safety, your family’s, or that of your community consistently on the line. Too many of my white colleagues in journalism still seem to believe their profession and the assumed stance of objectivity places them at a distance from white supremacy.

This, to me, is a different tier of moral cowardice.

A week after Ginella Massa tweeted about the threat of white supremacist violence making it unsafe to leave her workplace without security, PEGIDA (a German-based anti-Muslim political movement) organized a march in downtown Toronto. A CityNews reporter assigned to cover the event, Pam Seatle, found herself confronted (and even followed) by anti-racist protesters to the march, who shouted her for “giving a platform to fascists.” In response, Seatle tweeted “I felt more threatened by them than any of the so called ‘dangerous violent racists.’ ”

The tweet was hastily deleted, probably wisely so. A cornerstone of white supremacist politics is the purported defence of the purity of white women from foreign savages, and PEGIDA supporters have been fairly busy promoting the falsehood that refugees from Africa and the Middle East are essentially roving gangs of rapists. According to PEGIDA’s own philosophy, a white woman like Seatle is the utmost protected class—of course they mean her no harm. The same cannot be said for nonwhites, including her own colleagues.

While Seatle may have had cause to feel unsafe in the moment she was followed by protesters, the fact is, she was covering the march of an organization whose founder, a man who calls refugees “cattle” and filth, was found guilty by a German court for inciting racial hatred. It was not only Seatle’s decision to attend and cover the rally from a rather slanted angle, calling out the protesters’ lack of decorum, but the choice of her news department to approve the segment, if not covering PEGIDA’s rally (and the counter-rally) to begin with.

In Alberta, the United Conservative Party continually finds itself dealing with members who espouse bigoted views (including the recent resignation of Calgary-Mountain View candidate Caylan Ford and Calgary-South East candidate Eva Kiryakos), or have direct ties to white supremacist organizations. For his part, Kenney himself repeatedly reminds people why his reputation for homophobia was well-earned. Yet Kenney and his party somehow continue to deliver press conferences and policy announcements without being pressured to answer how the party could possibly serve all Albertans when bigotry has so clearly infected its ranks.

The people behind the bylines and headlines in Alberta’s media class are, as with the rest of the country, very white. They carry with them the sensibilities that often insulate white supremacy, even if inadvertently (as with the Calgary Herald headline that uncritically repeated Kiryakos’s claim that she was the victim of a ‘smear’ campaign). That is, of course, when they aren’t outright mainstreaming white supremacist smear campaigns against refugees in European countries, as talk radio host and former Wildrose Party leader Danielle Smith recently did during a segment on her program. This is an endless source of frustration for the communities of colour in the province, and across Canada, as we are perpetually dragged back to the same naïve and uncomplicated conversations about racism, even as our communities increasingly come under attack.

When infamous white nationalist Faith Goldy carried her message into the Toronto mayoral election, and was photographed not only with members of the Toronto Police Service, but also the premier of Ontario, neither the leadership of the Toronto Police nor the premier offered an apology or rebuked Goldy directly. Instead, Ford tweeted a condemnation of “hate speech” and “anti-Semitism” should it happen to issue from Goldy “or anyone else.”

And that was that—Ford has more or less moved on from having anything to do with white nationalism (often due to his tendency to surround himself with sycophants of all colours). While his party continues its agenda of governance-by-spite, and while he heralded the arrival of the Yellow Vests’ so-called “convoy” to Ontario, Premier Ford is able to show his face in public without the prospect of being questioned by Queen’s Park reporters just why racism seems to follow him around like a noxious cloud.

Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer has also surrendered political principles for the bigot’s vote, presiding over a party willing to virtue-signal anti-immigrant sentiment to supporters whose “Canada First” mantra places them firmly in our country’s white nationalist tradition. There was the empty grandstanding around and misrepresentation of the UN Migration Pact, often reported by media as if the pact were legitimate cause for sovereign concern, with only a nod to the fact that the pact is non-binding. There was also an infamous tweet sent out by the party, meant to stoke further fear and paranoia over asylum-seekers crossing into Canada from the U.S., that just so happened to echo this country’s history of migration pessimism where Black refugees are involved.

Despite this abysmal record, Scheer is given leave to credibly present the Conservatives as a viable governing party that will act in all Canadians’ interests, while retaining the services of staffers who include Georgeanne Burke (who co-founded a political organization which, regardless of its stated purpose, effectively keeps the fear of Sharia in the headlines of right-wing publications) and Hamish Marshall (a former corporate director at Rebel Media). Scheer doesn’t acknowledge the problem of white nationalism in Canada, or within the party ranks, because there is no media pressure on him to do so. Not even when he speaks at the same Ottawa rally promoted and attended by far-right hate groups. That’s simply not the way things are done in this country.

Scheer’s tolerance for subordinates blowing the dog’s whistle is not limited to his office, but has trickled down to regional MPs such as Kerry Diotte, himself a former journalist. In 2017, Diotte tweeted a picture of himself with Faith Goldy, lauding her efforts to “Make the Media Great Again.” The tweet remains on Diotte’s Twitter timeline. When this was called out by Bashir Mohamed as an endorsement of racism, Diotte’s lawyers sent him a letter threatening legal action. Additionally, Diotte filed a lawsuit against The Gateway, a student newspaper at the University of Alberta, which is, to date, the only media organization to pull together his history of dog-whistle politics (which includes tweeting a picture of a “Liberal Buzz Word Bingo card,” including the words “indigenous” and “Syrians,” for which he later apologized).

In a private conversation with a white journalism colleague, I discussed Diotte’s litigiousness against his critics, as well as the picture he took with Goldy. That colleague, as with others, could not be convinced that Diotte’s picture was a problem, as Goldy’s full-bore descent into racism apparently didn’t take place before her trip in 2017 to Charlottesville, South Carolina. Even though her Rebel segments, designed to stoke white paranoia against nonwhite immigrant populations, long preceded that.

It seems that, no matter the amount of evidence pointing towards a problem with white nationalism in our political ranks, white journalists will quickly get on code to inform those of us (who are the most likely targets of white supremacist violence) where the line is to be drawn in naming that problem. In fact, it seems the only figure in Canadian politics who is consistently problematized as entertaining white nationalist sentiment is Maxime Bernier. And this is a man who is, for the most part, dismissed as a buffoonish and aggrieved crank with no viable base outside of the alt-right.

Again and again this happens in Canada, where political figures and movements flirt openly with the very same white nationalist figures and rhetoric that have been cited by multiple anti-racism organizations as catalysts for the surge in hate crimes and mass violence in recent years. But they are only held to account by journalists for as long as their latest faux-pas can carry a headline. After the news cycle has passed, we’re back to square one. This interminable loop not only puts the onus of writing and talking about this problem on journalists of colour, but exposes us and our communities to the opprobrium, and too often the violence, that is increasingly being legitimized under the shifting auspices of normal political dialogue and free speech in this country.

I may have been a coward in failing to speak up when my brothers in Edmonton asked me to say something, or help them find a platform to say something themselves. At the same time, I have thousands of fellow travellers in Canadian media who are not only insulated from white nationalist violence by dint of their political views, but by the fact their whiteness too often qualifies them as Canadian, without question.

Old stock, if you will.

There should, therefore, be thousands of helping hands willing to break this media cycle on white nationalism. But there are hardly any to be found. Instead, we’re faced with a wall of white silence, as if the wave of hate crimes and terrorism in recent years hasn’t been aided by the bigoted rhetoric from acquaintances and even family members they’ve muted in group chats.

Already, we are moving towards the typical both-sides conversation that swings the glare away from white supremacists, and back towards establishing terror-inducing violence as the sole province of people of colour. The expressions of horror and sympathy for the victims of the shooting in Christchurch are quickly fading; the platitudes for peace and tolerance were forgotten almost immediately. As always happens with this sort of thing, enough temporal distance from a terrorist incident causes the incandescent urgency of confronting white supremacist violence to gutter out.

The question I would pose to my professional colleagues, then, is this: knowing that your co-workers, your peers, and people you claim to be your friends are facing danger in our homes, in the streets, and in our places of worship, what will it take for you to do something?

Because our cancerous political climate, and all of the attendant bigotry that arrived with it, is what happens when you do nothing.

Despite a recent spate of storms and floods whose violence scientists blame on climate change, anti-carbon tax politics seems to be in the ascendancy in many provinces.

Between that and a federal opposition that has described carbon pricing as a ""gimmick,"" the Ecofiscal Commission faces an uphill battle persuading Canadians during the year of a national election that could decide for or against the carbon tax.

The Liberals, of course, have imposed a national carbon tax that will be applied to any province that does not have a carbon pricing system of its own. The federal system, which is very similar to the existing one in B.C., will put a charge on carbon but give most of the money back to consumers in a rebate.

Inescapably political

The commission, which gets its money from private interests including some of the largest players in the Canadian petroleum industry, insists it is apolitical and non-partisan. But arriving just as Alberta heads into an election, the timing of today's report — framed as an antidote to carbon tax ""myths"" — is inescapably political.

Bev Dahlby, research director at the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy and co-author of the report, says the timing of the release just after the Alberta election call is a coincidence. The report's purpose, he said, is to educate residents in provinces that, unlike Alberta, have never had a carbon pricing system in place.

""The purpose of the paper was really to inform the people in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick, who will be subject to the federal backstop carbon price as of April 1st,"" said Dahlby.

""I'm hoping the paper will help people understand the nature of carbon pricing and why some of the alleged problems of carbon pricing are not valid.""

And while it is not aimed at Albertans or their election campaign, ""it can also help people in Alberta understand the issues around carbon pricing,"" he said.

As Dahlby points out, the oil and gas producing province has had a carbon tax in place for more than a decade, imposed by a Progressive Conservative government. Just two weeks ago, Canadian oil companies were promoting themselves internationally as coming from a place where carbon reduction is taken seriously.

But in the current Alberta election campaign, the United Conservative Party led by Jason Kenny has taken a strong line against carbon pricing, saying it will abolish the provincial carbon tax and require a referendum before imposing a new one.

Societal consensus

To most people in Quebec, the idea of strenuously objecting to economic measures that might save the world from climate destruction seems strange, says economist France St-Hilaire, vice-president of the Institute for Research on Public Policy, a Montreal-based think-tank.

""I think I would call it almost a societal consensus,"" St-Hilaire said of Quebec, which has had a carbon pricing system since 2013. ""It didn't cause any controversy. The political parties just sensed that is something the public expects that the government would be acting on climate change.

""There's no question also that the perspective on these things is very different if you're sitting in Saskatchewan and Alberta.""

Nevertheless, she said, economists have repeatedly shown that putting a price on carbon emissions and raising it gradually remains the most efficient and business-friendly way of taking responsibility for saving the world from the dire effects of climate change.

""I think that's a sentiment that's shared across the country,"" she said.

Exactly how widely shared remains in question. The scientific consensus about the existence of climate change is unequivocal, but a growing anti-science movement, as exposed in the Netflix documentary Behind the Curve, may mean facts just aren't as important as the hard-headed economists at the Ecofiscal Commission like to think.

Certainly a glance at the bottom of any story that mentions climate change shows a flurry of anti-science comments and economic arguments that, taken one by one, people like former TD Bank chief economist and founding Ecofiscal commissioner Don Drummond could make short work of.

The Trump advantage

But Drummond says the anti-climate change position of U.S. President Donald Trump and his supporters — the kind promoted by pseudo-science websites — makes for a less complicated debate than the current Canadian political conflict over carbon pricing.

""Trump's argument is a pretty clean one actually: He doesn't believe any of it,"" said Drummond. ""If you don't believe any of it is real, and none of it is man-made, then his policy solutions sound pretty reasonable.""

But Canadian conservative politicians who don't like the carbon tax don't share Trump's advantage.

""Canada is more complicated than that because they have all, including [Ontario Premier Doug] Ford, acknowledged climate change is real and it is connected to human behaviour and it needs to be addressed,"" said Drummond.

He says he's willing to debate whether carbon taxes or some other strategy would somehow be a better fit. One such example would be Canadian economist Mark Jaccard's proposed flexible regulations, which Jaccard says may be less economically but more politically efficient.

""But that's the sort of thing we should be having a debate about and we never seem to get around to that,"" said Drummond.

The Ecofiscal Commission's five-year mandate comes to an end in November, and while the group plans one more report — on the economic costs of climate change — today's release is the last before the federal election.

While the commission will disappear, a group that includes members of the commission has learned they had won the bidding for $20 million over five years, funding provided in the 2018 federal budget, for a new independent climate and clean growth institute.

Funding for the new institute, which will extend beyond the Ecofiscal mandate into such things as climate adaptation engineering, will be paid out at $4 million a year — at the discretion of whoever wins the next federal election.

And China recently announced a ban on Canadian canola citing “hazardous organisms” in ...","OTTAWA — At least one Canadian company has successfully bid on a contract with the Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank, a nascent multilateral institution based out of Beijing.

In 2017 Canada formally joined the bank, which funds infrastructure projects in Asia, and pledged to spend $256 million over five years on its one-per-cent shareholding — with Finance Minister Bill Morneau promising that Canadian companies would be able to benefit from involvement in projects.

Last fall, Finance Canada reported in a document tabled in the House of Commons that no Canadian investors or companies had gotten involved yet. With the deteriorating Canada-China relationship and the United States’s unwillingness to join the bank as a backdrop, Conservative politicians in Canada demanded a withdrawal.

But in conversation with the National Post, a spokeswoman for the bank, Canadian Laurel Ostfield, confirmed that at least one Canadian company, Hatch Consulting, has won a procurement contract with the AIIB. She said others, including a major Canadian firm — not SNC-Lavalin — are in the running for additional contracts. Hatch’s lead executive for China was not available for an interview this week.

The bank’s president visited Toronto last month to help “raise awareness” about opportunities. “There’s contracts, and we want more Canadian companies to bid on them,” Ostfield said. “Canadian companies have great skill sets, high quality, great reputations and we just invite them to really participate.”

There’s contracts, and we want more Canadian companies to bid on them

Canadian companies could’ve bid to work on projects funded by the bank even if Canada had not become a member. Membership provides other benefits to Canada though, Ostfield said, including a seat on a 12-member board of directors charged with strategy, policy and project approval. Although Canada’s share in the bank is small, this gives it some heft in decision-making.

But hovering over the AIIB are concerns about the potential influence of the Chinese government. The United States warned its allies against joining the development bank when it was announced in 2015.

From the American point of view, this is just another way the authoritarian regime is trying to extend and buy influence — like with the Belt and Road initiative, which has seen China invest hundreds of billions of dollars into expanding transportation infrastructure outside of its borders. As a counterbalance, the U.S. is partnering with Japan to fund its own set of infrastructure projects in the region.

Despite its generally friendlier attitude towards China, Canada has in recent months seen plenty of evidence of that country’s self-interest, and the blurry lines between private entities and Beijing’s communist party leadership. After Canadian authorities arrested a Huawei executive in December on behalf of the U.S., China detained two Canadian citizens, a move widely seen as political retaliation. And China recently announced a ban on Canadian canola citing “hazardous organisms” in seeds, not the first time a non-trade barrier has hurt the agricultural industry.

Ostfield is quick to point out that China was not the only country that supported the AIIB’s development. About 20 countries were involved in the early stages of writing its governance documents and by the time negotiations were finished, 57 countries had signed up as founding members. There are now 93 members in total, including Canada’s allies France, Germany and the United Kingdom.

“We’re not owned by any one particular country,” Ostfield said. The AIIB is similar to, approved by, and works with other institutions such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. “Canada historically has been very actively engaged in multilateralism. I think that them applying to be a part of AIIB and ratifying that is another step in that direction,” she said.

Asked whether perceptions about the Canada-China relationship or about the influence of Chinese authorities have caused trouble for the bank, Ostfield said there has certainly been “skepticism.” But she insisted the 200 or so people who work there — seven or eight of them Canadians — are focused on creating a first-class institution and seeing projects through, including, Ostfield offered as an example, bringing electricity to 2.5 million people in Bangladesh.

“At the end of the day, the proof is going to be in the pudding,” she said. “As we start investing in projects, and people see how our procurements run, and we are transparent, then for some that is what’s going to be required before they start to see that AIIB is an independent international organization.”

Saskatchewan company Viterra Inc., had its licence revoked by China on Tuesday, the second Canadian canola company to have that happen after Manitoba’s Richardson International had its licence pulled earlier in March. Chinese customs officials cited the same pest concerns with Viterra’s shipments as with Richardson’s.

Some are saying the issue is a political one, not scientific, linking it to the ongoing situation with Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou. Meng was arrested in Vancouver on Dec. 1, and the extradition process began March 1. The ministers of international trade and agriculture were called to appear before the parliamentary trade committee next week regarding the ongoing issue. Just after the second ban was announced, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he’s considering sending officials to China in an effort to sort out the situation. Brian Innes, vice-president of public affairs with the Canola Council of Canada, said though companies’ permits being revoked is a big issue, the standoff is affecting more than just those two companies.

“We understand from all of our exporters that there is no interest from Chinese buyers to purchase Canadian canola seed at this time. So we now have two companies that no longer have licences to export, but we understand there’s no purchases to export anyways,” said Innes. “We’re perplexed how suddenly our canola can be a problem when we have been shipping … record amounts of canola seed, oil and meal to China.” Innes said the Canadian canola market has diversified over the past 10 years, meaning more Canadian canola is processed in the country, which makes it more valuable.

Ray Orb, president of the Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities, said he thinks Canadian processing plants could see a boost, since China is still buying processed canola. However, Innes said most plants are at full capacity, and he hopes this “hiccup” will be resolved soon so canola farmers can feel confident in their crops. “There may be some more processing that can happen in North America and Canada,” he said. “But we cannot replace the size of the Chinese market.” Rob Stone farms around 7,800 acres in central Saskatchewan, more than a third of which are canola. He said that since December, he has seen the slowdown, and revoked licences seem like an escalation in an already uncomfortable situation for farmers. “Exports into China have been basically nil since December, but it just kind of became a bit more evident … that they really weren’t interested in doing business with us,” he said, adding he feels the government is “kind of stuck in a hard spot,” but that he hopes the issue will be resolved soon. He said it has been “very stressful” for farmers, who mostly have their crops planned out already but are now concerned about being able to sell them. While some farmers pre-sell their crops, many still have unsold canola to worry about, Stone said. “There’s going to be a hangover from it for a long time, even after we … get this issue solved,” he said. Canadian Agriculture and Agri-Food Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau said in a statement that the government is “working through all available channels in China and here in Canada to find a science-based solution.” Rosa Saba is a reporter/photographer with Star Calgary.

Earlier this month, Chinese customs authorities revoked the sales licence for a major Canadian canola distributor, Richardson International. Officials said the move was related to ""dangerous pests"" such as fungi in the crop, an allegation the company has strongly denied.

Against the backdrop of escalating trade tensions with China, there is much speculation that pushing back against a major Canadian crop was an attempt to send a political message.

China tore up a bilateral trade deal with Norway and restricted imports of salmon from that country after Norway awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to Chinese political prisoner Liu Xiaobo in 2010.

""China always links its trade diplomacy with its foreign policy,"" said Meredith Lilly, the Simon Reisman Chair in International Affairs at Carleton University, and an associate professor on international trade.

""They've made this claim before,"" she said, referring to the allegations Canadian canola is somehow unsafe, ""because to not make one with a legal justification would be an outright admission that this is just about geopolitics.""

Regardless of China's true motivations, Richardson is no longer the only Canadian canola seller being shut out of the Chinese market. There are 18 members of the group that represents the industry in Canada, including Viterra Inc., Louis Dreyfus Company, Cargill Ltd. and Parrish & Heimbecker Ltd. All of them say their contracts to sell in China are just drying up.

""While there was some initial optimism that Chinese concerns with canola trade could be resolved quickly, technical discussions to date have not indicated an immediate resolution is possible,"" said the Canola Council of Canada (CCC). ""Canola seed exporters report that Chinese importers are unwilling to purchase Canadian canola seed at this time.""

Canola seeds can be crushed to produce an oil used in food and cooking. The ""can"" in Canola stands for Canada, since the specific variety of the plant known as rapeseed that has a bright yellow flower was invented by Canadian researchers in the 1970s.

A spokesperson for the canola group says that to their knowledge, oil and meal are not subject to the same ""challenges"" that the seeds are having in China.

About 40 per cent of Canada's canola seed exports last year went to China, worth about $2.7 billion. Canada also sent about $1 billion worth of canola oil to China, and about $500 million worth of canola meal, which is the name for canola seeds after they have been crushed and separated from their oil, leaving a product that is used as animal food.

Up until the recent disruption, Chinese demand for Canadian canola has been strong, the group says.

""We urge the government of Canada to continue to intensify efforts to resolve the situation,"" CCC president Jim Everson said.

Canada's Minister of Agriculture Marie-Claude Bibeau said China only recently agreed to have scientists assess the claim that they have found organisms in Canadian canola, after they claimed that about Richardson's.

""Officials from both countries will continue to engage in order to find a science-based solution to this issue as quickly as possible,"" Bibeau told CBC News on Friday. ""We are working closely with industry stakeholders on this matter, and we will continue to keep them informed as additional information becomes available.""

The sudden canola clash has sent prices for the crop plunging. For delivery in May, it has fallen almost $10 to $458 a tonne on Friday, only slightly ahead of the multi-year low of $455 it hit earlier this month.

Lilly said Canadian government officials should do their utmost to solve the dispute, but ultimately she suspects they may not have enough tools at their disposal to make that happen quickly.

""Canada does not have currently a great deal of levers to reverse this situation.""

Alberta Premier Rachel Notley weighed into the dispute on Friday, noting how important the industry is to the province she leads, and calling on the Federal Government to ""work very hard"" to resolve the issue.

""If they are unsuccessful at doing that, then all Albertans will be looking to the federal government to supply relief to our canola industry just as they would to SNC-Lavalin, just as they would to GM, just as they would to any other industry in the country that is in jeopardy because of … international actions outside of our border,"" Notley said.

Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe echoed concerns over the reports in a statement and said the provincial government remains hopeful that the federal government will continue to engage with Chinese officials on a technical level.

""We have also requested that the federal government elevate their engagement to a diplomatic level to rectify this situation as soon as possible.""

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called it an important issue on Friday when speaking with reporters.

""So, we're going to roll up our sleeves and work with the Chinese officials to demonstrate that canola should continue to flow safely from Canada to China,"" he said, adding the government is optimist it'll be able to make headway this year.",China has stopped buying Canadian canola seed,CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canada-canola-china-1.5067307

(Photo: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images)

As the dust finally settles on LavScam and Russiagate — two scandals that recently rocked the leaders of both Canada and the U.S. — now might be a good time to put these two affairs into perspective.

Like previous Canadian political controversies (Tunagate, Adscam or the Senate Scandal) the SNC-Lavalin affair will likely be remembered for what it was — a truly Canadian cause celebre.

While the opposition and media tried to play it up as a misuse of power by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and members of his office, the Liberals assured us that it was nothing more than a lot of raised voices and rolling eyes. In the end, the Toronto Star probably got closest to the truth when it suggested that, “not much happened, but whatever happened must be reported. Repeatedly.”

Juxtapose that with the hysterically over-the-top and breathless commentary the U.S. media gave to Robert Mueller’s probe on Russian interference and you can see how the very different ways these two countries process a scandal. Even after Mueller submitted his report, we still don’t know what truly happened: was it a “witch hunt” or “coup attempt” as President Donald Trump and right-wing media suggest, or a “cover-up” of “massive political malfeasance” as the liberal media keep touting.

So, in an effort to illustrate just how different Canadians and Americans treat their political scandals, let’s breakdown the key points of #Russiagate and #LavScam.

What’s the Big Deal?

#Russiagate: Did the President collude with Russia and then block attempts to investigate this collusion?

#LavScam: Did the Prime Minister and members of his office put pressure on his attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to do a legal favour for a Quebec-based engineering firm that’s also a big Liberal donor.

Why it stinks?

#Russiagate: Anything that involves Trump always has the odour of corruption.

#LavScam: Anything that involves the Liberal Party and Quebec always has the odour of corruption.

Hashtag Originality

#Russiagate: This nickname follows the irritating media rule that, since Watergate in the early 70s, all political scandals must contain the suffix “gate.”

#LavScam: It’s original and thankfully doesn’t contain “gate.” So #LavScam wins by a mile … errr … kilometre.

Will it Make a Good Movie?

According to reports, Wilson-Raybould recommended in 2017 that Trudeau nominate a conservative Manitoba judge, Glenn Joyal, to be chief justice of the Supreme Court. Sources told The Canadian Press Trudeau was opposed to appointing Justice Joyal to the position.

Meanwhile, Joyal said in a statement he withdrew his application – which was supposed to confidential – due to his wife’s breast cancer and noted he was concerned he was being dragged into the discussion to further a political agenda.

Longtime Winnipeg lawyer Robert Tapper, who says he has known Joyal professionally for years, told 680 CJOB Monday he was “disgusted” by the judge’s name being made public, allegedly by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).

“I don’t even know where to begin. I’ve been around for 46 years and I’ve never seen anything like this,” said Tapper.

“If you’re going to have a spat over the possible application or appointment of a judge, you don’t name him publicly. That’s just frankly obscene, disgusting, and it’s despicable … to have leaked that name.”

Tapper said the suggestion that Joyal wasn’t given the job due to his perceived political views is a further disgrace.

“That particular judge withdrew his applications because of health reasons of his wife. To accuse him of being anti-charter – as I read the story – anti-abortion, anti-LGBTQ… I know the Chief Justice personally and I know the latter two are nonsense.

“To accuse him of being anti-charter is just, frankly, it’s stupid and it’s also insulting.”

Manitoba Bar Association president Mark H. Toews says the reporting of the appointment process of judges is of “significant concern”.

“It is vital that any deliberations leading up to any appointment remain confidential,” Toews said in a statement to Global News.

“The recent breaches of confidentiality where the suitability of other candidates are discussed is highly disconcerting It demeans the entire selection process, and is harmful to the privacy of individual applicants. “

Toews also said it is “highly regrettable that Chief Justice Joyal was forced to respond and disclose deeply personal and confidential information.”

Trudeau faced renewed questions about the controversy during a morning event in Winnipeg Tuesday where he was trying to promote his government’s budget introduced one week ago.

He would not, however, say whether he rejected Wilson-Raybould’s 2017 recommendation for chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, instead stating repeatedly that Canadians could have confidence in how judges are chosen and that he had no further comment.

Tapper said he can’t understand why Joyal’s name came up at all.

“Why would they do that? Why would you slam somebody who had absolutely nothing to do with the issue at hand?”

The Liberal majority on the committee voted down a motion backed by Conservatives and New Democrats that would have seen former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott testify about the controversy.

“The coverup continues,” Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre said after the meeting ended.

Wilson-Raybould told the justice House of Commons justice committee last month that she was pressured by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his senior advisers and senior ad visors to the finance minister, to overrule the decision by the director of public prosecutions not to negotiate a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin rather than proceed to a criminal trial on fraud charges.

She believes she was shuffled out of justice in January because she wouldn’t change her mind.

Trudeau has denied anything improper occurred but has been unable to change the channel from the saga that has badly hurt his public image. He said the whole thing boils down to a breakdown in trust between him, his aides and Wilson-Raybould.

During the almost two-hour-long meeting Tuesday, Conservatives and New Democrats urged their Liberal colleagues to put partisan issues aside and agree to have the ethics committee take on the probe after the Liberals ended the justice committee’s investigation last week.

Liberal MP Nathaniel Ermine-Smith, who voted in favour of an NDP motion in February to hold a public inquiry on the matter, said at the ethics committee Tuesday a new probe may only result in relitigating what has already been said at the unless the two former cabinet ministers were granted wider waivers to testify on the issue.

Trudeau has not indicated any willingness to do that saying the waivers were already unprecedented and allowed for the facts relevant to the matter at hand to be made public.

The justice committee heard from 10 witnesses over five meetings but opposition parties say Wilson-Raybould named 11 people who she felt crossed the line and all of them should be asked to testify. Only two of those people were among the witnesses the justice committee did hear from.

Trudeau faced renewed questions about the controversy during a morning event in Winnipeg where he was trying to promote his government’s budget introduced one week ago. He would not, however, say whether he rejected Wilson-Raybould’s 2017 recommendation for chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada.

Sources told The Canadian Press that Trudeau turned down Wilson-Raybould’s recommendation that Glenn Joyal be elevated from chief justice of Manitoba’s Court of Queen’s Bench to chief justice of the Supreme Court over Joyal’s views on the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Shortly after Trudeau told Wilson-Raybould he did not support her choice, the sources said Joyal withdrew his name from consideration.

In a statement Monday, Joyal said he submitted an application for consideration for the Supreme Court in 2017, only to be forced to withdraw his name for personal reasons related to his wife’s health.

Instead, Trudeau appointed Sheila Martin to the high court and named Richard Wagner as chief justice. Former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper appointed Wagner to the high court.

Trudeau said Tuesday he would not discuss the matter nor would he say whether his office was involved in the leak of what is usually a highly confidential appointments process.

Trudeau said it is the prime minister’s choice of who to nominate for the Supreme Court, as well as for chief justice, and that Canadians can and should continue to have faith in their judicial system.

Speaking at the ethics committee meeting, Kent said the breach of a highly confidential judicial appointment process would warrant a parliamentary investigation on its own.

Half of Canadian executives say old NAFTA better for our economy than USMCA USMCA signed, but not yet sealed ...","Unions are turning on it, Democrats are demanding to change it and Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland is casting doubt over whether Canada will support it with the steel and aluminum tariffs in place.

Now the North American free trade pact, already laden with challenges to ratification, will have to find a route to passage amid hardening political positions in the wake of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report, and a host of counter-investigations expected to “poison the well” for Democrats whose cooperation is crucial, analysts say.

“This was already going to be tricky but I think the political will as a practical matter is rapidly evaporating,” said Todd Tucker, a fellow at the New York based Roosevelt Institute. “If there was a 45 per cent chance of a path forward for this deal a few months ago, it’s closed down to 25 to 30 per cent now. It’s getting very hard to see how the stars will align.”

U.S. Attorney General William Barr on Sunday released a four-page summary of the findings from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Cleared of conspiring with Russia, U.S. President Donald Trump lashed out at the inquiry, vowing investigations into his unnamed political enemies.

For his part, Senator Lindsey Graham, the Republican Senate Judiciary Committee chairman and a Trump ally, said he would ask Barr to appoint a special counsel to investigate the origins of the Russia probe. On the other side of the aisle, Democrats – already conducting multiple congressional investigations into Trump’s business and personal dealings – demanded a full release of the Mueller report, setting up a potential clash with the White House.

It all points to an increasingly acrimonious political atmosphere where convincing Democrats to support a deal Trump views as his greatest victory on trade is getting much more difficult.

“If there’s any chance for it to go through, and I think those chances are receding, the more the Mueller investigation and counter investigations take root, the less likely you’ll get Democrats to switch sides,” said international trade lawyer Mark Warner. “We need to see what happens, but it could paralyze everything.”

The challenges facing the deal are already significant. A concerted push from U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and various business groups to win support for the agreement has faced stiff resistance from trade unions and Democrats who have called for changes to provisions on labour standards and drug patents.

The AFL-CIO, the U.S.’s largest federation of unions has said it won’t support the pact in its current form and the United Steelworkers union has said it should not be ratified until tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum are dropped.

“All the NAFTA renegotiation efforts in the world will not create U.S. jobs, raise U.S. wages or reduce the U.S. trade deficit if the new rules do not include clear, strong and effective labor rules that require Mexico to abandon its low wage policy,” Celeste Drake of the AFL-CIO said at a House Ways and Means subcommittee hearing Tuesday.

Canada and Mexico are important but at the end of the day this is a domestic issue now

Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland added her own pressure to the process a day earlier, warning that Canadians would be “very troubled’ by any move to ratify the deal with the US tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum in place.

“The existence of these tariffs for many Canadians raises some serious questions about NAFTA ratification,” she told reporters following a meeting with Lighthizer.

Removing the tariffs — issued under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 — would go some distance to easing the path to ratification, analysts said. The levies are unpopular with both political parties in the U.S. and Republican Senators Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Rob Portman of Ohio have introduced competing legislation that seeks limit the President’s use of them. A congressional review of Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 is also underway.

“Virtually all of Congress has said they won’t consider the deal as long as the tariffs are there,” said Dan Uzcjo, an Ohio-based trade lawyer with Dickinson Wright who has been keeping track of votes on the deal. “To me that’s far more important than Canada saying they won’t ratify it with the tariffs on. Canada and Mexico are important but at the end of the day this is a domestic issue now.”

Any removal of the tariffs — which could be the final sweetener to win support from some lawmakers — will have to be “carefully choreographed,” he added. The U.S. International Trade Commission is expected to unveil its report on the economic impacts of the deal in mid-April. Lighthizer will likely submit legislation to implement the pact soon after that. A calculation on when to lift the levies would likely depend on Congress’s response, Uzcjo said.

“It’s a dilemma because you can’t start the process unless you lift the tariffs,” Uzcjo said. “However if you lift the tariffs you pull momentum away from USMCA. But at the end of the day I think the tariffs are coming off. It’s a matter of when.”

Warner is less sure, given Trump’s penchant for the levies and the support they have received from steel firms. The U.S. President is also likely to be emboldened in his tariff policy by a Court of International Trade decision Monday that ruled his imposition of tariffs based on national security was constitutional, Warner said.

“There’s one guy at the top who calls himself “Tariff man” said Warner. “I personally don’t think he’ll lift them. That’s pushing on a closed door.”

As the hurdles add up, the window for getting the deal passed is narrowing. Legislation will need to be submitted by May in order to have a deal passed by Congress’ August recess. In the meantime, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi could take all kinds of steps to delay the process, Uzcjo said. If the deal isn’t passed by Labour Day, it will likely be pushed into 2020, a U.S. presidential election year, where it will be left on the back burner.

“I’m not optimistic anyway but if this pushes into an election year with 20 odd Democrats running it’s not getting done, because they won’t want to support Trump on anything,” Uzcjo said. “That’s why this spring window is so important.”",'I'm not optimistic': Political will for passage of new NAFTA rapidly evaporating in America,O Canada,https://o.canada.com/news/economy/im-not-optimistic-political-will-evaporating-in-u-s-for-passage-of-new-nafta/wcm/10a9478d-8a1b-426e-8139-d641ccc205bc

Polls suggest the United Conservative Party is on course to win power in the province, Canada’s energy center, capitalizing on voter concerns about a struggling economy and lack of progress on new oil export pipelines.

However, UCP leader Jason Kenney, a former federal cabinet minister, polls behind New Democrat Party Premier Rachel Notley on a number of personal attributes such as honesty, likeability and trustworthiness, and is embroiled in a scandal over his successful party leadership bid in 2017.

Notley, whose late father led the NDP from 1968-1984, is polling well ahead of her party and seeking to profit from that edge.

To overcome that, the UCP is focusing on Trudeau, with repeated references to “the Notley-Trudeau alliance,” emphasizing her one-time close relationship with the prime minister, while images of their own leader are less visible.

Trudeau is an unpopular figure in Alberta, where many feel he failed to support the energy industry. The prime minister also faces a political scandal on whether he unduly pressured Canada’s former justice minister.

“If you look at the signs the NDP are putting up, their logos are not very prevalent, it’s all Rachel Notley,” said Gregory Jack, vice president at polling firm Ipsos. “The UCP signs are all about the UCP and their brand, and underplaying their leader to a certain extent.”

The UCP’s focus on Justin Trudeau may be effective with older Alberta voters who remember the unpopular National Energy Program in 1980, an effort by his prime minister father, Pierre Trudeau, that sought to give Ottawa more control over the oil and gas industry and a higher share of revenues.

“(The UCP) spin on it is Alberta has been mistreated by a Liberal government and the son of another prime minister who did not treat Alberta well,” said Jared Wesley, a political science professor at the University of Alberta.

Alberta’s energy industry contributes C$80 billion a year to Canada’s economy, but opposition from other provinces has shut down new pipelines like TransCanada Corp’s Energy East project and helped stall the Trans Mountain expansion plan.

Congestion on existing pipelines out of landlocked Alberta left crude bottlenecked in storage tanks and sent prices spiraling to record lows last year, prompting the NDP to mandate temporary crude production cuts.

Alberta has posted budget deficits since global oil prices started tumbling in 2014, and more than C$20 billion in foreign capital has fled its energy sector since 2017.

Notley and Trudeau came to power in the same year and initially forged a close partnership aimed at pleasing the oil industry and environmental groups with a dual strategy that supported new pipelines and introduced a carbon tax.

They fell out last year over delays to the Trans Mountain expansion project. Notley’s camp downplays the relationship that the UCP is working so hard to highlight.

“The job of premier is to work with anyone who has a stake in projects like pipelines. I wouldn’t call it an alliance,” said NDP campaign spokeswoman Cheryl Oates. “A lot of people feel Jason Kenney is stuck in Ottawa trying to rehash a battle that his party lost.”

“There’s going to be a point where the prime minister is going to be need to be directly engaged,” said Jeremy Harrison, minister of trade and export development.

Harrison was responding to reports that a wider range of commodities are now facing delays at Chinese ports. After the Canola Council of Canada stated that Chinese importers are unwilling to purchase Canadian canola, the Globe and Mail reported on Friday that strict customs inspections are causing similar problems for wheat, peas and other Canadian agricultural exports.

Harrison said Saskatchewan hasn’t yet received any formal notification that the canola crisis is broadening to other products, but he said that would be “clearly unhelpful.”

“Right now, we’re going to be working with the national government to try and find a resolution because this is such an important economic issue for our province,” said Harrison, adding that talks with federal officials are ongoing.

China has maintained that its recent actions are normal quarantine measures, a pretext similar to that given for the canola crackdown. Federal Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau said this week that Canadian and Chinese officials are exchanging technical information and trying to find “a science-based solution.”

But Harrison suggested that federal officials may have to aim higher up the power hierarchy.

“We’re going to be supportive of efforts they make, but we think that they do need to be engaged at the diplomatic and political level on this, and continuing to engage at the scientific level as well,” he said. “But they do need to elevate the dialogue to a higher level within their government.”

Analysts have speculated that China’s measures to interfere with Canadian exports are retaliation for the arrest of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, who is the subject of a U.S. extradition request.

Harrison hinted that he sees some merit in that notion.

“The fact that we’re asking them to be diplomatically and politically engaged, I think would indicate that there probably is a connection,” he said.

“No one can, with a straight face, tell us that Canadian steel and aluminum pose a threat to American national security,” said federal Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland after a meeting in Washington March 25, as she attempts to get a deal headed to Congress for approval.

“I made the case to ambassador Lighthizer that these tariffs are completely unacceptable to Canada … to impose these tariffs on steel and aluminum on national security grounds is illegal, unjustified and frankly completely absurd,” she said.

Freeland was fresh from a meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, where the two spent most of their time discussing that issue in the face of attempting to ratify last year’s three-nation trade deal.

“These tariffs cause many questions about ratifying NAFTA under these conditions…. Many Canadians feel this NAFTA is a free trade deal with the United States. All countries made some compromises to make this deal and in order to move ahead with that deal, the right thing is there should be no 232-tariffs or retaliatory measures between our three countries,” said Freeland.

The U.S. imposed its Section 232 tariffs for steel and aluminum a year ago to create advantages for its domestic producers on the grounds of protecting national security, while leveraging negotiations around the renewal of NAFTA. A program to lift tariffs on the two metals from Canada and Mexico was linked to the renegotiation of the NAFTA but did not make it through that process. Both Canada and Mexico have told U.S. lawmakers that it must be removed for the new NAFTA to be completed.

Freeland said she knows Canada’s retaliatory measures on $16 billion of targeted trade are hurting American businesses. These include import surtaxes on many steel and aluminum products, as well as agriculture and food products, such as processed meats, and many paper items.

Canadian farm equipment manufacturers say they are having to increase equipment and building prices as a result of the effects of the 232 tariffs (see our story on page 1 in this edition of The Western Producer), which have driven up prices for the American metal they have to buy.

Several U.S. lawmakers have said they did not believe the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, or CUSMA as it is known in Canadian legislation, could be ratified by the U.S. Congress if the metals tariffs along with retaliatory duties on American farm and other products were left in place.

The U.S administration has sought quotas on steel and aluminum in lieu of tariffs, but Canada and Mexico have resisted these, arguing that their metals pose no threat to U.S. national security.

USMCA-enabling legislation needs to be placed in front of Congress so it could be considered before the House recesses in August if it is going to avoid being caught up in another border-wall funding fight in the fall or the subsequent 2020 presidential election campaign.",New NAFTA attempts to avoid U.S. politics,The Western Producer,https://www.producer.com/2019/03/new-nafta-attempts-to-avoid-u-s-politics/

The Canadian dollar is drifting lower ahead of tomorrow’s release of January Gross Domestic Product data. The forecast is for a modest improvement from -0.1% to 0.0%, which in the big scheme of things, is rather pathetic. Q4 ended on an ugly note, and some analysts believe January could start similarly. Yesterday, data showed January Merchandise Trade deficit narrowing to $4.25 billion from $4.82 billion, but that was less than expected. That result suggests Q1 GDP could be a tad worse than forecast.



A drop in oil prices managed to undermine the Canadian dollar as well. WTI oil fell from a peak of $60.20 U.S./barrel to a $58.80 U.S./b on Wednesday after the Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that U.S. crude inventories rose 2.8 million barrels in the week ended March 22.



Broad-based U.S. dollar demand further eroded the Canadian dollar. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi hinted that euro-zone interest rates could stay unchanged beyond the end of 2019 which undermined EUR/USD and led to buying of U.S. dollars across the G-10 major currency spectrum. The U.S. dollar closed the Toronto trading session with small gains across the board



Overnight, FX markets were distracted by U.K. politics and wide price swings in GBP/USD. Prime Minister Theresa May’s announcement that she would resign her position if the MP’s passed her Brexit deal was initially seen as a good sign for sterling. Prices rallied to $1.3260 just before yesterday’s close. There were eight votes on a series of motions to facilitate a Brexit deal, and all of them failed miserably. GBP/USD plunged to 1.3127.



U.S./China trade talks resume in Beijing today. Analysts believe that both sides are motivated to get a draft of a deal ready to sign before China President Xi Jinping returns to the U.S. in April. There are reports that China is making concessions on key issues like forced technology transfer. More talks are scheduled next week in Washington. If the headlines suggest that the two sides are close to a deal, it could spark a shift into risk-seeking trades and give the Canadian dollar a boost, in the process.



Traders are waiting for this morning’s U.S. data which includes Q4 GDP. Analysts are forecasting growth of 2.4%, down from the 2.6% previously estimated. The weaker than expected Retail Sales data gets the blame for causing the drop.

On September 17, 2018, Parliament’s first day back from summer break, Leona Alleslev, the Liberal MP from Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill, rose in the House of Commons to announce her defection from the governing Liberal Party of Canada. “The government must be challenged openly and publicly. But for me to publicly criticize the government as a Liberal would undermine the government and, according to my code of conduct, be dishonourable,” she said. “After careful and deliberate consideration, I must withdraw from the government benches to take my seat among the ranks of my Conservative colleagues.”

New to politics when she was first elected in 2015, Alleslev is a hard-nosed and plain-spoken air force veteran. Before her dramatic exit, her time in office had been somewhat unexceptional, save for her early career appointment as parliamentary secretary to public-services and procurement minister Judy Foote—a notable promotion for a rookie MP. Still, she was, until she switched sides, little known outside of political and military circles.

The media immediately scoured her social media for signs of dissent but turned up nothing—no instances of serious disagreement with the party, no off-the-cuff clashes with Liberal colleagues, no pretension of sticking it to the man for the sake of her constituents. Rather, by all appearances, Alleslev had fallen in line with the party. Throughout her tenure, she offered reassurances that team Trudeau was on the right track. In July, two months before switching sides, she fawned over the prime minister, foreign-affairs minister Chrystia Freeland, and defence minister Harjit Sajjan in a private email, calling them “truly awesome.” Nine days later, she praised Trudeau’s leadership at a fundraising event.

Conservative leader Andrew Scheer wasted no time taking advantage of her move. “For all those Canadians who supported Justin Trudeau in 2015 and are dissatisfied or even angry about the leadership that he’s been giving,” he told a room full of reporters, “the Conservative Party needs you.” He had apparently forgiven her previous anti-Conservative criticism. During a 2015 election debate in her riding, Alleslev lamented having watched the country under Stephen Harper “become something I barely recognize—socially, politically, economically, and internationally.” But the Trudeau government, in the end, apparently fared just as poorly in Alleslev’s eyes. Bidding adieu to her fellow caucus members, she referenced wide-ranging failures on tax reform, trade, foreign policy, defence, and security. She assured everyone who asked that it was never only one issue.

The act of switching teams requires a flexibility uncommon among twenty-first-century politicians. Alleslev considers herself among that rare breed of lawmaker. “As a member of Parliament, it’s my job to listen to everybody,” she told me. “I’m not sure that’s always the most widely held opinion.” She sees in modern politics a tendency to characterize all debate as conflict and worries about where that will lead. “If you look where we are, not only in Canada but in the world, where we’re becoming far more divided, far less able to have conservations with those that we have differing opinions with, we’re at risk of losing the value of debate.”

The resignations of two high-profile cabinet ministers over the Liberals’ mishandling of the SNC-Lavalin affair have since brought the question of debate within parties into greater focus. Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former justice minister and attorney general, and Jane Philpott, the former Treasury Board president, two of Trudeau’s most respected ministers, brazenly stood against the prime minister and his office and still remain in the Liberal caucus. Their actions lend credibility to Alleslev’s story while undermining the necessity of her departure. She chose to keep her quarrels with the party silent, she says, because dissenting openly would jeopardize its ability to govern.

But, in keeping quiet for so long, Alleslev has opened herself up to accusations of political opportunism. “Did you put your finger in the air to see which way the wind was blowing,” pressed CTV’s Don Martin, “and figure it was going to go Conservative in 2019, so you might as well join the parade?” If she hopes to regain her seat in 2019, Alleslev will need to prove those accusations wrong. She will need to convince her supporters that switching sides was more than simply self-interested politics, despite what the opposition says. And the Liberals will come armed with stories spun by former staffers and Liberal hard-liners with an incentive to discredit her. All voters have is her word. Whether she honestly acted in their interest or not, the fallout that ensued suggests intentions are moot. Few things are as politically isolating as crossing the floor.

Since Confederation, 340 MPs have changed party affiliation, willingly or not, between elections. Those who leave tend to opt for independence, with many soon switching again to join another party or to return to their former caucus. While some forty countries have laws pertaining to crossing the floor—in most cases, defecting legislators are forced to give up their seats—there’s no federal convention, legislation, or parliamentary rule regarding it in Canada. Manitoba and New Brunswick have enacted laws forcing outgoing caucus members to sit independently for the remainder of the term. But both the Liberals and Conservatives seem less keen to hamstring members’ freedom. In 2005, the federal government defeated a bill proposing that changes in party affiliation be followed by a by-election. Similar legislation has been introduced regularly in parliamentary sessions since; all have failed to pass first reading.

However, a series of ethics inquiries suggests floor crossers came under greater scrutiny beginning in the early 2000s, as crossing grew in popularity. Some forty-four MPs switched sides between 2001 and 2005, which, according to a 2006 study, outpaced the previous eighty-year average of twenty-three crossings per decade. In 2005, former ethics commissioner Bernard Shapiro was asked to determine whether a member had contravened the Conflict of Interest Code in switching parties. The following year, his attention turned to investigating Prime Minister Stephen Harper. In question was whether Harper had bribed Liberal MP David Emerson into leaving his party with the perks of a cabinet position with the Conservatives. Shapiro found no wrongdoing, but noted, “The discontent expressed by Canadians on this matter cannot be attributed merely to the machinations of partisan politics. Fairly or unfairly, this particular instance has given many citizens a sense that their vote—the cornerstone of our democratic system—was somehow devalued, if not betrayed.”

A number high-profile defections have been viewed as politically expedient, such as those of Belinda Stronach, in 2005, and Eve Adams, in 2015. Stronach left the Conservatives and was granted a cabinet seat with the Liberals, a move she made, some suspect, to help keep Paul Martin’s minority government in power ahead of two important budget votes. Adams deserted the Conservatives over their “mean-spirited leadership” six months after dropping out of a nomination-race in a new riding and was welcomed by Trudeau’s Liberals with open arms.

In Alleslev’s case, journalists and political pundits raised the possibility that she was reacting to the Ontario Liberal Party’s defeat in June 2018. During that provincial election, the riding of Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill saw Conservative Michael Parsa win by more than twice as many votes as the Liberal runner-up. By comparison, in 2014, each of the predecessor districts that now make up the new riding—Newmarket-Aurora, Oak Ridges–Markham, and Richmond Hill—had voted Liberal. The losses are notable, but they offer little insight into the projected electoral outcome for the region in October. According to the CBC, the federal party that has won the most seats in Ontario has been different in 52 percent of elections from the one currently in power provincially.

At the federal level, the ethnically diverse riding of Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill remains a toss-up between the reds and blues. It would be foolish to think Alleslev had special insight, more than one year out, into how the election will unfold. What we know is this: in Ontario, the parties have been neck and neck in the polls since early 2018, and an analysis of polling numbers by the website Calculated Politics, taken only weeks before Alleslev’s defection, projected the Conservatives were on par to win Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill by a margin of just 2 percent.

What seems to set defectors apart is an ability to exploit the divisive nature of politics today to their own advantage. It’s a quality Alleslev seems to have put to work during her 2014 nomination race. Clayton Haluza, president of the federal Liberal riding association in Aurora–Oak Ridges–Richmond Hill, hadn’t the faintest idea who she was when she approached him at a fundraising event that year. Haluza found her straightforwardness refreshing for a political hopeful. But Alleslev had no ties to the Liberal party, hadn’t served in municipal politics, and wasn’t particularly involved in the community.

Alleslev’s aloofness was the result of having, as she says, “never, ever considered” a life in politics. Instead, she envisioned spending her entire career in the military—a calling she says teaches you to put country first. Her father retired as a two-star general from the Royal Canadian Air Force; his father had resisted the Nazis in Denmark as a member of the Danish underground. She came to believe that “serving one’s country is an honourable profession.” In 1991, she joined the Canadian military as a second lieutenant, logistics officer in Comox, BC, having studied history and political science at the Royal Military College in Kingston, Ontario. A decade later, following her retirement from the military, she worked as a consultant, at times within the federal government, and eventually landed in the private sector at IBM and Bombardier Aerospace.

Alleslev says it was Harper government that motivated her to join the Liberal Party in 2014. She thought their policies weren’t positioning Canada competitively and that, in contrast, the Liberals were making bold promises on everything from foreign policy to infrastructure spending, which she found appealing. Sitting in her Richmond Hill office late last year, she told me she began to sense, around four years ago, that “some pretty dramatic things” were unfolding at home and abroad. She was unsure about running for office, however, until she met Jason Cherniak, who was seeking the nomination. A lawyer based out of Richmond Hill, then in his midthirties, Cherniak was as faithful as they come: a card-carrying Liberal since high school, he went on to serve on the Young Liberals of Canada national executive and later as president of the Richmond Hill federal riding association and as president of the Liberal Party of Canada (Ontario) Central Region.

“Considering how significant the challenges facing the country and world are right now, I’m not sure he’s the right guy to represent me as a member of Parliament,” she said, thinking back. “Ah rats—I’m going to have to run.”

With existing ties to the Liberal Party, Cherniak was confident he had a shot at the nomination. But he began to suspect party upper brass were favouring Alleslev. “That part of it has been very difficult for me,” Cherniak says, “because after all these years of volunteering, I really thought that at the very least I had earned a chance at a fair race.” Alleslev had virtually no political experience, but she was a veteran and strong leader who stood in contrast to Conservative incumbent, Costas Menegakis. She played right into the optimistic, feminist narrative the Liberals were hoping to tell. As the Globe and Mail’s Adam Radwanski has noted, Trudeau “made a point of recruiting a diverse array of candidates who, despite impressive professional credentials, often did not have much partisan political experience.”

So intent was the party to win the riding that it overlooked what one former staffer now considers several “red flags.” Alleslev’s sister Caroline vied for the Conservative seat in Beaches–East York in 2008. And, throughout the nomination race, Alleslev could be found in tow of Greg Beros, a staunch Conservative and Richmond Hill city councillor. “You know that Leona’s a good, dear friend,” Beros would say when introducing her to members of local community groups. “While I can’t vote for her, because she’s with the Liberal Party, she is a great individual and would represent us well.” Beros recused himself from supporting her come the election. “Some people are candidate first, party second,” he says. “I’m always party first, candidate second.”

Alleslev succeeded at connecting with influential members of the riding’s Muslim community, whose support, both financial and otherwise, was “key to her getting the nomination,” says Haluza. She was later able to leverage constituents’ unhappiness with the Conservatives’ anti-immigrant rhetoric over “Canadian values” to garner widespread approval among members of the Muslim community. Without their support, many Liberals believe she would have lost in the general election. In the end, a combination of Alleslev’s own political abilities and the Conservatives’ hardline tactics helped mobilize the Muslim community at the polls, and she clinched the seat by fewer than 1,100 votes.

Following the win, a different picture of Alleslev began to emerge, one the Liberals could attempt to resuscitate during the upcoming election. In several instances, sources speaking on background say Alleslev was reluctant to credit the Muslim community for its role in her electoral success. This, they say, left some supporters feeling hurt and embittered. (In a request for comment, Alleslev apologized. “I like to think of myself as being sensitive,” she said. “So if I have been in any way insensitive, then I’m very sorry for that.”). According to the sources, that resentment was amplified by Alleslev’s decision to join the Conservatives, a party which has shown itself—most recently through its promise to withdraw Canada from the UN’s Global Compact for Safe, Orderly, and Regular Migration—to be less open to refugees and immigrants. In 2019, Alleslev will have to grapple with having alienated a group that fervently supported her only four years ago.

“A political party is made up of the people who are in it at the time and must be judged by what the country needs at the time,” Alleslev has said, in explanation of her actions. By this, she appears to suggest that political parties aren’t monolithic entities but rather are born out of a particular time and place and defined by their caucuses, which presumably have voters’ best interests at heart. This logic enables Alleslev to argue it’s not her principles but rather the needs of Canadians that have changed since she first entered politics.

Her position reveals a grey area, rarely acknowledged in federal politics, that can be exploited by politicians willing to see beyond fervent partisanship. The Liberals and Conservatives may have the tendency to disagree, especially during election years, and their rhetoric may be different, but their track records suggest they’re more similar than they’re wont to admit. “To this day, if you go down line by line and look at what the Conservative and Liberal party stand for,” Haluza says, “at least on paper, it’s shades of grey.”

Alleslev seems to have leveraged this dynamic to her own advantage. Justifying her defection, she accused the Liberals of failing to meet the NATO target that members spend at least 2 percent of GDP on defence, even though Trudeau campaigned on maintaining previous spending levels. The truth is, no sitting government has met NATO’s targets since they were enacted in 2006. Alleslev also rebuked the Liberals’ diplomatic track record, citing tensions with Saudi Arabia, China, and India. This critique ignores the Conservatives’ own failings, such as in 2010, when Canada was forced to withdraw from pursuing a seat on the UN Security Council, a move interpreted by an article in OpenCanada as a “stinging rebuke of Harper’s anti-UN foreign policy.” (Trudeau has pledged to vie for a seat on the council in 2020). Their similarities extend to the economy, where both parties are quick to talk about more free-trade agreements and tax relief for the middle class.

But, if the parties are so alike, why would Alleslev leave one for the other? To the former colleagues who are quick to mention Alleslev’s ambition, it’s easy to craft a tale of opportunity. Alleslev’s political career was off to a strong start when, in late 2015, she was named Foote’s parliamentary secretary. The public-services minister’s mandate included replacing the country’s fleet of aging CF-18s and supporting a national shipbuilding procurement strategy—two areas that would seem to be of strong personal interest to Alleslev. As parliamentary secretary, she supported these files. But she also worked on Phoenix, the payment system for the federal civil service, the deployment of which has been riddled with complications.

According to a 2018 Senate finance committee report, more than half of the Canadian civil service has not been properly paid since Phoenix’s implementation in 2016. The report notes that the project will likely amass $2.2 billion in unplanned costs by 2023, making it an “international embarrassment.” When questioned about Phoenix on Foote’s behalf, Alleslev would assure legislators the system would soon be fixed. But the situation remained chaotic, and following a cabinet shuffle in January 2017, she was demoted from her role as parliamentary secretary. Historically, such appointments have been used to prepare (or rather to test the readiness of) future cabinet ministers. Alleslev would later cite the Liberals’ failure to resolve Phoenix as among her reasons for leaving the party.

Throwing herself in with the Conservatives has, conveniently, allowed her to regain lost momentum. National media attention has made her a familiar face and a champion of the Conservative cause. And, with Scheer swiftly appointing her shadow cabinet secretary for global security, she has reclaimed a prominent role in the House. It may prove to be an important career pick-me-up, given that she was ousted as chair of the Canadian NATO parliamentary association one month after defecting. Like the majority of floor-crossing MPs before her, Alleslev could have ridden out her term as an independent, thereby limiting speculation on her motives, but she says she decided against it, believing that the Canadian system is not “structured for independence.” Independent members rarely sit on committees, are not recognized as often during Question Period, and lose the support of a caucus. They are, in other words, less influential.

Alleslev has always been focused on maximizing her influence.

BEIJING/OTTAWA (Reuters) - China expanded its ban on Canadian canola seed imports on Tuesday to include shipments from Viterra Inc, the latest development in a wider trade dispute between the two countries.

Viterra is the second canola exporter to have its registration canceled, after Beijing halted shipments from top exporter Richardson International earlier this month.

An industry group said last week that Chinese importers have stopped buying any oilseed from Canada, though Chinese imports of Canadian canola oil and meal have not been impacted.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters on Tuesday that his government was trying to resolve the issue and considering sending a high-level delegation to China to address the country's safety concerns.

""We are taking this very seriously,"" he said in Winnipeg, Manitoba, noting that Canada's relationship with China has been fraught in recent months.

""We have seen a certain amount of challenges in our relationship with China over diplomatic issues,"" he said.

Canada and China have been locked in a trade and political dispute since the chief financial officer of Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd was arrested in Vancouver late last year on a U.S. extradition request.

The ban on Viterra and its related companies was announced by China's General Administration of Customs on its website and was effective immediately. Viterra is owned by Glencore Plc's agricultural arm.

Chinese customs said in a statement the ports of Dalian and Nanning had once again detected several pests in samples taken from cargoes shipped by Viterra.

In order to prevent the introduction of harmful organisms, it canceled the firm's export registration, it said, adding that it will continue to strengthen inspections on all canola imports.

Viterra is working with the Canadian government and the Canola Council to gather more information, a spokesman said. Export products are tested to ensure they meet specific import standards, the spokesman said in a statement.

A spokesman for the Canola Council of Canada said the industry group is confident in the quality of Canadian canola seed exports, noting no other global customers have expressed concerns.

""Today (the Chinese) are alleging another new pest of concern. We are quite perplexed. How can the quality of our canola suddenly change?"" said Brian Innes, vice president of public affairs with the Canola Council.

China accounts for about 40 percent of Canada's canola seed, oil and meal exports, according to the Canola Council, with seed exports to China worth some C$2.7 billion ($2 billion) a year.

Bhatti’s commitment to religious freedom, despite knowing he was risking his life, inspired Anderson to ask himself if there is “something I can do to ...","OTTAWA – David Anderson had been a popular Conservative MP in Saskatchewan for more than a decade when an assassination half a world away inspired him to pick up the torch for religious freedom.

Anderson, 61, who has represented the Saskatchewan riding of Cypress Hills-Grasslands since 2000, has announced he will not be running in October’s federal election.

Anderson said he was inspired to make religious freedom his focus after the 2011 assassination of Pakistan Minorities Minister Shahbaz Bhatti, the first Christian to serve as a cabinet minister in the Pakistani government. Anderson had met Bhatti when he visited Ottawa, just weeks before armed gunmen assassinated the Catholic politician in Pakistan for his stance against his country’s blasphemy laws.

“I was looking for something relevant to faith issues,” said Anderson, who is an evangelical Christian, noting he was inspired by “people like (former MP) Joy Smith doing a great job on human trafficking.”

“There wasn’t a focus in the Canadian Parliament at all on religious freedom,” he said.

Bhatti’s commitment to religious freedom, despite knowing he was risking his life, inspired Anderson to ask himself if there is “something I can do to participate, to help” in furthering the cause.

“Without David’s leadership, we would not have today in Parliament such a robust group of MPs dedicated to the cause of religious freedom around the world,” said former Ambassador of Religious Freedom Andrew Bennett, who now heads the Cardus Religious Freedom Institute.

“Through David’s unique diplomacy, his passion, his ability to engage across partisan lines, he demonstrated that religious freedom is not an ideological issue but a human issue.”

Anderson launched the Annual Parliamentary Forum on Religious Freedom in 2012 that brought in guest speakers, drew MPs and Senators from all parties, and a public audience for discussion. After seven forums, it will now be up to other MPs to carry on the event.

In 2014, he was involved in the development of the International Panel of Parliamentarians for Freedom of Religion or Belief that now has hundreds of parliamentarians from around the world actively involved in fighting religious persecution and promoting freedom.

Anderson also wrote a religious freedom motion that his colleague Conservative MP Bev Shipley introduced to the House of Commons in 2012.

Motion M-382, passed unanimously by the House of Commons, said the government should “continue to recognize as part of Canadian foreign policy” the right to “freedom of religion and conscience, including the freedom to change religion or belief and the freedom to manifest religion or belief in teaching, worship, practice and observance.”

The motion also called on the foreign affairs minister to denounce violations of religious freedom in the world and called on Canada’s commitment to the creation of an Office of Religious Freedom to promote the protection of the rights of religious minorities globally.

Anderson credited former Conservative cabinet minister Jason Kenney for being the driving force behind the creation of the Office of Religious Freedom that named Bennett as Ambassador of Religious Freedom. Bennett served from 2013 to 2016 when the new Liberal government folded the ORF into a foreign affairs body focusing more generally on human rights.

Bennett created the International Contact Group on Freedom of Religion or Belief that still exists, Anderson said.

“I think we’re in good hands in the Canadian Parliament,” he said. “Certainly it’s been a great privilege for me to be part of the process.

“It’s gotten to be such an important issue that had been ignored for so long,” he said.

Anderson said he and his wife Sheila had a discussion on whether they had the energy for another campaign, describing the toll serving in the House of Commons takes on family life.

Travelling to his riding can take 24 hours a week in order to spend time at home.

“We have some little people in our lives, some grandchildren we want to spend some time with,” said Anderson, who serves in the Conservative Opposition’s shadow cabinet as the secretary for human rights and religious freedom.

“That’s one of the main things. We don’t have anything specific. Nobody’s come to us with any great offers and opportunities, but we’re trusting God will give us some direction when the time comes.”

Richard Truscott is vice-president, B.C. and Alberta, of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. Corbella: Brad Wall ...","In response to a reporter’s question during the 1993 federal election, former prime minister Kim Campbell famously said: “An election is no time to discuss serious issues.”

Alberta’s entrepreneurs certainly hope that won’t hold true for the provincial election campaign now underway. They deserve a full airing of economic issues, policy, and party positions. Sadly, it isn’t looking good so far; there have already been truckloads of mud being flung around by the two main combatants.

During elections, it is also important that there is an opportunity to discuss the incumbent government’s track record. That includes how it has performed on economic policy and measures to support small business owners, since they are the foundation of our economy and the heart and soul of our local communities.

Looking back on the past four years, it has definitely been a rocky ride for Alberta’s business community. When global oil prices plunged in late 2014, it caused a protracted recession that gripped the province throughout 2016 and 2017. By 2018, it looked like the worst was over, but late in the year the economy slipped back into a funk.

Some people argue responsibility for the state of the economy over the past few years should not be laid at the government’s feet. Policy makers don’t control oil and gas prices, and the protracted recession that has afflicted Alberta has been largely out of their hands.

That’s true. To a point. While the government can’t directly control oil prices, it can control its policy response to the downturn. In large part thanks to the push back from the business community, the government wisely announced three years ago it would cut the small business tax rate by one point. A welcome move at the time, for sure.

Since then, the government has also rolled out a few other narrowly targeted tax credit programs for a relatively small slice of businesses. They have also made more loans available through ATB Financial.

Taken together, however, this small stream of support pales in comparison to the veritable flood of other punitive policies that flowed from the government affecting huge numbers of Alberta’s small businesses. Over the past few years, the government increased corporate taxes, pushed through a 47 per cent increase in the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and implemented a new carbon tax that drained billions of dollars a year out of the private sector into government coffers. It also overhauled employment rules with barely a thought as to how it would impact small business and rammed through new WCB costs and constraints.

Was any of this looked at through the lens of a small business? Was there meaningful mitigation? The answer is no. The government continued to point to that one point reduction in the small business tax rate as if it was a full offset for everything else. It simply wasn’t enough, though. Besides, a reduction in income tax only really helps the businesses that were able to stay profitable through the recession, and not those that needed it the most. For those barely breaking even or losing money, the cascade of new costs completely dwarfed the tax cut.

The Alberta government should have done a lot more to offset the impact on small businesses. It could have extended the timeline to get to a $15 minimum wage for small business, like Seattle did. It could have extended some specific carbon tax rebates to local businesses. It could have allowed some flexibility on new employment and occupational health rules for smaller employers. But none of these sensible choices was made.

Instead, in the midst of the worst recession in a generation with the province’s small businesses hanging on by their fingernails, the government chose to keep its foot on the gas and made a bad situation a lot worse. The next provincial government, whatever the political stripe, must do a better job of finding meaningful ways to support entrepreneurs, and pursuing policy that reflects the unique reality of small business.

Alberta’s economic future depends on it.

Starvation and chronic hunger have continuing, epigenetic effects that last ...","It really is the perfect time for Alicia Elliott’s A Mind Spread Out on the Ground to be published. In what the 31-year-old Tuscarora writer calls the Indigenous renaissance, Indigenous artistry has never had so spectacular a presence across Canada’s cultural spectrum. Maliseet composer Jeremy Dutcher took the Polaris Music Prize last year, the third Indigenous winner in ﬁve years, while three Indigenous artists have won the annual Sobey Art Award since 2013. Indigenous poets have won the Grifﬁn Prize, one of the richest and most prestigious poetry prizes in the world, three years running. With a constant presence on bestseller lists and among literary prize nominations and wins, Indigenous literature is now as integral to CanLit as the immigrant story. If the current wave of Indigenous cultural prominence recedes anywhere, it won’t be in literature. Whatever this says about the country’s blind spots in the past, there’s never been a brighter spotlight on or a broader audience for incisive Indigenous cultural commentary.

Elliott delivers that commentary in exceptional essays as arresting as her title, which comes from a richly evocative Mohawk phrase for someone in the grip of depression. Assured enough to mock herself on occasion—“I don’t have all the answers,” she writes, after 200 pages of laying them down with utter assurance, “even if I sometimes imply I do”—Elliott ranges over a wide canvas. She tackles the vexed question of identity, both personal and political, powerfully linking larger questions of Indigenous life—from the residential school legacy to the loss of languages—to the unfolding of her own life. In forthright prose, in a format—a buzzed-about book from a major publisher—that should make it difficult for non-Indigenous Canadians to ignore, she also links past and present, laying out how the colonial legacy still shapes contemporary lives, Indigenous and non-Indigenous. And how real reconciliation is going to require an internal reformation within non-Indigenous Canada.

It’s “complicated,” Elliott says of her own identity, in her ﬁrst use of a word that becomes a theme running right through an interview with her. She calls herself Tuscarora, one of the Six Nations of the Haudenosaunee (historically known to white Canadians as the Iroquois), whose reserve near Brantford, Ont., is the country’s most populous. That’s not the federal government’s assessment of Elliott’s ethnicity. “Haudenosaunee people are matrilineal,” she continues. “But the imposition of the Indian Act changed everything. If you were to look at my status card it would say I’m Mohawk because it traces through patrilineal lines and my father is Mohawk. We had to actually do research into what we would be traditionally, which—going through my father’s maternal line—is Tuscarora.”

Elliott traces herself through her father’s maternal lineage because, complicating matters further, her own mother is white. She describes her “white-passing” skin colour as both a lifelong “shield” against casual racial harassment and a childhood “barrier” between her and her darker cousins, making her “both winner and loser, abuser and victim.” Also, not having been raised on the reserve, Elliott did not have Haudenosaunee culture “slowly, carefully poured into her hands” as those cousins did.

“There’s so much misunderstanding about Indigenous identity,” she says. “I look at it as being a citizen of a country. Indigeneity as a racial concept was something created by colonialism, something that we never acknowledged. We had adoptions into our nations that would have been similar to the way immigration works: you have to agree to certain things, to abiding by the Great Law and so forth. For me to say that I am Native means that is my afﬁliation, my nation, the group I have allegiance to. It doesn’t conflict to say I’m both Native and white-passing, or that I had to come to the culture later in life because of family circumstances. Those are things a lot of people who are Indigenous have to deal with.” Canada’s preferred image of an Indigenous person, she writes, is not “the modern Native girl in a sweatshirt and jeans trying to ﬁgure out how she ﬁts in ‘Reconciliation© Canada,’ ” but a stoic full-blooded Indian man decked out in beads and leather.

“Although,” she adds, in what could be a swipe at an unnamed Joseph Boyden, or, to be precise, at Boyden’s fans, “should the genuine artifact be unavailable, Canada will happily accept a handsome, agreeable white dude with tenuous Indigenous ‘roots’ as a substitute.”

If Elliott’s family circumstances brought her to parse identity closely, they also impelled her toward wider connections. Both her parents have engaged in domestic abuse and been arrested on various charges; the criminal justice system “didn’t help them, or our family.” Her mother’s abuse Elliott links to episodes of severe mental illness, eventually diagnosed as bipolar disorder, her father’s to intergenerational trauma—what his father inflicted on him. But the depression that has afflicted all of them, Elliott included, she believes to be as much a cultural phenomenon as a matter of personal history and brain chemistry. “We live in a society that is very much about the individual,” she says, where we are each responsible for pulling ourselves up, or where no one’s responsible when mental illness strikes. “The problem with that is that we don’t think of things such as class or race, even when you’re consistently having to worry about where your next meal is coming from or you know that when you’re looking for an apartment people are going to take one look at you and not want to rent. But those things are there—cultural depression, if you will.”

There are a lot of supposed “individual” choices in Indigenous life that are in fact out of people’s control, Elliott notes. Reading a study on the lingering effects of the Holodomor, the Ukrainian famine deliberately induced by a Soviet government determined to extinguish Ukrainian resistance and identity, she feels her breath catching in her throat. Never before had she seen an account of a non-Indigenous people sharing “my people’s experience of genocide,” especially as the decades roll on. Despite high literacy rates and economic success, Ukraine has the highest percentage among 41 countries surveyed of 11-, 13- and 15-year-olds who drink alcohol at least once a week, and 11-year-olds who smoke at least once a week, as well as the lowest life expectancy in Europe, all familiar pathologies in Canadian Indigenous communities. Starvation and chronic hunger have continuing, epigenetic effects that last for generations, among them substance abuse and elevated rates of diabetes among Indigenous people, rates that many non-Indigenous people blame on “lifestyle choices” or Indigenous biology, Elliott writes. “My father has diabetes,” she comments, and she looks warily ahead to her own diagnosis.

Unlike in Ukraine, the original crime continues, she writes. Many observers decry an ongoing “cultural genocide” still levied on Indigenous peoples. Elliott has no use for the adjective—it’s just plain genocide that she sees coming from a Canadian state that has not fundamentally changed its attitude, only its tactics. How else to explain an apology for residential schools co-existing with ongoing underfunding of Indigenous children’s education, or widespread anger over the fate of the murdered Tina Fontaine paradoxically combined with silence over the child welfare system that left Fontaine vulnerable in the ﬁrst place? “Today, the child welfare system abducts Indigenous children at abnormally high rates,” says Elliott. “And it is kind of terrifying to realize the number of Indigenous kids who are currently in the system exceeds the number of kids that were ever involved in residential schools. Yeah, that’s pretty alarming, given the high rates of high school failure and prison time among children from foster care. You know something is at play—it’s not much different from residential schools, just a variation.” Canada carries on as it began, she says, its economic system still “based on Indigenous destruction.”

If there are sparks of hope, one of the brightest lies in the cultural renaissance, in the admiration and respect Canadians are according Indigenous art. Although Elliott believes Indigenous writers are still treated differently in a way that reflects lingering colonial attitudes—“I read a magazine interview with [Grifﬁn Prize winner Billy-Ray] Belcourt in which the interviewer seemed almost offended at the fact Belcourt is very well-educated and uses a lot of big words, when his poetry deals with very complex issues of sexuality, gender and colonialism”—the situation is changing rapidly. “We are moving on from a situation where we had to constantly address who we are, why we matter, constantly explaining things about our culture, things that white writers speciﬁcally don’t have to deal with. They can move on to what actually interests me: what do I want to do stylistically, what really cool things that would play with form or time? We have gone from Lee Maracle ﬁghting to get a foot in the door to Joshua Whitehead writing a cyberpunk poetry book. We’re now able to show our creativity and talk about things other than just our identities.”

Respect for artistry is a balm Elliott acknowledges, but it doesn’t come close to countering continuing assaults on Indigenous life. Canada still wants what it has always wanted, the resources on (or beneath) Indigenous land, which means the path to true reconciliation—which requires acceptance of Indigenous sovereignty—can seem permanently impassable. In her last and most provocative essay, which links domestic violence to state-sponsored violence in the same way she sees her own family as the micro reflection of macro Indigenous culture, she asks her readers a series of questions about their true responses to abuse and exploitation. It culminates in questions about what Elliott, borrowing a term from writer Leanne Betasamosake Simpson, refers to as extract­ionism, the entrenched idea that the land and its resources are there to be plundered. “What do you want? Are those desires based on extraction? Are they dependent on capitalism or colonialism?”

Elliott’s message is clear: For reconciliation to ﬁnally arrive, it’s non-Indigenous Canada that has to change, to become more like Indigenous Canada, rather than the reverse. Otherwise, the past—not dead at all or even really in the past—will carry on and on and on.

That trend is expected to continue as ongoing oil and gas spending weakness in Canada is balanced against comparatively steady activity in the US, said analyst Tim Monachello in an interview.

The report found that 12 of the largest Canadian energy services companies with US operations earned 54% of their revenue in the US in 2018, up from 46% in 2017.

It’s the highest percentage since at least 2013, when it was at 41%, the report notes.

“We see growing US revenue but we also see shrinking Canadian revenue a lot of times because we have Canadian rig activity levels coming down,” said Monachello.

“And we’ve seen pricing coming down as well in some service lines (in Canada).”

He is forecasting a 16% decline in Canadian drilling rig activity this year to an average of about 160 active rigs, while the US average rig count will be just over 1,000, largely flat versus 2017.

The survey includes large Calgary-based drilling companies like Precision Drilling Corp. and Ensign Energy Services Ltd., in addition to well completion firms such as Calfrac Well Services Ltd.

The industry relocated 16 Canadian rigs to the US in 2018, up from six in 2017, and has sent at least four rigs south of the border this year, according to the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors.

Canadian oilpatch activity normally peaks in mid-winter when frozen ground allows access to backcountry drilling sites, but CEO Mark Scholz of the CAODC said that’s not the case this year.

He said oil and gas producers are spending less in view of Alberta government production cutbacks, fear of the return of last fall’s steep price discounts due to a lack of pipeline export capacity, and fewer investment dollars to spend.

The provincial election called last week for April 16 may also be a factor as producers wait to see whether the opposition United Conservatives are elected and can roll back NDP moves including the carbon tax.

Facebook promises to launch a Canadian ad archive in June, before the next federal election ...","By Brian Wells | @JohnBrianOnline | bwells@cjournal.ca

Scroll through your Facebook feed and you’ll see it’s the Wild West for political advertisers on Facebook, communication experts say. As Alberta heads to the polls on April 16, political parties and third-party advertisers are corralling votes through mobile apps and online advertising.



All of this comes as online advertisers and platforms face increasing scrutiny from federal regulators concerned with interference that could ultimately influence election results.

Going Mobile

However, new federal rules won’t impact Albertans who will see their fair share of targeted political messages this coming provincial election.Targeted Facebook AdsFacebook ads are excellent for reaching audiences advertisers want to connect with. But, it’s the ability to target ads at specific demographics that has some experts, like analyst Sara Bannerman, worried.“What’s concerning to me is the lack of transparency. That we really don’t have a tool for monitoring what kind of advertising is out there,” says Bannerman, the Research Chair in Communication Policy and Governance at McMaster University.Bill C-76, introduced by the federal government last December, is attempting to force online platforms to maintain a sharable database of political advertisements.Google Canada has already decided they won’t be hosting political ads for the next Federal Election due to that requirement. In the U.S., U.K., India, and Brazil, Facebook maintains ad libraries that track who purchases political ads, how much they paid, and how the ads performed.Facebook promises to launch a Canadian ad archive in June, before the next federal election, but after Alberta’s provincial election.Under Alberta law, political advertisers only need to disclose their expenses to Elections Alberta. However, Bannerman insists more information, including how organizations are aiming particular messages to certain groups and which groups are being targeted with specific ads, should be shared with the public.“If ads are only seen by the people who [are meant to] see them, then we’re not even participating in the same conversation.”

Mobile apps are one of the newer tools being made available by political parties. Apps can be used to communicate directly with supporters, gather data, and organize campaigns.

Peter Ryan, public relations professor at Mount Royal University, says Albertans should be concerned about how easily these apps collect users’ private information.

The Alberta NDPs app Forward is the only mobile app made available to the general public.

“If they’re downloading a partisan app, we don’t know what information is getting collected by that party … we don’t know how [the data] is being used, and what effect it will have on the election.”



Ryan added there is also no way of knowing what security is in place in the event of a hack.



So far, the Alberta NDP’s app, Forward, is the only one available within the Google Play and Apple app stores.



The app requests biographical information such as name, constituency, phone number, and email.



However, as of March 14, the app wasn’t completely accessible to the public, as users who provided basic information, and granted notification and text message permissions were never sent the invitation code needed to access any in-app content.

Third-party advertisers

While political parties will be doing their share of advertising online, they’re not the only ones with a stake in this election.

Organizations not affiliated with political parties can spend up to $150,000 on advertising, per legislation introduced by the current government back in 2017.

Third-party advertisers and other groups not directly linked to political parties have the capacity and legal ability to advertise as well, which Ryan says is going to show us a lot about their role in our politics.



“We will learn which political parties will be able to leverage the third-party space to effectively amplify their messages to strategically frame their opposition and drive voters to the polls to support their election policies.”



While these third parties can advertise, they are required by law to register with Elections Alberta but can spend no more than $150,000 on advertising.



The Alberta Federation of Labour, the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees, and political-action organizations like Shaping Alberta’s Future are three examples of groups registered as third-party political advertisers with Elections Alberta.

Unregistered groups

Public Facebook groups with thousands of members can spread suspicious news articles to non-members through sharing.

While registered third parties will have their spending monitored by the province, Ryan raises the issues of groups who may not be receiving or spending any money at all, but still exerting great influence.



“If you aren’t receiving any money you can still have a [Facebook] group and post away,” says Ryan.



“A huge group right now is the Yellow Vest movement online, over 100,000 people are following it. That could influence a provincial election.”



Yellow Vests Canada identifies itself as a group that supports the building of pipelines and opposes carbon taxes, globalists and ‘treason’ committed by Canadian politicians. The group’s Facebook page is filled with posts by members sharing from sources such as Debate Post which makes unsubstantiated claims, often about immigration or Prime Minister Trudeau.



Ryan encourages voters to be critical of posts they see online and attempt to verify what they see with trusted media outlets and official government sources, like Elections Alberta.



“If it’s not the mainstream media reporting or circulating information to you, I would say consumers beware of that information.”

By MarketsFarm

WINNIPEG, March 26 (MarketsFarm News) – The following is a glance at the news moving markets in Canada and globally.

– Another Canadian grain company is banned from exporting to China. Viterra Inc. had its license revoked as the country continues to crack down on Canada’s foremost crop, citing concerns with dangerous pests and fungus found in the product, though the Canadian Food Inspection Agency hasn’t found any such pests. This trade pushback is seen as a retaliatory move following the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wangzhou in Vancouver in December.

– United States Treasury Bond yields inverted on Friday, meaning 10-year bonds have a lower yield than the 3-year note, reflecting a lack of faith in near-term markets. Some experts view yield curve inversions as a recession predictor.

– United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May’s most recent British attempt was shot down on Monday night, defeated by 329 votes to 302. The former industry minister said “It’s absurd that now we are in a position of political impasse and… Parliament hasn’t actually talked about it on the floor of the House of Commons. That’s what I call a democratic deficit.” MPs have said if there is majority consensus for a plan, May must acknowledge it.

– Following Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Friday showing no collusion between Donald Trump and Russia during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Trump is focusing on trade negotiations with China.

Broadband access makes it exponentially easier to deliver ...","Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau tabled the 2019 Federal Budget on Tuesday March 19. Overall, it was a positive budget for the Canadian tech industry, with a number of items that have positive short- and long-term implications for our national tech ecosystem. These include:

Elimination of income thresholds on SR&ED premium tax credits

$35.2 million over five years (with $7.4 million ongoing) for the Global Talent Stream, to help Canadian tech firms compete for global talent

$38 million over the next five years to fund a new generation of tech entrepreneurs via Futurepreneur Canada

$60 million over two years for CanCode

$1.7 billion over 13 years for the much-discussed Universal Broadband Fund

My colleague Ian Heine and I took a deeper dive into these budget items to uncover where the greatest opportunities lie for Canadian tech.

New tax incentives give growing tech companies room to scale

The budget eliminated the $800,000 taxable income limit when calculating eligibility for the 35 percent SR&ED enhanced tax credit. By doing so, it accepted a recommendation the Canadian Council of Innovators has been making for several budget cycles. Going forward, larger and profitable private tech companies can invest heavily in R&D and still receive the attractive 35 percent credit (instead of the lower 15 percent rate).

With no national data strategy announced in Budget 2019, it begs the question: is Canada behind on this?



This change removes a constraint that punished success by taking away tax relief as companies scaled up. It also recognizes the reality of the R&D cycle, which is one of constant, ongoing refinement, rather than a short window during start-up. The new incentive gives high-growth companies some help in staying upright through various R&D cycles—and that gives them significantly more room to scale up, without the need to manage fluctuations in profits. Companies should actively look at whether they qualify and budget accordingly.

Mixed news on stock option grants

Fortunately, tech startups were left mostly unaffected by the proposed change to the tax treatment of preferred stock option grants; employees at larger, mature tech firms perhaps not so much. Under proposed rules, there will be an annual $200,000 limit (based on fair market value of the underlying shares) for employee stock option grants, but emerging tech companies will be specifically exempt.

The government will release additional details on the measure this summer, but it’s clear this treatment will not impact an existing narrative: that Canada is a great place to start and build a tech company. It’s our hope that future details will also enforce it being a great place for companies to reside as they scale and expand globally.

Permanent Global Talent Stream project to continue attracting foreign talent

The federal budget aims to give Canadian tech firms a leg up in the drive to attract global talent by making the Global Talent Stream project permanent. The program reduces waiting time for visas for qualifying high-skilled talent to a mere ten business days, greatly accelerating the talent onboarding process for tech firms.

With an estimated 216,000 Canadian tech positions that need to be filled by 2021, the need for such a program is critical. (Indeed: last year, Los Angeles-based CBRE Group Inc. pointed out that Toronto added more technology-related jobs than the Bay Area, Seattle, and Washington DC combined). This program builds on Canada’s reputation as a place where “the best and the brightest” can build a career—a reputation that stands in contrast to some of our global competitors, where talent streams may be deterred due to strict immigration policies and changing visa programs.

Nurturing a new generation of Canadian tech innovators

Futurepreneur Canada, a non-profit that supports aspiring business owners aged 18-39, will receive $38 million over five years (this includes $3 million specifically earmarked for entrepreneurs from Indigenous communities). Combined with matched investments from other partners, the funds will help nurture some 1,000 new entrepreneurs per year.

Universal Broadband Fund brings high-speed internet to all Canadians

The most significant budget impact on the tech sector may be the $1.7 billion dedicated to the Universal Broadband Fund. Its goal is to build broadband infrastructure for Canadians in rural and remote regions by 2030 by deploying a low-orbit satellite offering high-speed connections to every corner of the country.

The Universal Broadband Fund also has the potential to be a “social upgrade” that helps level the playing field between urban and rural areas.

Combined with existing infrastructure, this buildout presents an opportunity for Canadian e-commerce and telecom firms, as well as other industries. By eliminating a critical “chokepoint” that has prevented a good portion of the population in taking part in the burgeoning digital economy, the initiative should open a sizeable new market to our online retailers.

Beyond economics, the Fund also has the potential to be a “social upgrade” that helps level the playing field between urban and rural areas—an economic divide that has become a socio-political one in recent years. Broadband access makes it exponentially easier to deliver comparable social programs (education and healthcare being two obvious examples) over vast distances, helping to make Canada a more equitable society.

Some opportunities for 2020

Wrapping up, it’s intriguing to consider some questions left unanswered by this year’s budget and think about a few items that were missed that are almost certainly on the tech industry’s “wish list” for next year.

National Data Strategy

The budget’s allocation of $22 million over the next five years for funding the office of the Privacy Commissioner is well-intended—enhancing the office’s capacity and ability to engage with individuals is welcome—but it could have been part of a bigger idea. It begs the question: is Canada behind on this?

Response to U.S. tax reform

Like the 2018 budget, this year’s did not include specific commentary on the United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. U.S. tax reform was designed to reduce foreign investment by U.S. multinationals, resulting in a loss of economic activity in Canada. An active response to this measure would help bolster the tech industry (and indeed, all of Corporate Canada). Failing to decrease the corporate income tax rate, for instance, erodes Canada’s competitive position with Silicon Valley.

Overall, this year’s Federal Budget appears to offer some positive changes for Canada’s tech ecosystem, which we anticipate will help to deliver further growth and development in the sector as a whole.

I’d argue that viewers ...","I never thought I’d say this, but CBC-TV is on a roll. It began in 2015, with the debut of Schitt’s Creek, a quietly amusing sitcom by Canadian Jewish father-son duo Eugene and Dan Levy. In 2016, CBC introduced Kim’s Convenience, a fluffy story of Korean shopkeepers that has proven to be, if not gut-busting comedy, at least a cute, polished family comedy pushing minority representation across the country.

Then came 2017, when Workin’ Moms walked in the door, and elevated CBC-TV to a whole other level.

Unlike its saturated siblings, Workin’ Moms adopts a sharper tone, mixing adult themes with blunt swears. Showrunner and star Catherine Reitman has created a firmly 21st-century feminist series on par with other great contemporary, women-led televised series, down to the main character baring her breasts in the pilot episode. (My wife pointed out this bizarre trend to me: the leads of Girls, Orange is the New Black, GLOW and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel all appear shirtless, not throughout the series, but pointedly in the pilot, as if complying with some unspoken rite of passage.)

Workin’ Moms wrapped its third season this month, weeks after launching internationally on Netflix. The reviews are not unanimous, but if early American responses are any indication, the show cements a new benchmark for Canadian television. Finally, we’re done pretending the best we can do is Mr. D.

“Never before have I related more to a show,” gushed Lindsey Benoit O’Connell of Good Housekeeping. Variety reports the show enjoyed a 20 per cent higher audience retention rate in 2019 than the average CBC series, and in October 2018, it was nominated for best comedy series at the International Emmy Awards in New York City (though it lost to an Israeli series, Nevsu).

Workin’ Moms works because it’s fun and complex, building storylines that blossom into realistic, sometimes tragic finales. The first season is unfortunately inconsistent, but one of the brightest plots focuses on Anne, a mother of two struggling over whether she can justify getting an abortion. There’s an implicit blow against ageist conventions that dictate such plotlines usually be reserved for unprepared teenagers; the show handles the issue with nuance and emotion, as Anne weighs her moral responsibilities against the practical terror of looming debt and her own selfish desire to get back to work.

READ: KIMMY SCHMIDT SHOWED US HOW TO COMBAT BEING OFFENDED

The harshest criticism, from disappointed reviewers in the Globe and Mail and Slate, focuses on the moms’ privilege: most are white, all have well-paying jobs and, aside from the abortion plotline, the show largely ignores the political and financial realities of raising a kid in downtown Toronto. I’d argue that viewers who insist their pop culture strictly mirrors reality may also scoff when Reitman’s character fends off a bear by yelling at it, or when she takes too many hallucinogenic mushrooms and accidentally pitches the same lame ad campaign to two clients, both of whom gleefully love it. Disliking a show because it is not the show you want it to be does not make it a bad show.

Besides, this appears to be one of those sitcoms critics resent and regular folks love. One mommy blogger called it “spit-from-your-sippy-cup funny,” and while anecdotally quoting my American sister-in-law’s Facebook page is not exactly hard proof, she is a good example of an everyday working mother who wrote (unprompted, of her own volition, without any Canadians recommending it to her!) that “Workin’ Moms on Netflix speaks to my soul,” which is honestly the nicest thing I’ve read by a normal non-Canadian about a CBC show.

That brings me back to my point: CBC-TV is actually good now. Netflix is definitely a disruptor, but part of that disruption has boosted our national broadcaster. Regardless of whether you resent your tax dollars going to the CBC, at least they’re now producing decent stuff that’s giving Canadian artists a chance to prove themselves on a global stage.","With Workin’ Moms, CBC raises the bar for Canadian TV",Canadian Jewish News,https://www.cjnews.com/culture/entertainment/with-workin-moms-cbc-raises-the-bar-for-canadian-tv

Bruce said the political issue engulfing the Liberals has “very little ...,"MONTREAL — SNC-Lavalin Group’s chief executive said on Friday the company is looking at ways to protect its business in the event it loses a corruption trial that has created a political crisis for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

An SNC-Lavalin board subcommittee is weighing the construction and engineering company’s options as it takes “steps to minimize the effect of any potential sort of bad outcome in a few years’ time,” chief executive Neil Bruce told Reuters in an interview.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations that top officials working for him leaned on former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to ensure that the construction company avoided a corruption trial. Trudeau has denied the allegations.

At the affair’s centre is a request by SNC-Lavalin for a remediation agreement that would have enabled it to avoid a court case which, if lost, would block it from federal government contracts for a decade. SNC-Lavalin is facing fraud and corruption charges related to allegations that former executives paid bribes to win contracts in Libya under Muammar Gaddafi’s regime, which fell in 2011.

Bruce said SNC is now focused on defending itself in court, with little expectation that a remediation would become available. Any court decision would likely be years away.

“We don’t want to be reacting too late or not early enough if the worst came to the worst,” he said. “We’ve got to be prudent and make sure that we position the company.”

Being blocked from federal contracts would raise the threat of job cuts among the company’s Canadian workforce of 9,000.

“If we were in a position where for whatever reason we couldn’t do work with a certain customer or in a certain country then we would plan all of that and make sure that our business development efforts and the work we were chasing and hopefully winning didn’t fall into that category. That’s part of the mitigation plan.”

Trudeau has often referred to the 9,000 potential job losses as a reason for helping the company, but Bruce told the CBC earlier this week that he never gave a specific number.

SNC wanted to take advantage of new legislation to pay a large fine rather than be prosecuted.

Bruce said the political issue engulfing the Liberals has “very little to do” with the Montreal-based company whose backlog of about $15 billion (US$11.17 billion) is expected to rise during the first quarter.

But politics impacted SNC’s ability to win new work in Saudi Arabia in December and January, amid tense relations between Riyadh and Ottawa. Saudi Arabia froze new trade with Ottawa in August after Canada demanded the release of jailed rights activists.

“Generally we would expect to win sometimes one in two, sometimes one in three,” he said. “And that actually went down to zero in a couple of areas.”

While the dispute has not impacted current contracts underway in Saudi Arabia, Bruce said SNC’s backlog in the country would taper off toward the end of the year if it didn’t win any new contracts in 2019.

The CEO also said an accelerated arbitration process around a delayed Chile project, which hit results from its mining unit in the fourth quarter, would likely not be resolved in 2019.

Each year, the weeklong CSA event organized by the Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television celebrates excellence in Canadian screen content, encompassing film, TV and digital media work.

Hosted by comedian Aisha Alfa, Tuesday evening's ceremony was dedicated to non-fiction programming, including TV news, sports, documentaries, lifestyle, factual and reality content.

Gord Downie's Secret Path in Concert, among the final works by the late Tragically Hip frontman, won a pair of trophies. Secret Path — a multimedia project, concept album and live performance completed about a year before Downie's death — tells the story of Chanie Wenjack, a pre-teen Anishinaabe boy who escaped from a northern Ontario residential school more than 50 years ago but died of hunger and exhaustion trying to walk 600 kilometres home. The Secret Path concert special won best variety or entertainment special and best sound, non-fiction.

For decades, Downie told stories about Canada through his music. But in his latter years the musician thought, ""maybe we shouldn't be so quick to pat ourselves on the back about being such a great country,"" his brother, Mike Downie, said in his acceptance speech.

""Gord wasn't much of an awards show kind of guy, but I think he'd be happy with this. Any opportunity to keep talking about Indigenous culture, Indigenous traditions, the true history of this country over the last 150 years is a good thing,"" he added backstage.

Longtime foreign correspondent Arsenault, a co-host of CBC's The National, won kudos both for shepherding the public broadcaster's coverage of Prince Harry's wedding to Meghan Markle (best host or interviewer in a news or information program) and as part of the team behind The Ruins of Raqqa (best news or information segment), an in-depth CBC News report that also garnered an award for its powerful visuals (best photography, news or information).

""In regards to any issue of quality, we disagree with the Chinese allegations. The Canadian government respects and supports our position, and the quality of our product, at the same time.""

Canada exported more than $5 billion worth of canola last year, and almost half of it was destined for the Chinese market — almost five million metric tonnes worth, according to the Canadian Canola Growers Association.

Richardson is among the largest individual shippers of the product in the world, and this move ""would basically curb or shut down their exports of canola,"" growers association chief executive Rick White said in an interview.

""If Richardson can't buy and move it and send it to China, farmers are to be left with it here in Canada.""

The news comes against the backdrop of rising tensions between Canada and China ignited last year, when Canadian officials detained Meng Wanzhou, vice-president of Chinese technology firm Huawei, at the request of U.S. tax authorities as she was boarding a flight in Vancouver.

Meng, who is the daughter of Huawei's founder, was arrested on Dec. 1, 2018, while in transit through Vancouver to Mexico and South America. She is now involved in an extradition case and personal litigation against Canadian border officials, the RCMP and the attorney general of Canada.

Two Canadians — Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor — have since been detained in China, and on Monday the two men were accused of stealing state secrets from China.

White said that while there's ""no evidence or any information that ties that issue one to the other,"" others are drawing a direct line between the revocation of Richardson's permit with ongoing Chinese-Canadian trade and diplomatic issues.

One industry expert who has been granted anonymity for fear of becoming the target retaliatory measures from China said the move is ""direct retaliation"" for Canada's recent actions — including the unfolding scandal involving SNC-Lavalin.

Carla Gottgens/Bloomberg More

The Chinese see that ""Trudeau was willing to intervene in legal matters to help ... SNC, while at the same time refused to intervene to have Meng released to avoid extradition,"" the source said.

I am a longtime reader of The Spectator. I glance at the obituaries, skip the sports pages — sorry I am sure they are great for sports lovers — I have a thorough read of the front section and then my morning treat. The Go section. Being Monday my favourite is Lorraine Sommerfeld's column. A sweet column about everyday life. Not very important? I disagree. Whether the topic is the cottage, family, cats or shopping for boots I enjoy it because It feels normal. Even though we are all living our own circumstance it joins us in everyday life.

I know there are serious and important issues here and around the world ... government corruption, families fighting for appropriate help for their autistic children, terrorism, poverty and of course climate change. I know because they are reported in the paper and on the internet as well as news programs. It is important that we know what is going on in the world, but with 24-7 access to news I think the job is covered.

I am not sure if Lorraine's column bashing Doug Ford and his government will change anybody's political views but I know her human interest column about every day life adds to my Monday mornings.

Creating 'worker bees' in the classroom

RE: Class size about cutting programs (March 20)

Raising class sizes will affect teaching positions, to claim otherwise is not realistic.

The government is hopeful that people will retire but there is no guarantee. The sad part is that it comes at the expense of young people in many ways. First, young adults trying to start their lives as teachers. It comes at the expense of students. There is a lot of data on how students lack social contacts and feel isolated, in some cases leading to depression and suicide.

Not all students are science and math oriented. Shouldn't everyone have the choice of what they want to be when they grow up? By eliminating arts, languages and drama you are indeed creating 'worker bees in an assembly line economy'. The problem is the assembly line jobs are almost extinct or what jobs left are being or will be taken over by robots.

Don't parents, society at large, and governments have a responsibility to nurture and guide our young people to be the best they can be? You can only become your best when you are given the opportunity and exposure to explore who you are and who you want to be. This happens only with choice and variety. It isn't about the almighty dollar all the time. This route has already cost us, and will continue to cost us, as a society.

Seven stunning vintage shots from a Victorian-era mother-daughter photography duo

The mother-daughter duo Minna Keene and Violet Keene Perenchief are two of the most famous Toronto photographers you’ve never heard of.

At 19, the German-born Minna Bergman emigrated to England, where she met her husband, Caleb Keene. In England, while recovering from a toothache, Minna found time to experiment with photography. She worked and exhibited in the U.K., South Africa and Canada, and ran successful photography studios in Cape Town, Montreal and Oakville. She was a member of the London Salon of Photography and the first woman to be accepted as a fellow of the Royal Photographic Society.

When the Keenes immigrated to Canada in 1913, Minna’s daughter Violet learned how to use a camera by spending time in her mother’s Montreal studio. Their work differed in both method and style: Minna focused on pictorialist landscape photography, while Violet became known for Modernist portraits, photographing political and cultural figures including Aldous Huxley, W.B. Yeats, Amelia Earhart and the Canadian governor general. Eventually, they settled down in Oakville, where they ran a well-known photo studio. Both Minna and Violet exhibited often, and Minna was profiled in a 1926 edition of Maclean’s.

For Two Generations of Photography, the Stephen Bulger Gallery is displaying 65 of Minna and Violet’s works. Here’s a preview of the collection.

Pictorialism, a style of photography that prioritized the beauty of the subject and composition over realistic representation, was en vogue in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Minna was part of that movement, manipulating her images by using a softer focus and colour tinting. This picturesque shot was taken in Fahrenholz, Germany.

While in Cape Town, Minna experimented with social realism, a relatively uncommon photographic style for the time. It wasn’t until after World War I that the concept of documentary photography became popular. In this series, Minna explored Boer life in South Africa with poignant images of life on the farm.

Minna won the Picture of the Year at the London Photographic Salon for this photograph of Violet at 17. Pomegranates are a classic symbol of fertility and eternal life, and here they represent Violet’s youth and vitality.

By 1913, Minna and her family had emigrated to Canada, first landing in Montreal before settling in Oakville. Her reputation as an accomplished photographer preceded her and, only a year after arriving, the Canadian Pacific Railway hired her to document the Rockies.

Violet became a widow after only four months of marriage and had to find extra work to support her child. She became the manager of Eaton’s photography studio in Toronto and spent 15 years bussing to work every morning from her home in Oakville. Most of her portrait work was produced in the Eaton’s photo studio on College Street, like this shot of a woman with her marionettes.

Minna manipulated many of her images to create an ethereal quality, but most of Violet’s work is true to the negative.

Violet mostly shot portraits, but several photos depict dolls dressed in wedding gowns. Some historians suspect they were taken as part of a window display for Eaton’s.

The Liberal government didn't have to take voters to the polls until Oct. 7 under the province's fixed-date election provisions, but there was an apparent desire to avoid overlap with the federal election this fall.

In his speech, MacLauchlan called the Tories a party of division and opposition, and said support for the surging Greens would be an expensive social experiment.

He touted advancements made by his government on housing, lower taxes and reducing child poverty by more than half.

""Prince Edward Island is working,"" he told the partisan crowd. ""There are now more opportunities for Islanders to get ahead and strive.""

Despite a booming economy, polls suggest the Liberal party is likely facing a rough ride, with the Green party seen as a legitimate contender for power.

A Corporate Research Associates poll released this month suggests the Greens had a healthy lead, followed by the Progressive Conservatives, who picked a new leader, Dennis King, in February.

The Liberals were in third place, the poll suggests.

The Island has only ever been governed by the Liberals or Tories.

Green Leader Peter Bevan-Baker became the first party member elected to the legislature in 2015, and he has worked to build the Green brand, mainly by challenging the notion that the party is devoted to nothing more than environmental activism.

The party snagged a second seat when Hannah Bell, the 48-year-old head of a businesswomen's association in Charlottetown, won a 2017 byelection.

The Liberals have been in power since 2007, and there are signs MacLauchlan - a longtime academic who began his political career in 2015 as premier - is personally unpopular.

MacLauchlan said Tuesday night that he notified the other party leaders earlier in the day.

The pending expiry of the $ ...,"A SNC-Lavalin contract with the Department of National Defence (DND) worth half a billion dollars comes up for renewal next year — when the Montreal-based engineering giant is expected to be on trial over corruption charges.

The pending expiry of the $507 million contract to support the servicing of minor warships and auxiliary vessels, signed in 2011, sharpens the debate over what a guilty verdict would mean for the Quebec-based engineering giant and whether a conviction actually would mean subjecting the company to a 10-year ban on bidding for federal contracts.

The stakes are high for DND. In addition to holding an important defence contract, SNC-Lavalin has access to a range of secret military drawings, equipment and intellectual property. Although its agreements are periodically reopened to new bids, the embattled corporation has been a reliable contractor for National Defence.

A survey of active federal government contracts shows DND and Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) were the two biggest users of SNC-Lavalin services and construction during the current fiscal year.

Across the whole of the federal government, SNC-Lavalin holds 53 'active' federal government contracts — 25 of them with DND — with a combined value of $670 million.

A company with a big federal footprint

The firm signed roughly $68 million in new or renewed agreements with the federal government ($23.7 million with DND and PSPC alone) in the current budget year up to the end of December.

That figure excludes what could be a large number of smaller contracts worth less than $25,000 — contracts the federal government can award without competition.

An inventory of those agreements is extremely difficult to track down, but PSPC acknowledged it awarded $146,522 in minor work to SNC-Lavalin in the current fiscal year.

The RCMP laid corruption charges against SNC-Lavalin and some of its units in February 2015. All the charges relate to the company's operations in Libya. The charges allege that the company offered officials in that country $47 million in bribes and accuse SNC-Lavalin and two of its subsidiaries of defrauding various Libyan public agencies of approximately $129.8 million over 10 years, starting in 2001.

The company has been at the centre of a political firestorm since early February, when The Globe and Mail reported that former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould felt pressured by the Prime Minister's Office to grant the company a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) — a legal tool which would have allowed the company to avoid a criminal trial by acknowledging fault and paying a fine, among other conditions.

In defending their interest in a DPA for SNC-Lavalin, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and others in his government have pointed to the scale of the engineering firm's business, the possibility it could be banned from federal government work and the number of people it employs.

Scott Newark, a former Crown prosecutor who teaches at Simon Fraser University, said it's been clear from the outset that avoiding the federal contract ban has been SNC-Lavalin's main objective.

The question of what would happen to those federal contracts should the company be convicted is a subject of debate, however.

There are policy provisions that allow federal officials to cancel existing contracts and ban future bids from a company convicted of serious crimes, such as bribery.

PSPC would only say the federal government would ""assess the situation"" if ""a supplier becomes ineligible during the life of a contract"" due to a conviction.

The power to terminate or suspend a contract rests with federal bureaucrats, according to PSPC's Ineligibility and Suspension Policy.

A company convicted of serious crimes can avoid being fired by the feds by signing an undertaking stating ""that it will conduct business with Canada in an ethical and responsible manner."" But there's never a guarantee that such an undertaking will be offered to a convicted company.

Just three companies are currently banned from carrying on business with the federal government — all relatively small firms in Ontario, Quebec and Newfoundland.

No ban on bidding during trial

A spokesman for DND said there's nothing stopping SNC-Lavalin from continuing to bid on federal contracts as they appear, even during its trial.

""These contracts were issued pursuant to Government of Canada contracting regulations, particularly as it concerns open, fair and transparent competitions,"" said Dan Le Bouthillier in an email. ""Those regulations also stipulate that any company eligible to bid on Government of Canada contracts may continue to do so, so long as they meet the necessary requirements for the work.""

In an analysis piece for the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, Newark said PSPC is working on a revision of its 'integrity regime' policy to give federal officials more discretion to waive bans of individual companies contracting with the federal government.

Public Services Minister Carla Qualtrough has said her department is looking at eliminating fixed bidding disqualification periods and replacing them with a wholly discretionary determination — which would include the option of imposing no contracting ban at all.

Even under the current system, Newark said, an order cancelling a company's federal contracts and banning it from future contracts following a conviction is far from a slam-dunk.

""I checked on the Criminal Code and the Corruption of Public Foreign Officials Act and, of course, it's not in those statutes. It's not a mandatory consequence."" he said.

The integrity regime review has been underway in Qualtrough's department since 2017. Newark said he's amazed that nobody with the company or the federal government seems to have realized that a conviction for SNC-Lavalin could lead to something other than a 10-year contracting ban.

""Why didn't anybody say, 'Hey wait a minute. We know what about this. We're changing our policy,'"" he said.

The head of procurement at DND attempted to reassure members of the all-party House of Commons defence committee during a hearing last month that SNC-Lavalin's ""secret"" work for the federal government does not pose an unacceptable risk.

""We hold the intellectual property, the drawings and everything,"" Pat Finn testified on Feb. 28.

Neil Bruce told The Canadian Press last Wednesday that if SNC-Lavalin is convicted of criminal charges and barred from bidding on federal contracts its workers would end up working for the Montreal-based company's foreign rivals.

""We have never put forward anything that is purely an economic argument about jobs and why we think we qualify for a DPA (deferred prosecution agreement),"" he said in an interview. ""We put forward an argument in terms of the public interest.""

The charges stem from allegations the engineering firm paid millions of dollars in bribes to win government business in Libya between 2001 and 2011.

In a statement posted to its website Monday afternoon, SNC-Lavalin says it never threatened the federal government.

""However, the company had made it very clear to the government through its advocacy campaign that the implementation of a remediation agreement — known as a deferred prosecution agreement — was the best way to protect and grow the almost 9,000 direct Canadian SNC-Lavalin jobs, as well as thousands of indirect jobs through its more than 5,000 suppliers across Canada. The company still asserts this position.""

It added that an agreement is not ""a get out of jail free card,"" as a few commentators have stated.

""It is an internationally recognized tool for protecting innocent stakeholders from the criminal actions of a few bad actors in a company.""

Chile copper mine cancels SNC contract

SNC said countries around the world have made this tool available to their prosecution and that Canada was at a competitive disadvantage until it passed its own version of the DPA.

""If the remediation agreement is not available to SNC-Lavalin, the company will continue to vigorously pursue a path that allows it to move forward and defend its innocent employees to the fullest as it moves forward through the Canadian court system.""

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has repeatedly held up potential job losses as the main reason he and other top officials spoke with former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould about her decision not to intervene after federal prosecutors declined to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement with SNC-Lavalin.

Wilson-Raybould, who resigned from cabinet last month, has suggested political considerations rather than jobs were behind the alleged pressuring by the Prime Minister's Office to hammer out an agreement with the company.

Earlier Monday, Chile's state-owned copper mining company said it has terminated its contract with SNC-Lavalin, accusing the construction giant of breaching its obligations.

Codelco said SNC-Lavalin failed to live up to its commitments under a $260-million US contract attached to one of the world's largest open pit copper mine, citing quality issues and delays in subcontractor payments and project execution.

The contract, awarded in November 2016, included engineering, supply and construction of two new acid plants for a smelter at the Chuquicamata mine in northern Chile.

The announcement from Codelco comes after SNC-Lavalin slashed its profit forecast twice in two weeks earlier this year, stemming largely from problems with the project and plunging SNC's share price to 10-year lows of around $34.

SNC-Lavalin announced last month it had agreed to settle a dispute with the Chilean state miner through a fast-tracked arbitration process, which it expected would yield ""significant recoveries in the future"" on losses of about $350 million.

The project cancellation ""likely means relations between the two companies have further soured"" and could make clawing back any losses more ""difficult"" during arbitration, analyst Derek Spronck of RBC Dominion Securities said in a research note.

Wilson-Raybould testified before the justice committee on Feb. 27, 2019.

Over the course of four hours, she laid out explosive allegations of a “consistent and sustained effort” by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his senior staff to inappropriately pressure her into agreeing to cut SNC-Lavalin a deal to avoid a criminal trial and potential conviction.

WATCH BELOW: Trudeau says he’s ‘changing’ processes in PMO after SNC-Lavalin affair

As attorney general, Wilson-Raybould was the only person who had the power to override the decision of the director of public prosecutions not to do so.

SNC-Lavalin is facing charges of corruption and fraud and could face a 10-year ban on bidding for lucrative government contracts if convicted.

The company lobbied heavily to get the Liberals to create a new legal tool called remediation or deferred prosecution agreement last year.

Such a deal would let a company admit wrongdoing and pay a fine but avoid a criminal trial.

WATCH BELOW: Scheer says Trudeau’s story on SNC-Lavalin has been ‘widely debunked’

However, SNC-Lavalin’s bid for such a deal was rejected and Wilson-Raybould told the justice committee she believes she was shuffled out of her portfolio specifically because she refused to intervene in that decision despite repeated attempts to pressure her to do so.

Several witnesses testified after Wilson-Raybould: among them, Gerald Butts.

READ MORE: Trudeau rejects Philpott’s warning that ‘there’s much more’ to the SNC-Lavalin affair Canadians must hear

Butts was Trudeau’s principal secretary and right-hand man up until he resigned over the allegations last month.

In his testimony, Butts argued no one in the matter did anything wrong and that Wilson-Raybould never told anyone there was any problem with the talks.

She told the committee she had made it clear on several occasions that the pressure needed to stop and that she had made up her mind.

But Liberals dominate the justice committee and used their majority to shut down the limited probe into the allegations last Tuesday.

Christopher Reynolds, The Canadian Press





MONTREAL -- SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. is leaving the door open to a lawsuit against Chile's state-owned copper mining company, which has terminated its contract with the construction giant.

""We have to see if legal actions will be taken,"" spokesman Nicolas Ryan said Tuesday. ""We're looking at all the options.""

On Monday, the Montreal-based engineering firm said it was ""appalled and surprised"" that state miner Codelco ended the US$260-million contract due to alleged quality issues and delays in subcontractor payments and project execution.

""We believe that this termination is unwarranted and in breach of good faith agreements reached by the parties,"" SNC-Lavalin said in a statement.

The contract, awarded in November 2016, included engineering, supply and construction of two new acid plants for a smelter at the Chuquicamata mine in northern Chile.

SNC-Lavalin said it is now demobilizing the job site and preparing dispute-resolution actions to recover some of the roughly C$350 million in losses, which the company blames on Codelco and subcontractors.

The announcement from Codelco comes after SNC-Lavalin slashed its profit forecast twice in two weeks earlier this year, stemming largely from problems with the project and plunging SNC's share price to 10-year lows of around $34.

It also arrives as the firestorm continues to rage around top government officials who allegedly pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to steer prosecutors toward a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin.

The would-be deal, also called a deferred prosecution agreement, would allow the company to avoid criminal proceedings on bribery and corruption charges linked to business dealings with Moammar Gadhafi's regime in Libya between 2001 and 2011.

On Monday, the company walked back a statement by its CEO, who said last week he never cited the protection of 9,000 Canadian jobs as a reason the construction giant should be granted a remediation agreement.

Neil Bruce told The Canadian Press last Wednesday that if SNC-Lavalin is convicted of criminal charges and barred from bidding on federal contracts its workers would end up working for the Montreal-based company's foreign rivals.

Analyst Yuri Lynk of Canaccord Genuity says investors should not expect any recovery on the mine project losses in 2019.

""Having a contract terminated by the world's largest copper miner is clearly a hit to SNC's reputation within the mining industry. It is extremely rare for a project sponsor to cancel a contract with an E&C company, especially so close to completion,"" Lynk said in a research note Tuesday.

""All told, this is a minor setback for the company,"" he added.

Members of the House of Commons ethics committee met Tuesday to consider an attempt by the opposition to hold a new investigation into the SNC-Lavalin matter and to call former attorney-general Jody Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott to testify.

Conservative and NDP MPs argued that the government tried to silence Ms. Wilson-Raybould when the Liberals on the House justice committee closed down its inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin affair last week.

But Liberal MPs on the ethics committee used their majority to defeat the bid by a vote of 6-3, putting an end to further House of Commons probes into attempts by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other top officials to shelve the fraud and bribery prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

The Conservatives and NDP on the ethics committee had requested the Prime Minister waive all cabinet confidentiality and solicitor-client privilege for the time period from when Ms. Wilson-Raybould was demoted to Veterans Affairs in early January to her subsequent resignation from cabinet in mid-February.

The waiver the federal cabinet approved last month lifted cabinet confidentiality and solicitor-client privilege for the conversations relating to SNC-Lavalin that took place while Ms. Wilson-Raybould was attorney-general but not the specifics of the criminal prosecution which remain confidential.

“Canadians deserve to know the whole truth,” Conservative MP Peter Kent told the ethics committee. “There remain many unanswered questions about the former attorney-general’s resignation from cabinet, the presentation she gave to cabinet after her resignation and the discussions she had after being replaced as attorney-general.”

Ms. Wilson-Raybould testified before the justice committee on Feb. 27 that she faced “constant and sustained” pressure from the Prime Minister and other top aides to override federal prosecutors and grant a deferred prosecution agreement for SNC-Lavalin. The B.C. Liberal MP has said she has more information to disclose and would like the Prime Minister to allow her to speak freely about the time from when she was shuffled out of the justice portfolio to her resignation from cabinet.

Ms. Philpott last week complained about “an attempt to shut down the story,” saying “there is still a substantial amount of her [Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s] story that’s not out there.”

The opposition parties on the ethics committee had been counting on Liberal MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, who earlier supported calls for a public inquiry into SNC-Lavalin, to join them in voting for an investigation by that committee.

However, Mr. Erskine-Smith said the opposition motion to call Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott before the committee was “premature.” He said the MPs should wait to see the further material that Ms. Wilson-Raybould provided to the justice committee on Tuesday. Her written submission still has to be translated into French.

Ms. Wilson-Raybould had earlier said that she had additional ""relevant facts and evidence” – documents that she said will support her version of what transpired between September and December, 2018, when she was attorney-general and justice minister.

Mr. Erskine-Smith noted that the waiver Mr. Trudeau gave Ms. Wilson-Raybould last month applies only to the justice committee.

“Frankly at this time, justice is seized with it, the waiver applies and there are more documents forthcoming to justice. It seems like we’re getting a little bit ahead of ourselves at this committee,"" he said.

He also noted the matter is being investigated by Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion.

NDP MP Tracey Ramsey told the ethics committee the Liberals were “trying to silence” Ms. Wilson-Raybould as well as Ms. Philpott, who resigned in early March, saying she had lost confidence in how the Prime Minister had handled the SNC-Lavalin matter.

“At the heart of this is extensive lobbying from SNC to influence the Prime Minister ... to intervene and go to the former attorney-general to pressure her to change her mind,” Ms. Ramsey said.

She added that there is no possibility that the justice committee will revisit its investigation. “There have been multiple attempts to bring it back to the justice committee, but it has been downed by [Liberal] members of the justice committee,” she said.

“The cover-up continues,” Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre told reporters after the vote. “The Prime Minister clearly has something to hide. … If Trudeau wants the truth to come out, he’ll let people appear before committee to tell the truth.”

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh joined his MPs after the committee hearing, reiterating his party’s call for an independent public inquiry.

“The ethics committee shut down any slim hopes that Canadians had that we would be able to get to the truth about this scandal,” he said.

Outside the committee, Mr. Erskine-Smith told reporters that if Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott have additional evidence to provide, regardless of time period, they should be allowed to bring it forward.

“My view is that if we’re getting at the truth, if there’s any evidence outside that time period that is relevant to the questions at issue, then it should be permitted,” he said, noting that issue was not before committee on Tuesday.

On Monday, the Prime Minister told reporters there was no need to grant another waiver to Ms. Wilson-Raybould, saying the justice committee had a “full airing” of the matter.

The issue has dominated Parliament since The Globe and Mail reported on Feb. 7 that the Prime Minister’s Office pressed the then-attorney-general to negotiate a settlement without trial for SNC-Lavalin.

In the fallout, Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott resigned from their cabinet positions and Mr. Trudeau’s close friend and principal secretary, Gerald Butts, stepped down. On March 18, former clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick retired, saying he had lost the “trust and respect"" of the opposition parties over his role in the SNC-Lavalin case.

One option that remains open to Ms. Wilson-Raybould is to raise a question of personal privilege in the House of Commons to speak freely about what transpired after the cabinet shuffle. She would be covered by parliamentary immunity and could not be sanctioned for violating cabinet confidentiality and solicitor-client privilege. However, it would be up to the Speaker whether to allow her to speak and he could limit the time to 20 minutes.

“We know that those are not practical suggestions given the time limitation generally imposed by the Speaker. The ethics committee would have been a safe and a civil place for her to speak,” Mr. Kent told the committee.",Liberal-dominated ethics committee shuts down opposition attempt for new SNC-Lavalin inquiry,The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-liberal-dominated-ethics-committee-shuts-down-opposition-attempt-for/

These additional documents include a new written statement, as well as copies of emails and text ...","OTTAWA – New and supplementary evidence from former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould regarding the SNC-Lavalin scandal is set to be made public Friday.

These additional documents include a new written statement, as well as copies of emails and text messages currently in the hands of the House Justice Committee that had been studying the SNC-Lavalin affair.

The Liberal MP is providing this evidence to further bolster the testimony she gave to the committee on Feb. 27. In that testimony Wilson-Raybould detailed what she considered to be high-level ""veiled threats"" and political interference in an effort to have her instruct federal prosecutors to drop the criminal prosecution of the Quebec construction and engineering giant and pursue a remediation agreement instead.

""For a period of approximately four months, between September and December of 2018, I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role of Attorney General of Canada, in an inappropriate effort to secure a prosecution agreement with SNC-Lavalin,"" she testified.

Wilson-Raybould said she was consistently reminded of the potential political implications in Quebec, should SNC-Lavalin be found guilty in the case and therefore possibly no longer be able to apply for federal contracts, leading to the company moving out of Canada.

She offered an in-depth account of approximately 20 exchanges --10 phone calls and 10 meetings -- specifically on the SNC-Lavalin case while she was still attorney general and justice minister. She also worked through a chronology of communications, ranging from in-person meetings and phone calls, to text messages and emails, from 11 senior staffers from the Prime Minister's Office, Privy Council Office and the finance minister's office.

Since her testimony, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has faced calls to resign, the House of Commons agenda has been largely usurped by opposition-prompted procedural moves, and several other high-profile officials have resigned amid insistence that nothing improper occurred.

The opposition wanted to invite Wilson-Raybould back to testify again -- something she was open to -- but Liberal MPs on the House Justice Committee shut down the study saying that they’d heard all they needed to.

The evidence is expected to include physical copies of texts and emails she referenced during her initial testimony, as well as her rebuttal to the contradicting stories that others have offered since her appearance a month ago.

""I also have relevant facts and evidence in my possession that further clarify statements I made and elucidate the accuracy and nature of statements by witnesses in testimony that came after my Committee appearance,"" Wilson-Raybould wrote in her letter informing the committee that she’d be offering up more information.

Throughout her testimony, she cautioned there were limitations in her ability to speak broadly about the case because of the specifics of the waiver of solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence that Trudeau had issued. Whatever she has handed over to the committee is expected to stay within the lines of what is permitted in the waiver, which includes any relevant information related to the case against SNC-Lavalin over her years-long tenure as attorney general.

Chair of the committee Anthony Housefather has said that the evidence will be made public at 3 p.m. on Friday, after it is translated and redacted for any personal information, like phone numbers or private email addresses.

In advance of this new evidence, here's CTVNews.ca's summary of the key aspects of what Wilson-Raybould said during her hours-long Feb. 27 testimony, and subsequent counter testimonies or statements that offer the government’s perspective on these interactions or situations.

On an external review of the decision

Wilson-Raybould said she took issue with government officials suggesting that she should seek an external review by a legal expert to weigh in on whether or not the government should pursue a deferred prosecution agreement in the SNC-Lavalin case. She alleged that senior officials told her they would provide cover for her, such as favorable op-eds from friendly legal voices, if she went ahead with it.

Gerald Butts, the former principal secretary in the Prime Minister’s Office, defended the idea of an external review during his two-hour follow-up testimony, saying that it would have been appropriate because it would have been the first time ever an agreement of this type was pursued in Canada.

""We felt that outside advice was appropriate because of the extraordinary consequences of a conviction. The fact that the company involved employs so many people across the country heightened the public importance of the matter,"" Butts said.

When she had made up her mind

Wilson-Raybould said that ""everyone was fully aware that I had made my decision,"" including the prime minister, in the fall.

""I told Trudeau that I had done my due diligence and made up my mind on SNC and that I was not going to interfere with the decision of the DPP,"" she said.

She also said that she had told Butts during a December meeting at the Chateau Laurier that she ""needed everyone to stop talking to me about SNC as I had made up my mind and the engagements were inappropriate.""

Butts disputed this version of events during his March 6 testimony.

""I learned for the first time while watching the former attorney-general's testimony that she had made a final decision on the 16th of September. My understanding is that nobody in the PMO or PCO knew that at the time either.""

He also said as far as he was aware she had not communicated to anyone that the pressure was improper.

More broadly, Butts also stated: ""We did what any responsible government would, of any political stripe. We worked as hard as we could, strictly within the laws and conventions of the country, to protect thousands and thousands of Canadian jobs... I am firmly convinced that nothing happened here beyond the normal operations of government.""

Text exchange, meeting with chief-of-staff

Speaking about a text conversation she had with her then-chief of staff Jessica Prince about a meeting Prince had with Butts and Trudeau's Chief of Staff Katie Telford, Wilson-Raybould quoted her staffer as telling her that Butts had allegedly said: ""Jess, there is no solution here that doesn't involve some interference.""

She said this exchange came after Prince was ""urgently summoned"" to meet with the pair.

Butts disputed this characterization, saying that ""there was no urgency to attend that meeting. … In any case, it was a brief meeting between staff, the kind which happens dozens of times a day, every day on Parliament Hill.""

He also said that the recounting of the exchange with Prince was taken out of context and that he had a ""very different recollection of that meeting.""

PM references being MP from Papineau

During one conversation she had with the prime minister, Wilson-Raybould said she looked him ""in the eye"" and directly asked if he was politically interfering in her role, after he allegedly referenced being the MP for Papineau, Que.

""The prime minister said, 'No, no, no, we just need to find a solution,'"" Wilson-Raybould said.

At a press conference 20 days later, Trudeau said that he did mention that he was the MP from Papineau, but that ""it is our job as Parliamentarians to defend the interests of the communities we were elected to represent, to be the voice of those communities in Ottawa.""

Morneau staffer's alleged involvement

In another exchange, Wilson-Raybould named Ben Chin, who is Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s chief of staff. She said that he spoke with Prince to say that extending a deferred prosecution agreement to SNC-Lavalin needed to happen out of fear the company would relocate.

""In my view, these events constituted pressure,"" she told the committee.

Morneau later defended his staff, saying they acted entirely appropriately and out of interest of jobs.

""My staff, appropriately, would make her staff aware of the economic consequences of decisions,"" Morneau said. ""I can't speak to her views, she has her opinion.""

'Veiled threats' from PCO clerk?

Wilson-Raybould referred to more ""veiled threats"" that came around Dec. 18 and 19, when she had a phone call with Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick in which he sought to know whether her thinking had changed about pursuing a deferred prosecution agreement.

She alleges that Wernick told her: ""I think he is gonna find a way to get it done one way or another. So, he is in that kinda mood and I wanted you to be aware of that.""

In his second appearance before the House Justice Committee, Wernick denied ever making any threats in relation to Wilson-Raybould's handling of the criminal case.

""The minister experienced lawful advocacy to consider doing something lawful in the public interest. I made no threats, veiled or otherwise, that the minister's decision would lead to consequences for her…It is my contention the minister was doing her job and I was doing mine,"" Wernick said.

On her leaving cabinet

Wilson-Raybould told the committee that she believes she was shuffled out of her role as justice minister and attorney general because of her refusal to change her mind about the case, something she says Trudeau denied when she floated that view.

She also alleged that days before the January cabinet shuffle, Wernick called her former deputy minister and said that one of the first conversations the new justice minister -- later named as Quebec MP David Lametti -- would be having in his new role was on the SNC-Lavalin file. Wilson-Raybould said that if he had gone through with a remediation agreement early in his mandate, she would have resigned from cabinet at that point.

In contrast, Butts offered a different narrative around the January shuffle.

""Neither her move from justice nor minister Lametti's move into it had anything whatsoever to do with SNC-Lavalin. So the plan was a simple one. Philpott to Treasury Board, Wilson-Raybould to Indigenous Services. … Then minister Wilson-Raybould did something I didn't expect. I had never seen anyone do it before, in many shuffles, over many years. The former Attorney-General turned down a Cabinet portfolio.""

Butts said that she couldn’t take the Indigenous services portfolio because she was opposed to the Indian Act, which ultimately prompted her being moved to veterans affairs instead.

394,,2019-03-27T12:30:00.0000000Z,Democracy can’t survive when equality before the law becomes a cynical joke Andrew Scheer contributed significantly to Canadian political life by saying recently that the SNC-Lavalin affair isn’t just about choosing between Justin Trudeau and Scheer.,"Andrew Scheer contributed significantly to Canadian political life by saying recently that the SNC-Lavalin affair isn’t just about choosing between Justin Trudeau and Scheer.

The Conservative leader did further good by making clear that the SNC-Lavalin mess isn’t even just about an abstraction called the rule of law. It is, he spelled out for those at the annual Manning Networking Conference in Ottawa, about protecting the very concrete, very practical division of responsibilities that comprise our legal system.

In our system, the official Opposition leader reminded, we don’t tolerate political pressure on the police during the investigative phase of potential wrongdoing. Nor would we ever countenance such intrusion, overt or subtle, on a judge weighing evidence to make a ruling. Crown prosecutors must be fiercely protected from external actors as they decide whether to proceed with charges and trial.

The very need for a key parliamentary figure such as Scheer to go back to basics in front of a crowd of case-hardened political obsessives demonstrates the importance of his contribution. Indeed, it almost makes up for his own misstep earlier this year when he demanded, wildly prematurely, Prime Minister Trudeau’s resignation as the scandal gathered steam.

Scheer’s early maladroitness risked diverting SNC-Lavalin into yet another humdrum story of opposition parties seeking electoral advantage by whooping about alleged government malfeasance. We’ve wavered in that direction numerous times since.

Scheer’s recent comments, then, can be taken as recognition that he, too, must be part of the effort to keep rigorous focus on what truly matters in the scandal.

What matters is the profound threat of institutional damage if those who work within the component elements of our legal system begin to feel hot, sour political breath upon their necks.

What matters is that it won’t matter one whit who the prime minister is if we lessen by an iota our vigilance in protecting them.

What matters is that democracy can’t survive when equality before the law becomes a cynical joke, which is what the SNC-Lavalin affair portended.

It’s here that Scheer’s weekend comments substantially clarify and edify. Even factoring out partisan rhetoric, Canadians have come to discuss SNC-Lavalin as very much a contest between former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould and various players in the prime minister’s office, up to and including the PM.

Indeed, a staple of the Liberal defence has been that it was all just an intra-office personality-driven misunderstanding.

Such a way of telling the tale obscures the crucial detail that the initial decision to proceed to trial was not Wilson-Raybould’s to make. Further, I haven’t heard anything to make credible the idea that she took an activist role in pushing for prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

What she did, based on her testimony to the justice committee, was support the judgment of the director of federal prosecutions. What she did, from everything I’ve heard, is affirm that nothing she saw in the discernment process led her to overrule the decision of a highly-qualified Crown prosecutor.

It’s a distinction that makes a massive difference to the way we’ve come to understand and talk about the scandal. It kicks the props, for example, out of the argument that Wilson-Raybould could, under the legislation allowing for deferred prosecution agreements, have intervened. Yes, she could have. But nothing in front of her justified, in her mind, taking the active step of setting aside the judgment of the individual responsible for judging the best way to take the case forward.

Entirely reasonably, she refused to let others interfere with her own best judgment. By so refusing, she precluded any interference cascading down through the legal system and undermining the best judgment of those who report to her.

Remember, after all, that the whole debate around the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin is whether the criminal charges facing the company should go before a trial judge.

Scheer’s significant contribution reminds all of us that the very process of how we arrive at legal judgment must be defended without fail. Such defence must always stand outside politics, regardless of the prime minister’s name.

Neil Bruce told The Canadian Press last Wednesday that if SNC-Lavalin is convicted of criminal charges and barred from bidding on federal contracts its workers would end up working for the Montreal-based company’s foreign rivals.

“We have never put forward anything that is purely an economic argument about jobs and why we think we qualify for a DPA (deferred prosecution agreement),” he said in an interview. “We put forward an argument in terms of the public interest.”

The charges stem from allegations the engineering firm paid millions of dollars in bribes to win government business in Libya between 2001 and 2011.

In a statement posted to its website Monday afternoon, SNC-Lavalin says it never threatened the federal government.

“However, the company had made it very clear to the government through its advocacy campaign that the implementation of a remediation agreement — known as a deferred prosecution agreement — was the best way to protect and grow the almost 9,000 direct Canadian SNC-Lavalin jobs, as well as thousands of indirect jobs through its more than 5,000 suppliers across Canada. The company still asserts this position.”

It added that an agreement is not “a get out of jail free card,” as a few commentators have stated.

“It is an internationally recognized tool for protecting innocent stakeholders from the criminal actions of a few bad actors in a company.”

SNC said countries around the world have made this tool available to their prosecution and that Canada was at a competitive disadvantage until it passed its own version of the DPA.

“If the remediation agreement is not available to SNC-Lavalin, the company will continue to vigorously pursue a path that allows it to move forward and defend its innocent employees to the fullest as it moves forward through the Canadian court system.”

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has repeatedly held up potential job losses as the main reason he and other top officials spoke with former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould about her decision not to intervene after federal prosecutors declined to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement with SNC-Lavalin.

Wilson-Raybould, who resigned from cabinet last month, has suggested political considerations rather than jobs were behind the alleged pressuring by the Prime Minister’s Office to hammer out an agreement with the company.

Earlier Monday, Chile’s state-owned copper mining company said it has terminated its contract with SNC-Lavalin, accusing the construction giant of breaching its obligations.

We have never put forward anything that is purely an economic argument about jobs

Codelco said SNC-Lavalin failed to live up to its commitments under a US$260-million contract attached to one of the world’s largest open pit copper mine, citing quality issues and delays in subcontractor payments and project execution.

The contract, awarded in November 2016, included engineering, supply and construction of two new acid plants for a smelter at the Chuquicamata mine in northern Chile.

The announcement from Codelco comes after SNC-Lavalin slashed its profit forecast twice in two weeks earlier this year, stemming largely from problems with the project and plunging SNC’s share price to 10-year lows of around $34.

SNC-Lavalin announced last month it had agreed to settle a dispute with the Chilean state miner through a fast-tracked arbitration process, which it expected would yield “significant recoveries in the future” on losses of about $350 million.

The project cancellation “likely means relations between the two companies have further soured” and could make clawing back any losses more “difficult” during arbitration, analyst Derek Spronck of RBC Dominion Securities said in a research note.

396,Business,2019-03-28T19:12:00.0000000Z,"As the political furor over whether SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. received special treatment from the Prime Minister dominates national headlines, the Montreal engineering and construction company has been suffering through its own, separate business drama ...","As the political furor over whether SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. received special treatment from the Prime Minister dominates national headlines, the Montreal engineering and construction company has been suffering through its own, separate business drama — reshuffling much of its executive lineup this year in the face of losses and mishaps.

On Thursday, the Montreal-based engineering company announced an official restructuring of its business, and made three leadership changes adding to earlier turnover in its ranks.

The company framed the changes as an attempt to “de-risk” its business by consolidating certain business segments. It follows several damaging mishaps, including the loss of a $350-million contract in Chile earlier this month, and a cloud that moved over its oil and gas business particularly in Saudi Arabia, both of which led to major writedowns and earnings revisions.

“This new organizational structure will position us for further improving project delivery, driving sustainable growth and more consistent cash flow generation,” Neil Bruce, chief executive of SNC, said in a press release.

The company has twice slashed its profit forecasts this year and last month it reported a $1.6-billion loss for the fourth quarter. That prompted Standard & Poor’s Ratings agency to downgrade its credit from BBB to BBB minus, the lowest investment grade rating for its bonds to still be eligible for bank investment.

Part of its losses flowed from a dispute with the Chilean-run copper producer Codelco.

In January, Bruce said he was “deeply disappointed” in his mining team for cost overruns on the project, and the company’s chief financial officer said it would result in hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. Earlier this week, SNC confimed it had been fired from a $350-million contract to build acid plants for Codelco, and walked back claims that it hoped to resolve that dispute on an accelerated time frame.

That project was an engineering, procurement and construction contract, in which SNC agreed to design and build the project at a set price. Such contracts are higher risk as the company is responsible for cost overruns.

As part of the restructuring, SNC announced a new “project oversight” position to “foresee and fix project-related issues in a timely fashion,” that will report directly to Bruce.

He has stressed to investors that there won’t be any future debacles similar to what happened with Codelco on its outstanding EPC contracts.

“We have gone through 20 of our top contracts,” Bruce said during the last earnings call in February. “In terms of the work we do in this arena … we’ve done all the checks again to make sure that what we approved is what we signed and that they are on track and we don’t have anything of any similar nature whatsoever.”

This new organizational structure will position us for further improving project delivery, driving sustainable growth and more consistent cash flow generation SNC CEO Neil Bruce

Per its restructuring on Thursday, the company is focusing on four core segments including nuclear, infrastructure, resources and lastly, engineering, design and project management, or EDPM.

It will also have a technology business, which includes clean power and cybersecurity, and its capital business, meaning six discrete units down from seven.

SNC also announced new people to lead its EDPM, capital and resources segments — the last of which combines the old mining with the oil and gas segment.

This follows the appointment of a new chief operating officer Ian Edwards in January, a replacement named to succeed him as head of infrastructure, and the planned exit of its former head of the oil and gas business unit this summer.

Meanwhile, in Ottawa, the company has faced heightened scrutiny after former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould testified earlier this month that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s administration pressured her to reach a settlement with SNC on longstanding criminal charges that it bribed Libyan government officials.

The entire situation has lead to growing speculation about whether SNC may seek to break up some of its business, and sell certain units. Market reaction to the latest news was tepid, with the price barely moving from around $34.

Speaking in Penticton, B.C., on Tuesday, Liberal MP Carla Qualtrough responded to questions about Trudeau and the ongoing SNC-Lavalin scandal. Qualtrough, from Delta, was in the Okanagan to discuss the federal Liberal budget at a local college.

“Well, I think the prime minister can and has weathered it quite well,” Qualtrough said of Trudeau and the ongoing SNC-Lavalin issue. “He was very honest with Canadians when he said that there was a fundamental breakdown in the trust — and communication, quite frankly — between himself and a couple of cabinet ministers.

“Putting it into perspective, we’re going to weather this, we’re going to come out stronger. We’re all rallying behind the prime minister because we believe in him. I have the luxury of sitting next to him in the House of Commons. I speak with him every day. He’s a good man, he’s a man of integrity,” Qualtrough added.

“He kind of admitted that he wished he would have done things differently, and we’re moving on.”

Asked by Global News if it was challenging to promote the budget with the SNC-Lavalin scandal hanging over the Liberals’ heads, Qualtrough said no.

“I don’t think so,” she said. “It’s such a great budget, and there’s something in it for everyone. It’s why we’re here in Penticton. But it’s certainly a distraction.”

Asked if MPs Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott were staging a coup of sorts against Trudeau because of the scandal, Qualtrough said: “That’s not the case at all.”

“I think what you see is a breakdown of trust in communication between the prime minister and a couple of our cabinet (ministers),” said Qualtrough.

“But I think our cabinet is strong. I think the prime minister will kind of ably lead us into the election and I think you’ll see another Liberal government for another four years.”

In his latest piece, “SNC-Lavalin would be wise to emulate Maple Leaf Food,” Alan Freeman uses a quote from SNC-Lavalin’s president and CEO, Neil Bruce, out of context. Since he is using this quote as a basis for his argument, it is important to clarify the context in which the quote was made.

Mr. Bruce did say during the company’s quarterly-earnings conference call with financial analysts on Feb. 22: “First, I want to categorically say that we have done nothing wrong as a company and none of our current employees have done anything wrong. (…) Our innocent employees are being used as a puck in a political hockey game and, frankly, they don’t deserve it and we’ve had enough.”

This quote was used in reference to the current political situation in Ottawa, which has been widely commented on by the media in Canada and abroad. It is a fact that SNC-Lavalin and its employees did nothing wrong as a company in the current political situation. Mr. Bruce’s quote had nothing to do with the current criminal charges as Mr. Freeman is suggesting.

Furthermore, Mr. Freeman says of SNC-Lavalin that its “consistent policy of not apologizing and blaming its problems on long-departed rogue employees is unlikely to ever win SNC-Lavalin any awards for smart reputation management.”

However, in an open letter on Oct. 19, 2018, published in major newspapers across Canada, and on snclavalin.com, Mr. Bruce did apologize on his behalf and on behalf of the company. He wrote: “The truth is, the events prior to 2012 that led to the federal charges should have never taken place. They did, however, result in fundamental cultural, governance, and leadership changes. The management team at SNC-Lavalin is entirely new, and I apologize to all for the shortcomings during that period.”

He reiterated again his apology on behalf of the company in a second open letter on Oct. 26, 2018, where he also stated: “we don’t want the past to be forgotten; we do want to move forward.”

It is important to point out that the alleged transgressions (or crises) that Mr. Bruce has been dealing with did not happen during his tenure, nor indeed the tenure of the previous CEO, Bob Card, and the leadership team has changed entirely since 2012. The transgressions in question are firmly in the past, the responsibility of previous leadership.

Mr. Freeman may not recall, but Mr. Bruce joined SNC-Lavalin in 2013, after the alleged briberies occurred. He was named president and CEO on Oct. 5, 2015, after the charges were filed. Under his lead, and Bob Card before him, SNC-Lavalin worked tirelessly to remediate itself while taking responsibility for others’ actions.

Furthermore, Mr. Bruce continues to actively speak about integrity and anti-corruption matters in his capacity as co-chair of PACI, the World Economic Forum’s anticorruption initiative, and at national conferences like the 2018 National Corporate Ethics and Integrity Summit in Ottawa where, in fact, he spoke alongside Michael H. McCain, president and CEO of Maple Leaf Foods Inc.

While we acknowledge and appreciate Mr. Freeman recognizing the complete turnaround in the leadership team and board of directors, it is false to claim, as he says, that the company refuses to admit it ever did anything wrong.

The most important principles of integrity and ethics are to come forward, to self-report, to be transparent and to co-operate with authorities, to try to get to the bottom of what happened. This is precisely what Mr. Bruce, his management team, the board of directors, with the support of all his employees around the world, have been trying to do for a number of years.

Mr. Freeman should be well placed to understand that SNC-Lavalin is currently facing criminal charges laid by the Public Prosecution Service of Canada and the impact this has on the company’s ability to commentate fully. After being denied a remediation agreement for now, SNC-Lavalin intends to defend itself vigorously before the court, in the best interest of its 52,000 employees, shareholders, pensioners, suppliers and business partners.

399,Business,2019-03-27T03:47:00.0000000Z,MONTREAL — SNC-Lavalin Group’s chief executive said on Friday the company is looking at ways to protect its business in the event it loses a corruption trial that has created a political ...,"MONTREAL — SNC-Lavalin Group’s chief executive said on Friday the company is looking at ways to protect its business in the event it loses a corruption trial that has created a political crisis for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

An SNC-Lavalin board subcommittee is weighing the construction and engineering company’s options as it takes “steps to minimize the effect of any potential sort of bad outcome in a few years’ time,” chief executive Neil Bruce told Reuters in an interview.

Trudeau has been on the defensive since Feb. 7 over allegations that top officials working for him leaned on former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould last year to ensure that the construction company avoided a corruption trial. Trudeau has denied the allegations.

At the affair’s centre is a request by SNC-Lavalin for a remediation agreement that would have enabled it to avoid a court case which, if lost, would block it from federal government contracts for a decade. SNC-Lavalin is facing fraud and corruption charges related to allegations that former executives paid bribes to win contracts in Libya under Muammar Gaddafi’s regime, which fell in 2011.

Bruce said SNC is now focused on defending itself in court, with little expectation that a remediation would become available. Any court decision would likely be years away.

“We don’t want to be reacting too late or not early enough if the worst came to the worst,” he said. “We’ve got to be prudent and make sure that we position the company.”

Being blocked from federal contracts would raise the threat of job cuts among the company’s Canadian workforce of 9,000.

“If we were in a position where for whatever reason we couldn’t do work with a certain customer or in a certain country then we would plan all of that and make sure that our business development efforts and the work we were chasing and hopefully winning didn’t fall into that category. That’s part of the mitigation plan.”

Trudeau has often referred to the 9,000 potential job losses as a reason for helping the company, but Bruce told the CBC earlier this week that he never gave a specific number.

SNC wanted to take advantage of new legislation to pay a large fine rather than be prosecuted.

Bruce said the political issue engulfing the Liberals has “very little to do” with the Montreal-based company whose backlog of about $15 billion (US$11.17 billion) is expected to rise during the first quarter.

But politics impacted SNC’s ability to win new work in Saudi Arabia in December and January, amid tense relations between Riyadh and Ottawa. Saudi Arabia froze new trade with Ottawa in August after Canada demanded the release of jailed rights activists.

“Generally we would expect to win sometimes one in two, sometimes one in three,” he said. “And that actually went down to zero in a couple of areas.”

While the dispute has not impacted current contracts underway in Saudi Arabia, Bruce said SNC’s backlog in the country would taper off toward the end of the year if it didn’t win any new contracts in 2019.

The CEO also said an accelerated arbitration process around a delayed Chile project, which hit results from its mining unit in the fourth quarter, would likely not be resolved in 2019.

Normand Béchard was working for Hydro-Québec in James Bay, looking for a new challenge, for maybe one last big project. He decided to make a change, ending up on Nalcor Energy’s Muskrat Falls project.

He was asked to take a month off before starting work with SNC-Lavalin in early 2011, to avoid conflicts. But by July, he was with SNC-Lavalin and had moved to Newfoundland and Labrador, starting work in St. John’s. He was the project manager for SNC.

SNC-Lavalin had been brought in as an engineering, procurement and construction management (EPCM) contractor by Nalcor Energy. As previously reported, that contractual relationship changed in 2012, after SNC had submitted an estimate for the bulk of the project and for its planned EPCM services, in December 2011.

Béchard said the professional relationship between owner and contractor never started as a positive one, and personal grievances stacked up at the Torbay Road office.

“They didn’t let me explain very much. They were just so frustrated,” he said of Nalcor’s project team.

He was specifically describing the period after the estimate numbers were submitted.

He said Nalcor Energy general project manager Ron Power told him an engineering student could have done a better job.

Béchard told Commissioner Richard LeBlanc he didn’t take any of it to heart, knowing Power was frustrated at the time.

“They didn’t let me explain very much. They were just so frustrated."" — Normand Béchard

(Power is scheduled to be called to the stand May 13).

Béchard spent most of Tuesday morning describing clashes between Nalcor and SNC staff. He referred to shouting in conference rooms, micromanaging and a lack of respect for non-Nalcor personnel.

Like others, he said he had started with the expectation of a certain level of authority in his position, as conveyed by SNC-Lavalin, only to have that diminished as SNC-Lavalin’s role on the project was changed in 2012.

“I decided I would not fight. I would make myself available in a collaborative way,” he said of his response.

But he also said there was finger pointing at meetings after staff disputes or whenever things didn’t go as expected, with blame falling to SNC’s people.

“It was stressful,” he said.

He criticized a lack of hydroelectric project experience in Nalcor Energy’s management team.

Béchard left the project in 2014. He is now semi-retired, but undertakes some business coaching.

On the subject of early budgeting on a hydro megaproject, Béchard referred to past work with Hydro-Québec. He said a good rule of thumb is to develop a list and sum of all of the project’s direct costs (known costs, including materials and work hours). The total estimate for the project should be about double that amount, he said. That way you’re covering all “soft costs,” including contingencies.

In other words, a $5-billion base capital cost would be roughly a $10-billion project to complete.

“It was stressful."" — Béchard

He said the Muskrat Falls project had “very low contingency.” He said it also opted for larger bid packages, something that will shift some additional management cost onto contractors, but also risks greater difficulty in replacing contractors if needed.

Asked about the 2013 SNC-Lavalin risk assessment report, where contract package size was a recorded risk, he said former Nalcor Energy president and CEO Ed Martin had an opportunity to see the report. At the same time, Béchard was not in the relevant meeting with former SNC-Lavalin CEO Robert Card where it would have happened.

Béchard said his impression, from meetings he was a party to, was Nalcor project manager Paul Harrington did not see the details. Béchard said he believes Nalcor’s former deputy project manager Jason Kean similarly did not read the report.

Béchard said it was an internal SNC-Lavalin document. He did not convey any of the detail himself, considering it the role of the executive.

He said his understanding was the report was kept within SNC-Lavalin and did not come to light after the few, original meetings with project team members until 2016, when it was requested from SNC-Lavalin by then-Nalcor Energy CEO Stan Marshall. Marshall passed the report to Premier Dwight Ball.

Béchard is set to continue on the stand on Wednesday.

State-owned Chilean copper miner Codelco has torn up its US$260-million contract with Canadian engineering and logistics firm SNC-Lavalin (TSX:SNC,OTC Pink:SNCAF), accusing the company of “serious, repeated and evident breaches” in works at the Chuquicamata mine.

In a release on Monday (March 25), Codelco said it is terminating the agreement it signed with SNC-Lavalin in 2016 for upgrades to be carried out at Chuquicamata’s smelting facilities, though the Canadian company has been working at the mine since 2012.

“Among the non-compliances, are the delay in payments to its subcontractors, delays in the execution of the project and problems in the quality of the works, among others,” said Codelco in its release.

Access Report

The Chilean government had previously noted that SNC-Lavalin’s “problems at an international level” had delayed works.

SNC-Lavalin confirmed that Codelco has ended the agreement, saying that it is “appalled and surprised” by the decision.

Its surprise, said SNC-Lavalin, is because the two companies “had reached an agreement in good faith on February 1st, 2019 regarding the full completion of the project and a process for a fast track dispute resolution of previously announced unresolved issues through accelerated arbitration.”

The termination will, as a result, put the project’s completion at risk, warned the Canadian company, which threw blame back on the state miner.

“It should be noted that Codelco has reached this decision after SNC-Lavalin openly informed Codelco of the status of the execution of the works, as requested by Codelco, which showed delays caused by site conditions that were the responsibility of Codelco, and the poor and unjustified acts by the main construction subcontractors.”

Codelco also pointed to negotiations in February over issues at the plant, though its side of the story is that it had been attempting to fix any issues after having raised them with SNC-Lavalin.

Codelco said that it expects to have full control of upgrade works at the plant within the next two to three weeks, and it anticipates beginning commissioning of the acid plant by the end of April.

For its part, SNC-Lavalin said it will be packing up and going home, while “preparing the dispute resolution actions to recover as much as possible of the previously announced losses that are due directly to our client and to poor subcontractor performance.”

Shares in SNC-Lavalin on the TSX have been down by 4.51 percent since Codelco sent it packing, though for the Canadian company, problems at home have proven far more bruising, as its part in allegations of obstruction of justice swirling around Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have so far consumed its media profile.

Understanding what transpired between former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould and the Prime Minister’s Office has been, at the clearest of times, a process of two steps forward one step back. Monday was like trying to learn the cha-cha-cha and box step waltz at the same. In the dark.

Coming after a weekend when multiple Liberal MPs, all women, attacked Wilson-Raybould and former cabinet minister Jane Philpott for not using their parliamentary privilege to clear the air over the SNC-Lavalin controversy, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appeared to be in a mending-fences mood early in the day. When asked about the saga, he said he experienced a “cordial” conversation with Wilson-Raybould when they last spoke last week. “I look forward to continuing to engage with both Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott as they make their way forward,” he said in B.C. “They have both indicated they look forward to running again as Liberals in the next election and I look forward to continuing to have their strong and thoughtful voices as part of our team.” (Canadian Press)

Then two separate news reports emerged claiming that relations between Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould began to deteriorate in 2017 after she picked a conservative judge, Manitoba Justice Glenn D. Joyal, to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. The multiple sources who leaked the details claimed Trudeau opposed the appointment because he felt Joyal wasn’t committed to LGBTQ and abortion rights. In response, Wilson-Raybould denied there was any conflict, and pointed out in all-caps that communications about Supreme Court appointments are typically “CONFIDENTIAL … I do however find it extremely worrisome why you are even asking such questions and where you received any such information. Commentary / reporting in this regard with respect to a SCC appointment(s) could compromise the integrity of the appointments process and potentially sitting Justices.” (CTV News, Canadian Press)

The sources also claimed Trudeau overruled Wilson-Raybould to reject Joyal. Yet in a statement, Joyal said he withdrew his application for the Supreme Court position himself because of his wife’s metastatic breast cancer. “Regrettably, that detail was omitted from the now published media reports … I fear that someone is using my previous candidacy to the Supreme Court of Canada to further an agenda unrelated to the appointment process. That is wrong.” (Twitter)

Not okay: Legal scholars and lawyers wasted little time in expressing their outrage about the stories. “Joyal should *never* have been put in the position of responding publicly to the scurrilous stories published today,” tweeted UBC law prof Dr. Emma Cunliffe. Added constitutional scholar Emmett Macfarlane: “That anyone would leak this in an attempt to discredit Wilson-Raybould says a lot of troubling things.”

In other thoroughly-confusing narrative threads in the SNC-Lavalin story, the company at the centre of the controversy threw its own chief executive under the bus. Last week CEO Neil Bruce said he’d never raised fears about the loss of 9,000 Canadian SNC-Lavalin jobs in arguing for a deferred prosecution agreement that would allow it to avoid a criminal fraud and corruption trial. On Monday the company posted a “clarification statement” that it remembered things differently. While SNC-Lavalin “never threatened” Ottawa with the prospect of job losses, “the company had made it very clear to the government through its advocacy campaign that the implementation of a remediation agreement … was the best way to protect and grow the almost 9,000 direct Canadian SNC-Lavalin jobs… . The company still asserts this position.” (SNC-Lavalin)

For weeks senior Liberals have been at pains to explain where the 9,000 jobs figure came from. Now we know. Maybe.

Remember back in the day when the Wright-Duffy affair seemed confusing?

Ethically speaking: Later today the Liberal-dominated House of Commons ethics committee will decide whether to pick up where the Liberal-dominated justice committee left off when it decided not to pursue the SNC-Lavalin investigation any further. (Toronto Star)

It's the sound of another day of incremental developments in the SNC-Lavalin mess.

On Tuesday, the Liberals blocked an opposition attempt to hold another committee investigation into whether Jody Wilson-Raybould was subjected to unreasonable pressure to allow SNC-Lavalin to avoid criminal prosecution. Quelle surprise.

We also learned that Wilson-Raybould and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau locked horns before SNC-Lavalin. She wanted him to name a conservative Manitoba judge as chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. He disagreed. Asked about her disagreement with Trudeau, Wilson-Raybould said there was no problem, just the normal back and forth that happens inside government. Sound familiar?

Pundits and some media allege the story, reported by CTV and The Canadian Press, was leaked by the Prime Minister's Office. Could be. But those same pundits have no problem with the original story having been leaked to The Globe and Mail, allegedly by sources close to Wilson-Raybould. Apparently, not all leaked stories are created equal.

It was hard not to feel sympathy for Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, a politician visibly struggling to maintain principles despite being a Liberal MP on the Commons ethics committee during a vote on the SNC-Lavalin affair.

He was the one, among the six Liberal MPs on the committee, who had voted a month ago for a public inquiry, arguing for transparency. The vice-chair of the ethics committee, many suspected, might have a hard time voting to prevent former attorney-general Jody Wilson-Raybould from testifying. So on Tuesday, he was the chosen spokesman when the Liberals rejected it.

The other five Liberal MPs on the committee made it through Tuesday’s meeting without saying anything but the word “no” – twice each, when they voted.

Afterward, they left it up to poor Mr. Erskine-Smith to explain this embarrassing thing. Liberal MPs and ministers that spent the weekend saying Ms. Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott could walk into the House of Commons any time and say their piece – demanding they “put up or shut up.” Then Liberals on the ethics committee voted not to hear them.

Mr. Erskine-Smith’s main reason – the Liberals’ reason – for rejecting an opposition motion to call Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott to testify, by the way, was that it would be “premature,” because Ms. Wilson-Raybould still plans to send some written submissions to the justice committee.

That’s a pretty flimsy procedural rationalization. More on that later.

But it was almost painful to see the one Liberal MP on the committee willing to explain himself, Mr. Erskine-Smith, try to square the circle. He still asserted that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott should tell all of their story. And he disagreed with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on a key point.

Mr. Trudeau’s cabinet had issued a waiver releasing Ms. Wilson-Raybould from solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidentiality so she could testify before the justice committee about events that occurred when she was attorney-general. But Ms. Wilson-Raybould indicated she wants to speak about the period after she was shuffled out of that job on Jan. 14 and until she quit the cabinet on Feb. 12. Mr. Trudeau has refused to extend the waiver.

Mr. Erskine-Smith told reporters that the waiver should be extended.

Those five other Liberal MPs wouldn’t offer an opinion. Michel Picard, the MP for Montarville, said solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidentiality shouldn’t be taken lightly. Ottawa MP Mona Fortier shook her head and looked terrified. MPs Raj Saini, David de Burgh Graham and Stéphane Lauzon scurried away from the microphone.

At 34, Mr. Erskine-Smith is one of the younger Liberal MPs, but he has been willing to break ranks. He is a liberal Liberal, a lawyer with an Oxford education who was keen on legalizing cannabis and sympathetic to banning handguns, and also an idealist who has argued against rigid party lines.

No doubt he wanted to stick with his party this time. But it took a bit of rationalization.

He argued that since Ms. Wilson-Raybould intends to send further written submissions, including requested documents, to the Commons justice committee, the ethics committee should wait to see her submissions and how the justice committee responds.

In a run-of-the-mill case, that might make sense. But the justice committee has already been short-circuited by Mr. Erskine-Smith’s Liberal colleagues. They rejected a move to have Ms. Wilson-Raybould appear a second time, and voted to end their hearings. It’s absurd to wait for committee that has closed up shop.

Mr. Erskine-Smith also said Ms. Wilson-Raybould could not really testify before the ethics committee because the waiver of privilege issue by the government only applied to the justice committee. But of course, Liberal MPs could ask the PM to extend it.

And Mr. Erskine-Smith suggested the committee could ask Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion to testify about whether he has the mandate to properly investigate. But last month, Mr. Erskine-Smith expressed the view that he does not. To his credit, he didn’t dodge questions from reporters about that.

But in the end, it was another day when the Liberals seemed to be contradicting the thing they said a couple of days ago, or a couple of weeks ago. It’s spreading, too.

What those pages say, including the details of texts and e-mails, is a highly-anticipated secret in the nation’s capital.

When Wilson-Raybould appeared before the justice committee on Feb. 27, she discussed text messages and e-mails related to her testimony.

New Democrat MP Murray Rankin asked Wilson-Raybould to share the messages.

“I wonder if you could provide the committee with a copy of all the text messages and e-mails that you referred to in your testimony,” Rankin said.

Wilson-Raybould said at the time that she would take the matter “under advisement” and a month later handed over more than 40 pages of written testimony to the committee.

That testimony is now being translated from English into French so that it can be released to the public in both official languages.

Sources close to the committee say that likely won’t happen before Friday. The committee could decide to receive and release the report in English only however with such a detailed submission, that is unlikely to happen and would be a violation of committee norms.

Meanwhile, the Conservatives are asking a judicial watchdog to wrap the knuckles of the Liberal government.

Conservative MP and deputy leader Lisa Raitt has written to Marc Giroux, the commissioner for federal judicial affairs, to ask him to investigate a bizarre smear job by the Liberals on Monday.

The PMO leaked information to two separate media outlets at the same time that claimed Wilson-Raybould may have been removed from her post as attorney general not because she opposed a deal that would let SNC-Lavalin avoid prosecution on bribery and corruption charges but because she backed the wrong candidate for her Supreme Court pick.

Unnamed sources told reporters details about the application of Justice Glenn Joyal, the current chief justice of the Court of Queen’s Bench of Manitoba. The claim from government sources was that Joyal was rejected because Trudeau felt he would trample abortion and LGBT rights.

Joyal, a respected member of the bench, was forced to issue a statement saying that he withdrew his name because his wife was dealing with breast cancer at the time. In her letter to Giroux, Raitt says this political attack on the justice system must be looked at.

“A plain reading of the facts strongly suggests that political actors have leaked the content of discussions regarding an appointment to Canada’s highest judicial body,” Raitt said of Monday’s leak.

“If indeed this is true, it is an egregious case of political interference and one that severely injures the independence of the judiciary.”

Raitt stated in her letter that the SNC-Lavalin affair has raised serious questions about the rule of law in Canada and judicial independence amid claims that the prime minister’s office has sought to interfere in criminal prosecutions.

“In accordance with your duty to protect the independence of Canada’s judiciary, I urge you to immediately undertake an investigation of the disclosure of this confidential information and report to Canadians,” Raitt wrote.

Unfortunately, Giroux has said that the request is not within the mandate of his office and he cannot investigate.

On Tuesday, the battleground moved to the Commons ethics committee, which considered a Conservative motion to launch a study after the Liberal-dominated justice committee voted to conclude its investigation without calling more witnesses.

But the six Liberals on the ethics committee out-voted the Conservatives, who had two votes, and the NDP, who had one, and the motion failed.

Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre called the result especially ironic given recent comments from some Liberal MPs that it was time for Wilson-Raybould to just say her piece, rather than dribbling out news day-by-day. In the most prominent example, Liberal MP Judy Sgro said in a radio interview over the weekend that Wilson-Raybould needed to “either put up or shut up.”

“Today, the Liberals got together and voted against giving her the chance to say it,” Poilievre told reporters. “You know, this is a cavalcade of contradictions and cover-up.”

Parliament has been seized by the SNC-Lavalin affair for nearly two months now, after The Globe and Mail published an allegation on Feb. 7 that Wilson-Raybould had been politically pressured while attorney general to intervene and defer the corruption prosecution of the construction company.

Toronto MP Nate Erskine-Smith was the only Liberal who spoke during the ethics committee meeting. Although Erskine-Smith has a track record of challenging the party line, and had even previously cast a vote in favour of holding a public inquiry on the matter, he told the committee he felt launching the study was premature.

He noted Wilson-Raybould planned to provide a written submission to the justice committee that included further evidence, including text messages and emails.

“To me, it makes far more sense to see what is said in that public statement, to see how justice (committee) reacts to that, frankly, and whether they think any of that new information is something worth reconsidering their previous decision to close off their study,” Erskine-Smith said.

The NDP’s Tracey Ramsey rejected that, saying the Liberals blocked multiple attempts to keep the investigation going. “No one in Canada believes that the justice committee is going to revisit that,” she said. “There is absolutely no indication that they will entertain any further conversation.”

The Conservatives offered an amendment to call Wilson-Raybould only after her submission to the justice committee, but Erskine-Smith said it was too early to make decisions before seeing what she provided. It is not known when Wilson-Raybould will make her submission, but justice committee chair Anthony Housefather has said it will be made public.

Erskine-Smith also pointed out that Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion is already studying the matter, and said the committee should support Dion’s study rather than launch a parallel process.

Finally, Erskine-Smith argued that the waiver provided by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Wilson-Raybould on cabinet confidence privilege and solicitor-client privilege only covered testimony to the justice committee, not the ethics committee.

That waiver has become its own source of conflict, however. Wilson-Raybould has pointed out it does not apply to events after she was removed as justice minister, and opposition parties have demanded Trudeau provide an expanded waiver to cover that time period. Philpott also said in an interview in Maclean’s magazine last week that there was “much more to the story that should be told.”

This breach of the confidentiality of what is supposed to be a highly confidential judicial appointment process is serious enough to require an investigation on its own

After the meeting, while other Liberal MPs left without making their position clear, Erskine-Smith stayed and said he believed an expanded waiver may be necessary — depending what Wilson-Raybould’s evidence to the justice committee showed.

“If still, to get at the truth, there is additional information that Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott need to provide that they are unable to provide because of the confines of the existing waiver, then yes, to get at the truth there should be a broadening of that waiver,” he said.

He said he believed that was only a fair position, given the comments from some of his colleagues that “we should get all of this information out in the open as quickly as possible and deal with it and move on.”

Both the Conservatives and NDP — and even Erskine-Smith — condemned two stories that came out Monday that contained leaks about the Supreme Court of Canada appointment process. The stories cited confidential sources to allege that tension had arisen between Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould when she recommended the appointment of Glenn Joyal, a Manitoba judge who Trudeau felt to be too conservative.

“This breach of the confidentiality of what is supposed to be a highly confidential judicial appointment process is serious enough to require an investigation on its own,” said Conservative MP Peter Kent during the meeting.

Speaking earlier in the day, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau did not respond directly when asked by a reporter whether his office leaked the story.

“Canadians can have confidence in our government’s respect for the institutions, for the Supreme Court,” he said. “Canadians have confidence in the strength of our judiciary in this country. And I have no further comment to make on this issue.”

The document has undergone heavy revisions by city staff to remove the original motion’s numerous false assertions, including the highly erroneous idea that SkyTrain is a proprietary technology to SNC-Lavalin and Bombardier.

Those assertions were sharply rebuked by both TransLink and the BC Ministry of Transportation earlier this month.

NPA councillor Colleen Hardwick’s revised motion seeks to have city staff report back to council on the findings of a concurrent TransLink report being made to the Mayors’ Council this spring on any proprietary rights or bidding advantages SNC-Lavalin and Bombardier have for the coming Broadway Extension of the Millennium Line.

She requests that any further decisions by city council on the SkyTrain extension should consider a number of factors, including how SNC-Lavalin’s criminal charges for corruption and the World Bank’s audit of Bombardier for allegations of corruption could affect how SkyTrain is used for an extension to Arbutus Street and eventually UBC, even if the technology is not proprietary to either of the companies.

“A criminal conviction against SNC-Lavalin could result in them not being allowed to bid on either the phase 1 Millennium Line extension Broadway subway from VCC to Arbutus or the phase 2 extension from Arbutus to UBC,” wrote Hardwick.

In her motion, she asserts city council’s official approval earlier this year of a seamless SkyTrain extension between Arbutus Street and UBC was “rushed in consideration of potential funding in the federal budget,” although possible funding commitments are not anticipated until later in the year when the federal election nears.

While the original motion falsely described SkyTrain as a proprietary technology with technical patents owned by Bombardier and the engineering patents owned by SNC-Lavalin, the revised motion accurately explains SkyTrain is the name of Metro Vancouver’s backbone rail transit system.

“SkyTrain is TransLink’s name for the Vancouver region’s rail system which has two main types of technology, the Canada Line that is conventional and the Expo and Millennium Lines that are unconventional,” reads Hardwick’s revised motion.

“The unconventional Millennium Line technology would apply to the proposed extension to UBC, of which SNC Lavalin (track and electrics) and Bombardier (cars) partnered to build the SkyTrain Millennium Line.”

The provincial government owns the SkyTrain system and allocates the responsibility of operation and oversight to TransLink.

As it is the system’s owner, the provincial government is also leading the charge with overseeing the construction process of the Broadway Extension to Arbutus Street, just as it did for the Evergreen Extension earlier in the decade.

The procurement process for the $2.83-billion, six-km-long, six-station project was launched in February, and the deadline for the first stage of bidding — the request for qualifications (RFQ) — is due in April.

After the RFQ, up to three respondent teams will be selected to participate in the upcoming phase of the competitive selection process, which will involve the submission of a detailed design and plan for the request for proposal (RFP) stage.

The provincial government is aiming to select a contractor in April 2020 to allow for construction to begin later that year for a 2025 opening.

Trudeau government brought down a notch

Thank you, NOW Magazine, for Enzo DiMatteo's balanced and sane article on the SNC-Lavalin soap opera (NOW, March 7-13, 2019).

The Canadian media has whipped itself into an irrational frenzy over this supposed scandal.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his government are not corrupt: a tad unethical, maybe, and somewhat fraudulent, but they hardly meet the threshold of high crimes and misdemeanours that the hapless, silly opposition wants us to think they do.

Trudeau is not Donald Trump. Canadian democracy has worked. We pretty much know what happened – the virtuous Trudeau government has been deservedly brought down a notch and voters will make a decision on his governance in October.

Now it’s time for the media to move on to more important issues.

Scheer laughs

Thanks for reminding us of some of the, um, more egregious incidents in Andrew Scheer’s career. I have been watching him with amazement throughout the SNC-Lavalin affair as he declares the Conservative party’s principled opposition to giving any help to corporations when they fall afoul of the law. I had no idea!

Jody Wilson-Raybould for Prime Minister?

Jody Wilson-Raybould should be Prime Minister of Canada. She is a courageous and honest woman. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau seems to think that when a woman says no what she really means is “keep bothering me.”

Crystal meth reality check

Re Crystal Meth Myths (NOW, March 7-13). I have trouble understanding the argument of this article. Is it that the meth=death campaign is ineffective in getting people to stop using Tina, or that Tina is not that dangerous and that people can use it recreationally?

All drugs make a person feel wonderful – that is their function by definition. Some of them while making you feel wonderful are also highly addictive and extremely harmful, not only physically, but also psychologically.

I am the child of two gay men. One has overdosed on meth three times in the past three years. More to the point he has lost his mind and his life is in a seeming never-ending downward spiral. I have lost my father and am essentially waiting for him to die.

I am sure that he felt in control at first and that he could “manage” his use of Tina during sex. Right before he wasn’t in control and it began to destroy him.

Homeless deaths on council’s head

I am away for the winter and keeping in touch with home by reading about homeless people in Toronto. The mayor’s comments are sickening (NOW, February 14-20). Why does it take so long to find empty buildings – many owned by the bloody city of Toronto – to get people inside and give them a chance at life?

I am 80 years old, born and raised in Toronto and appalled and sickened by the homelessness problem. How could the city council have over their heads that they caused homeless men and women to die because they are not taking this seriously?

A different side of poverty

Regarding NOW’s recent articles on the growing homelessness problem in Toronto (NOW, February 14-20).

Walking home recently, a well-dressed gentleman with two young girls stopped me outside Futures. He whispered if I could help him buy breakfast for his daughters. I gave him $20 and told him he could find decent sandwiches at Metro. He thanked me with tears in his eyes, which brought tears to my eyes. Here I was in a wealthy area of Toronto and some people cannot feed their children.

Planning Toronto for social cohesion

Thank you to NOW for covering how we’re building for loneliness in Toronto (NOW, February 28-March 6).

Young people and the elderly alike can find the busy city a lonely place. And that can lead to greater chance of death. Planning for social cohesion needs to be a priority and part of all developments.

Growing, cooking, buying and sharing food can be a great tool to bring people together.

Animating public spaces, parks, green spaces and community rooms can work wonders, too, especially within social housing.

Toronto also needs to clear its paths and sidewalks of snow and slush citywide. Not being able to get around with a bad hip, in a scooter, wheelchair or walker further isolates people all winter.

There is a cover-up going on in Parliament and the Prime Minister is going to great lengths to stop the truth from coming out. On top of that, Liberal operatives have now leaked confidential information on the selection of a Supreme Court Justice to cast doubt on former Jody Wilson-Raybould’s judgment. This level of potential political interference from the Prime Minister’s Office damages our democratic institutions and their ludicrous behavior, as Paul Wells recently said in a Macleans article, “is the very stuff of a police state.”

article continues below

I am also extremely disappointed with the five Liberal MPs on the Justice Committee who shut down the investigation into the alleged political interference with the former Attorney General. Due to her extraordinary testimony, it is unfathomable why the Prime Minister won’t permit her to answer direct questions regarding meetings and interactions after he removed her as the Minister of Justice, which she herself acknowledged are relevant to the matter at hand.

It boggles the mind why the Prime Minister is refusing to waive solicitor-client privilege and cabinet confidence as it only drags this scandal on even longer. It has been going on for weeks, overshadowing his budget and ripping apart the Liberal caucus.

It begs the question, if he thinks it’s better to take the political heat for this, is he really worried what his two former Ministers want to say?

Every day we learn information about how the Liberals inappropriately pressured Jody Wilson-Raybould. Now Jane Philpott, who resigned from Trudeau’s cabinet, revealed there is still more evidence that must be released.

I firmly believe not getting to the truth would be a grave injustice to the rule of law and to the democratic principles that we were elected to uphold. In a recent speech to Parliament, I urged my colleagues to check their political allegiances at the door and vote in favor of our motion to let Jody Wilson-Raybould speak. While almost every Liberal MP voted it down, there were a few who refused to be whipped against the motion.

Those in high office are not beyond reproach. Members of Parliament are not elected to protect the Prime Minister, nor should their political survival – or even our own political futures – trump the independence of an Attorney General.

It is time for Liberal MPs to rise to the occasion and put aside their political fidelities. I will continue to implore them to join us in calling for the Prime Minister to waive full solicitor-client privilege and all Cabinet confidences and let Jody Wilson-Raybould finish her testimony. Canadians deserve the truth.

Too soon?: By stumbling his way through the opening weeks of the SNC-Lavalin controversy, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau created any number of opportunities for his political opponents to calmly but ruthlessly dismantle his constantly changing narrative. Instead, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer fumbled the opportunity with his pre-mature call for Trudeau’s resignation, writes Andrew MacDougall:

If Canadians are impressed by what they’ve seen from Scheer personally in response to SNC, they’re doing a pretty good job of hiding it. While Conservative support has now surpassed that of Trudeau’s Liberals, Scheer’s personal numbers remain below Trudeau’s. The differential in polling outcomes likely exists because people identify Trudeau much more strongly with his party than Scheer with his, and because the SNC debacle has, to date, been driven more by Trudeau’s missteps than Scheer’s interventions. To wit, Scheer called for Trudeau’s resignation (checks calendar) 12 days ago and Trudeau is (checks www.pm.gc.ca) still prime minister. Canadians will have noticed the misfire. (Maclean’s)

If it walks like a lobbyist and talks like a lobbyist: Last fall Canada’s former top bureaucrat called up Canada’s current top bureaucrat to talk about SNC-Lavalin. In doing so, Kevin Lynch, now the chair of the engineering company’s board, may have broken lobbying rules. Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick disclosed the Oct. 15 call during his second round of testimony to the justice committee last week, but the Hill Times found no record of such a call in the federal lobbyist registry. A spokesperson for SNC-Lavalin said Lynch’s call was merely to inform Wernick the company would be issuing a statement after prosecutors refused to offer it a remediation agreement. As Wernick told it, Lynch asked him: “Isn’t there anything that can be done?” (Hill Times)

Ethically speaking: The watchdog looking into whether the PMO broke any federal ethics rules in the SNC-Lavalin affair has taken a “prolonged” medical leave, according to his office, which said the investigation will continue in his absence. Mario Dion later told a reporter he hopes to be back within weeks and said “There’s no delay that will be attributable to this. (CBC News, Twitter)

When no one wants Alberta’s oil: Twitter fights about pipeline politics, carbon taxes and culture wars are fashionable. But Alberta needs to think long-term—and not just hope for another boom, writes Jen Gerson;

[Alberta] has a bad habit of talking about the need for economic diversification until the next resource boom rolls around to save the day. “On diversification specifically, it’s just one of those words we throw around, but we don’t know what it means or what the actual goals are,” says Trevor Tombe, a professor of economics at the University of Calgary. The problem is that talk of diversification is just that—talk—if the provincial government’s own fiscal situation remains a mess. Alberta has suffered substantial deficits since the oil price dropped in 2015 and oil revenue tanked with it. Just as a decade of Progressive Conservative governments had done before it, the NDP adopted a strategy of waiting for the oil royalties to come back.

When Alberta doesn’t want Canada: University of Calgary professors David J. Bercuson and Barry Cooper imagine a future when Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and parts of Ontario and B.C. have split from Canada to form the Republic of the Northwest:

The immediate benefits were obvious. Indeed, gaining them was a major part of the failed negotiations of 2020. How long ago that all seems now! First there was an end to the corrupting equalization payments. More symbolic, but tied to equalization, came an end to the absurdities of official bilingualism. With the accession of northern British Columbia, the Northern Gateway oil pipeline to Prince Rupert was built in less than two years. The huge new container port, built at the same time, has cut transit times from Chicago to the Western Pacific by three days as compared to shipping through Vancouver or Seattle. (Maclean’s)

Now, the CBC reports that SNC’s bid did not meet the city’s technical requirements, a problem which would typically disqualify a bid.

It is time Mayor Jim Watson and senior city staff gave the public some straight answers on what is going on with the $1.6-billion extension of the Trillium Line. Instead, they are stonewalling. When the contract came to city council for approval, Coun. Diane Deans asked if the company had met the technical requirements. Simple question, but it produced only an evasive answer. Now, we know why.

There is an issue of commercial confidentiality when competing firms bid on a project such as rail expansion, but the city has buried the LRT evaluation in unnecessary layers of secrecy. Even the membership of the bid evaluation steering committee is secret. One of the high-billing outside lawyers advising the city on the project even had the audacity to tell councillors that they didn’t need to know if the bid met the technical qualifications.

There is an issue of commercial confidentiality … but the city has buried the LRT evaluation in unnecessary layers of secrecy.

What isn’t secret is who owns this decision. Jim Watson, that would be you. Very little happens at City Hall without the mayor’s stamp of approval and no one is better placed to say, “Wait a minute, why would we choose a company that didn’t meet the technical requirements?”

We can safely assume that it is not because SNC-Lavalin gave Watson a $38-million yacht, an inducement the company is alleged to have given to the son of former Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi to get a contract in that country.

Doug Ford announces $1.2 billion in funding for second stage of LRT

LRT testing going well, Transpo boss says, but warns things won’t be ‘pretty’ on days trains face trouble

Perhaps there is something about the SNC bid that makes it vastly superior overall to its two competitors, despite the bid’s technical failings, whatever they are. If so, the mayor needs to let the public in on the secret.

We do know that the SNC bid is the cheapest of the three, even though it is $230 million over the city’s estimate. The company has promised to offset that by saving the city $100 million on the accompanying maintenance contract.

The failure to meet the technical threshold is worrying, though, especially when one considers the seemingly large number of technical problems that have plagued the first phase of LRT. The latest round of stories about the rail cars’ inability to cope with the predictable challenges of winter doesn’t exactly inspire confidence.

The federal and provincial governments are giving the city billions of dollars on the premise that city staff and politicians will do the work to ensure that it’s well spent. City tax dollars are in there, too. And yet, no reasonable person could now claim that this project has a solid footing.

When the project came to council for approval, our elected officials were told that it had to be approved right now, or the city would lose the fabulously great price it had when the bid expired at the end of March.

Several councillors expressed frustration and concern about being asked to approve such a large project without all the facts in hand. Combined, the two parts of the LRT expansion will cost $4.7 billion. And yet, all but three councillors voted for it anyway.

Watson clearly isn’t going to address this problem unless he is forced to. Even after the CBC story, he says he has full confidence in the procurement process and it’s not up to council to oversee it. That’s a grossly inadequate response.

It would take only 13 councillors to request an emergency meeting on the SNC contract, based on new information. The bid’s technical failure is new information. Council needs to demand answers, and if they aren’t satisfactory, it should vote to overturn the contract approval.

THE CANADIAN PRESS

OTTAWA- Liberals are urging former attorney general JodyWilson-Raybould to use her parliamentary privilege to tell the House of Commons whatever she wants about the SNC-Lavalin affair.

But they want her and her former cabinet ally Jane Philpott to tell their stories in full all at once, rather than dragging out the controversy with partial statements and hints of more to come, which have overshadowed all other aspects of the government’s agenda.

“That should happen right away,’’ Environment Minister Catherine McKenna said Friday. “If there are serious concerns, we should all be concerned, but we’ve also got to continue delivering what we’re delivering for Canadians.’’

McKenna made the comment shortly after Wilson-Raybould informed the House of Commons justice committee that she intends to make a written submission revealing more about her accusation that she faced improper pressure last fall to avert a criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavalin.

In a letter to the committee, Wilson-Raybould said she will provide “copies of text messages and emails’’ that she referred to last month when she testified for nearly four hours before the committee. She will also make a written submission, based on “relevant facts and evidence in my possession that further clarify statements I made and elucidate the accuracy and nature of statements by witnesses in testimony that came after my committee appearance.’’

Her written statement will be “within the confines of the waiver of cabinet confidence and solicitor-client privilege’’ she was granted before testifying orally, she said. That waiver covers up until Jan. 14, when she was shuffled out of her dual role as justice minister and attorney general.

When she testified in person, Wilson-Raybould said she’d suffered a months-long campaign, pushed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office, to get her to order a “deferred prosecution agreement’’ be offered to SNC-Lavalin over its allegedly corrupt dealings in Libya. She was followed by former prime ministerial aide Gerald Butts, who said there were miscommunications but no improper pressure, and then-Privy Council clerk Michael Wernick, who denied Wilson-Raybould’s allegation that he’d issued

veiled threats about her place in cabinet on the prime minister’s behalf.

Wilson-Raybould’s letter came the day after former cabinet ally Jane Philpott fanned the SNC-Lavalin fire in an interview with Maclean’s magazine, saying there is “much more to the story’,’ _ a report that landed in the midst of a 31-hour, Conservative-orchestrated filibuster over the controversy. The filibuster, which continued until almost 1 a.m. Friday, was intended to protest Trudeau’s refusal to offer a blanket waiver of privilege and confidentiality that Wilson-Raybould has claimed is necessary if she is to fully tell her side of the story, including things that occurred after her move to Veterans Affairs until her resignation from cabinet a month later.

Philpott resigned from cabinet early this month, saying she’d lost confidence in the government’s handling of the SNC-Lavalin case. Both former ministers remain in the Liberal caucus and intend to seek re-election this fall as Liberals but their continued stirring of the pot is testing the patience of their colleagues.

Liberal MPs publicly professed Friday to be comfortable with the pair remaining in caucus, in keeping with Trudeau’s argument that diversity of opinion within Liberal ranks is a good thing.

The Liberal-dominated justice committee shut down its investigation into the affair on Tuesday, with Liberal members concluding no rules or laws were

broken. That denied Wilson-Raybould a potential opportunity to testify again

and respond in person to Butts’s and Wernick’s accounts.

A different set of Liberal MPs will likely reject a bid by the Conservatives to launch a separate investigation through the Commons ethics committee next week.

Still, Toronto Liberal MP Adam Vaughan said nothing is stopping the ex-ministers from saying whatever they want in the Commons, where they are protected by parliamentary privilege from lawsuits.

“If they want to tell their story, they have the best seat in the house in this country to do so. Parliamentary privilege allows them to tell their truth and my advice to both of them is avail yourself of the seat you have in the House of Commons,’’ he said.

“Any member can rise at any time on a point of privilege and make a statement.’’

But Conservative House leader Candice Bergen said suggestions that parliamentary privilege frees the former ministers to say what they like is “a smokescreen.’’ She argued that opportunities to speak at length in the Commons are limited and continued to push for a blanket waiver to let the pair testify in a committee hearing.

Wilson-Raybould “has things she needs to tell Canadians and we need to get to the bottom of this,’’ Bergen said.

At an event in Thunder Bay, Ont., on Friday afternoon, Trudeau once again shrugged off the Opposition’s demand for a broader waiver, arguing that the original waiver was “unprecedented’’ and allowed Wilson-Raybould to talk “entirely and completely’’ about the question he puts at the core of the controversy: whether she was pressured unduly on the SNC-Lavalin case during her time as attorney general.

“She testified for four hours … There has been a full airing at the justice committee,’’ Trudeau said, noting that the federal ethics commissioner is also conducting his own investigation.

The engineering and construction giant is facing criminal prosecution over alleged bribes to Libyan government officials while pursuing business in that country. Under the current rules, a conviction includes a 10-year ban on federal contracts.

CEO Neil Bruce, who assumed leadership in 2015, has repeatedly said the organization has turned over a new leaf, and that a prosecution at this date would only punish “innocent employees.”

Nearly one-third of SNC-Lavalin’s $9.3 billion in revenues in 2017 came from Canada, down from roughly 60 per cent of revenue in 2014. Analysts estimate that up to one-half of home-turf revenues stem from federal contracts.

Analyst Yuri Lynk of Canaccord Genuity said the reputational damage of a looming corruption case could hurt the company more than a decade-long ban on federal contract bidding.

“It hurts their reputation,” he said. “Their competitors would always be reminding clients that you’re dealing with someone with outstanding charges against it in its own country.”

On Oct. 10, shares plunged more than 13 per cent after news broke that federal prosecutors had declined to negotiate the charges, making prosecution appear imminent.

In the ensuing political scandal, various Liberal officials have made remarks about the spectre of large job losses and the risk that SNC-Lavalin would pull up stakes from Montreal to settle overseas in London.

The company currently employs about 10,000 people in the United Kingdom, more than the 8,500 or so stationed in Canada. However, the advantages of moving abroad are unclear.

“What’s moving to London really going to do?” Lynk asked, noting SNC-Lavalin would face the same bidding restrictions in Canada should a 10-year ban come down.

The U.K. serves as a major base for engineering companies in the European Union, but that bridge may crumble with the country’s impending departure from the EU.

“One of our major concerns around the U.K. is the impact of Brexit…so it’s not as simple as, ‘Hey, let’s go from Montreal to Manchester and call it a day,”‘ said analyst Chris Murray of Altacorp Capital.

Canada’s recent free trade deal with the EU allows European companies to bid on Canadian government contracts, potentially opening a door to SNC-Lavalin through subsidiaries, such as the London-based WS Atkins, that are not listed in the criminal case, analyst Derek Spronck of RBC Dominion Securities said in a research note.

Other experts say that even if the company shifts its focus further abroad, a criminal conviction in Canada could land it on blacklists in other countries.

In Canada, the restriction would apply to contracts that are “issued by a federal department or agency and contain the integrity provisions,” Public Services and Procurement Canada said in an email.

Provincial or municipal contracts that happen to receive federal funding would not be affected, according to According to Infrastructure Canada, in an email.

One possible workaround lies in the public services minister having the power to reduce or waive bidding bans under certain circumstances, said international trade lawyer Lawrence Herman.

“This is not a law but rather a policy under the government’s integrity regime,” he said in an email.

Moreover, the government is now considering changes to those ethical procurement rules, with Public Services holding a month-long public consultation last fall on a proposed “ineligibility and suspension policy” that would give officials more flexibility to set the ban period.

Analysts say a remediation agreement would likely lead to a major stock bump, sorely desired after shares have been hovering at seven-year lows of around $36.

It might also lessen the appeal for SNC to sell part of its 16.77 per cent stake in Ontario’s 407 ETR highway. The company has been mulling a partial sale for at least six months, which would hand it a slice of the $2.2 billion some analysts say the stake is worth.

SNC-Lavalin is working on the five biggest infrastructure projects in Canada, according to trade magazine ReNew Canada. Those contracts alone amount to $52.8 billion, and include projects for Bruce Power and the Darlington nuclear plant in Ontario as well as the Site C dam in B.C.

In 2013, SNC-Lavalin was barred from bidding on any construction project backed by the World Bank for up to 10 years. It also paid undisclosed restitution in 2017 to seven Quebec municipalities as part of the Quebec government’s program to recover money paid in connection with public contracts obtained as far back as 1996 as a result of fraud or fraudulent tactics.

Further clouding the legal are court documents that show Quebec prosecutors are working with the RCMP on the possibility of new criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin tied to a contract to refurbish Montreal’s Jacques Cartier Bridge.",Here's what a 10-year ban on federal contract bids would mean for SNC-Lavalin,Montreal Gazette,https://montrealgazette.com/news/heres-what-a-10-year-ban-on-federal-contract-bids-would-mean-for-snc-lavalin/wcm/fd82b271-4bd6-4712-8bc5-81c9cb10f1e5
416,Politics,2019-03-27T01:59:00.0000000Z,"OTTAWA—The Liberals have again blocked an investigation into the SNC-Lavalin controversy, raising opposition concerns that parliamentary inquiries to probe allegations of judicial interference are at a dead-end. Liberal MPs on the House of Commons ethics ...","""No one is going to hold her back,"" and he added, ""I understand all of that information is to be made public.""

""So one, this is appropriately before justice and we ought to see what justice does in the wake of information that is provided, and two . . . I have not found committees like ours to be very effective at conducting inquiries,"" said Erskine-Smith, who was the only Liberal to speak at the meeting.

Pointing to its earlier investigation of the Cambridge Analytica affair, he said committees are not best placed to do investigations.

""We ran into roadblocks and were unable to proceed based on our inability to compel document production in the same way, revisit previous testimony in the same way, frankly the tools we have at our disposal are more cumbersome.""

Still, Erskine-Smith broke with many of his Liberal colleagues, saying that if Wilson-Raybould and Philpott feel they cannot speak fully on the issue, then the prime minister should act to ensure they can.

He also agreed with the Conservatives and denounced what seemed to be a deliberate leak to CTV and Canadian Press aimed at showing relations between the prime minister and Wilson-Raybould had soured as early as 2017 when they disagreed whether a conservative Manitoba judge should be named to a Western vacancy on the Supreme Court. The reports named the judge, Glenn Joyal, who was forced to publicly disavow his candidacy, saying he withdrew his name because his wife had cancer.

""It is outrageous that there's a leak with respect to the Supreme Court judicial appointment process and without question that kind of leak undermines the confidence in the judicial selection process and appointment process. So I think people from all parties ought to condemn that kind of thing. Completely inappropriate.""

Wilson-Raybould told the justice committee last month that she faced ""inappropriate"" and ""sustained"" political pressure from Trudeau and senior officials last fall to mediate criminal charges against the Quebec construction and engineering company.

Trudeau and his team deny they pressured her, and said they only urged her to consider a second outside legal opinion. A mediated agreement would allow the company to avoid a criminal prosecution and with it, a 10-year ban on federal contracts, which had sparked fears within government of job losses.

Ramsay, who is a vice-chair of the justice committee, said there is little hope that committee will resume its hearings into the affair.

And she said the Liberal chair Anthony Housefather has publicly declared there's nothing more to be studied, he'd made up his mind.

In an opinion piece in the National Post last week, Housefather wrote that in his view it is ""duty"" of an attorney-general to consider new facts relative to a possible remediation agreement ""seriously and on an ongoing basis.""

David Moscrop, a political scientist with the department of communication at the University of Ottawa, said the day's proceedings left him ""frustrated."" He said he doesn't believe the office of the federal ethics commissioner is well-suited for this sort of inquiry. And he said the shutdown of the justice committee and now the refusal of the ethics committee to launch an inquiry underscores his belief that a public inquiry is the only forum to get at the facts.

""This is the sort of information that Canadians would like to have ideally before the election so it was frustrating to watch,"" Moscrop said an interview.

""It raises the broader question, can the House and its committees effectively hold the government to account in the current system, I think the answer is not really,"" he said.

""The only thing that's going to ultimately, I think, result in fundamental changes is if voters decide they're not going to have any of it,"" he said.

Liberals on the House Ethics Committee shot down the opposition’s push to open another probe into the SNC-Lavalin affair.

While most ministerial events on Tuesday were centred on promoting the budget to students and youth, today’s slate of engagements appear to be focused on outreach to seniors—another key voting bloc the Liberals hope to woo in upcoming vote.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, meanwhile, is headlining a Laurier Club “donor appreciation event” in Toronto this evening at 7 p.m. the Omni King Edward Hotel. Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen is also expected to attend.

Democrats fail to block Trump’s emergency wall funding

U.S. President Donald Trump’s first veto will stand.

House Democrats were unable to override his declaration of a national emergency that allows him to take $3.6 billion in military funding and shift it to building a wall along the Mexican border. The border wall was one of Trump’s biggest campaign promises, but it also came with the promise that Mexico, not the American people, would pay for it.

Conservative MP Michael Cooper, vice-chair of the committee, told 680 NEWS it is disappointing to find out facts in this manner, adding he would have much preferred another round of testimony from Wilson-Raybould.

“Liberals have used every tool at their disposal to shut down the work of the Justice Committee to hear her whole version of events,” Cooper said.

Last week, Wilson-Raybould said she would provide “copies of text messages and emails” that she referred to last month when she testified for nearly four hours before the committee.

She said the written submission would be based on “relevant facts and evidence in my possession that further clarify statements — made and elucidate the accuracy and nature of statements by witnesses in testimony that came after my committee appearance.”

Her written statement will be “within the confines of the waiver of cabinet confidence and solicitor-client privilege” she was granted before testifying orally, she said. That waiver covers up until Jan. 14, when she was shuffled out of her dual role as justice minister and attorney general.

“Canada’s prime minister, embroiled in a political scandal, is now escaping to Southwest Florida,” announced NBC 2, a local news affiliate who got exclusive word of the visiting national leader.

The broadcaster dispatched a reporter to North Captiva Island, a largely recreational island where Trudeau reportedly rented two large homes for his family and entourage. For much of the prime minister’s visit, the affiliate also kept up a live feed on the prime ministerial plane, a “maple-leaf-emblazoned” Bombardier Challenger parked at Page Field, a small airport close to Fort Myers, Florida.

North Captiva Island is accessible only by charter boat, and cars are banned, with the only motorized transportation being golf carts. However, Trudeau appears to have been brought to the island by a vessel with U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

The NBC2 report described a team of 40 “Secret Service” protecting the prime minister and his family from a fleet of golf carts. Trudeau’s typical bodyguards are plainclothes RCMP who closely resemble the Secret Service details that typically surround U.S. presidents and VIPs.

However, as a visiting dignitary, it’s possible that Trudeau was supplied with U.S. Secret Service agents for added protection. His visit did indeed pull in assistance from local law enforcement, including a marine unit of the local Lee County sheriff’s office.

Trudeau is one of approximately 3.5 million Canadians who visit Florida every year. Canadians also constitute 27 per cent of the state’s foreign real estate buyers, purchasing $7 billion in Florida properties in 2017 alone.

The state is also notable as the frequent weekend getaway for the incumbent U.S. president, with Donald Trump’s Mar-A-Lago resort located almost directly east of North Captiva Island on Florida’s east coast.

The Trudeau family itself has long ties to Florida, with Orlando being where Justin’s grandfather, Charles-Émile Trudeau, died of a heart attack in 1935 while touring with the Montreal Royals baseball team, of whom he was a part owner.

While the Canadian public is normally informed of Trudeau’s whereabouts, all bets are off when he takes private vacations. For a similar Florida vacation in early 2018, officials in the prime minister’s office said only that he was “spending private time with his family in Florida.”

On Monday at approximately 6 p.m., the prime ministerial Challenger jet was seen departing Page Field.

Treasury Board President Jane Philpott -- seen as one of his team’s star performers -- quit cabinet Monday amid questions about Trudeau’s efforts to snuff out corruption charges against Montreal construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. She said the scandal meant she could no longer back the government.

Philpott follows Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former attorney general who says she was pressured by Trudeau and key aides into ending prosecution of the company. Another lawmaker, Celina Caesar-Chavannes, has declined to seek re-election. While she said her decision wasn’t related to SNC-Lavalin, she publicly cheered on Philpott and Wilson-Raybould.

It all leaves Trudeau without two of the highest-profile women in his famously gender-balanced cabinet. “Because it’s 2015” is how he explained the 50-50 lineup after a convincing election win four years ago. Amid the current scandal, however, he faces weakening party solidarity and sagging poll numbers.

‘Lost Confidence’

As head of the Treasury Board, Philpott -- a doctor from a Toronto-area district -- would have carried out many of the nuts-and-bolts efforts of the government’s agenda in the lead-up to the October election. Instead, she said she couldn’t back the government because of the SNC controversy.

“The evidence of efforts by politicians and/or officials to pressure the former Attorney General to intervene in the criminal case involving SNC-Lavalin and the evidence as to the content of those efforts have raised serious concerns for me,” Philpott said in her resignation letter. “Sadly, I have lost confidence in how the government has dealt with this matter and in how it has responded to the issues raised.”

There’s a gendered thread to the defections. Wilson-Raybould lauded Philpott’s decision Monday, calling her a “Mother of Country.” The former treasury board chief, who previously served as health minister, was among a handful of Liberal lawmakers who voiced support for Wilson-Raybould after her exit. The former attorney-general then returned the favor. “You are a leader of vision & strength & I look forward to continuing to work alongside you,” Wilson-Raybould tweeted.

Caesar-Chavannes -- a one-time parliamentary secretary to Trudeau -- also celebrated the move. “When you add women, please do not expect the status quo. Expect us to make correct decisions, stand for what is right and exit when values are compromised,” she said on Twitter.

Trudeau was elected under a pledge of “real change,” while leading a party with a long history of backroom deals. Part of his wave included many new faces -- Wilson-Raybould, Philpott and Caesar-Chavannes were all elected for the first time in 2015. Trudeau bet on the new blood when he froze out much of his party’s old guard, including senators appointed by his predecessors. He also trumpeted the need to bring diversity to the decision-making table. Wilson-Raybould was the country’s first indigenous justice minister, while Caesar-Chavannes is one of only a handful of black lawmakers in Trudeau’s caucus.

The departures leave Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland as one of the few women holding a major cabinet post, along with Carla Qualtrough, the former procurement minister who was named acting head of the Treasury Board to replace Philpott. Freeland, who led negotiations over the revamped North American free-trade deal, has so far stood by the prime minister.

Deferred Prosecution

The rest of Trudeau’s cabinet continues to back him, and lawmaker Steven MacKinnon on Monday acknowledged the Liberals “absolutely have a disagreement here” on the issue of stepping in to help SNC-Lavalin with a so-called deferred prosecution agreement.

“Our belief is that this company is one that is, like its competitors around the world, entitled to a deferred prosecution arrangement like they would be able to have access to,” in other countries with similar systems, MacKinnon told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. “The vast majority of my colleagues believe the government has acted entirely appropriately.”

The path forward now for Trudeau is unclear. While Caesar-Chavannes isn’t running again, Wilson-Raybould has said she intends to stay in the Liberal Party caucus and seek reelection under the party’s banner. Trudeau indicated Monday he was still weighing whether to force Wilson-Raybould out. Philpott hasn’t indicated if she will seek re-election.

A long-time federal Liberal in B.C. has stated he's in ""full agreement"" with former cabinet minister Jane Philpott's assertion that Canadians would like to know the whole truth about the SNC-Lavalin affair.

In a letter to the Georgia Straight (see below), chartered professional accountant Elbert (Bert) Paul also declared that he strongly supports the creation of an independent public inquiry.

""The powers pursuant to the Inquiry Act permit summoning of witnesses to provide testimony under oath, requiring them to give evidence and produce documents,"" Paul wrote in his letter. ""A non-partisan inquiry can then address the issues of bearing false witness, contravening the Shawcross Doctrine and Section 5 of the OECD Convention as it relates to anti bribery provisions.""

Paul was a director of the Federal Liberal Agency of Canada from 1986 to 2016. It's the chief agent of the Liberal Party of Canada.

Paul also chaired FLAC's audit committee.

""It is vital we protect the public interest relating to the rule of law and address these serious allegations including contravention of our international obligations,"" he wrote. ""Canadians deserve the best government possible.""

Paul's letter was written in response to an article by Martyn Brown called ""Pardon my French, Prime Minister, but you’re f#*ked”.

In the 1990s, Paul was one of the earliest and foremost public critics of the B.C. NDP government's fast-ferry scandal. During this period, a $210-million capital program ballooned into a $460-million expenditure for three vessels that were taken out of service shortly after being built.

Dear Editor,

I am writing this letter in response to Martyn Brown’s insightful article dated March 21 entitled ”Pardon my French, Prime Minister, but you’re f#*ked”.

I am a former thirty-year director and chair of the audit committee of the Federal Liberal Agency of Canada ""(FLAC)"". FLAC, is the Chief Agent of the Liberal Party of Canada.

I am in full agreement with the comments of former cabinet minister Jane Phillpott. She justifiably complained in MacLeans about “an attempt to shut down the inquiry”. I agree with her assertion that “Canadians would like to know the whole truth.” It is obvious that as Martyn Brown quoted ""There’s much more to the story that should be told.""

I would strongly support that an independent public inquiry be initiated. The powers pursuant to the Inquiry Act permit summoning of witnesses to provide testimony under oath, requiring them to give evidence and produce documents.

A non-partisan inquiry can then address the issues of bearing false witness, contravening the Shawcross Doctrine and Section 5 of the OECD Convention as it relates to anti bribery provisions.

It is vital we protect the public interest relating to the rule of law and address these serious allegations including contravention of our international obligations. Canadians deserve the best government possible.

Sincerely,

Elbert King (Bert) Paul

That's the advice from Ian Brodie, Stephen Harper's former chief of staff, following the shocking resignation of Jane Philpott from cabinet on Monday in the wake of the SNC-Lavalin controversy.

On Monday, Philpott stepped down from her post as Treasury Board president, saying in a statement that she had ""lost confidence"" in how the government has dealt with the SNC-Lavalin case and in ""how it has responded to the issues raised.""

Philpott's resignation was the second high-profile departure from Trudeau's cabinet since this story first broke in the Globe and Mail. Former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould, whose allegations against the prime minister and senior government officials are at the centre of the controversy, resigned from her cabinet position as veteran affairs minister on Feb. 12.

Brodie said Canada hasn't seen this kind of cabinet crisis since the closing years of the John Diefenbaker government. (Diefenbaker had three cabinet ministers resign over his nuclear arms policy in 1963.)

""Mr. Trudeau must now move quickly to shore up his cabinet support with a new Treasury Board minister while holding his caucus together,"" Brodie said in an email. ""He should hold an emergency caucus meeting as soon as possible to see if he has the support to continue on.""

Watch below: Trudeau comments on Philpott's resignation

Among cabinet members at least, Trudeau seems to be holding support. CBC News reached out to the remaining 33 members of cabinet, who all said they support the prime minister.

But with an election looming this fall and ongoing investigations, continued support is far from certain.

​The prime minister's political opponents, meanwhile, are already calling for further inquiry, with Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer calling for Trudeau to quit and the RCMP to investigate. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, who will soon take a seat in the House of Commons, wants a full public inquiry.

'It's big'

Last week, Wilson-Raybould testified in front of the parliamentary justice committee that when she was attorney general, she faced a ""consistent and sustained effort"" from several top government officials, including the prime minister, to intervene in a corruption and fraud case against SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.

Wilson-Raybould, who was later shuffled out of her justice portfolio to veterans affairs, said she resisted the pressure.

The resignation of Philpott, a key and highly respected cabinet minister in Trudeau's government, has significantly escalated this political crisis for the prime minister, said David McLaughlin, a former chief of staff to Brian Mulroney.

""It's big. A three-alarm fire for the Liberals just became a five-alarm fire,"" McLaughlin told Power & Politics host Vassy Kapelos.

Frank Gunn/Canadian Press More

Trudeau's personal brand was already being ""corroded"" by the controversy, McLaughlin said. What's particularly damaging for Trudeau, he said, is that in her resignation letter, Philpott raised questions about the competency of the government.

The Lead

The Liberal MPs on the House ethics committee have defeated a motion calling for Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott to appear before the body to testify on a proposed study into the SNC-Lavalin controversy.

Moved by Tory member Peter Kent, the motion won the support of the three opposition MPs during Tuesday’s special meeting, but it couldn’t draw any support among the six Liberals who sit on the committee. Conservative MP Bob Zimmer serves as chair of the committee.

“Well, the cover-up continues,” Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre told reporters after the meeting. “Liberals had a chance to put votes where their mouths were, and instead, they decided to vote for another cover-up.”

During the meeting, Liberal MP and committee member Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, speaking on behalf of his party colleagues, argued that the committee wasn’t the “right forum” for the study because one had already been undertaken by the justice committee and such an inquiry would be better suited for a parliamentary commissioner.

He also said it was “premature” for the ethics committee to hold a study since the justice committee has yet to receive emails and text transcripts promised by Wilson-Raybould to verify her allegations.

Jolson Lim has the full story.

In Canada:

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is dismissing suggestions of deep-seated fractures in the Liberal caucus, pointing to last week’s voting marathon in the House as helping in solidifying party unity.

“Because of the tremendous opportunity to vote as a team for 30 hours last week … our team has come out stronger and more united than ever before,” he told reporters Tuesday morning at the Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology in Winnipeg. He was visiting the school to tout the Liberal government’s new training benefit program unveiled in the 2019 budget.

Wilson-Raybould and Philpott recently resigned from cabinet over the lingering SNC-Lavalin controversy, with both openly criticizing how the Prime Minister’s Office has handled the issue. Also, outspoken MP Celina Casear-Chavannes left the Liberal caucus last Wednesday after publicly criticizing Trudeau for how he responded to her announcement that she would not run in 2019. Marco Vigliotti has more.

Interestingly, Erskine-Smith penned an op-ed for the Toronto Star on Tuesday urging Wilson-Raybould and Philpott to stay in the Liberal caucus, despite their disagreements with the government.

“I am a Liberal member of parliament and I continue to support our Liberal government. But that does not mean that I support every government action taken, or that I ought to refrain from public disagreement,” he wrote.

Back to Trudeau, he was also asked during his media availability about a story that broke Monday that alleged that the professional relationship between the PM and Wilson-Raybould “first began to fray” back in 2017 because of concerns over who to name to the Supreme Court.

Trudeau, though, said it would be inappropriate for him to respond to the media reports, adding that “the choice of Supreme Court justices and indeed, chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, is always a decision of the prime minister.” Vigliotti also this one.

Keeping with the SNC-Lavalin controversy, the Globe and Mail is reporting that the Prime Minister’s Office received information last fall suggesting an internal disagreement with dispute Director of Public Prosecutions Kathleen Roussel and “one of the lower-ranking prosecutors handling the SNC-Lavalin bribery and fraud prosecution.”

Ex-Progressive Conservative MPP Randy Hillier says he’s in talks with the province’s ethics watchdog about possible illegal or unregistered lobbying of the Ford government. In a lengthy Tuesday afternoon press conference, Hillier repeatedly slammed the culture of “fear and intimidation” in Premier Doug Ford’s government but gave no evidence to back-up his fresh attacks or his previous allegations of illegal activity.

He said he started speaking with Integrity Commissioner J. David Wake about “possible illegal and/or unregistered lobbying” soon after he was suspended from the Tory caucus on Feb. 20. Marieke Walsh has the latest.

Former Afghanistan hostage Joshua Boyle’s assault trial continued in an Ottawa courtroom on Tuesday, with the court hearing a frantic, late-night 911 call he made in December 2017 to say his wife Caitlan Coleman was threatening to kill herself, reports the Canadian Press.

The call was what eventually triggered an investigation that led to Boyle’s arrest just two months after Pakistani forces freed the couple from its kidnappers. Boyle is charged with offences including assault, sexual assault, unlawful confinement and causing someone to take a noxious substance.

After the call, Ottawa police showed up at the Boyle family’s apartment and it was on that day that Coleman was “finally able to walk away from Mr. Boyle” after months of alleged domestic abuse, Crown attorney Meaghan Cunningham told the court on Monday.

The NDP is calling for the federal government to extend its mission in Mali to October to meet a request made by the United Nations, even though the government has said it plans to stay in the West African country only until mid-summer. The Canadian Press reported late last week that the UN had asked Canada to keep its forces in Mali until October, when their Romanian replacements will arrive.

Since the Mali mission was announced, the Canadian government has maintained that it will end at the end of July 2019. Charlie Pinkerton has more.

Canada’s armed forces, the RCMP and the Canada Border Services agency spent a total of $158,000 to send 42 employees to what’s billed as the biggest small arms show in the world last January.

In a written question in the Commons, B.C. Conservative MP Todd Doherty asked for expenditure details about federal employees who were “sent” to the annual SHOT Show in Las Vegas, Nev.

The annual exhibit, held in the sprawling Sands Expo Centre on the outskirts of the city’s downtown casinos, is limited to representatives from armed forces, police services, tactical police units, the gun industry and related associations. It is not an event open to the general public, and no one under age 16 is allowed in. Tim Naumetz reports.

MPs in the U.K. Parliament took the unprecedented step Monday of seizing control of the parliamentary timetable as they look to resolve the deadlock over the terms of the country’s exit from the European Union. On Tuesday, they revealed the details of their plan to consider other Brexit options, as prime minister Theresa May was “warned more ministers could quit unless she changed course,” reports the BBC. The Commons will begin voting on alternatives on Wednesday, though this will likely continue into next week. MPs will complete a series of ballots to gauge support for different ideas.

The Democratic-controlled House in the U.S. fell short Tuesday in its bid to override the first veto issued by President Donald Trump, enabling him to divert more funding to build more barriers along the country’s southwest border with Mexico.

Lawmakers voted 248-181 in favour of overturning his veto of a motion passed by Congress annulling his national emergency declaration along the border, but it fell 38 votes short of the two-thirds majority required, reports the Associated Press.

Trump’s declaration allowed him to use a law that lets him shift already budgeted funding to address emergencies. This enabled him to move an additional $3.6 billion from “military construction projects to work on border barriers,” even though Congress voted this year to limit spending on such barriers to less than $1.4 billion.

The head of Algeria’s army is demanding that President Abdelaziz Bouteflika be declared “unfit to rule after weeks of protests against him,” reports the BBC. In a television address, the army’s chief of staff, Lt. Gen Ahmed Gaed Salah, said “we must find a way out of this crisis immediately, within the constitutional framework.”

Bouteflike has already agreed not to seek a fifth term in upcoming elections but they have been delayed in what critics say is a ploy to prolong his 20-year rule over the country. There have also been talks set up to draft a new constitution and set a date for elections but they have no scheduled start date.

Spain offered data to the FBI that it collected from a raid conducted against a self-proclaimed human rights group that allegedly led attack on the North Korean Embassy last month, the Associated Press reports.

National Court judge Jose de la Mata on Tuesday lifted the secrecy order in the case, saying it had found evidence of several crimes, such as trespassing, injuries, threats and burglary committed by “a criminal organization” at the Madrid embassy. He identified a Mexican, an American and a South Korean as the main suspects. Adrian Hong Chang, a Mexican national and resident in the United States, was named by the judge as the leader of a gang of 10 people who escaped on Feb. 22 after “stealing computers and documents from the embassy, where they shackled and gagged its staff.”

Pressure mounts for public inquiry into SNC-Lavalin affair

The leader of the federal New Democrats is calling on Canadians to “ramp up the pressure” on the Trudeau government to hold a public inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Jagmeet Singh’s comments came after the opposition parties failed to have the Commons ethics committee launch another investigation into allegations of political interference by the Trudeau government over charges against the company. The opposition want former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould and ex-Treasury Board president Jane Philpott to tell their stories with no restrictions.
